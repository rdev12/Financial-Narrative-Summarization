we are enabling 
growth ( pp2-9)
Amlin is a specialist insurer and reinsurer with a well proven and scaleable business model. 
This has delivered excellent performance for shareholders across the insurance cycle. 
1. Proﬁ t focused underwriting 
Amlin’s underwriting approach is highly disciplined and focused 
on gross underwriting profitability (before investment income and 
reinsurance) across the insurance cycle, rather than premium income 
or market share. This is underpinned by incentive structures which 
reward underwriters for long term profitability.
Amlin Group average combined ratio (2007–2011)
82%
2. Breadth and depth of underwriting expertise
The skill and experience of our underwriters is paramount in achieving 
outstanding performance. Amlin has strength in depth across an 
underwriting portfolio that spans more than 30, classes with over 
100 senior underwriters. 
Average turnover of senior underwriters (2007–2011)
4.1%
3. Wealth of industry experience
Amlin’s underwriters are supported by a team of seasoned 
professionals in specialist disciplines including claims, risk 
management, actuarial, catastrophe modelling, investments and 
finance. Many of Amlin’s key people have been with Amlin since its 
creation in 1998. As Amlin has grown, this experienced and stable 
team has been further enhanced by the addition of high calibre 
senior recruits.

4. Active capital management
Our active and flexible approach to capital management has 
generated a weighted average return on equity of 14.7% over the past 
five years. Understanding and managing the level of capital required, 
adjusting the level of equity and debt employed across the cycle to 
enhance returns and support growth, and returning surplus capital 
to shareholders are key aspects of this strategy.

5. A dynamic approach to managing investment risk
Amlin’s disciplined and responsive approach to investment 
management has delivered consistently robust returns in stable 
financial markets. In current turbulent markets our focus on risk 
appetite, rather than a target return, is crucial.

6. Strong balance sheet with signiﬁ cant scope for growth 
Amlin’s strong capital position, with £1,7 million of equity and long 
term debt capital, makes Amlin a preferred market for major brokers.

of net catastrophe losses in 2011 and maintain the dividend, 
while continuing to provide scope to grow into more favourable 
market conditions.

7. Effective risk management
Amlin has developed a sustainable enterprise risk management 
framework that enables us to manage risk effectively and helps 
optimise return for the risks that we take. The framework is overseen 
by a dedicated team of professionals who provide assurance and 
challenge to management. This risk management capability will 
be important under Solvency II regulation.

8. A diverse and balanced portfolio
The diversity of Amlin’s portfolio mixes high margin but volatile 
catastrophe underwriting with lower margin and less volatile business. 
This enhances quality of earnings and capital efficiency, especially 
in a high margin environment, as well as offering a broad range of 
opportunities for growth in different territories and classes of business.

10. Cross-cycle track record of outperformance
Amlin’s business model is focused on delivering an average return 
on equity of at least 15% across the insurance cycle through a diverse 
and profitable underwriting portfolio, active capital management 
and optimised investment returns. Over the past five years we have 
delivered a weighted average return on equity of 14.7% and cumulative 
profit after tax of £960.4 million, despite extraordinary catastrophe 
losses in 2011. Since 2002, our weighted average return on equity 
is 18.0%. The business is well positioned to continue this strong 
performance through further profitable growth.

2011 Catastrophes
A damaging year for catastrophe reinsurance
Natural catastrophes are always unique, even if their likelihood and potential severity 
can be modelled. 2011 saw events exceptional not only for their frequency and severity, 
but also for how they occurred. The combination of tsunami and earthquake in Japan, 
the unprecedented land damage caused by soil liquefaction following New Zealand 
earthquakes, and the prolonged and widespread ﬂ ooding in Thailand all challenged 
previous expectations for such events. Our analysis of the impact of these scenarios will 
increase our understanding of potential future events and help us to provide clients with 
appropriate protection for the future.

“ In a difficult year, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of 
our people enabled us to rise to the challenge of multiple catastrophe 
events and demonstrate our commitment to our clients. We are well 
positioned to benefit from improving markets.”
 Roger Taylor, Chairman
Chairman’s statement
Providing continuity to our clients
Results and dividend
2011 was an exceptional year for catastrophe 
losses, both in terms of scale and location. For 
the first time we encountered record natural 
catastrophe losses mainly from outside the US, 
including in what were viewed as non-peak 
zones for catastrophe exposures. In total, 
earthquakes in New Zealand and Japan and 
severe weather related events, including US 
tornadoes and floods in Australia, Denmark 
and Thailand, cost Amlin £500.8 million on  
a net basis. In addition to this wide ranging  
loss activity, we were also managing assets  
in a difficult and volatile environment with 
historically low interest rates, which adversely 
affected the investment return achieved. 
Overall, we were disappointed to report a 
pre-tax loss of £193.8 million and a negative 
return on equity of 8.6%. It is our business to 
pay claims and prompt settlement following 
catastrophes is the most practical way of 
helping our clients and the communities they 
serve to recover from such events. It is a 
testimony to the quality of our organisation 
that we have been delivering a high level of 
service to clients in this regard, so maintaining 
our strong market reputation.
In years when catastrophe activity is low or 
average, the margins available to us on the 
catastrophe account, combined with the 
profitability of the rest of the portfolio, are 
reflected in high returns. Despite the 
negative return on equity for 2011, our five 
year average return on equity of 14.7% is 
only slightly below our cross-cycle target of 
15% and over a ten year cycle since 2002, 
which includes previous severe catastrophe 
losses in 2005 and 2008, it remains well 
above target at 18.0%.
We remain focused on managing the 
business to produce excellent cross cycle 
returns for shareholders. The strength of our 
balance sheet has allowed us to meet  
our obligations to policyholders quickly and 
fairly and move forward with ample capital 
into an improving trading environment. Our 
confidence in the outlook for the business  
is reflected in the decision of the Board to 
propose a final dividend of 15.8 pence per 
share (2010:15.8p), thus maintaining the 
total dividend declared at the same level as 
2010, despite being uncovered by earnings. 
The final dividend will be paid on 24 May 
2012, subject to shareholder approval,  
to shareholders on the register on 10 April 
2012. In the longer term, our goal remains  
to steadily grow the dividend.
It has been part of our long term strategy  
to underwrite a balanced portfolio of US and 
international catastrophe reinsurance. As a 
result, in 2011 we incurred disproportionately 
greater losses than some of our more 
US-focused peers. However, this international 
catastrophe portfolio has generated a good 
return over the longer term and provided a 
valuable counterbalance to our US exposures. 
We are confident it will continue to do so in 
the future. 
Our major catastrophe claims in 2011 were 
mainly the result of earthquakes. A feature of 
earthquake claims is that it is very difficult to 
crystallise initial loss estimates and these were 
no exception, causing us to revise estimates 
during the year. We have taken the opportunity 
in our 2012 plans to modify risk appetite  
by purchasing more outwards reinsurance, 
particularly for Amlin Bermuda. 
While catastrophe claims loomed large,  
it was also not an easy year for large risk 
losses. ACI, in particular, experienced an 
unusual concentration of large losses in the 
first half of the year, which adversely affected 
its full year result. 
12 Governance and the Board
The Board believes that high standards of 
Corporate Governance are intrinsic to Amlin’s 
culture and values. We have further developed 
our strong culture of accountability through a 
review of our executive processes and the 
subsequent interaction throughout the 
organisation and with our subsidiary boards. 
Through the work of the Audit Committee 
chaired by Nigel Buchanan, our Senior 
Independent Director, and the Risk & Solvency 
Committee, led by Richard Davey, the Board 
has been updated on pertinent matters in 
what is an increasingly complex regulatory 
environment, allowing the Board to focus  
on challenging and encouraging executive 
management and on the strategy for the 
Group as a whole. 
During 2010, the Board, upon the 
recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee, identified the need to recruit  
an additional member, which culminated  
in the appointment of Sir Alan Collins as a 
non-executive director on 14 November 2011.  
Sir Alan, who has had a distinguished career  
in HM Diplomatic Service, brings a wide 
experience of promoting international business 
activity, which will broaden the diversity of  
skills on the Board. 
At the AGM in May all of the directors are 
standing for re-election (as we announced  
last year), other than Sir Alan Collins who is 
standing for election and myself. I am confident 
in recommending to shareholders, following 
individual as well as collective evaluation, that 
the Board possess the necessary skills and 
diversity of experience that a complex insurer 
like Amlin requires. 
I was elected as a director and appointed 
Chairman of Amlin on its formation from the 
merger of Angerstein and Murray Lawrence  
in 1998 and it is my intention to retire  
at the AGM in May. Succession planning,  
led by Nigel Buchanan in his capacity as  
Senior Independent Director, resulted in  
the Board inviting Richard Davey to serve  
as Chairman immediately following the AGM  
on 17 May 2012. Richard Davey is an 
outstanding financier and very capable 
director, who I have every confidence will  
be an excellent Chairman of Amlin. 
Strategic progress
Despite the challenges posed by catastrophe 
events and financial market upheaval during 
2011, management continued to focus on 
the development of the business and the 
delivery of our strategic vision for profitable 
long term growth.
Amlin Re Europe, which started underwriting in 
October 2010, got off to an excellent start and 
has the potential to develop into an important 
longer term earnings stream for the Group.  
We also continued to make targeted small 
acquisitions, with J R Clare and Lead Yacht 
further broadening the scope of business 
written by Amlin UK and Amlin London 
respectively. The underwriting ratios obtained 
by Amlin London in their principal lines of 
business, other than catastrophe reinsurance, 
were similar to the previous year, a particularly 
good performance in difficult market 
conditions. Amlin UK continued to grow its 
motor and property accounts as pricing 
improved, benefiting from previous investment 
in underwriting and distribution.
ACI remained a key focus during the year. Its 
disappointing result for 2011 does not reflect 
the sustained effort and substantial resource 
being applied both within ACI and the wider 
Group to integrate and improve this business. 
Step by step progress towards sustainable 
profitability is being made and we remain 
confident of ACI’s strategic value to Amlin over 
the longer term.
Elsewhere, excellent progress was made in a 
number of key areas, notably our preparations 
for Solvency II. The tangible benefits to the 
business realised so far from implementing our 
Target Operating Model already outweigh our 
investment in its development. Over the longer 
term, we anticipate significant further 
advantage, particularly in risk management 
and capital efficiency. This programme has 
required the co-operation of colleagues from a 
range of disciplines and locations across the 
Group and its success is an excellent example 
of the teamwork which is one of our core 
values. Actuaries, risk modellers, accountants, 
IT specialists and other professionals 
throughout the business play important roles in 
supporting our underwriters. We continue to 
invest in high calibre people across these 
disciplines to ensure that we are resourced to 
support a larger and more diverse business. 
Outlook
Many of the investments made in recent years 
in new teams, niche acquisitions and better 
operational capabilities have been against a 
backdrop of softening market conditions, with 
a view to positioning the business to grow as 
and when the trading environment improves. 
Now that we are seeing an upward trend in 
pricing in much of Amlin’s portfolio, albeit not 
a hardening market across all lines, we are well 
placed. The broader scope of the business, 
with three well capitalised underwriting 
platforms, gives us greater flexibility to manage 
exposures and the cycle, as well as creating 
more opportunities for profitable growth.
The Amlin team 
As Chairman of Amlin I have witnessed many 
aspects of the Group’s remarkable 
development. However, a key to our success 
has been our ability to retain, recruit and 
develop talented individuals in all aspects  
of our business, from front line underwriting  
to the key support services. I have personally 
taken great pleasure seeing people flourish  
in their careers at Amlin, but also welcomed 
many excellent new staff who have joined our 
various operations as they have developed, 
both in the UK and internationally. I can 
assure shareholders that Amlin has a stronger 
team today than ever before and I take pride 
in them all. 
2011 was a challenging year, with major losses 
following one after the other, yet the staff 
remained motivated, delivering on their plans 
for the year and ensuring that Amlin was 
positioned to seize opportunities as markets 
reacted to events. 
A great team needs good leadership and  
in an unexpectedly tough year, Charles Philipps 
and his colleagues have responded admirably. 
We are in good heart and I would like to thank 
Charles, his management colleagues and  
all our employees for their hard work  
and resourcefulness. 
It has been a privilege to serve the  
shareholders as Chairman of Amlin, but it has 
also been a pleasure to work with a first class 
team of insurance industry professionals.

Amlin’s underwriters are supported by a team of seasoned 
professionals in specialist disciplines including claims, risk 
management, actuarial, catastrophe modelling, investments and 
finance. Many of Amlin’s key people have been with Amlin since its 
creation in 1998. As Amlin has grown, this experienced and stable 
team has been further enhanced by the addition of high calibre  
senior recruits.

4. Active capital management
Our active and flexible approach to capital management has  
generated a weighted average return on equity of 14.7% over the past 
five years. Understanding and managing the level of capital required, 
adjusting the level of equity and debt employed across the cycle to 
enhance returns and support growth, and returning surplus capital  
to shareholders are key aspects of this strategy.

Amlin’s disciplined and responsive approach to investment 
management has delivered consistently robust returns in stable 
financial markets. In current turbulent markets our focus on risk 
appetite, rather than a target return, is crucial.

Amlin’s business model is focused on delivering an average return  
on equity of at least 15% across the insurance cycle through a diverse 
and profitable underwriting portfolio, active capital management  
and optimised investment returns. Over the past five years we have 
delivered a weighted average return on equity of 14.7% and cumulative 
profit after tax of £960.4 million, despite extraordinary catastrophe 
losses in 2011. Since 2002, our weighted average return on equity  
is 18.0%. The business is well positioned to continue this strong 
performance through further profitable growth.

Our goal
16 A consistent vision with a strategy for growth
The core objective of our strategy is delivery of a cross cycle return  
on equity of at least 15%. Evidence suggests that there is a positive 
correlation between profitable growth and the price to book multiple 
and hence the creation of shareholder value. We believe that we can 
deliver significant growth over the insurance cycle through expansion 
of the platforms and markets in which Amlin operates. However,  
given Amlin’s leading position as a catastrophe underwriter, this 
average return will necessarily be achieved with a wide variance 
between single years. In 2009, when catastrophe losses were low and 
investment returns buoyant, Amlin’s return on equity was a record 
37.0%. However, in 2011, with extraordinary international catastrophe 
losses and a difficult investment environment, the Group made its first 
loss since 2001. As a result, the Group’s five year weighted average 
return on equity fell to 14.7%. However, our cross cycle return on 
equity (from 2002) remains ahead of target at 18.0%.
A key aspect of our strategy is the focus on maintaining a balance 
between catastrophe and non-catastrophe exposures, as well  
as a broad spread of risk by geography and class. We aim for the 
mean expected profitability of our total business to offset claims  
(after reinsurance) in the event of one of the extreme catastrophe 
scenarios to which the Group’s catastrophe underwriting is exposed.  
In 2011, there were large losses from the New Zealand and Japanese 
earthquakes, in addition to unusually severe weather-related losses  
in Australia, the US, Denmark and Thailand. With many other  
business lines experiencing pricing towards the bottom of the cycle, 
non-catastrophe earnings failed to fully offset these claims, but did 
mitigate their impact. We continue to believe that the diversity of our 
business is a key strength, which will underpin our performance in the 
future and provide the balance to allow our catastrophe business to 
grow, particularly as the trading environment for non-catastrophe lines 
begins to improve.
Growth through acquisition remains central to our plans as  
we believe that organic growth alone is less likely to deliver the 
diversity, quality and scale of growth targeted over our strategic 
horizon. The 2011 result benefited from some of the recent niche 
acquisitions made to further diversify our non-catastrophe lines. 
ACI, which was acquired in 2009, has yet to attain the performance 
level that we expect, but we remain confident that it will provide 
significant diversification into the Continental European insurance 
market. Organic growth will also be important. Amlin Re Europe, 
which commenced operations in October 2010, has started  
strongly and will further extend the Group’s business mix into  
the substantial Continental European reinsurance market. The 
continued growth of Amlin UK and the expansion of specialty lines 
such as US property as market conditions improve will also add  
to non-catastrophe earnings. 
One of the strategic priorities articulated in our Vision is ‘first class 
client service based on a thorough understanding of their needs’.  
The catastrophe loss activity in 2011 gave us a greater than usual 
challenge, but also presented an opportunity to deliver on our 
commitment to clients as described later in this report ( pp28). 
Consistent delivery of excellent service is reflected in the stability  
of Amlin’s underwriting portfolio and enhances our ability to attract 
profitable new business in the future.
Despite the catastrophe claims of the past two years, Amlin remains 
well capitalised to take advantage of opportunities for profitable 
growth. Our disciplined focus on underwriting profit, without reliance 
on investment returns, which has underpinned Amlin’s cross-cycle 
outperformance, is even more important in the current low interest 
rate environment. As the cycle turns, we have the people and the 
capital in place to grow significantly as others withdraw.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011 Chief Executive’s review
Well positioned for improving market conditions
“ 2011 was an exceptionally challenging year for Amlin in which  
the quality and professionalism of our service to clients was amply 
demonstrated. While catastrophe claims were a primary focus during 
the year, importantly, we continued to make strategic progress. Our 
strong balance sheet and leading market position means that we are 
already benefiting from the improved trading environment and are  
well placed to resume the delivery of good returns for shareholders.” 
 Charles Philipps, Chief Executive
Key highlights in 2011
  Outlook improving with 13.8% average 
rate increase in catastrophe reinsurance 
at January renewals
  Difficult and volatile investment markets
  Many insurance classes traded at bottom 
of insurance cycle
  Capital of £402.7 million above assessed 
capital requirement at 31 December 
2011 despite £500.8 million of net 
catastrophe losses in the year
  Delivery of exceptional catastrophe 
claims service in line with our vision  
‘to be the global reference point for 
quality in each of our markets’ 
  Good progress made at ACI in adopting 
Amlin risk standards with stronger 
management
  Encouraging first year for Amlin Re 
Europe
  Continued investment in future growth 
through niche acquisitions and 
recruitment
  Preparation completed for Solvency II 
internal model approval application
The combination of an extreme frequency  
and severity of natural catastrophes at a low 
point in the insurance cycle, a difficult climate 
for investments and poor performance from 
ACI resulted in 2011 being the worst year  
on record for Amlin since 2001. However,  
our strong strategic and financial positioning, 
together with actions taken to address the poor 
performance at ACI, leaves us well placed to 
grow in the healthier underwriting environment 
which is emerging. 
Amlin has continued to make considerable 
progress in enhancing operational and risk 
management practices so that it is well 
prepared for the introduction of Solvency II. 
Through active claims management associated 
with 2011’s catastrophes, we have reinforced 
our exceptionally strong reputation among 
brokers and clients.
Financial results
The main driver of the pre-tax loss, of  
£193.8 million, were seven significant 
catastrophes, including major earthquakes  
in New Zealand and Japan and extreme 
flooding in Thailand. These events are 
estimated to be three of the ten costliest 
insured loss events in global history.  
The US also witnessed two of its largest  
ever tornadoes. Amlin’s net catastrophe  
losses in 2011 totalled £500.8 million,  
with £255.2 million expected to be  
recovered from outwards reinsurance and 
reinstatement premium.
Amlin is one of the leading reinsurers in Lloyd’s 
and the London Market, as well as in Bermuda. 
As was the case in 2010, catastrophe activity 
was weighted towards international rather than 
US accounts, where Amlin has a more

developed book of business than many of our 
competitors. The broad geographic spread  
of our catastrophe exposures has resulted  
in robust performance over many years, with 
£662.8 million of profit generated over the 
past ten years, including 2011. However, in 
years such as 2011, where our models suggest 
the frequency and severity of activity should 
occur less than once in every thirty years,  
we will incur significant claims. 
Amlin London’s underwriting result of a  
£13.9 million loss with a combined ratio  
of 102%, after £247.3 million of catastrophe 
losses net of reinsurance recoveries and 
reinstatement premiums, demonstrates the 
solid underlying performance of its diverse 
account where 33.6% of its premium income  
is catastrophe and property reinsurance.  
Amlin Bermuda’s loss of £58.1 million and a 
combined ratio of 112% largely reflects the fact 
that since its start up in 2005, it has purchased 
less retrocessional reinsurance protection than 
Amlin London, but it is also a more catastrophe 
oriented business.
Amlin UK continued to grow its income, 
assisted by the acquisition of J R Clare  
whose accounts performed well. Its full year 
underwriting loss of £7.9 million and combined 
ratio of 103% was better than in the first half  
of the year, helped by improving margins on its 
fleet motor account and the prudent reaction 
to unusual prior year claims development  
on its property and motor accounts at the half 
year proving to be over cautious.
ACI and Amlin France performed poorly with 
underwriting losses and combined ratios of 
£56.0 million and £10.6 million and 112% and 
124% respectively. Amlin France was affected 
by exposure to overseas French property 
interests which suffered losses from the 
February New Zealand and March Japanese 
earthquake and the Thai floods, without which 
performance would have been satisfactory. 
ACI’s marine business performed considerably 
worse than expected, while its non-marine 
businesses delivered respectable results  
given the competitive nature of their markets. 
With the considerable changes and corrective 
action taken at ACI’s marine business over  
the previous two years, we started 2011 with 
the expectation of seeing an improvement  
on 2010’s performance. It was materially 
adversely affected, however, by three principal 
factors. These were an exceptional level of 
large claims, claims on long term contracts, 
(particularly in the commodities cargo account, 
which expire in 2012), and the need to 
strengthen reserves on its long tail shipbuilding 
account, where it became evident that ACI had 
taken more profit than it should have done in 
2007 and 2008. 
Amlin Re Europe, our new Zurich based 
European reinsurer, was well received by 
brokers and clients and wrote £107.4 million 
of premium income in its first full year, 81.6% 
of the Group’s overall growth in premiums. 
However, with only £50.9 million of its net 
premium income having been earned in  
2011 and a full year of operating expenses,  
it contributed an underwriting loss of  
£2.6 million and a combined ratio of 105%,  
a respectable result for a start up year.
The combination of low interest rates and,  
in the latter part of the year, the growing 
Eurozone crisis, made the generation of an 
investment return difficult, whilst managing our 
portfolios against a risk of a reversal in long 
term interest rate trends and a banking crisis. 
In this environment we were pleased to end 
the year in positive territory. 
Strategically we have focused over the years  
in maintaining a strong balance sheet which 
has the propensity to fund a dividend in the 
event of a year such as 2011. Accordingly,  
the dividend has been maintained at 23.0p  
per share and, if we return to a more normal 
year in terms of major loss events, we expect 
to return to our policy of steadily increasing  
the dividend in 2012.
Amlin’s five and ten year average returns  
on equity, of 14.7% and 18.0% respectively, 
remain near to and above our cross cycle target 
of 15%, despite the loss incurred in 2011.
Positioning for 2012
Whilst we do not expect the circumstances  
of 2011 to be repeated frequently, it is 
important that we learn and adjust to improve 
the balance of risk and reward for the future. 
As 2011 unfolded, we focused our attention 
on two critical areas: firstly, what we could 
have done differently or better in our 
catastrophe exposure management; and 
secondly, what further action we could take  
at ACI to ensure that it meets our required 
return on equity of 15%.
Amlin’s largest 2011 catastrophe loss was  
the February earthquake in New Zealand.  
This was an extraordinary event in terms of its 
damage to Christchurch and in an area where 
the modelling of events is less well developed. 
While the Group’s loss from this event was 
within our risk tolerance and New Zealand 
modelled loss scenarios, our market share  
of the loss was higher than we consider 
appropriate given market conditions. We have 
reviewed all market shares globally and have 
decided to downsize in a limited number of 
areas where we are overweight, unless the 
pricing of risk is sufficiently strong to justify an 
above average position. However we remain as 
focused as ever on our strategy of maintaining 
a diverse and balanced book of risk.
Amlin London’s retrocessional reinsurance 
programme responded well to the frequency  
Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements
19
Amlin plc Annual Report 2011 of events in 2011, but Amlin Bermuda, which 
has operated since its creation in 2005 with 
less protection, suffered from the combination 
of frequency and severity of events in 2011. 
For 2012, the protection purchased for Amlin 
Bermuda is much more in line with that for 
Amlin London, and we have reduced the first 
loss retention for Amlin London. We have also 
issued our first catastrophe insurance bond  
in the capital markets, which provides an 
additional $150 million of protection against 
extreme severity and/or frequency of events  
in the US and Europe in a calendar year.  
The bond has a three year duration. 
The purchase of this new reinsurance 
programme has reduced our expected loss 
from a modelled 1 in 50 and 1 in 100 year 
event from £293 million and £344 million 
respectively to £240 million and £288 million 
respectively. 
While reinsurance expenditure as a proportion 
of premium income is expected to increase  
to 15.3% in 2012, inwards rates have reacted 
to last years’ events and we expect full year 
inwards premium income to more than 
compensate for the additional cost, leaving 
Amlin in a better risk reward position than in 
2011. Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda’s 
combined reinsurance income was up 18.4% 
at the end of January compared to the same 
period in 2011.
Action continued to be taken to strengthen 
ACI, particularly its marine division which has 
been the source of its underwriting losses since 
acquisition. A further €192.0 million of poorly 
performing business has been non renewed  
in 2011 and 2012 to date across the division, 
principally in its cargo accounts. This included 
one material multi year cargo liability contract 
from which ACI had been unable to withdraw 
previously, which had incurred an average  
loss ratio of 155% over the five years prior  
to cancellation. 
Further reviews were undertaken of ACI’s 
portfolios and new line guides were put in 
place with a view to reducing volatility. Also, 
increased co-operation was achieved between 
our London marine underwriters and those  
at ACI. This was further enhanced in the latter 
part of the year with the appointment of David 
Harris, International Development Director and 
the former Managing Director of Amlin 
Underwriting Limited, to head up ACI marine 
on an interim basis. During November and 
December, in preparation for the 1 January 
2012 renewals, leading class underwriters 
from London provided guidance and review  
of ACI marine hull and cargo risks, with a focus 
on quality of selection, adequacy of pricing and 
coverage provided.
Management was further strengthened  
in June with the appointment of a new CEO  
at ACI, Kim Hvirgel, who had previously been 
CEO of Codan, Royal and Sun Alliance’s 
subsidiary in Denmark, and with a new CFO, 
Reijer Groenveld, previously at ABN Amro,  
in December. Kim has made a noticeable 
impact since joining, improving accountability, 
transparency and controls, as well as ACI’s 
overall alignment with Amlin’s objectives. 
There remains a risk that ACI will continue  
to suffer from claims on policies written prior 
to its acquisition in 2009 and from some multi 
year contracts which it has been unable to 
re-underwrite or cancel. However, most of  
the poorly performing multi year contracts  
will expire in 2012 and reserves have been 
increased to help address the risk of further 
adverse claims development on prior years. 
With the action taken ACI’s 2012 combined 
ratio is expected to move towards 100%.
Capital
While net tangible assets reduced 22.3%  
to £1,201.5 million in 2011, after deducting 
£42.0 million spent on goodwill and intangibles 
associated with acquisitions and dividends  
paid of £113.6 million, the Group’s capital 
position remains strong and capable of 
supporting further growth as market conditions 
improve. Capital and available resources  
at 31 December 2011, before the proposed 
final dividend in respect of 2011, were  
£402.7 million in excess of the Group’s 
assessed capital requirements. 
Looking forward, assuming our internal  
model approval is obtained, the Group  
remains well capitalised against its anticipated 
Solvency II requirements.
With our 2010 results we announced that  
we had allocated up to £75 million for share 
buy-backs. However, following the major 
earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand,  
we decided to retain this capital with a view  
to sustaining our ability to pay a dividend  
and grow. 
Strategy and business development
A key focus of management has been on 
turning around ACI’s performance and helping 
to bring its risk management and controls  
up to our desired standards. Until this is 
completed and we are able to demonstrate a 
marked improvement in its results we do not 
intend to pursue further major acquisitions. 
However, we remain on the look out for 
smaller bolt-on acquisitions in niches which 
can augment our strategy of balancing 
catastrophe exposure with more attritional  
risk. In January 2011, Amlin UK acquired  
the agency of J R Clare which increased  
its UK property account by £35.1 million  
and in February 2011, Amlin London acquired 
Lead Yacht, the leading specialist super-yacht 
underwriting agency outside the US. Amlin UK 
also supported the acquisition of R L Davison 
by Miles Smith, a broker in which it has a 
minority investment. With this acquisition, 
Miles Smith is now one of the UK’s largest 
wholesale brokers and a growing source  
of business for Amlin UK. 
Amlin Re Europe, which started trading in 
October 2010, has successfully built up its 
team in Zurich to comprise 37 employees, 
including 16 senior underwriters. A further  
13 hires are planned in 2012. Having written 
approximately £100 million of new business in 
2011, its January 2012 income was up 32.3% 
to £136.0 million. We believe that this business 
has the potential to grow to some £300 million 
of premium income over the next three years 
as it continues to build its reputation and 
penetration of its target European client base.
Organic growth has also been augmented 
through attracting further experienced 
underwriting talent, particularly in Amlin 
London and Amlin UK, which were joined  
by eight senior underwriters during 2011. 
We have strengthened resources in our 
Corporate Centre to increase our ability  
to manage a larger and broader group,  
and to address the increasing requirements  
of regulation, in particular for Solvency II.  
Chief Executive’s review continued
20 This has included the creation of a Group 
Underwriting function, whose role is to monitor 
the quality of underwriting and adherence to 
Amlin’s underwriting policies and standards 
across the Group, and to enforce improvement 
where it is necessary. ACI has clearly been the 
focus of most of its attention to date and this 
function will provide us with a better ability to 
ensure that future acquisitions quickly adopt 
Amlin’s standards.
Our major change programme in preparation 
for Solvency II was largely completed in 
2011, so that enhanced risk management 
and reporting will become business as usual 
in 2012. We are working with regulators  
to gain approval of our capital models  
and starting to realise benefits from the 
investment made over the last two years.  
For example, our modelling capability  
now better informs decisions on outwards 
reinsurance and the allocation of risk 
appetite between our operating divisions.
Given our Vision of becoming the  
“global reference point for quality”  
in insurance, we were pleased that the  
work done by our claims team in London  
was clearly recognised in the most recent  
survey of brokers carried out by Gracechurch 
Consulting ( pp28).
Outlook
In contrast to the start of 2011, when 
downward pressure on pricing was increasing, 
we are now seeing signs of a better rating 
environment emerging. This was reflected in 
average renewal rate increases to 31 January 
2012 of 4.0% compared to average reductions 
of 1.3% in January 2011.
Responding to last year’s losses,  
catastrophe reinsurance rates have continued 
to strengthen both in the United States and 
internationally, with 1 January renewal rate 
rises of 14.5% and 15.9% respectively. As 
expected, loss affected areas have increased 
the most and we expect the April Japanese 
renewals to see significant rises.
Amlin UK is continuing to achieve rate rises  
on its motor business, and following average 
renewal rate increases in 2011 of 7.4%,  
is expecting a double digit average increase  
in the current year. UK property rates are also 
starting to show signs of positive movement 
and we expect liability rates to start to improve 
during 2012.
Within the US property and casualty market,  
1 January renewal rates increased 4.3% for our 
US property account with casualty renewal 
rates flat. We expect a gradual improvement  
in rates through 2012. In most other 
accounts, renewal rates are flat.
While pricing in some areas where renewal 
rates are flat already offers acceptable 
margins, such as in our London marine 
business, other areas, such as the European 
insurance accounts, remain highly competitive, 
although we expect increasing financial 
distress and lower investment returns to result 
in a positive turn, at some stage.
With the steps taken to enhance our 
underwriting teams in Amlin UK and Amlin 
London in particular, and with our strong 
capital position, we are well placed to grow 
income in classes of business where margins 
are becoming more attractive. We also 
anticipate growth in Amlin Re Europe as it 
builds on its successful start in 2011.
As the upward turn in the insurance cycle 
broadens to more of our less catastrophe 
exposed classes of business, including in 
Europe, this will again allow us to increase 
appetite for catastrophe risk, providing  
the prospect of the high returns on capital 
historically delivered.
While investment returns in the year to date 
have been good, with 1.8% achieved to the 
end of February, the economic and political 
environment is far from stable and interest 
rates are expected to remain low for the 
foreseeable future. We will therefore continue 
to adopt a cautious approach and do not 
expect returns to recover to the levels that 
were the norm only a few years ago.
Overall, with the underlying profitability  
of our core business in London in 2011, 
increasing rates in reinsurance and UK  
motor in particular, the expectation of better 
performance at ACI and the capital to support 
our planned growth in premiums in 2012, we 
expect to return to a good level of profitability 
in 2012. 
People
2011 was a tough year for many of our 
employees, in particular those involved  
in managing claims from the catastrophes  
and associated underwriting adjustments,  
the changes implemented in preparation  
for Solvency II and at ACI, where work  
on their systems replacement overlaid actions 
to improve processes and controls as well  
as improve performance. The staff turnover  
of 5.8%, combined with progress achieved, 
demonstrates a resilience and loyalty as well  
as the ambition of our employees to make 
Amlin the “global reference point for quality  
in each of our markets”. I thank them for  
their achievements.
As indicated in his Chairman’s statement, 
Roger Taylor has decided to retire as 
Chairman, having served in that capacity since 
the merger of Angerstein and Murray Lawrence 
to create Amlin in 1998. Roger has been  
a constant source of helpful guidance and 
support to me and to my senior management 
colleagues and we owe him our sincere 
gratitude for helping us build Amlin to what it is 
today. He will be succeeded by Richard Davey, 
who has been on our Board since 2005 and I 
look forward to working closely with him over 
the coming years.

Introduction
Reinsurance
The reinsurance market provides risk  
transfer and contingent capital to insurance 
companies. As a result of a sustained period  
of consolidation in Europe, Bermuda and the 
US, the global market is dominated by large 
reinsurers in Germany, Switzerland, Bermuda, 
the US and within Lloyd’s. 
Amlin underwrites reinsurance principally 
through Lloyd’s Syndicate 2001 (Amlin 
London) and Amlin AG (Amlin Bermuda and 
Amlin Re Europe). The largest part of Amlin’s 
reinsurance portfolio is catastrophe 
reinsurance, which protects insurers against 
losses caused by natural catastrophes such as 
hurricanes or earthquakes. Amlin London and 
Amlin Bermuda also write other reinsurance 
business across a range of classes, mainly 
covering property risks. Amlin Re Europe, 
which started underwriting in October 2010, is 
developing a Continental European reinsurance 
account focused mainly on property, casualty, 
marine and motor reinsurance for small and 
mid-sized insurance companies. 
The majority of Amlin’s reinsurance business is 
sourced through global reinsurance brokers. In 
line with market practice in Continental Europe, 
Amlin Re Europe is developing some business 
which is transacted direct with insurers.
Market commentary
2011 was dominated by substantial 
international catastrophe claims from events 
even more devastating than those of 2010.  
An aftershock of the New Zealand earthquake 
of September 2010 hit Christchurch on 22 
February 2011, proving to be more intense 
than the initial earthquake and causing further 
extensive damage to the city and the 
underlying land. In addition to numerous 
smaller aftershocks, further earthquakes 
occurred in New Zealand on 13 June and  
2011 was the worst year on record for insured losses from natural catastrophes
1
, 
with major earthquakes in New Zealand and Japan and severe weather related losses 
in Australia, the US, Denmark and Thailand. Catastrophe reinsurance pricing firmed 
markedly during the year and continued to increase at 1 January 2012 renewals. 
24
23 December. On 11 March a major 
earthquake and tsunami struck north eastern 
Japan causing widespread damage and loss  
of life. 
As well as these major catastrophes, 2011  
was characterised by an unusual number of 
large weather related claims around the world. 
These included severe flooding in Australia, 
Denmark and Thailand, as well as Hurricane 
Irene, exceptional tornado activity and wildfires 
in the US. Tornado activity typified the unusual 
scale of loss events, reaching an all time high 
both in terms of frequency and severity. 
Insured losses from tornadoes exceeded  
$16 billion in 2011, compared to an average  
of $6.1 billion between 2001 and 2010
2
. 
Overall, insured catastrophe claims for 2011 
are estimated to be a record $105 billion
1
. 
Amlin’s expected share of these events is 
shown opposite. 
The cumulative impact of the catastrophe 
claims of 2010 and 2011 on the reinsurance 
market led to a marked change in market 
conditions. In 2010, despite localised rate 
increases in loss affected areas, overall claims 
had insufficient impact on abundant industry 
capital to affect the downward trend in 
catastrophe pricing, which continued into  
early 2011. This began to reverse for both 
international and US risks following the 
Japanese earthquake in March. The upward 
trend continued through the year, as losses 
further eroded surplus capital and risk 
exposures in many territories were re-priced. 
Rates on Amlin’s international catastrophe 
portfolio increased by 6.8% overall during 2011. 
Increases in loss affected territories were 
substantially higher, but capacity attracted by 
higher pricing meant that in some areas the 
rate rises achieved fell short of expectations. 
Further momentum to US catastrophe pricing 
was generated by the release by commercial 
modelling firm, Risk Management Solutions,  
of an update to one of the mostly widely  
used US windstorm models. This new model, 
RMSv11, significantly increased loss 
predictions for certain US hurricane scenarios, 
increasing demand for reinsurance and 
consequently pricing for US exposures. 
Commercial modelling of many of the  
non-US catastrophes and weather-related 
events seen in 2011 is limited in scope  
or unavailable, but the range and severity  
of these losses also prompted a market-wide 
reassessment of risk assumptions, particularly 
for earthquake exposures. 
On US catastrophe risks, rates on Amlin’s 
portfolio increased by 0.3% overall during 
2011, reflecting the softening market 
conditions seen prior to the Japanese 
earthquake. The average rate reduction for the 
year to March was 4.2%, but this was offset by 
significant increases later in 2011. Continued 
increases for 1 January 2012 renewals have 
lifted pricing close to peak levels. 
The trading environment for Amlin Re Europe’s 
portfolio remained competitive although there 
was some evidence of slightly firmer market 
conditions in certain lines, for example, on loss 
affected Scandinavian business following the 
Copenhagen floods in 2011.

Insured catastrophe losses 1970 – 2011 ($bn)
Amlin is a recognised leader in the catastrophe 
reinsurance market, with Amlin London and 
Amlin Bermuda viewed by brokers as preferred 
insurers by virtue of their underwriter 
expertise, claims service and strong financial 
strength ratings ( pp50). Both businesses  
are recognised for excellence in client service, 
which is reflected in the consistently high 
retention rates achieved on renewal business.
Amlin’s catastrophe account is mainly 
underwritten on a treaty excess of loss  
basis. While the US accounts for the largest 
proportion of catastrophe premium by 
geography for both London and Bermuda,  
the overall catastrophe portfolio is a global 
one, with a significant spread of international 
business outside the US. This reflects Amlin’s 
strategy to seek profitable diversity within 
individual business classes as well as across 
the whole Group underwriting portfolio. 
Amlin Re Europe was established in  
October 2010 to provide the Group with 
access to European reinsurance business 
that does not typically flow into the London 
and Bermuda markets. This is achieved by 
meeting demand for greater diversity of risk 
transfer and counterparty risk among small 
and medium sized insurers. Like Amlin’s 
other reinsurance businesses, Amlin Re 
Europe offers cedants strong ratings and 
capitalisation, underwriting expertise founded 
on knowledge of local markets and high 
levels of client service. It had a successful 
first full year of underwriting in 2011.

2011 Catastrophes
A damaging year for catastrophe reinsurance
Natural catastrophes are always unique, even if their likelihood and potential severity 
can be modelled. 2011 saw events exceptional not only for their frequency and severity, 
but also for how they occurred. The combination of tsunami and earthquake in Japan, 
the unprecedented land damage caused by soil liquefaction following New Zealand 
earthquakes, and the prolonged and widespread flooding in Thailand all challenged 
previous expectations for such events. Our analysis of the impact of these scenarios will 
increase our understanding of potential future events and help us to provide clients with 
appropriate protection for the future.

Delivering first class client service
When clients buy a policy from Amlin they  
are buying a promise to pay. Delivering on 
that promise quickly and efficiently is a key 
component of our value proposition to clients 
and never more so than following major 
catastrophe events. During 2011, Amlin paid 
$445.6 million net in catastrophe claims to 
clients in New Zealand, Japan, the US and 
other territories. 
A number of clients benefited from Amlin’s 
early payment scheme for catastrophe claims, 
Amlin Advance. This unique initiative enables 
part payment of major claims before they  
are fully assessed, thus assisting clients’ cash 
flow and helping them to make rapid claims 
payments to their customers. Previously used 
to help Amlin’s portfolio of small and medium 
sized US clients following hurricane losses, 
the service was extended in 2010 and 2011 
to pre-fund major earthquake, flood and 
tornado claims. 
Our ability to provide advance payments relies 
on Amlin underwriters’ detailed understanding 
of individual client accounts, assisted by risk 
and aggregate modelling. This enables us  
to make a relatively accurate estimate of loss 
in most cases. In addition, Amlin’s strong 
balance sheet can support the early advancing 
of claims. No other Lloyd’s business provides 
this service and it is a differentiator for Amlin 
which is greatly valued by clients, as illustrated 
in the example opposite.
During 2011, Amlin London and Amlin 
Bermuda paid $55.4 million and $6.2 million 
respectively under the scheme to nine Amlin 
clients. This includes $44.0 million for the  
New Zealand earthquakes and $13.2 million 
for floods in Australia. These advance 
payments enabled our clients to play  
their part in funding the recovery process  
in disaster stricken areas through rapid 
settlement of insurance claims to 
policyholders. Unfortunately Amlin was 
unable to provide the Amlin Advance  
to Japanese clients following the  
earthquake and tsunami, due to the way  
that Japanese clients account for their 
reinsurance receivables.

28 “ TOWER really appreciates the client focused approach that you have taken here. We feel it is a 
very visible and practical example of the ‘first class customer ser vice based on client needs’ that 
you articulate in your vision statement.
While the current circumstances with these earthquake claims are not ideal for either company, TOWER would like  
to acknowledge the great response we have had from you in dealing with the outcome. Once again thank you for your 
decision to pre-fund these claims. We look forward to continuing our relationship with you over the next few years.”
Michael Boggs, Chief Operating Officer, TOWER, New Zealand
During the year, senior members of the 
claims and underwriting teams made several 
trips to loss affected areas to understand the 
impact of catastrophe events on the ground 
and meet with brokers and clients, gaining 
insights into the loss events. This proved 
invaluable in negotiating claims settlements 
and policy renewals. Amlin was the first 
Lloyd’s business to send a senior team to  
visit Christchurch after the September 2010 
earthquake and the team made two 
additional visits during 2011, as well as four 
visits to Australia and one to Japan. A 
co-ordinated approach between Amlin 
London and Amlin Bermuda ensured that 
clients received a seamless response and the 
involvement of underwriters, as well as claims 
experts, meant that we could also work 
closely with clients and brokers to reassess 
exposures and ensure continuity of coverage 
at renewal.
Amlin’s superior service delivery was  
again recognised in the Claims Performance 
Monitor, a rolling quarterly survey of specialist 
London Market claims brokers by the 
independent research company, Gracechurch 
Consulting. Two hundred specialist claims 
brokers were interviewed during 2011, across 
the full spectrum of business lines. 
Amlin moved further ahead of competitors 
with the highest overall satisfaction rating  
of all insurers, as illustrated in the panel 
below left. Amlin’s service performance 
exceeds the market average on each of the 
nine metrics identified as important by claims 
brokers and our 2011 performance has 
improved on 2010 on all metrics bar one. 
Lloyd’s remains the highest ranked claims 
market among major global centres.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011 Market review
Introduction Market commentary
Specialty lines
The specialty lines area insures a wide  
range of risks, which are typically commercial, 
large and complex, requiring specialist 
underwriting expertise and individually tailored 
cover. Distinct markets include the US surplus  
lines market and the international marine  
and aviation markets. Lloyd’s remains an 
important hub for the insurance of many  
of these highly specialised risks, but capacity 
is also provided by global insurers operating 
world-wide and in regional market centres 
such as the Dutch Beurs.
Catastrophe and severe weather losses, combined with claims inflation  
and lower investment returns, contributed to an improving trend in the  
US property market. Many specialty lines experienced a stable or improving  
trading environment.
As in previous years, the diversity of the 
specialty lines market was reflected in  
a varied picture for pricing and capacity. 
Some classes were particularly affected by 
the catastrophe and large weather related 
losses of 2010 and 2011, and as a result,  
a more positive trend emerged in these 
markets, particularly US property. As shown 
in the table below, the US property market 
had been subject to declining overall returns 
since 2007 and this was exacerbated by the 
severity of losses in 2011. Key factors were 
record tornado losses, Hurricane Irene and 
substantial US business interruption losses 
due to the Japanese earthquake. The 
combined impact of these events prompted 
a reversal of the previous downward trend 
in US property rates, which for Amlin’s 
portfolio increased by 1.7% during 2011. 
Lower investment returns, claims inflation 
and poor market results also contributed  
to a stabilisation in US casualty pricing.
Rates for London-based marine classes 
generally remained satisfactory and there 
was continued improvement in offshore 
energy rates, reflecting substantial market 
losses including Deepwater Horizon in  
2010 and the North Sea Maersk Gryphon 
loss in February 2011. However, ACI’s 
marine operation continued to experience  
a highly competitive trading environment. 
Conditions in the global aviation and 
aerospace segment also remained 
competitive, with little overall improvement 
in a weak pricing environment.

30 Amlin’s market position
Amlin has specialist expertise in five major 
specialty lines as shown below, with most 
business written through Syndicate 2001,  
via Amlin London, and through ACI in the 
important Benelux marine market centred  
on Rotterdam. Our office in Singapore 
sources Asian energy and cargo business for 
Syndicate 2001. A substantial proportion of 
Amlin’s specialty business comes from the 
US, which accounted for 25.0% of Amlin’s 
premium in 2011. 
Other specialist tailored insurance provided  
by Amlin includes insurance for thoroughbred 
breeding and racing bloodstock and high  
value competition horses through Amlin Plus, 
and for other types of livestock through  
Crowe Livestock Underwriting Limited, both 
subsidiaries of the Group. 
Amlin sources its specialty business mainly 
through brokers and other intermediaries.  
In certain lines, part of the business is written 
via lineslips and binding authorities, whereby 
Amlin gives limited and defined underwriting 
authority to selected intermediaries. 
Amlin is a major insurer in the marine market. 
Marine is Amlin’s largest specialty class with 
combined gross written premium across the 
Amlin London and ACI marine account of 
£492.6 million in 2011, including energy 
premium of £64.4 million. Amlin London 
underwrites all major international marine 
classes including energy, cargo, marine hull 
and liability. Amlin is also a leading provider  
of yacht insurance through two specialist 
subsidiaries, Haven Knox-Johnston, which 
services the small yacht market, and Lead 
Yacht Underwriters, which provides coverage 
for super-yachts. 
ACI is a market leader in marine insurance  
in the Benelux region. In the Dutch market, 
ACI writes a diverse regional and international 
hull account and is a major shipbuilding insurer 
as well as a market leader in cargo. In Belgium, 
ACI is a major underwriter of specialist 
commodities cargo business. 
Amlin also writes US and international  
property and casualty lines at Lloyd’s and 
participates in the US surplus lines market. In 
these and other specialty lines, Amlin pursues 
a disciplined underwriting approach based on 
writing a diverse portfolio of risks within each
class, with a focus on profitability rather than 
market share. The broad scope of Amlin’s 
specialty book means that it is exposed to 
different and sometimes contrary pricing 
cycles according to business line, generating 
varied opportunities for profitable growth. The 
expertise of Amlin’s underwriters across a wide 
range of disciplines is well recognised in the 
market and Amlin’s strong financial strength 
ratings ( pp50) give a competitive advantage. 
Amlin is also noted for quality client service, 
which is reflected in long standing broker and 
client relationships and the consistently high 
retentions achieved on renewal business.

Market commentary
Commercial insurance
Commercial lines insurance covers motor, 
property and liability insurance to commercial 
enterprises, ranging in size from sole traders  
to global corporations. In some markets 
commercial insurers also provide insurance  
to local and national government entities.
During 2011, the commercial insurance 
markets in which Amlin operates presented  
a mixed picture. 
In the UK there was a continued improvement 
in pricing for motor fleet business and  
a modest upturn in property rates, while 
liability pricing began to stabilise. There was 
further withdrawal of capacity from various 
commercial classes, reflecting poor market 
results after several years of intense 
competition. Claims inflation, severe weather 
losses and lower investment returns were  
all factors adding momentum to a more 
widespread upward trend in rates. 
Pricing in the fleet motor market continued to 
rise and rates on Amlin’s portfolio increased by 
7.4%, with the improvement accelerating later 
in the year. Property rates on Amlin UK’s book 
of business also improved modestly by 5.2%. 
In Continental Europe, markets remained 
competitive with limited evidence of improved 
market conditions. In the Netherlands,  
ACI continued to experience a soft property 
market, although there was some evidence  
of a stabilisation of pricing towards the  
end of the year. The Dutch liability market 
continued to offer acceptable margins 
although pricing trended downwards during 
the year, particularly on larger premium 
volume contracts. In Belgium, ACI saw a 
similar soft property market and the liability 
market was also highly competitive, with 
excess capacity. Motor fleet pricing in both 
markets remained soft but relatively stable. 
The trading environment for Amlin France  
was competitive across most of its portfolio. 
Commercial insurance in Continental Europe remained competitive,with excess capacity driving 
competition for market share, particularly in property lines. By contrast, UK commercial lines showed 
some improvement, with a firmer property market, partly reflecting the impact of higher claims following 
the severe winter weather in 2010 and 2011, and a continued upward trend in fleet motor rates.

34 Amlin’s market position
Amlin’s commercial lines business is 
underwritten in Amlin UK, which serves 
clients in the UK and Ireland, ACI, which 
operates in the Netherlands and Belgium, 
and Amlin France, which serves the French 
corporate market. 
Amlin sources its commercial insurance mainly 
through Lloyd’s brokers and regional and local 
intermediaries in the UK and Continental 
Europe. Each of Amlin’s commercial lines 
businesses is focused on maintaining close 
relationships with key intermediaries in their 
respective markets and on providing high 
levels of service tailored to the needs of 
brokers and clients in specific industry and 
business sectors. 
Amlin UK is a market leader in commercial 
fleet motor business. It also underwrites 
property and liability business for UK 
corporate entities, together with some 
specialist lines, such as high net worth 
products for private individuals. The 
property account includes package products 
aimed at the SME sector, which incorporate 
combined property and liability cover.  
Amlin UK also writes a portfolio of 
homeowners business on a wholesale basis. 
The experience and technical expertise  
of Amlin UK’s underwriters and their  
ability to create and price non-conventional 
programmes provides a competitive 
advantage. The business works closely with 
brokers to create niche products meeting client 
needs across a wide range of business types 
and sectors. 
ACI is a leading provider of commercial 
property and liability insurance in both the 
Netherlands and Belgium, where it also 
underwrites commercial motor fleet 
insurance. ACI benefits from long-standing 
relationships with major international 
brokers operating in the Benelux region,  
as well as with a broad range of local brokers 
and intermediaries. In the Netherlands,  
ACI is a major participant in the Beurs 
co-insurance market. 
Amlin France is the largest Lloyd’s 
coverholder in the French market by 
premium and writes a diverse range  
of business including property, cargo, 
professional liability and specie insurance, 
mainly for small and medium sized 
corporate enterprises, focused on niche 
areas where its specialist underwriting and 
pricing skills can generate good returns. 
Amlin France’s business is underwritten  
on behalf of both Syndicate 2001 and ACI.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011 Business review
2011 highlights
  Net losses from major catastrophe events  
of £247.3 million 
  Underlying combined ratio of 79%,  
excluding impact of catastrophe losses  
and reserve releases
  New business growth in reinsurance, 
property and casualty and marine portfolios
  Acquisition of Lead Yacht Underwriters 
  Excellent feedback from brokers on claims 
service: Amlin London ranked first in London 
market by Gracechurch survey
  Continued recruitment of senior 
underwriters to further broaden the portfolio
As described in the market reviews  
(  pp24-35), the trading environment for 
Amlin London during 2011 was dominated  
by global catastrophe activity. Net catastrophe 
claims for the division totalled £247.3 million 
and had a marked effect on profitability for the 
year. The frequency and severity of catastrophe 
losses contributed to an upturn in rates for 
catastrophe reinsurance and an improving 
trend in a number of other classes, such as  
US property, which has continued into 2012. 
Renewal rates improved by 1.0% overall,  
but by 3.2% in the second half of the year. 
International catastrophe reinsurance  
delivered a rate increase of 7.7% for the full 
year and 27.9% for the second half, whilst  
US catastrophe reinsurance achieved an 
average increase of 0.1%, with an increase  
of 2.6% in the second half. 
Importantly, the multiple loss events also  
gave us an opportunity to demonstrate  
our commitment to fair and timely claims 
settlement and an exceptional level of client 
service, as described earlier in this report  
( pp28).
Overall international catastrophe exposures 
were reviewed in the light of 2010 and 2011 
loss experience. Whilst significant rate rises 
were achieved for loss-affected international 
catastrophe exposures, in certain areas  
the increases fell short of our view of an 
acceptable post-loss re-rating, and risk 
exposures were reduced accordingly. However, 
we continued to maintain our strategy to have 
a balanced portfolio of US and international 
risk within the catastrophe book. The general 
pattern of the last decade has seen the 
normally profitable international catastrophe 
portfolio counterbalance large US catastrophe 
claims, for example in 2004, 2005 and 2008. 
In 2010 and 2011 the opposite occurred, with 
the returns on the US catastrophe portfolio 
helping to offset the impact of the international 
catastrophe losses on the reinsurance account. 
Gross catastrophe losses generated  
£176.9 million of reinsurance recoveries from 
Amlin London’s retrocessional reinsurance 
programme. The structure of the programme, 
which was designed to respond to multiple 
catastrophe events, responded well, with the 
entire aggregate limit purchased being utilised 
during the year. 
Gross written premium was £954.9 million,  
an increase of 7.3% on the prior year  
(2010: £889.4 million). Growth was driven  
by catastrophe reinsurance business, both  
in the US and globally, generated by back  
up premiums, new opportunities following 
catastrophe losses and rate improvements. 
New business was also added within our 
property and casualty and marine businesses.
Despite generally competitive markets until 
later in the year, we were able to increase  
our property and casualty account through 
selective new business development. The

“ Catastrophe claims made 2011 a challenging year, but equally 
enabled us to demonstrate to clients the value of Amlin’s capital

for profitable growth.”

Source: Amlin
36 catastrophe and weather-related losses during 
2011 was modest and it remained profitable 
overall. Towards the year end there were some 
positive market trends, suggesting that we may 
be reaching the end of the soft part of the 
cycle for property and casualty lines. During 
the downward phase of the cycle, as well as 
carefully managing our portfolio to maintain 
profitability, we have invested in broadening 
our underwriting capabilities to create more 
opportunities for growth, increasing the 
number of property and casualty underwriters 
from eight to 23 since 2008. We are in a 
strong position to take advantage of better 
market conditions as they emerge. 
Growth in our marine business benefited from 
the recruitment of additional senior 
underwriters and the acquisition of specialist 
underwriting business Lead Yacht in February 
2011. Lead Yacht provides coverage for super 
yachts and added income of $9.2 million in 
2011. We expect it to contribute gross written 
premium of approximately $12.3 million in 
2012. While pricing in the marine market was 
flat overall, the continued upward trend in 
energy rates, combined with a higher level  
of exploration and construction activity in the 
sector, generated opportunities to write 
additional profitable business. 
The division generated a combined ratio  
of 102% (2010: 80%). We believe this to be  
a very good result in such a heavy catastrophe 
year. Net earned premium of £669.5 million 
(2010: £627.9 million) reflects increases in net 
written premium in 2010 and 2011.
The combined ratio of 102% (2010: 80%) 
includes an impact of 33% from catastrophe 
events in 2011, including the New Zealand and 
Japanese earthquakes in February and March 
respectively, and the Thai floods in late 2011. 
As described above, major catastrophe losses 
were mitigated by Amlin London’s 
retrocessional reinsurance programme,  
but the Amlin London underwriting result  
was also supported by profits generated  
within the property and casualty, marine and 
aviation businesses, demonstrating the benefit 
of a diversified book. Reserve releases of 
£68.4 million (2010: £80.8 million) reduced 
the combined ratio by 10% (2010: 13%).

  Net losses from major catastrophe events  
of $379.8 million

Amlin Bermuda writes a similar catastrophe 
reinsurance book to Amlin London and 
therefore experienced a comparable claims 
profile during 2011. Amlin Bermuda worked 
closely with colleagues in London to provide  
a first class claims service to clients in the 
aftermath of each loss event ( pp28).
International catastrophe exposures were 
re-analysed in the aftermath of major loss 
activity and catastrophe appetite was reduced 
in areas where pricing was not deemed to have 
responded sufficiently. The improved rating 
environment on both international and US 
catastrophe business in the second half of the 
year, combined with increased demand for 
catastrophe protection after first half losses 
and market wide catastrophe model changes, 
created opportunities to write new business, 
particularly back up programmes. 
Casualty premium income increased  
to $11.5 million in 2011, following the 
successful transfer of a casualty underwriter 
from Amlin London in late 2010 to establish  
an underwriting capability in this class. 2011 
also saw further growth in our short term trade 
credit business to $30.1 million on both a 
proportional and non-proportional basis, with 
new participations on two of the three biggest 
specialist carriers. Terms in this class continue 
to be acceptable following the rapid upturn  
in the market in the aftermath of the 2008 
financial crisis.
Amlin Bermuda continued to write a whole 
account quota share of Syndicate 2001 to 
provide balance to the overall account. In 
2011, the quota share was maintained at 
17.5%, with the exception of the reinsurance 
book, where the quota share was reduced  
to 10.0%. Amlin Bermuda also continues  
to write variable quota shares and excess  
of loss programmes on a number of classes 
including marine, aviation, property and other 
specialist classes.
Gross written premium was $847.8 million 
(2010: $676.4 million). Net earned premium 
increased by 18.4% to $760.4 million, 
supported by growth in income from the  
whole account quota share, as well as in Amlin 
Bermuda’s direct account. Rates increased by 
1.1% year on year, but by an average of 5.9% 
in the second half as the market hardened  
in the aftermath of major loss events.
The division’s combined ratio was 112%  
(2010: 83%). The claims ratio of 94% included 
an impact of 60% from catastrophe events  
in 2011, including the New Zealand and 
Japanese earthquakes in February and March 
respectively, and the Thai floods in late 2011. 
Reinsurance recoveries made against major 
losses were lower than for Amlin London, 
which benefited from a more extensive 
retrocessional reinsurance programme. 
Prior period reserve releases increased to 
$55.3 million (2010: $19.8 million) improving 
the claims ratio by 7% (2010: 3%). The increase 
largely reflects improvements on large losses 
and Amlin Bermuda’s share of releases made 
within Syndicate 2001. The expense ratio 
remained stable at 18% (2010: 18%).

reinsurers already operating in the Continental 
European market. The overall portfolio 
comprises a mix of proportional and  
non-proportional treaty reinsurance business, 
with a focus on property and casualty and 
some special lines of business, mainly marine  
and engineering. ARE’s portfolio is largely 
complementary to the existing reinsurance 
books of Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda. 
In its first full year of operation, the business 
made good progress, attracting more than  
250 clients, generating €123.7 million of gross 
written premium on approximately 500 
reinsurance programmes.
During 2011, targeted recruitment in line  
with the business plan increased the ARE team 
to 37 experienced reinsurance professionals 
from leading European reinsurance players.  
As well as substantial market and underwriting 
expertise, senior recruits also brought actuarial, 
risk management and finance capabilities. 
In addition to establishing a robust operational 
framework, a key focus during the year was 
ensuring that ARE set a high standard in 
service delivery and responsiveness to client 
needs, for example, in underwriting certain 
complex and non-standard transactions 
alongside providing professional quotes  
in all main lines of business and products. 
Key components of ARE’s business  
proposition include the quality of the 
underwriting team, their established client 
relationships and knowledge of local markets. 
Further differentiators are the ability to offer  
a comprehensive and flexible underwriting 
approach across a client’s entire portfolio, 
together with the strength of the Amlin AG 
balance sheet and the Amlin brand. 
The outcome of January 2012 renewals 
confirmed the strong initial response from 
ARE’s target markets, with €170.0 million  
of gross written premium (January 2011: 
€70.0 million), representing more than 300 
clients on over 600 programmes. 
The division generated a combined ratio  
of 105% in the year. Net earned premium  
was €59.0 million reflecting the first full year  
of trading. The claims ratio of 72% was 
satisfactory with no individual claims above 
€3.5 million. The expense ratio of 33% reflects 
material start up costs. Over the longer term 
this expense ratio is expected to reduce.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011 Business review
2011 highlights
  Increase of 7.1% in gross written premium 
to £312.4 million
  Growth of fleet and other motor income  
to £127.4 million, supported by an average 
fleet rate increase of 7.4%
  Property income of £114.6 million, a 
178.8% increase since 2009, reflecting 
recent strategic investments
  Acquisition of JR Clare contributed  
£35.1 million of gross written premium
The trading environment for Amlin UK 
continued to improve during 2011. Notably, 
the upward trend in fleet motor rates 
experienced during 2010 continued to 
strengthen as the year progressed generating 
an average increase of 7.4% for the year.  
As competitive pressures eased in this market, 
with the withdrawal of capacity by certain 
peers following poor results, there were more 
opportunities to provide capacity and gain 
market share at favourable rates. Growth 
within the fleet account was focused within 
‘minifleet’ (small fleets of less than 20 vehicles) 
and private hire, where market capacity was 
limited and pricing correspondingly improved 
sharply. Minifleet income increased by  
29.0% during the year, with new business  
at £6.3 million. Private hire income grew  
by 14.0% with new business at £2.5 million. 
Overall, fleet and other motor income 
increased by 1.6% to £127.4 million, with  
new business amounting to £31.0 million. 
Property pricing also improved modestly with  
a rise of 5.2%. The property account generated 
gross written premium of £114.6 million, 
supported by recent strategic investments.  
The acquisition of J R Clare in January 2011 
gave us further distribution in the commercial 
and household property market, and 
investments made in Insolvency Risk Services, 
Miles Smith and T L Dallas in prior years are 
now contributing to new business 
development. On 1 November 2011,  
Amlin UK announced the addition of a team  
of three underwriters to its mid/high net worth 
household account, which is expected to 
generate approximately £10 million of income 
in 2012. 
Amlin UK continued to benefit from a higher 
profile with regional and smaller intermediaries 
as a result of targeted marketing, the Amlin 
Group’s European rugby sponsorship and 
Amlin UK’s sponsorship of Essex County 
Cricket Club. 
The division produced a combined  
ratio of 103% (2010: 97%). Net earned 
premium was up 21.4% at £231.2 million 
(2010: £190.4 million) reflecting growth  
in net written premium in 2010 and 2011. 
The claims ratio was 69% (2010: 64%). 
Reserves were strengthened at the half year 
within our property, fleet and private motor 
accounts, in light of loss experience and slower 
development on the 2009 underwriting year. 
Whilst the position has improved in the second 
half, with releases of £8.5 million, we continue 
to hold a prudent position on these accounts. 
Overall releases were reduced year on year,  
at £5.3 million (2010: £17.1 million).
The expense ratio was stable at 34%  
(2010: 33%).

  Strengthened executive management team
  Solid performance by non-marine business 
  Marine re-underwriting nearing completion
  In-house capability achieved for all support 
functions
The integration of ACI within the Group  
and the alignment of ACI’s underwriting  
and risk management with Amlin best 
practice remained our principal focus  
in 2011. In support of these goals,  
the executive management team was 
strengthened with the appointments  
of Kim Hvirgel as CEO in June and Reijer 
Groenveld as CFO in December. A number  
of other senior appointments were made  
to the underwriting and operational teams. 
Several important actions were taken with  
a view to improving ACI’s longer term 
underwriting performance. The re-underwriting 
programme led to the non-renewal of  
€146.0 million of poorly performing business, 
most notably from within the marine account 
(€107.0 million), which has been the source  
of underwriting losses since acquisition.  
In addition, further reviews were undertaken  
of ACI’s portfolios and new underwriting line 
guides were implemented with the objective  
of reducing the underlying volatility of the book. 
During the year, ACI received strong support 
from both the Group Underwriting function and 
our Amlin London underwriters. Additional work 
was completed to establish an underwriting 
strategy for future business development and 
ahead of 1 January 2012 renewals, ACI worked 
closely with London colleagues to review ACI 
marine hull and cargo risks, with a focus on risk 
selection and pricing adequacy.
Key aspects of Amlin’s risk management 
practices were implemented during the year 
and ACI made positive strides towards 
Solvency II compliance as part of the Group’s 
Solvency II programme. Work continued to 
separate ACI from the operations of its former 
sister companies within the Fortis Group.  
The Platform Replacement Programme (PRP), 
which will enable transfer of ACI onto Amlin’s 
IT systems, proved more complex than 
originally anticipated and implementation was 
delayed to ensure that all user requirements 
could be met. Deployment of the new system 
is planned for the second quarter of 2012.
Gross written premium was down 20.6%  
at €609.8 million (2010: €768.2 million).  
The reduction in income reflects the impact  
of the re-underwriting programme offset by  
the addition of new business amounting to 
€46.0 million. Renewal rates were broadly flat 
for the second consecutive year, reflecting a 
challenging rating environment in Continental 
Europe, though a marginal improvement was 
evident in the second half. The retention rate 
was 72% (2010: 84%).
ACI produced a disappointing combined  
ratio of 112% (2010: 104%), with the claims 
ratio increased to 79% (2010: 76%). 
Underwriting losses were predominantly  
driven by the marine business, with the 
underlying profitability of the non-marine 
businesses in the Netherlands and Belgium 
proving satisfactory. Large claims, in excess  
of €5 million, were unusually high in the year, 
generating losses of €32.9 million (2010: €nil). 
Reserve releases were also reduced at  
€7.6 million (2010: €49.6 million), due to the 
need to strengthen ship building and cargo 
reserves. The expense ratio increased to 33% 
(2010: 28%), mostly reflecting costs incurred  
in developing operational capability, spread 
over a reduced net earned premium base.

2011 highlights
  22.7% increase in gross written premium  
to €69.8 million
  Further increase in share of total portfolio 
written by Amlin
  New products launched for general  
liability business
Amlin France continued to build on its 
established position as the largest Lloyd’s 
coverholder in the French market, underwriting 
business on behalf of Syndicate 2001 and  
ACI, fully integrated under the Amlin France 
brand. The increased line size available from 
the ACI platform created opportunities to 
develop relationships with larger brokers 
alongside Amlin France’s existing links with 
brokers and clients in the SME sector. The 
profile of the business continued to benefit 
from an active marketing strategy, assisted by 
Amlin’s sponsorship of European rugby, which 
raised the profile of the business with target 
brokers and clients. 
Despite generally competitive market 
conditions, Amlin France generated  
€19.0 million of new business across a number 
of business lines, but most notably in the 
multinational property business sector, where 
stronger relationships with the larger brokers 
are now paying dividends. 
The general liability book, which had previously 
been placed outside Amlin, was written within 
the Group, contributing to a growing portfolio 
of profitable casualty business.
Elsewhere, the regional office in Lyon, which 
opened in 2010 to extend Amlin France’s 
distribution beyond the Paris area, continued 
to grow its broker base and underwrote 
approximately €500,000 of new premiums 
during the year.
Gross written premium was €69.8 million,  
an increase of 22.7% in the year (2010:  
€56.9 million). Growth was mostly in business 
generated for ACI. Net earned premium was 
€50.2 million (2010: €43.4 million).
The traditional core business of Amlin France 
enjoyed a stable year with no major events 
impacting the French domestic business. 
However, the international exposures 
associated with some of the newer business 
proved challenging in 2011, with the division 
impacted by losses from New Zealand, Japan 
and Thailand. Total losses were €8.8 million  
for French domiciled clients with exposures  
in those territories which had a 17% impact  
on the claims ratio. 
The reduced expense ratio of 37% (2010: 40%) 
reflects saving in costs following the integration 
of ACI France, largely in staff related costs.  
The combined ratio was 124% (2010: 99%).

42 “ During 2011, we made further progress towards Solvency II 
compliance and started to realise tangible business benefits 
through the development of our Target Operating Model. We 
remain confident that full implementation will improve cross-cycle 
earnings quality by further enhancing our risk management and 
capital efficiency.” 
 Richard Hextall, project sponsor
Pillar 3 focuses on disclosure and reporting 
requirements, including an annual report  
to supervisors.
Progress during 2011
Amlin’s Solvency II programme set out  
to achieve five key objectives:
1. To improve risk and capital management 
across the Group so that Amlin remains ahead 
of its peers in terms of quality risk taking and 
delivering cross-cycle capital returns.
2. To supplement our expertise in underwriting 
and investments with improved risk 
management capability supported by 
analytical and modelling tools, while 
maintaining Amlin’s philosophy of relying  
on expert judgement rather than models.
3. To demonstrate to our customers, 
shareholders and other external stakeholders 
that Amlin is adequately capitalised and  
a global leader in risk management.
4. To prepare the Group for compliance with 
Solvency II regulation.
5. To deliver the Target Operating Model within 
a three year timeframe.
During 2011, the focus of the programme  
was on the Pillar 1 aspects relating to risk  
and capital management, and the embedding 
Solvency II is an EU directive aimed at 
overhauling the regulation of life and non-life 
insurers. The key objective of Solvency II  
is to introduce a more risk-based approach  
to regulation, with strong incentives for firms 
to assess their own capital requirements 
internally. The directive goes beyond existing 
regulation by aiming to instil a high standard 
of risk management and governance within 
each insurer. Implementation of the directive 
has been repeatedly delayed, but Amlin has 
continued to pursue the objectives set in 2009 
at the launch of its Solvency II programme  
and the business is now beginning to reap 
the benefits.
Solvency II regulation is predicated upon  
three ‘pillars’. 
Pillar 1 sets out the minimum level of capital 
required, how it is to be calculated and the 
nature of the assets held to support this 
capital. There are two prescribed methods  
for assessing an insurer’s regulatory capital 
requirements – using either a standard formula 
set by the regulator or an internal model 
specific to that insurer, which reflects its risks 
and which is subject to regulatory approval.  
We continue to believe that obtaining approval 
for Amlin’s internal model will give the 
business greater capital flexibility and 
competitive advantage over insurers operating 
under the standard formula. 
The goal of Pillar 2 is to strengthen the internal 
corporate governance and control processes 
within European insurance firms. As part of 
Pillar 2, companies are required to deliver  
an ‘Own Risk & Solvency Assessment’ (ORSA), 
to the Board, at least on an annual basis. This 
defines the company’s internal risk tolerance, 
assesses its own individual risk profile and 
derives a capital requirement that is consistent 
with these.
of a Group wide risk management framework 
in accordance with Pillar 2. Key components, 
such as the ORSA, the Risk Assessment 
Process and the Internal Model have now 
become integrated ‘business as usual’ 
components across the Group. 
We also submitted to Lloyd’s our Internal 
Model Application. Amlin has been at the 
forefront of the Solvency II initiatives taken  
by Lloyd’s and throughout the process Amlin 
has been in the upper quartile of businesses  
in relation to our progress in Solvency II 
compliance and operational embedding. 
We also continued to work to bring ACI into 
line with Solvency II requirements and further 
substantial progress was made in 2011, to the 
extent that ACI’s level of preparation is now 
ahead of many local peers. 
Although many of the expected business 
benefits from the Solvency II programme  
are yet to emerge, gains realised so far have 
already overtaken the cost of the programme. 
These include improvement across the Group 
in our catastrophe risk modelling and aggregate 
risk analysis, which in 2011 allowed outwards 
and internal reinsurance to be structured more 
efficiently with significant cost savings. 
Additionally, the use of more flexible analytical 
tools and more robust modelling have led  
to more informed underwriting decisions and  
in some business lines identified areas where 
more underwriting risk can be taken against 
available capital within risk appetite.
Other benefits include standardised 
management information at executive level 
and a common Group policy framework across 
divisions, both important in managing a larger 
and more diverse business.

“ During 2011 we focused on integrating our risk management 
framework within day-to-day operations. This has raised the level  
of risk awareness across the business and helped the organisation 
focus on improving and consolidating existing processes.” 
 James Illingworth, Chief Risk Officer

  Own Risk & Solvency Assessment (ORSA)
process successfully developed and 
integrated within the business cycle
  Risk Assessment Process further embedded

  Risk event reporting process implemented 
and actively used
  Awarded ‘Enterprise Risk Management 
Strategy of the year’ at 2011 Risk

Setting our risk strategy
Amlin recognises that delivery of shareholder 
value comes from actively seeking and 
accepting risk while managing that risk within 
acceptable bounds. Our risk management 
policy clearly articulates the importance given 
to active management of risk within the Group. 
Risk categories are clearly identified, risk 
management standards are documented and 
risk tolerances are set for each category and 
allocated amongst our operating divisions.  
Risk taken is then regularly assessed against 
those tolerances. For example, the table 
opposite shows key realistic disaster scenarios 
against tolerance.
Effective risk management and governance  
are fundamental to the regulatory regime 
which will be implemented under the Solvency 
II Directive. During 2011 we made further 
progress towards meeting these requirements 
as part of the development of Amlin’s Target 
Operating Model. 
Embedding our Own Risk & Solvency 
Assessment 
The ORSA is a key business process required 
under Solvency II, that brings a coordinated 
view of risk and solvency together for 
management and boards. This information 
helps to ensure that risk and capital 
implications are recognised in the decision 
making process and that appropriate control 
plans are developed to support the successful 
delivery of business strategies and priorities. 
For example, the ORSA summarises realistic 
disaster scenarios for catastrophe events and 
also provides an aggregate risk assessment  
for multiple catastrophes in any one year.  
This information is compared with specific  
risk tolerances.
The Amlin plc Board, operating company 
boards and risk committees receive quarterly 
ORSA reports produced through consistent  
risk assessment and reporting processes 
across underwriting divisions and other 
corporate functions. These reports were further 
developed during 2011. For example, key risk 
indicators are now integrated into monthly 
management information reports, including

risk events and emerging risks at both Group 
and divisional level. This has proven a key step 
in embedding the management of risk within 
the day-to-day operations of the business and 
ensuring local management accountability. 
Our commitment to harnessing Amlin’s risk 
management framework to the benefit of the 
business as a whole was recognised externally 
when Amlin won the award for the ‘Enterprise 
Risk Management Strategy of the Year’ at the 
2011 Risk Management Professional awards.
Modelling and exposure management
Amlin aims to deliver an attractive cross-cycle 
return on capital through the maintenance of a 
diversified portfolio of business, combined with 
excellent capital management. Diversification 
across different business lines and geographies 
provides an effective balance of catastrophe 
and non-catastrophe exposures and reduces 
the risk of any one event, or series of events, 
causing unacceptable impairment to the 
Group’s balance sheet. 
We continue to develop our Dynamic Financial 
Analysis (DFA) model, the principal tool for 
analysing the range of possible outcomes, in 
terms of expected profitability, for the Group 
and each regulated entity. Consequently, the 
modelling provides the principal support for 
assessment of our economic and regulatory 
capital requirements and is central to our 
preparations for Solvency II and Internal Model 
approval. Amlin’s DFA modelling is integrated 
into the Risk Management Framework which 
supports the determination and assessment  
of risk. The modelling captures the distinct  
risk profile of the Group, including the potential 
aggregation of catastrophe risk, class 
diversification and reinsurance protection.  
It must always be remembered that financial 
risk modelling is not an exact science, yet

ongoing use and engagement with the wider 
business provides a catalyst for refining the 
model’s accuracy.
While this actuarial modelling provides a 
critical ingredient to our risk management 
approach, it is ultimately used to inform 
underwriters and management, on whose 
judgement and experience we ultimately rely 
and who remain accountable for exercising 
prudent judgement. During 2011, we have 
continued to focus on strengthening the use  
of the model within key business processes 
such as business planning, assessment of 
reinsurance purchase, investment decisions, 
risk reporting as described above and strategic 
business decisions. This work has been 
conducted to support Syndicate 2001, Amlin 
AG and ACI in a consistent manner. This model 
use provides a continuous feedback loop for 
model improvement.

2011 highlights
  Progress towards moving ACI onto core

  Upgrade of key catastrophe modelling

management of the catastrophe portfolio 
across the Group
ACI Platform Replacement Programme
The primary objective of this programme is to 
migrate ACI’s business operations from former 
parent Fortis Group to a new platform based 
on existing Amlin Group systems components. 
This has always been a necessary integration 
following the purchase of ACI but it will also 
facilitate improvements in ACI business 
processes and improve operational efficiency 
through the adoption of key Amlin 
underwriting and risk management processes. 
The platform replacement is complex with  
all ACI’s IT systems being replaced together. 
This includes policy and claims administration 
systems, operational accounting and general 
ledger, document production and scanning, 
market and broker interfaces and other 
components. The transition to the replacement 
systems platform also requires migration  
of approximately 100,000 live policies, open 
claims and histories.
Insurers rarely replace their entire systems 
platform in one event. Typically, the platform 
would be replaced component by component 
over a period of several years, in order to 
reduce complexity and cost. However, due  
to the unusual circumstances of the acquisition 
of ACI, our initial planning assumption was  
that we should aim to complete the transition 
within two years rather than the three or four 
years that might more typically be planned.  
We also concluded that step by step transition 
was not possible, since it was not practical  
to establish temporary new interfaces between 
existing Fortis systems and new ACI systems 
during transition.
During 2011, considerable progress was  
made, with the design complete and build 
progressing. However, it became apparent  
that the complexities of the project would 
require a postponement of the planned 
mid-year deployment to ensure that the  
risks to the business were minimised. 
Implementation of the new system is now 
planned for the second quarter of 2012.
Solvency II
Amlin made significant progress towards 
internal model approval and Solvency II 
compliance during the year ( pp43).  
Part of this included delivery of new and 
upgraded systems. 
The following were implemented as part  
of our preparation for Solvency II:
  Two new aggregate management systems 
  A new catastrophe modelling system for  
our marine business
  A new data quality toolkit to improve data 
quality within our core catastrophe 
modelling systems
  System upgrades for two catastrophe 
modelling systems 
  A new market risk tool to support the 
investments front office and to feed our 
internal model
  A new document management system  
to improve control around our internal 
model and Solvency II reporting
  Enhancements to our risk assessment 
system.
As well as these implementations, we 
developed further tools to improve the quality 
of aggregate and catastrophe modelling  
data and progressed the implementation  
of a new data management system for the 
investment team.
Amlin’s approach to Solvency II has been  
to drive commercial benefit for the business. 
Implementation of these systems has delivered 
demonstrable benefits to the Group. An 
example is within our War Terrorism book, 
where implementation of an aggregate 
management system has enabled the team  
to expand through improved understanding  
of exposure.
Supporting the development  
of the business
We are committed to ensuring that Amlin’s 
revenue generating businesses are well 
supported and technology is used effectively. 
During 2011 we created a Business 
Relationship Management function to work 
with each division or business to ensure that 
we understand their needs and deliver to their 
requirements. This is supported by a Group 
wide Projects Board and Shared Services 
Committee which help to prioritise projects 
and plan workload. The Projects Board, 
comprising representatives from Corporate 
Centre functions and the business divisions, 
was established to provide controls and 
manage the allocation of budget for business 
projects, including contingency funding.  
The Shared Services Committee is similarly 
comprised of representatives from all parts  
of the Group and oversees how our shared 
technology services are provided and what 
investments to make. 
“ During 2011 our main priorities remained the ACI Platform 
Replacement Programme and supporting the development of the 
Group’s Target Operating Model in preparation for Solvency II.”

People
“ In times of financial uncertainty and market turbulence the  
stability and quality of our team is more than ever a key competitive 
advantage. During a challenging year, Amlin staff demonstrated  
their professionalism in responding to client needs and we continued  
to benefit from our ability to attract high calibre talent.” 
 Mark Farrow, Human Resources Director
Organisational development
During 2011 we further developed the 
organisation of the Group to support  
organic growth and acquisitions. To enable 
 the Group Executive to focus on the 
management of the enlarged Group,  
Amlin London was fully devolved from  
the Corporate Centre and restructured  
to provide its own support infrastructure. 
The capabilities of the Corporate Centre  
were extended with the creation of a  
Group Underwriting function to oversee 
underwriting across the Group. The principal 
objective of this new function is to support 
the underwriting culture and philosophy 
combined with high standards of risk 
management which have contributed to 
Amlin’s success, and to ensure that similar 
standards are applied to new ventures and 
acquisitions as the Group continues to expand. 
In March 2011, we appointed a Head of Group 
Underwriting and by the year end, a team of 
four people was in place. 
ACI remained a major focus with a number of 
senior appointments, including Kim Hvirgel as 
Chief Executive on 1 June and Reijer Groenveld 
as Chief Financial Officer in December. ACI’s 
business also benefited from management 
support from seconded Amlin staff in the UK. 
The acquisitions of J R Clare and Lead Yacht 
Underwriters early in 2011 brought an 
additional 19 staff into Amlin UK and seven 
into Amlin London respectively. During the 
year Amlin Re Europe continued to selectively 
recruit staff in line with its business plan to 
reach a total of 37 at the year end. 
Staff development and retention
Retention of Amlin’s team of skilled and 
experienced underwriters, many of whom  
have been with Amlin for more than 15 years, 
remained a priority. Continuity of business 
relationships is a key strength of our team and 
our objective remains to maintain voluntary 
turnover, excluding retirements, of our senior 
underwriters below 10% per annum and our 
overall employee turnover below 15%. During 
2011, voluntary turnover of senior underwriters 
was 2.7% with overall staff turnover being 
5.8%, as shown in the table opposite. Our 
senior underwriters, including those joining  
the Group in 2011, have on average 23 years’ 
experience in the insurance industry and an 
average of nine years’ service with the Amlin 
Group, as shown in the table opposite.
We continued to invest in broadening our 
underwriting capabilities, with several senior 
underwriters joining Amlin during the year.
Remuneration and benefits
At the start of 2011 a new variable pay system, 
supported by a new approach to performance 
management, was introduced to ACI. We 
developed a ‘toolkit’ for all ACI employees 
regarding target setting and appraisals and 
managers received comprehensive training 
and guidance on how to manage the new 
approach. This proved a success during  
the year, as evidenced by a greater focus  
on performance management by ACI line 
managers. Importantly, this contributed  
to further aligning ACI’s culture and values  
with those of Amlin.
We continued to adapt the benefits offered  
to Amlin employees in the light of legislative 
and regulatory changes, for example, in 
making changes to contracts and to reward 
schemes to reflect the removal of the default 
retirement age in October. HMRC confirmed 
their formal approval of the Amlin Salary 
Sacrifice Scheme, ‘Pension Advantage’ at the 
end of March. This is a facility which provides 
an opportunity for employees to save for their 
pension in the most tax efficient way.

supplemented by regular development 
interventions to build their knowledge  
of insurance and all graduates studied  
for the professional qualification of Associate 
of the Chartered Insurance Institute.  
ACI also has a two-year rotational Young 
Professionals Programme with eight 
graduates participating in 2011. 
A new Group wide Graduate Development 
Programme, which will provide an improved 
and more integrated proposition, with 
additional placements in ACI, Amlin Re 
Europe, Amlin Bermuda and the Lloyd’s 
market was developed during the year for 
implementation in 2012. 
Professional excellence 
We continue to support staff in studying  
for professional qualifications, including  
the Associate of the Chartered Insurance 
Institute and a range of actuarial, accounting, 
risk management and human resources 
qualifications. There were 148 staff studying 
across all these categories in 2011, and 16 
staff achieved professional qualifications  
during the year. 
Developing new talent
Amlin’s ambition to be “the place to work”  
in the market is a key part of the Amlin 
vision. Our ability to attract, develop and 
retain talent is key to realising this vision  
and to the long term sustainability of the 
Group. Therefore, alongside our focus on 
retaining existing experienced employees  
we recognise the importance of investing  
for the future, through the development  
of people within the business. We continue  
to provide management development 
training through our established partnerships 
with Roffey Park, Coverdale and other 
external partners. During 2011, 76 Amlin 
employees benefited from training provided 
through these programmes.
Our inaugural Amlin London Graduate 
Development Programme, which 
commenced in January 2010, reached a 
successful conclusion at the end of 2011 
with the placement of the four graduates  
in permanent roles in our cargo, energy  
and reinsurance businesses. While taking 
part in the programme the graduates had  
the opportunity to rotate through eight  
areas within Amlin London, giving them  
an insight into underwriting as well as other 
In 2011 Amlin became an authorised training 
employer for the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in England & Wales (ICAEW). This 
is in addition to ACCA and CIMA accreditations.
During the year, Amlin partnered with the 
Institute of Risk Management, a leading 
international enterprise risk management 
education body, to support the launch of the 
Institute’s new ‘Risk Management in Financial 
Services’ certificate qualification. The course, 
which is focused on insurance and retail 
banking, requires students to work in their own 
time using online resources over a nine month 
period to secure this professional qualification. 
Separately, an Amlin Risk Management 
workshop won the Best Risk Training 
Programme Award at the 2011 Strategic  
RISK European Risk Management Awards.  
The judges described the programme as 
“exceptional” in design. This programme  
is a joint venture between Amlin and external 
training provider MDA. 
In addition to our focus on professional 
qualifications, the Amlin Academy continues  
to offer high quality management, personal 
and skills development programmes that aim 
to build on the existing skills of our staff.

* Bank facilities are subject to a number of covenants
Assessed capital is management’s estimate  
of capital required for current trading 
purposes. Assessed capital is built up from 
subsidiary requirements as follows. 
For Syndicate 2001, assessed capital  
is the Syndicate’s Funds at Lloyd’s, which  
at 31 December 2011 amounted to  
£497.0 million (2010: £476.1 million).
We continue to believe that $1.0 billion  
is the minimum amount of capital Amlin AG 
requires to trade with its preferred client base, 
an amount which exceeds the local regulatory 
capital requirement. At 31 December 2011, 
Amlin AG had net assets of $1.4 billion  
(2010: $1.6 billion).
At the end of the year, ACI held net assets of 
€226.1 million, relative to the local regulatory 
capital requirement of €117.0 million. 
Management consider that the current level  
of capital is in line with that which ACI 
economically requires.
We believe that the Group should retain  
a level of capital sufficient to allow material 
growth in the business in the aftermath of a 
major insurance disaster and also to respond 
to other opportunities to enhance long term 
profitable growth. At 31 December 2011, 
Business review
2011 highlights 
  Net tangible assets decreased by 22.3%

*Lloyd’s syndicate assessment
50 available capital was £402.7 million greater 
than the Group’s assessed capital requirement.
Assessed capital does not include any credit 
for the recently acquired catastrophe bond 
coverage for US hurricane, US earthquake  
and European windstorm perils of up to  
$150 million. As this reinsurance is intended to 
cover remote capital impairing events it should 
lead to a fall in capital requirements.
Adjusting the capital employed to 
enhance returns
Our capital management approach is flexible. 
When underwriting margins are sufficient  
to limit the impact of a large catastrophe loss 
to equity, debt capital will form a greater 
proportion of the overall capital deployed. 
When margins weaken, the level of debt  
capital used to support our underwriting will  
be reduced. 
At 31 December 2011 we had £292.8 million 
of subordinated debt in issue (2010: £318.0 
million). The debt is regulatory compliant, 
longer-term, unsecured and contains no 
financial covenants that could lead to early 
forced repayment. It is also recognised as 
capital by a number of the rating agencies. 
In addition, we have a £250 million unsecured 
revolving credit facility available. This facility 
expires in September 2013. At 31 December 
2011 the facility was undrawn (2010: nil).
Managing equity capital for 
shareholders
Our financial performance management  
is centred on delivering a cross cycle return  
on equity of at least 15%. Given the Group’s 
cyclical underwriting approach, at certain 
points this will lead to the Group holding 
surplus equity capital. In order to enhance  
our return on equity, as actual levels of capital 
exceed our forecast capital requirements,  
we will look to return some of this capital  
to shareholders.
The Group has demonstrated clearly its 
commitment to return capital to shareholders 
in recent years. Since 1 January 2007, through 
a combination of progressive dividend strategy 
and ‘B’ share issue, we have returned cash of 
£606.9 million to our shareholders. We have 
also repurchased £27.6 million of capital 
through share buy backs.
Despite extraordinary catastrophe claims  
in 2011, our balance sheet strength has 
allowed the Group to maintain a dividend to 
shareholders at 23.0 pence per share in 2011. 
In the absence of significant catastrophe 
losses, we intend to increase our dividend  
per share consistently over the next few years.

Enhancing cashflow
At 31 December 2011, the Group’s cash  
and investments were £4,325.8 million,  
a decrease of £56.1 million on the prior  
year (2010: £4,381.9 million). Cash and 
investments are a multiple of 3.0x 
shareholders’ equity (2010: 2.5x).
The strength and liquidity of the balance  
sheet is critical to our proposition as an insurer 
of choice, providing us with the ability to 
respond quickly to claims in the event of a 
large catastrophic loss. The analysis opposite 
demonstrates the strength of the Group’s 
balance sheet in the face of exceptional loss 
activity in 2011. 
We use bank facilities to supplement the 
working capital strength of the Group.  
A $200 million secured LOC facility is available 
to Syndicate 2001 to fund its US regulatory 
requirements and this reduces any potential 
funding pressures at times of catastrophic  
loss in the US. If drawn, security is provided  
by a fixed charge over a portfolio of assets. 
Similarly, Amlin AG has a $250 million facility 
secured over three years in order to provide 
collateral to US cedents for their regulatory 
needs. At 31 December 2011 Amlin AG has 
issued LOCs amounting to $194.7 million.

Credit quality of reinsurance debtors
Source: Amlin
Efficient cash flow management is an 
important source of value to an insurer.  
We retain premium for an average of 
approximately three years before claims are 
settled. On large claims where reinsurance 
recoverables are due, we have to pay the  
claim before the recovery is made and  
rapid reinsurance response is important.  
At 31 December 2011, outstanding insurance 
and reinsurance receivables debtors had 
increased to £933.5 million (2010: £795.6 
million), reflecting premium growth across  
the business, most notably following the  
start up of Amlin Re Europe. The accrual for 
reinsurance on outstanding claims was up 
61.1% at £617.0 million (2010: £383.1 million) 
due predominately to the underlying increase 
in reinsurance recoveries following major 
catastrophe loss activity. 
Effective investment management
Our investment management approach  
is driven by our investment risk appetite.  
This is based on, amongst other things,  
the perceived risk and returns of the portfolio, 
the outlook for underwriting profits and the 
strength of our balance sheet. We do not target 
an absolute investment return, rather, we seek 
to maximise returns for the level of risk that  
we are prepared to accept. We focus on:
1. Setting appropriate strategic asset 
allocations using both qualitative and 
quantitative analysis. 
2. Taking short-term tactical asset  
allocation positions around the strategic 
asset allocations.
3. Identifying skilled external investment 
managers to manage the underlying assets.

Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements
51
Amlin plc Annual Report 2011 We distinguish between policyholders’ funds, 
being premium received and used to meet 
future claims expenses, and capital assets, 
which support the underwriting business. 
For policyholders’ funds our risk appetite  
is relatively low, so they are held in a mixture  
of government and non-government bonds as 
well as LIBOR plus funds, whose underlying 
assets are bonds and currencies. The duration 
of these assets is referenced to the duration  
of the underlying liabilities, which is reasonably 
short. However, we will periodically reduce the 
duration of the assets if we believe that yields 
will rise, as is currently the case.
For Group capital, the investment horizon  
is longer term and this allows investment  
in more volatile classes such as equities and 
property, although our underlying requirement 
for transparency remains. The strategic 
benchmarks for capital are set using a 
combination of efficient frontier and value  
at risk
 
models. The table below analyses policy 
holders’ and capital asset allocation.
Further commentary on our investment 
performance in 2011 is provided later in  
this report ( pp55). In addition, investment 
risk is analysed within our risk disclosures  
( pp111-138).
Effective currency management
The Group reports in sterling but manages  
a sterling business in the UK, a US dollar 
business in Bermuda and Euro businesses in 
Continental Europe. Amlin AG, which consists 
of Amlin Re Europe and Amlin Bermuda, 
reports in US dollars. 
For our UK operations, we sell trading currency 
underwriting year profits into sterling as they 
crystallise, once we are largely through the 
Atlantic windstorm season. Amlin AG manages 
its US dollar trading position and holds its 
balance sheet mainly in US dollars reflecting  
its global underwriting profile. Similarly, ACI 
manages its Euro trading position and holds its 
balance sheet in Euros reflecting its European 
underwriting profile. At a Group level, we 
implement a policy to hedge up to 50% of the 
net US dollar / Euro exposure of the Group  
to Amlin AG and ACI respectively. The Group’s 
hedges are achieved through the use of 
forward sales and other derivative contracts. 
In the year to 31 December 2011, movements 
in the US dollar produced foreign exchange 
losses, before hedging, of £0.2 million on the 
dollar capital investment in Amlin Bermuda. 
The hedges deployed produced a gain of  
£2.8 million. For ACI, the weakening in the 
Euro produced foreign exchange losses before 
hedging of £6.4 million. Hedges increased this 
loss by £0.4 million.
In addition, foreign exchange losses  
of £30.5 million arising on the consolidation of 
an externally managed investment fund were 
recognised in reserves. A corresponding gain 
of £24.4 million was recognised as investment 
income within the Group’s income statement.
Estimating outstanding claims reserves
Estimation of claims reserves is a key aspect of 
financial management. Not only does it impact 
on overall profitability, but it also impacts 
investment mix, as different approaches are 
taken for capital and policyholders’ funds. 
Insurance business is inherently uncertain and 
much of Amlin’s business is large commercial 
insurance or reinsurance, which can be 
volatile, making it difficult to estimate ultimate 
claims levels. The factors that must be 
considered when assessing the level of 
outstanding liabilities include the risk profile  
of an insurance policy, class of business, 
timeliness of notification of claims, validity  
of claims made against a policy and validity  
of the quantum of the claim. At any time there 
are a range of possible outcomes at which  
the claims reserves could ultimately settle. 
However, as time passes the uncertainty 
surrounding likely claims settlement reduces.
Given this uncertainty, we adopt a prudent 
approach to the assessment of liabilities, 
however, consistency of reserving strength  
is our overall goal. 
We estimate that the Group as a whole  
holds reserves on an accident year basis of  
at least £170 million in excess of an actuarial 
best estimate (2010: at least £175 million). 
Whilst overall net claim reserves have 
increased to £2.7 billion (2010: £2.2 billion), 
£473.7 million relates to catastrophe claims 
which have been well reserved, with material 
exposures at policy limits.

52 With record catastrophe claims, a competitive 
rating environment in insurance lines and 
continued volatility in investment markets, 
2011 was a challenging year.
The Group recorded a loss before tax  
of £193.8 million (2010: profit before tax  
of £259.2 million). Total gross catastrophe 
losses amounted to £756.0 million or  
£500.8 million on a net basis. Net losses  
from the New Zealand and Japanese 
earthquakes in February and March 
respectively, and the Thai floods in late 2011, 
amounted to £433.0 million alone. ACI 
performed poorly, producing an underwriting 
loss of £56.0 million. Investment returns  
fell by £134.5 million, as risk assets such  
as equities and corporate bonds, performed 
poorly in the face of slowing global growth and 
the Eurozone debt crisis. The return on equity 
was a negative 8.6% (2010: positive 13.9%).
Despite a difficult 2011, over the longer term 
the Group’s performance has been robust, 
with a weighted average return on equity since 
2002 of 18.0% and since 2007 of 14.7%. This 
compares with our cross cycle target of 15% 
and exceeds our estimated cost of capital over 
that period of around 8.5%.
For 2011, underwriting contributed a loss of 
£146.0 million (2010: profit of £185.6 million) 
to the pre tax result. The scale of catastrophe 
losses impacted Amlin London and Amlin 
Bermuda in particular; these divisions 
generated respective underwriting losses of 
£13.9 million and £58.1 million (2010: profits 
of £123.6 million and £74.6 million). However, 
the underlying underwriting result for Amlin 
London was robust, with the property and 
casualty, marine and aviation business units 
performing well. London also benefited from  
a more substantial retrocessional reinsurance

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011 programme than Bermuda. Disappointingly, 
ACI made an underwriting loss of £56.0 million 
(2010: loss £19.6 million), impacted by a high 
frequency of large claims across the marine 
and property books in the first half of 2011 
and lower reserve releases due to the need  
to strengthen ship building and cargo reserves. 
Amlin UK, Amlin France and Amlin Re Europe, 
the latter in its first full year of trading, made 
small losses.
Across the Group, claims development 
continued to be better than expected. Releases 
from reserves amounted to £112.6 million 
(2010: £156.5 million), generated primarily 
from within Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda. 
ACI reserve releases reduced by €42.0 million 
year on year.
Investment markets continued to be  
volatile, particularly equity markets, 
corporate bonds and the European 
government bond market. The investment 
return was 0.9% (2010: 4.0%) on average 
funds under management of £4.2 billion 
(2010: £4.2 billion). The contribution from 
investments was £40.5 million.
Net foreign exchange losses in the income 
statement amounted to £10.2 million  
(2010: loss £12.3 million). In addition, net 
losses of £36.5 million on our subsidiary  
net assets exposures were taken to reserves 
(2010: gain £13.4 million). This includes a loss 
of £30.5 million arising on the consolidation  
of an externally managed investment fund.
Underwriting performance
The underwriting environment in 2011 was 
extremely difficult, with heavy catastrophe 
claims activity and competitive rating 
conditions across many of our lines of 
business. In addition, ACI suffered a higher 
than normal level of frequency of large  
loss in the first half of the year and whilst 
performance improved in the second half, 
overall it produced a disappointing  
financial return. 
Gross written premium increased by 6.1%  
to £2,304.1 million (2010: £2,172.5 million). 
At constant rates of exchange, written 
premium increased by 8.0%.
The average renewal rate increase for the 
Group was 1.1% (2010: decrease 1.8%). 
However, the pattern of rate movements was 
affected by catastrophe events in the period, 
with an average rate decrease of 1.0% in the 
first quarter offset by an average increase  
of 3.3% between 1 July and 31 December.  
The renewal retention ratio was a solid 82% 
(2010: 86%), despite the non-renewal of poorly 
performing business within ACI.
The underlying increase in gross written 
premium was £46.5 million. Amlin Re 
Europe, our new Continental European 
reinsurance platform, performed ahead of 
expectation, generating £107.4 million of 
income in its first full year of trading. Amlin 
London, Amlin UK, Amlin France and Amlin 
Bermuda also added new business, though 
this was offset by a reduction from ACI due 
to the re-underwriting programme. 
Amlin London generated gross written 
premium of £954.9 million (2010: £889.4 
million). Growth was delivered within the 
property and casualty and marine business 
units. The reinsurance business also 
generated increased income within the  
US and international catastrophe accounts, 
both of which benefited from reinstatement 
premiums and new business opportunities  
in the aftermath of major catastrophe  
loss activity. 
Amlin UK contributed gross written premium 
of £312.4 million, an increase of 7.1% on  
the prior year (2010: £291.8 million) as the 
division started to grow into a strengthening 
market, with an average rate increase of  
5.0% across all classes. New business was 
generated largely in fleet, other motor and 
package lines and aided by recent strategic 
investments, including the acquisition of  
JR Clare in January 2011. 
Amlin Bermuda produced written income  
of $847.8 million (2010: $676.4 million),  
an increase of 25.3%. Direct income was 
$553.2 million (2010: $438.6 million).  
The retention ratio remained strong at 90% 
(2010: 90%). New business generated within 
trade credit, political risk, terrorism and 
casualty classes contributed to growth.
ACI delivered gross written premium  
of €609.8 million (2010: €768.2 million). 
During the year we took further action  
to improve the underwriting performance  
of ACI’s marine business, including the 
non-renewal of approximately €107.0 million 
of marine business, where pricing was 
considered inadequate or where historic 
claims ratios were unacceptable. Performance 
within the marine account has been below 
expectation, but ACI’s non-marine business 
continues to perform satisfactorily in 
challenging trading conditions. 
Outwards reinsurance expenditure was  
£290.9 million, representing 12.6% of gross 
written premium (2010: £262.2 million and 
12.1% respectively). The proportional increase 
is mainly due to reinstatement premiums, 
additional cover for Amlin Bermuda and the 
impact of a reduction in ACI’s gross written 
premium not tracked by reductions in excess 
of loss cover.
Net earned premium was £1,927.4 million 
(2010: £1,748.1 million), an increase of 10.3%, 
driven by growth in gross written premium in 
2010 and 2011. 
The Group claims ratio for the year was  
78% (2010: 60%). Natural catastrophe 
activity reached record levels in 2011, with 
insured losses estimated at $105 billion
1
. 
The Group incurred net catastrophe claims 
of £500.8 million, with the New Zealand 
and Japanese earthquakes in February and 
March respectively, and flooding in Thailand 
in late 2011, generating a combined loss  
of £433.0 million. This compares to normal 
expected catastrophe losses of around  
£170 million in the year. 
The Japanese earthquake was the largest 
insured event in the period, with an estimated 
insured market loss of $35-40 billion

. We have 
assumed a total loss for our major client 
exposure, with other exposures based on client 
loss estimates, together with an additional load 
to cater for possible further deterioration.

in February 2011 has an estimated insured 
loss of $13 billion

54 international catastrophe reinsurance account. 
Our estimated gross and net claims for this 
event are $427.6 million and $334.5 million 
respectively. Recoveries were greater for 
Amlin London due to its more comprehensive 
retrocessional programme. Within these 
estimates, Amlin’s exposure to the New 
Zealand Earthquake Commission is reserved 
as a total loss, leaving limited scope for 
further deterioration.
The scale of insured damage arising from  
the flooding in Thailand in late 2011 remains 
uncertain, with current insured loss estimates 
ranging between $8 billion and $20 billion. 
Amlin’s exposures to the Thai floods lie mainly 
in its international property reinsurance 
account, with only limited catastrophe account 
involvement. There is further exposure within 
the insurance and other reinsurance accounts. 
However, claims arising from these accounts 
are expected to be largely covered within 
normal loss development. Amlin estimates  
that the property and catastrophe reinsurance 
account claims will be between £50 million 
and £70 million, net of reinsurance recoveries. 
These estimates are based on a review of client 
exposures in the region rather than individual 
loss advices. While the quality and scope of 
information remains limited, claims have been 
reserved towards the top end of the range.
The net claims to Amlin from the New 
Zealand Sumner earthquake in June are 
currently $37.5 million, based on client 
estimates. Net claims estimates from the 
severe US tornado season amounted to 
$43.5 million. Elsewhere, claims due to the 
cloudburst in the Copenhagen area in July 
amounted to $24.3 million. 
For each of these events, whilst claims within 
Amlin London have been well contained by 
recoveries from its retrocessional reinsurance 
programme, Amlin Bermuda has not 
benefited to the same extent from recoveries 
under its programme.
Net claims from the Chilean and New Zealand 
‘Darfield’ earthquakes in 2010 and the 
Australian floods in December 2010 and 
January 2011 have generated small releases  
in the year.
ACI experienced unusually high claims 
frequency, especially in the first half  
of the year, with €32.9 million of claims over 
€5.0 million in 2011 (2010: €nil). 
However, the claims ratio improved in the 
second half of the year to 71% relative to the 
first half of 87%. We consider the frequency  
of large claims experienced during 2011 to be 
abnormal and inconsistent with ACI’s previous 
history, particularly given that there has been 
no material increase in the risk profile of these 
accounts. Reserve releases were also €42.0 
million lower at €7.6 million after reserving for 
late claims advices on the shipbuilding account 
and poor run off on cargo.
We continue to hold a prudent reserving 
position for our property, fleet and private 
motor accounts within Amlin UK. As previously 
disclosed, reserves were strengthened at the 
half year in light of loss experience and slower 
development on the 2009 underwriting year. 
The second half generated reserve releases  
of £8.5 million.
Investment performance
The Group investment return for the year was 
0.9%, with average funds under management 
of £4.2 billion (2010: 4.0% and £4.2 billion). 
Overall, investments contributed £40.5 million 
to the 2011 result (2010: £175.0 million). The 
table overleaf shows the breakdown of asset 
allocation and returns. 
We began the year with a cautious view  
of the global economic outlook but with the 
expectation that central banks would look  
to move their policies slowly away from the 
emergency levels of accommodation adopted 
in 2008 and 2009. 
During the first quarter, two major 
unforeseeable events undermined global 
economic growth, namely the spike up in the 
oil price due to Middle East unrest and the 
disruption to global supply chains due to the 
earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan. 
Although the impact of these events was 
temporary, investors became concerned  
that the global recovery was losing traction, 
resurrecting “double dip” recession fears.  
With the growth outlook for peripheral Europe 
already looking poor due to austerity measures 
aimed at addressing high public debt levels, 
such growth fears had a heightened effect  
on the bond markets of those countries, 
exacerbated by fears of a deficit in the case  
of Greek sovereign debt. Consequently, Italian 
and Spanish sovereign bond yields started  
to rise to levels where Greece, Ireland and 
Portugal had previously sought bailouts.  
Given the scale of the Italian and Spanish 
economies, this caused the European debt 
crisis to intensify, with a sharp sell-off of 
equities and other risk assets during August. 
This shift was further heightened by political 
wrangling around the US debt ceiling, which 
culminated in the US losing its Standard  
and Poor’s AAA credit rating. These events 
generated a negative feedback loop into 
confidence and economic growth, particularly 
in Europe. 
Towards the end of the year the European 
Central Bank cut rates, but more importantly 
provided much needed liquidity to the banking 
system, with the introduction of three year 
longer-term refinancing operations. This helped 
to stabilise investor sentiment, by dampening 
the negative feedback loop between sovereign 
risk and bank funding. 
These events made 2011 an extremely 
challenging year for most assets, other than 
the so called ‘safe haven’ sovereign bond 
markets, such as Germany, the UK and US, 
where yields fell to historically low levels. 
With yields at such low levels, we maintained  
a defensive stance towards interest rate risk, 
whilst believing that credit was attractive 
relative to generally expensive government 
bonds. The asset allocation to equities was 
trimmed at the end of April and reduced more 
substantially during the third quarter. As 
discussed above, exposures beyond cash and 
‘safe-haven’ bonds were negatively impacted 
by the events that unfolded during the year. 
The exception was property, which produced  
a good return. Combined with additional 
investment, this meant that exposure to 
property rose during the year.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011 The insurance linked securities portfolio 
continues to be managed by Leadenhall 
Capital Partners, in the form of two standalone 
investment funds. The risk profile remained 
constant over the year, with Amlin’s investment 
increased to $117.2 million across both funds. 
The return on $112.0 million of average 
funds under management was $5.2 million 
or 4.7% (2010: $109.9 million, $11.4 million 
and 10.4%).
Expenses
Total expenses, including underwriting  
and non-underwriting costs, increased to 
£671.0 million, from £610.5 million in the 
prior year. 
Underwriting expenses, excluding foreign 
exchange movements, amounted to  
£568.1 million (2010: £497.6 million).  
This expenditure represents costs relating  
to the acquisition and administration of 
insurance business and claims payments. 
Within underwriting costs, acquisition costs 
accounted for £41.1 million of the increase 
due to growth in income. Acquisition costs 
have, however, remained reasonably  
stable at 17.1% of gross earned premium 
(2010: 16.9%). The remaining variance in 
underwriting expenses includes inflationary 
increases and growth in operational costs  
for Amlin Re Europe and ACI of £7.3 million 
and £10.1 million respectively. Increased 
operating costs at ACI were generated  
by temporary staff costs and expenses  
in relation to the delay in implementing  
Amlin’s IT programme.
Non-underwriting expenses, excluding foreign 
exchange movements, were £92.7 million 
(2010: £100.6 million). These expenses include 
employee incentives, investment management 
fees, ACI separation and integration costs and 
corporate expenses not directly attached to 
underwriting businesses. Employee incentives 
are down by £18.2 million due to poor 2011 
performance, impacting annual bonuses and 
long term incentive accruals. ACI separation 
and integration costs amount to £16.8 million 
(2010: £16.6 million) and are not considered 
ongoing costs of the business. It is anticipated 
that further expenses of £9.8 million will be 
incurred in completion of ACI separation and 
integration during 2012. In addition to items 
expensed in the period, expenditure on the 
replacement IT platform of £25.7 million  
has been capitalised during the period  
(2010: £17.4 million). 
Taxation
The effective rate of tax for the period is  
22.9% (2010: 14.4%). It is below the UK  
rate of corporation tax primarily due to Amlin 
AG’s Bermudian branch which operates  
in Bermuda with no local corporation tax. 
Profits arising on operations in Switzerland  
are taxed at a combined federal and cantonal 
rate of 21.2% (2010: 21.2%). We continue  
to believe that Amlin AG is exempt from  
the UK Controlled Foreign Company regime.  
The table above illustrates the source of Group 
profits with associated effective tax rate. 
Dividends
The Board proposes a final ordinary dividend 
of 15.8 pence per share. Taken together with 
the interim dividend of 7.2 pence per share, 
this provides total dividends of 23.0 pence  
per share (2010: 23.0 pence per share). 
Net tangible assets
In addition to the loss after tax of  
£149.5 million recognised through  
the consolidated income statement,  
the Group has also recognised a further 
£160.0 million decrease in net assets 
bringing total equity and reserves to 
£1,420.4 million (2010: £1,729.9 million). 
The key movements are: 
  Dividends totalling £113.6 million  
(2010: £102.5 million)
  £38.9 million of losses from the currency 
retranslation of overseas operations  
(2010: gain £17.6 million) offset by  
£2.4 million of gains recognised as the 
revaluation of associated hedge instruments 
(2010: loss £4.2 million) in accordance  
with hedge accounting rules of IAS 39 
“Financial instruments: Recognition  
and measurement”
  Pensions actuarial loss of £18.3 million 
(2010: gain of £5.9 million)
Intangibles have increased by £34.4 million  
to £218.9 million (2010: £184.5 million), 
following the acquisitions of JR Clare 
Underwriting Agencies Limited and Lead Yacht 
Underwriters Limited and capitalisation of 
costs associated with the ACI IT platform 
replacement programme.
As a result, net tangible assets have  
decreased by 22.3% from £1,545.4 million  
at 31 December 2010 to £1,201.5 million  
at 31 December 2011.

56 Outlook
Underwriting environment
The diversity of our business by class and 
platform means that trading conditions  
vary across the portfolio. Overall, however, 
we are seeing a more favourable rating 
environment than twelve months ago.  
At 1 January 2011 renewals, the overall 
Amlin portfolio saw a fall in rates of 1.3%  
and approximately 75% of the portfolio was 
experiencing pricing that was flat or falling. 
However, the trading environment improved 
markedly during the year, with an average 
rate increase of 3.3% from 1 July to  
31 December. In January 2012, with 
approximately 37% of the Group’s 2012 
business renewing, the renewal rate increase 
was 4.0%. This reflects further substantial 
rate increases on catastrophe reinsurance 
and continued momentum in UK fleet motor, 
but we are also seeing a modest uplift in 
other insurance lines. 
Rate increases for catastrophe reinsurance 
renewals in January, which accounts for 
approximately 49% of the catastrophe business 
expected to be written for the year, were  
up for Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda.  
US catastrophe rates were back to peak levels. 
Loss affected business witnessed substantial 
increases in rates. This trend is expected to 
continue for the 1 April Japanese renewals  
and peak rating levels are expected to be held 
into the US windstorm renewals in the middle 
of the year. 
The marine markets in London and on the 
Continent were stable at the start of the year. 
Some further increases are expected in the 
energy portfolio in 2012 and the recent Costa 
Concordia vessel loss is expected to exert 
upward pressure on marine rates. The ACI 
marine account was reduced modestly again  
at 1 January, with the retention ratio at 84%. 
The US property and casualty sector is starting 
to see a change in its rating environment,  
with large US insurers reporting price increases 
across sections of their business. In the 
London market, some rate correction was 
evident in the property market in the second 
half of 2011 and we expect to see this trend 
continued through 2012. 
In the UK, we continue to see an improving 
rating trend for fleet motor, with the withdrawal 
of capacity by some competitors creating 
opportunities to grow our market share 
significantly. UK property rates are also 
strengthening gradually, creating a more 
favourable environment to leverage the 
investments made to position Amlin UK  
to grow in this market. 
Amlin France and ACI continue to experience 
highly competitive property and casualty 
markets, although amid deteriorating results  
in the Continental European insurance sector 
there is some evidence of financial distress, 
which combined with lower investment returns 
may encourage a more realistic approach to 
pricing. The low interest rate environment is 
likely to have a more widespread impact on 
insurance pricing in most markets, particularly 
in casualty lines. 
Amlin Re Europe’s business proposition  
has been powerfully endorsed by clients  
and brokers and it continues to make good 
progress, with January 2012 premium of 
€163.6 million, up 32.3% on 2011. The 
business was able to broaden out its footprint 
with good support from brokers, an increased 
number of submissions and an expanded client 
base. The business has been underwritten in 
line with expected profitability targets.
In the past five years we have added to the 
quality and diversity of our core businesses 
through investment in niche acquisitions, 
start-ups in Singapore and Zurich and a 
significant increase in senior underwriters  
with the objective of broadening the range  
of growth opportunities for the Group.  
As well as already benefiting from higher  
rates on renewal business in 2012, we are 
better positioned than ever before to grow 
wherever the stronger pricing environment 
creates opportunities.
Capital and risk management
Amlin has emerged from the exceptional losses 
of 2011 with a strong balance sheet, excellent 
ratings and our franchise further enhanced  
by the excellent claims service we delivered  
to clients in the wake of the year’s multiple 
catastrophe events. 
Consequently Amlin is very well positioned  
to benefit from higher catastrophe margins  
as a market leader in catastrophe underwriting. 
However, every major loss event requires a 
reassessment of previous assumptions, and 
the severity of last year’s events, together  
with their unusual frequency, have naturally  
led to a careful review of our catastrophe  
risk appetite. Exposures on the international 
catastrophe account have been reviewed  
and cut where prices have not responded 
adequately to the events of 2011. However, 
through rate improvements and selective 
additions to exposures, January income for  
the London and Bermuda catastrophe 
reinsurance businesses is 10.8% higher than  
in 2011 at £209.8 million.
The structure of our reinsurance programmes 
for London and Bermuda has been revisited 
with a view to providing deeper reinsurance 
protection across the Group. The London 
programme worked well in 2011 and broadly 
the structure has been renewed, but with lower 
retentions for the first event. The Bermuda 
team have largely replicated that structure, 
which has provided much greater protection 
for 2012 than was previously the case.  
In addition, an insurance linked catastrophe 
bond of $150 million has been placed into  
the capital markets, which covers US perils  
and European windstorm events above  
a pre-set scale and in the aggregate. This 
provides greater protection against severity 
and frequency of catastrophe events. 
Reinsurance expenditure as a proportion  
of income is expected to increased to 15.3%.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011 Investment markets
Investment markets rallied in the fourth 
quarter of 2011 as action was taken in 
Continental Europe to address the Eurozone 
debt crisis. The possibility of policy error  
in the management of the crisis remains 
significant and has the ability to worry 
markets. However, confidence around the 
pace and sustainability of the US economic 
recovery appears to be growing and this, 
along with evidence of improving prospects 
for global growth, has seen a strong start  
to 2012 for our investment portfolios. 
We continue to believe that short dated  
‘safe haven’ government bond yields remain 
too low from a medium term perspective  
and we have continued to control our 
exposures to these assets. Higher yields  
and strong corporate balance sheets make 
non-government bonds more attractive  
and we retain our equity weighting, albeit  
at reduced levels from the first half of 2011.
However it is important to recognise that,  
with low interest rates in developed 
economies, our expectations for investment 
returns have been lowered compared to what 
we have seen in the past. 
Outlook continued
Summary
We expect that 2012 will bring a return  
to stronger profitability for the Group.  
Much of our business is seeing improved 
premium rating and we will naturally benefit 
if catastrophe activity returns to more normal 
levels. The underlying profitability of our 
London and Bermuda business is strong and 
with Amlin UK moving into a better trading 
environment, these divisions should see 
strong growth in 2012. Amlin Re Europe’s 
success in attracting new business, without 
compromising its profit targets, should also 
provide a better trend, as the underwriting 
profits will be better able to absorb its start 
up expenses. 
In our Continental European insurance 
businesses we also anticipate an improvement 
in performance, even without an improvement 
in the underlying trading environment. Amlin 
France was affected heavily on its modest 
income base by the international catastrophes 
of 2011 and in 2012 should revert to its 
underlying satisfactory trading position. With 
the action taken at ACI over the last two years 
to remove badly underwritten marine business, 
we expect that ACI will also achieve a better 
performance. Its non-marine businesses are 
performing satisfactorily and on much of its 
core marine account, while profitability is still 
not at acceptable levels, there is an evident 
improving trend. 
Investment markets are expected to remain 
challenging, but we expect that we should  
fare better in 2012 than last year. Amlin’s 
focus on underwriting profit should ensure  
that the lower interest rate environment is one 
where we can trade successfully. For insurers 
that have been reliant on investment return  
to generate profit it will not be as easy. 
With a strong capital position we expect  
to grow into improving market conditions  
when they emerge.

Board composition and independence 
At the date of this report the Board of Amlin plc 
(the Board or plc Board) comprised: the 
Chairman, who is non-executive, six independent 
non-executives, and four executive directors. 
Their biographical details are set out in this report 
( pp60). During the year Mr Anthony Holt 
retired as a director with effect from 12 May 
2011 and Mr Simon Beale and Sir Alan Collins 
were appointed on 12 May and 14 November 
2011, respectively.
All of the directors will be offering themselves  
for re-election, save for Sir Allan Collins who will 
be offering himself for election and Mr Taylor who 
will be retiring at the end of the AGM. 
The Chairman was independent on his 
appointment in 1998 but, as Chairman,  
is not classified as independent. Six of the  
other non-executive directors, who have tenure  
of between a few months and eight years,  
have been determined by the Board as being 
independent in character and judgement with  
no relationships or circumstances which are  
likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the 
director’s judgement.
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006,  
and as permitted by the Company’s Articles  
of Association, the Board has authorised a 
number of potential conflicts of interest regarding 
the independent directors. 
Mr Buchanan, the senior independent  
non-executive director, who retired as a partner  
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) in 2001, 
receives a pension annuity from that firm that  
can vary if PwC’s financial results do not meet  
a certain threshold. The Board believes that  
Amlin is not a material enough client to a firm  
of PwC’s size for this to affect whether such 
threshold is met. Therefore, following PwC’s 
appointment in 2009 as auditors, the Board 
authorised the potential conflict involved in  
Mr Buchanan continuing to serve as Audit 
Committee chairman, allowing him to be involved 
in all aspects of the Committee’s work, save that 
he would step aside from involvement in any 
financial dispute or litigation between the Group 
and PwC were it ever to arise. 
Within the last three years Mrs Bosse  
(until 31 January 2011) and Mr Feinstein (to date) 
were directors of overseas insurance companies 
which, like many insurers around the world, 
purchase reinsurance from the Amlin Group on 
normal commercial terms. These transactions are 
not material either to Amlin or, the Directors

believe, to the other company and in both  
cases the reinsurance relationship is independent 
of, and pre-dates, their Amlin directorships.  
The Board remains robustly of the view that such 
inter-company transactions are an inevitable 
consequence of engaging non-executive directors 
with relevant current insurance industry 
experience (which, in view of the specialist and 
complex nature of insurance written by Amlin,  
is highly beneficial to the Company) and that they 
did not, and do not, affect, and should not be 
regarded by an objective observer as affecting, 
the independence of the directors concerned  
in fulfilling their roles as non-executive directors 
of Amlin.
Regulated subsidiaries within a Group 
management framework 
During the year the organisational and 
governance arrangements of the Group have 
continued to evolve. 
Each of the Group’s business platforms  
comes under its own regulated board: Amlin 
Underwriting Limited (AUL) for the Group’s 
Lloyd’s operations (for Amlin London and Amlin 
UK); Amlin AG (AAG), domiciled in Zurich, 
Switzerland (for Amlin Re Europe and Amlin 
Bermuda); Amlin Corporate Insurance NV (ACI), 
operating in the Netherlands and Belgium; and 
Amlin France Holdings SAS (AF) for the Group’s 
French business. AF sources business for both 
the Lloyd’s syndicate and ACI. 
AUL’s executive governance is split between an 
Amlin London management committee and an 
Amlin UK management committee. They each 
hold quarterly review meetings with Group and 
AUL executives, in addition to AUL executive 
directors reporting to the AUL Board. AAG,  
the other subsidiary containing two business 
platforms, is run by a unitary board but with 
underwriting and other management decisions 
delegated to the local teams in each location. 
In parallel with the corporate structure, there  
are management accountabilities of particular 
functions, for example finance, operations and 
risk management, which help embed Group 
standards and seek to ensure that there is good 
two way communication between functional 
management at the centre and each local  
entity. The relationship between the corporate 
and management structures is illustrated  
in the ‘Corporate and management structure’ 
chart below.
Separate entity management with a 
strong Group governance input
Each regulated subsidiary has its own executive 
management separate from that of the Group, 
with Group executives including the Chief 
Executive (Mr Philipps), Finance Director  
(Mr Hextall), Chief Risk Officer (Mr Illingworth) 
and/or International Development Director  
(Mr Harris) sitting as non-executives on subsidiary 
boards along with the relevant business’s 
executive management either on the board  
or on a management board. 
One of the main ways in which the Company 
ensures that there is sufficient Group influence 
and control within this delegated structure  
is through overlapping board memberships  
(the year end position is illustrated in the  
‘Board memberships’ chart overleaf). 
In the UK the Chairman and, at present, two 
other non-executive directors of the Company 
also serve as non-executives on the AUL Board in 
addition to the Group Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director. The latter perform “internal 
non-executive” roles within AUL, which is 
managed by its own Managing Director, Finance 
Director and the Underwriting Directors of Amlin 
London and Amlin UK. Mr Illingworth, a director 
of AUL and other subsidiaries, is Chief Risk 
Officer at both Group and AUL levels.
The AAG board has four executive directors  
from its own businesses (two from Amlin Zurich 
and two from Amlin Bermuda) and, at the year 
end, its non-executives were two members of the 
Amlin plc Board, Messrs Hextall and Philipps, as 
well as one independent non-executive director 
and one Group executive director. ACI has a two 
tier board structure comprising a Supervisory 
Board made up of two independent directors  
and three Group executives and a Management 
Board (whose members usually attend 
Supervisory Board meetings) presently of eight 
ACI executives. AF’s board comprises two Group 
executives, one executive from each of the Group 
entities to which it provides business (AUL for the 
Lloyd’s syndicate and ACI) and three Amlin 
France executives. 
In terms of plc Board reporting, key indicator 
reports on each business unit are made to the plc 
Board in addition to consolidated reports at a 
Group level, enabling the Board to concentrate 
on its key strategic and control roles. 
Presentations are also made to the Board 
periodically by each business unit.
Board Committee structures
As the plc Board has overall responsibility  
to shareholders and other stakeholders for the 
Group’s operations, it is necessary not only for 
the plc Board to direct the overall strategy, 
values and standards for the Group but for its

Board Committees to be able effectively  
to oversee the aspects of the whole Group 
relevant to their responsibilities. As with board 
governance, the distinction between Group  
and subsidiary responsibilities is reflected  
in committee structures. 
The plc Audit Committee leads the process  
of review and makes recommendations to the 
Board regarding; external auditors, financial 
reporting, internal control and internal audit, 
and regulatory and compliance matters. The 
process is designed to ensure that significant 
risks in these areas are identified, evaluated, 
managed and controlled. AUL and ACI each 
have their own Audit Committees, which make 
reports to the plc Audit Committee as well  
as to their respective boards. 
In January 2011 a separate Board level  
Risk & Solvency Committee was established, 
taking over some of the Audit Committee’s 
responsibilities. It led the process of reviewing 
risk and made recommendations to the Board  
on risk management, risk appetite, solvency, 
economic and regulatory capital matters. Both 
Group and major subsidiaries have executive risk 
committees which provide reports to the plc Risk 
& Solvency Committee.
The Nomination Committee reviews succession 
planning for key roles within the whole Group, 
reporting the conclusions of its reviews to the 
Board and, when appropriate, to relevant 
subsidiary boards. 
The Remuneration Committee reports to the 
Board the conclusions of its reviews and makes 
recommendations on matters within the control 
of regulated subsidiaries to such subsidiaries’ 
boards and/or remuneration committees. 
This committee structure is illustrated in the 
chart ( pp65).
Each Committee is supported by the Company 
Secretary (Mark Stevens, who succeeded Charles 
Pender, now Group Director of Corporate Affairs, 
with effect from 1 January 2012) or a member  
of his team.
Executive, as well as Board, corporate 
governance
Amlin regards Board level corporate governance 
as only the most visible aspect of a review  
and decision-making structure that goes much 
deeper. It remains the philosophy of the Group 
that key decisions and processes, including purely 
executive ones, take place within an objective 
governance framework, whether they be at 
Group, subsidiary or divisional level. 
The Executive Committee (Exco), presently 
consisting of the Group Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director, Group HR Director, Chief 
Operations Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Group  
Head of Underwriting and International 
Development Director is responsible, through  
the Chief Executive and directly, to the plc Board. 
Its members also join the Board for its annual 
planning and strategy session where the Group 
strategy is determined or refined. The heads of 
each business area and each area’s chief financial, 
operations and risk officers report both to  
the relevant member of the Exco and to their 
operational boards and management committees. 
In addition to the Exco, a Group Management 
Committee (GMC), including representatives from 
each of the main business divisions, meets ten  
to twelve times a year, assisting the Group Chief 
Executive and acting as a forum for resolving 
management and strategic issues. 
The business functions themselves are all 
described in more detail in the Review section of 
the Annual Report. Summaries of the governance 
arrangements for some key functions now follow. 
Reserving
Responsibility for reserving is that of the 
regulated boards and, at Group consolidated 
level, the plc Board but it is important that the 
process through which executive management 
reach their reserving decisions is objective and 
robust. This role is performed by their respective 
quarterly review or board meetings, which review 
and finalise the preliminary reserving conclusions 
for their businesses. Reserving is reported  
at subsidiary board level each quarter and, 
twice-yearly, to the plc Audit Committee. 
Quarterly review meetings receive actuarial 
assessments from the Group Risk Assessment & 
Monitoring department reviewing the consistency 
and prudence of the key reserving judgements.

Risk management
In 2011 the plc Risk & Solvency Committee took 
over specific responsibilities for risk from the plc 
Audit Committee. A dedicated Group Risk 
Assessment and Monitoring Department (RAM) 
oversees the management of risk to ensure  
that each operating entity manages its risk in 
accordance with Group policies and allocated  
risk tolerances, as well as the Chief Risk Officer 
reporting to the Board and its relevant 
committee. Reports from RAM are reviewed  
and appropriate executive actions considered by 
a Group Executive Risk Committee. In addition, 
each regulated entity’s board is responsible  
for the entity’s risk, supported by executive  
risk committees or other executive reporting 
arrangements. Further details of the Group’s risk 
management, and its development during the 
year, are set out earlier in this report ( pp44).
Investments
The setting and execution of the Group’s 
investment strategy has its own hierarchy  
of responsibilities. The relevant boards are 
responsible for setting their Investment 
Frameworks that control the practices and 
procedures governing: the setting of investment 
policy, the management of investment risk and 
the management of the investment operations. 
Within this framework the boards set their own 
investment risk appetites within the overall  
Group investment appetite. 
The day-to-day responsibility for investment 
management is delegated to Group Investments, 
headed by Jayne Styles, the Chief Investment 
Officer (CIO). The CIO is a member of the 
Investment Management Executive (IME), 
together with the Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director. The IME sets the strategic asset 
allocation (SAA) and tactical asset allocation  
(TAA) ranges. Group Investments is responsible 
for TAA, which is implemented on a multi-asset, 
multi-manager basis. The IME is assisted  
in its decision making and recommendations  
to the boards by an Investment Advisory  
Panel consisting of the members of the  
IME plus three external investment experts. 
Investment management itself is outsourced  
to external managers. 
Board and Committee meetings  
and attendance
The plc Board held six regular Board meetings  
in 2011 (2010: six) and one two-day planning  
and strategy session (2010: one). No additional 
special Board meetings were necessary in 2011 
(2010: nil). The subsidiary operating boards met 
quarterly. The attendance of each director at plc 
Board meetings (out of seven possible meetings, 
including the planning and strategy session) are 
shown below.   66
The committee attendances of those directors 
who were members of any of the principal board 
committees for all, or any part of, the year are 
shown in the same table.
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
The Board is committed to the highest standards 
of good corporate governance. It follows an 
approach that complies with principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). 
The Board has considered the extent to which  
the Company satisfies the Code and the actions 
that may be taken to comply fully:
  The Board is satisfied as to the balance  
of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Company possessed by the 
directors, and of their diversity, to satisfy the 
Code. More details can be found later in this 
report ( pp68) and in the Nomination 
Committee Report ( pp72).
  Director appointments are made on merit, 
against objective criteria and with due regard 
to diversity on the Board, to ensure a 
satisfactory balance amongst directors;
  The Board is mindful of the Code’s 
requirement for the annual evaluation to be 
externally facilitated at least every three years 
and is in the process of conducting such 
evaluation during 2012;
  In accordance with the Code’s requirement for 
the annual re-election of FTSE 350 companies’ 
directors, all of the Company’s directors 
nominated and wishing to continue will offer 
themselves for re-election each year. While  
it is not proposed to change the Company’s 
Articles, non-executive directors’ appointment 
letters were re-issued in 2011 to take account 
of the new Code including annual re-election.
This report, the following Committee reports  
( pp72-75), the Directors’ Remuneration report  
( pp80), and Annex 1 to this report ( pp67) 
together describe how the Company applied the 
Principles of the Code during the year. Annex 2  
to this report ( pp71) summarises certain 
governance-related aspects of the Company’s 
Articles of Association (Articles) 
Board internal control statement 
The Board recognises its responsibility for the 
Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems and has complied with Principle C.2  
of the Code by establishing a continuous process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks the Group faces. This process  
has been in place from the start of 2011 to the date 
of approval of this report and includes risks arising 
from social, environmental and ethical matters. 
The Board is responsible for reviewing the 
effectiveness of established systems of internal 
control. Directors are aware that any such system 
is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement  
or financial loss. 
The effectiveness of the Group’s system of risk 
management and internal control is reviewed 
regularly on behalf of the Board by the Risk  
& Solvency Committee (on risk management 
matters) and by the Audit Committee (on 
financial, regulatory and compliance matters) 
Monitoring covers all controls, including those  
in operation for financial, operational and 
compliance controls and for risk management 
processes. Where significant control failings or 
weaknesses have been identified, we can confirm 
that necessary actions have been or are being 
taken to remedy these. The Risk & Solvency and, 
where appropriate, the Audit Committee have 
received regular reports from management to 
assist with this process.
Control framework
The Group has put in place a management 
structure with defined lines of responsibility  
and clear delegation of authority. A framework  
of Group policies and standards has been 
established with which each business is expected 
to comply. Each business or functional unit has 
clear responsibilities for ensuring that appropriate 
controls are in place at an operational level, 
including those in respect of financial reporting 
processes. Key elements of the overall control 
environment are the various executive 
governance bodies discussed earlier in this Board 
Corporate Governance statement. These bodies 
receive oral and written reports from Amlin’s 
businesses and support departments. Additional 
key control elements are the subsidiary boards 
(including where applicable their Audit and/or 
Risk Committees) and review committees. These 
boards and review committees are responsible 
for the day-to-day operations of Amlin’s individual 
subsidiaries or business units, including relevant 
aspects of internal control.
Business planning
The Group has developed a formal structured 
business planning process which operates for  
all business elements. This operates on an annual 
cycle with proposed plans being presented to  
and agreed by relevant subsidiary boards prior  
to being consolidated and approved by the plc 
Board. Board reporting operates on a quarterly 
basis, with monthly monitoring at management 
level. The Group’s financial performance 
monitoring includes detailed reporting against 
budgets and the preparation of longer-term 
projections.
Risk assessment
Amlin’s Risk Assessment process includes 
output from a system for reporting on all the 
significant identified risks to the achievement  
of Group objectives and on the nature and 
effectiveness of the controls and other 
management processes to manage these risks. 
Risk appetites are set for key risk categories  
for example catastrophe, reserving, investment 
and operational risk. The system encompasses 
self assessment of controls by risk owners 
throughout the business coupled with 
independent challenge of these assertions  
by the Group Risk team. Significant risks,  
their potential impact on the Group’s financial 
position, any variations from the agreed risk 
appetites, and the actions taken to manage 
those risks, are reviewed regularly by the  
Group Executive Risk Committee and by  
the Risk & Solvency Committee.
Amlin has developed a Group Internal Model 
which captures the key economic and risk factors 
that could impact the performance of the Group. 
The process to collate and report information 
from the internal model and consolidate this into 
an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)  
is developing well. Both the Risk & Solvency 
Committee and the Board review the ORSA on a 
quarterly basis and use it to assist with business 
planning and management. 
Internal audit and compliance
Internal audit and compliance monitoring work  
is carried out by the Group’s Internal Audit and 
Risk Assessment & Monitoring departments.  
The latter also provides compliance advice. The 
heads of both departments report to the Group 
Chief Executive, and to the Audit and Risk & 
Solvency Committees. The Group has established 
risk based audit and compliance programmes for 
reviewing and evaluating the internal controls and 
compliance procedures used in the management 
of risk. 
Assessment
The plc Board receives regular reports from both 
the Audit Committee and the Risk & Solvency 
Committee, which review the main processes 
established by the Group, including the matters 
which are the regulatory responsibility of the 
boards of AUL, ACI, AF and AAG and the risk 
management framework within which these 
operate. These processes are designed to ensure

Principles of the Code Commentary
A. Leadership
A.1 The Role of the Board 
“an effective board…collectively 
responsible for the success  
of the company”
The schedule of matters reserved to the Board for its own and its committees’ decisions provides that the 
Board’s primary obligation is to lead and control the Company and its business, with exclusive decision making 
powers over such matters as: overall strategy and resources; risk appetite; investment strategy; remuneration 
policies; accounting policies; capital expenditure, acquisitions and debt facilities over certain thresholds; and 
certain key Group policies, appointments and categories of public announcements. The detailed implementation 
of all these matters, and day-to-day business, are left to management, which reports formally to the Board  
at least quarterly on underwriting, financial, risk and other operational matters and objectives. The current 
schedule of matters reserved to the Board is available in the ‘Corporate Governance’ section of ‘Investor 
Relations’ on the Company’s website. 
The Board meets regularly as demonstrated in the ‘Board and Committee meetings and attendance’ section 
and table ( pp65). The non-executive directors met during the year without executive directors or other 
executive management present, including at least once without the Chairman. The Chairman chairs full 
non-executive directors meetings and the senior independent director chairs meetings when the Chairman  
is not present.
The data sheet at the back of the annual report identifies the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive,  
Senior Independent Director, and the Chairman and members of the Board Committees.
Amlin arranges appropriate directors and officers insurance in respect of legal action against any of its directors.
A.2 Division of Responsibilities 
“clear division of responsibilities”
There is a division of responsibilities on the Board between the Chairman, who is responsible for leading and 
running the Board and related matters such as Board induction and evaluation, and the Group Chief Executive, 
who has executive responsibility for running the Group’s business. 
A statement detailing this division of responsibilities has been approved by the Board, which includes provisions 
for the Chairman’s role in ensuring accountability of the Chief Executive to him and to the Board, in shareholder 
relations and in ensuring constructive relations between executive and non-executive directors.
A.3 The Chairman 
“responsible for leadership  
of the Board and ensuring  
its effectiveness”
The Chairman actively promotes a culture of openness and debate within the Boardroom and helps to build 
relationships between executive and non-executive directors.
All agendas for Board or Committee meetings are approved by the relevant Chairman before circulation. 
that significant risks are identified, evaluated, 
managed and controlled. They also permit the 
relevant Committee to determine whether any 
significant weaknesses are promptly remedied  
or indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. 
The Audit Committee and the Risk & Solvency 
Committee met jointly to perform a specific 
assessment for the purpose of this Annual 
Report. This assessment considers all significant 
aspects of internal control arising during the 
period covered by the report, including the  
work of internal audit, and the findings are used 
to assist the Board in discharging its review 
responsibilities. The Board has received regular 
reports during the year on operational issues 
from the Group’s major subsidiaries. At ACI,  
the programme of finance and risk management 
process changes is on track, however 
information technology changes have not 
advanced as well as was anticipated. Following 
on from the control improvements made in 
2010, further good progress has been made  
in 2011 to strengthen ACI’s Key Controls. This 
work is ongoing but to date, the internal control 
environment at ACI is not yet considered to meet 
the high standards to which the Group aspires. 
The Audit Committee has additionally reviewed 
and is satisfied with the Group policy whereby 
arrangements are made for staff, in confidence 
and if they wish via an external reporting line,  
to raise concerns about possible improprieties  
in matters of financial reporting or other matters. 
The Committee is satisfied with such 
arrangements for the longer standing parts  
of the business and is assured that appropriate 
arrangements are being made in certain of the 
Continental European jurisdictions where such 
arrangements are not yet fully in place.

A.4 Non-Executive Directors 
“should constructively challenge 
and help develop proposals  
on strategy”.
Mr Buchanan is the Senior Independent Director designated as an appropriate director to whom shareholders’ 
concerns may be conveyed if contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance 
Director has failed to resolve them or is inappropriate.
The Chairman holds regular meetings with the other independent non-executive directors without the  
executive directors present. There is usually an annual meeting where the Chairman is not present, chaired  
by Mr Buchanan, to assess the Chairman’s performance. As the Chairman had given an indication that he 
wished to retire at the AGM in 2012 this meeting did not take place in respect of 2011.
All meetings are recorded in the Company’s minute book. Minutes are sent for review by the Board ahead  
of the next meeting where executives and independent non-executives can ensure that their concerns regarding 
the running of the Company or a proposed action that they discussed within the meeting have been minuted 
appropriately. If the non-executive resigns and an issue has still not been resolved, the non-executive is required 
to submit a written statement to the Chairman, for circulation to the Board. 
As detailed in here and by the table in the section ‘Board and Committee meetings and attendance’, there is a 
Remuneration Committee comprising two non-executives and the Senior Independent Director, which meets to 
determine the appropriate levels of remuneration for executive directors. There is also a Nomination Committee, 
comprising the Chairman, Senior Independent Director, two non-executives and the Chief Executive, which meets 
to discuss succession planning, appointments, and if necessary, removing executives.
B. Effectiveness
B.1 The Composition of the 
Board “should have the 
appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and 
knowledge of the company” 
As detailed in here, the Board has identified which non-executive directors it considers to be independent.  
None of the non-executive directors as at 31 December 2011 have been an employee of the Company or Group 
within the last 5 years. Neither have they had a material relationship with the Company or received additional 
remuneration from the Company. No non-executives have close family ties with Company’s advisers, directors 
or senior employees, they do not hold cross directorships or have significant links with other directors through 
involvement in other companies, and they do not represent a significant shareholder. Save for the Chairman,  
no non-executive has served on the Board for more nine years from the date of their first election.
More than half of the Board of the Company is comprised of independent non-executive directors. This ensures 
strong independent representation and the sharing of committee work. The Nomination, Audit, Risk & Solvency 
and Remuneration Committees are regularly attended by executive directors and senior management at the 
invitation of the respective Committee Chairmen. Non-executive directors who are not Committee members 
may also attend these Committee meetings if they so desire or at the request of the Chairman.
B.2. Appointments to the  
Board “formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors  
to the Board.”
The process for nomination to the Board and for considering succession planning is decided by the Nomination 
Committee to ensure that the appropriate balance of skills and experience is maintained; and to promote 
progressive refreshing of the Board. Its role and authority is set out in the terms of reference for the Committee 
and in the Nomination Committee Report ( pp72).
When preparing a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment, the Committee 
evaluates the current balance of the skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Board. The search 
for Board candidates is then conducted, against objective criteria and appointments made, on merit, with due 
regard to the benefits of board diversity.
All directors are subject to annual re-election and all non-executives save the Chairman, Messrs Buchanan, 
Davey and Sir Mark Wrightson have been appointed for less than six years. Following rigorous review, it was 
decided that, in view of the specialist and complex nature of insurance conducted by Amlin and the years  
of experience that these non-executives have, it would be viewed as being highly beneficial to the Company  
to extend their tenure and to allow them to continue in their roles as non-executive directors and in the case  
of Mr Davey as Chairman following the AGM.
B.3 Commitment “should be 
able to allocate sufficient time  
to the company to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively.”
The Board continues to satisfy itself that the Chairman had sufficient time available to devote to his duties  
as non-executive Chairman of the Company (and of AUL). 
The letters of appointment of the Chairman and the other non-executive directors, which are available  
for inspection at the Company’s registered office, set out the following expected minimum annual time 
commitments to the Company and AUL:
  Chairman of the Company (also of AUL): 75 days
  Senior Independent Director, including chairing Audit Committee (Mr Buchanan): 30 days
  Chairmen of Remuneration Committee and Risk & Solvency Committee (Sir Mark Wrightson and Mr Davey 
respectively): 25 days
  Member of both Audit and Risk & Solvency Committees (Sir Allan Collins): 25 days
  Member of Remuneration Committee (Mrs Bosse): 20 days.
The Board has determined that no executive should take on more than one non-executive directorship  
of a FTSE100 company nor be elected as chairman of such company.

B.4 Development “All directors 
should receive induction on 
joining the Board and should 
regularly update and refresh 
their skills and knowledge”
The Company maintains a model director induction programme which was operated during the year for both 
Mr Beale and Sir Alan Collins. Non-executives are given the opportunity to attend meetings with the major 
shareholders at shareholders request; and all directors are given the advantage of meeting shareholders  
at the Company’s AGM.
The Company encourages and facilitates other professional development for both executive and non-executive 
directors as is required for their particular roles. Annual reviews take place between the Chairman and 
non-executive directors to assess their individual development needs. Regular Board update sessions are held 
to provide directors with industry specific briefings and developments within the business and in legal and 
regulatory matters.
B.5 Information and  
Support “Board should be 
supplied in a timely manner  
with information in a form  
and of quality appropriate to 
enable it to discharge its duties”
Procedures are in place for directors and Board Committees collectively to take independent professional 
advice, when necessary, at the Company’s expense.
The Board and its committees are supported by the Company Secretary and his team who, under the direction 
of the Chairman, advise the Board on governance matters and help to ensure good communication and 
information flows within the Board, including between executive and non-executive directors and between the 
Board and its Committees. The Secretary also facilitates the Board updating and induction work outlined above. 
Subsidiary Boards and executive level committees are also serviced, attended and minuted by the Secretary  
or another member of his team. 
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with the appropriate information to enable it to discharge its duties, 
including providing constructive challenge to, and scrutiny of, management. Further information is obtained  
by the Board from the executive directors and other senior executives as appropriate. All directors are provided 
with written materials on their responsibilities as directors of a public company and on other relevant regulatory, 
legal, accounting and insurance industry matters. Updating information on technical and/or industry matters  
is provided to the Board with opportunities for discussion.
Amlin has a policy to deliver Board papers to each director at least five working days prior to the meeting, 
where possible. This ensures that each director is given adequate time to digest the information prior to the 
Board meeting.
B.6 Evaluation “formal and 
rigorous annual evaluation  
of its own performance  
and of its committees and 
individual directors”
The Board has completed an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and each 
director. The annual evaluations were initiated by a questionnaire completed by each director giving his 
assessment of both collective and individual performances. The results of the latest internal Board evaluation 
were summarised by the Chairman at its meeting in early 2012 and the Board agreed its conclusions.  
Each Board Committee had its performance evaluated and the conclusions were also reported to the Board  
in early 2012. 
The Chairman discussed issues arising from the evaluation of each individual director, including  
the performances of executive directors in respect of their boardroom as opposed to executive roles  
(which was evaluated as part of the Group’s regular Performance Development Review process), with the 
director concerned as required. The Chief Executive’s total performance was reviewed by the Chairman.
The Chairman’s own evaluation is usually conducted by the non-executive directors led by the senior 
independent director, taking into account the views of the executive directors. The senior independent director 
normally discusses and agrees the conclusions with the Chairman.
B.7 Re-election “All directors 
should be submitted  
for re-election at regular  
intervals subject to continued 
satisfactory performance”
All directors of the Company will be subject to re-election at the Company’s AGM on the 17 May 2012,  
save for Sir Alan Collins who will be offering himself for election and the Chairman who will be retiring at the 
conclusion of the meeting. Details of the procedures whereby appointments and re-appointments to the Board 
are considered are set out in the Nomination Committee report ( pp72). Board and individual directors’ 
evaluations are taken into account by that committee when considering specifications for new non-executive 
directors, succession planning and nominations for re-election at AGMs. Further details of the terms of 
appointment of both the non-executive and executive directors are also set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
report. Biographical details to that effect will be circulated to shareholders on the AGM notice.
C. Accountability
C.1 Financial and Business 
Reporting “Board should present 
a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s 
positions and prospects”
The Board is aware of its responsibility for preparing the annual report as detailed ( pp96) and the 
requirement to confirm the disclosure of information to the auditors’ in preparing this report. The independent 
auditors’ report on page 97 comments on the respective responsibilities of directors and auditors.
The Board has given an explanation on how the Company generates value over the long term within the 
business model ( pp16) and strategy for delivering the objectives of the Company.
The Board has concluded that the business remains a going concern, as discussed further ( pp95). 70

C.2 Risk Management & Internal 
Control “Board is responsible  
for determining the nature  
and significant risks it is willing 
to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives…maintain sound risk 
management and internal 
control systems.”
The Board’s Risk & Solvency and Audit Committees meet on a quarterly basis to review, inter alia, risk 
management and internal controls. Their findings are discussed in the Risk & Solvency Committee report  
( pp76) and in the Audit Committee report ( pp74). These Committees cover all material controls including 
financial, operational and compliance controls.
C.3 Audit Committee and 
Auditors “establish formal and 
transparent arrangements….
apply corporate reporting and 
risk management and internal 
control principles and for 
maintaining an appropriate 
relationship with the  
company’s auditor”
The Board has established an Audit Committee of three non-executives with Mr Buchanan, who has 
considerable financial experience, acting as its Chairman.
The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee as set out in its terms of reference are described  
in the Audit Committee report ( pp74). One of the main functions is to monitor and review the effectiveness  
of internal audit activities. The Committee also has primary responsibility for making recommendations on the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of the Company’s external auditor.
The Audit Committee has reviewed arrangements by which staff of the Company may, in confidence raise 
concerns about financial reporting or other matters. The Committee has nominated Mr Buchanan as an 
appropriate director to whom concerns may be conveyed.
The Committee and Board have remained satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by Pricewaterhouse 
Coopers LLP (PwC) has not compromised PwC’s independence, as is explained further in the Audit Committee 
report ( pp74).
D. Remuneration
D.1 The Level and Components  
of Remuneration “should be 
sufficient to attract, retain  
and motivate directors of the 
quality required to run the 
company successfully, but  
a company should avoid paying 
more than is necessary for  
this purpose. A significant 
proportion of executive  
directors’ remuneration should  
be structured so as to link 
rewards to corporate and 
individual performance.”
The Remuneration Committee ensure that performance-related remuneration for executive directors is  
in accordance with principle A of the Code, which is discussed in detail in the Directors’ remuneration report  
( pp80).
The levels of remuneration of non-executives are based on the minimum time commitments given by each 
director and are set by reference to fees paid by financial services companies and listed companies of a similar 
size. Remuneration for non-executives does not include share options or performance related elements as 
stated in the Directors’ remuneration report ( pp80).
Executive directors have a maximum of 12 months notice period. In the event of early termination, the Group 
will seek to reduce, where practicable, the compensation payable by taking account of the duty of the employee 
to mitigate his or her loss, as explained in the Directors’ remuneration report ( pp80).
D.2 Procedure “formal and 
transparent procedure for 
developing policy on executive 
remuneration and for fixing the 
remuneration packages of 
individual directors. No director 
should be involved in deciding 
his or her own remuneration.”
The Remuneration Committee is formed of three of the Company’s independent non-executive directors.  
Its terms of reference, role and responsibilities are described in the Directors’ remuneration report ( pp80).
The Committee is responsible for setting remuneration for all executive directors and the Chairman, inclusive  
of pension rights and any compensation payments. It also makes recommendations and monitors the level and 
structure of senior management remuneration. The Board itself sets the remuneration of the non-executives.
If the Company wished to instigate a new long-term incentive scheme, shareholder approval would be sought 
before implementation. 
E. Relations with Shareholders
E.1 Dialogue with Shareholders 
“should be a dialogue with 
shareholders based on the 
mutual understanding of 
objectives. The board as a whole 
has responsibility for ensuring 
that a satisfactorily dialogue  
with shareholders takes place”.
The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and non-executive directors attend meetings with major 
shareholders, at the shareholders request. In these meetings the Chairman takes the opportunity to discuss 
governance and strategy with shareholders and then ensures that any particular views that the shareholder  
may have are communicated to the Board as a whole.
The Board is given the opportunity to understand the views of major shareholders of the Company, through 
analyst reports, broker briefings and surveys of shareholder opinion.

E.2 Constructive Use of the  
AGM “to communicate with 
investors and to encourage  
their participation”
The opportunity is taken at each AGM for the Chief Executive to make a presentation on the Group’s progress. 
Shareholders are encouraged to ask questions at this time. 
All items seeking shareholder approval are proposed under separate resolutions. Voting on resolutions is 
undertaken by a show of hands except in the event of a close result as indicated by the proxies held by the 
Chairman of the meeting. In these circumstances the Chairman would call a poll. The Board believes the 
immediacy of voting on a show of hands with the proxy votes immediately being announced to the meeting  
is appreciated by the shareholders attending the meeting. 
For each resolution, proxy appointment forms will be provided to the shareholders with the option to direct their 
proxies to either vote for, against or to abstain from voting. 
The Company has instructed its registrars, Computershare Investor Services Plc, to ensure that all valid proxy 
appointments are properly recorded and counted; and electronic proxy voting is made available. Following  
the meeting the Company will make available on the Company’s website, as soon as reasonably practical;  
the number of shares over which proxies have been validly appointed, the number of votes for each resolution, 
the number of votes against each resolution, and the number of shares which have been withheld from voting. 
The proxy form and announcement of the results explicitly state that a vote withheld is not a vote in law and will 
not be counted in the calculation when deciding whether the resolution has passed.
It is anticipated that all directors will be attending the AGM and that the Audit, Nomination, Remuneration and 
Risk & Solvency Committee Chairmen will be available to answer questions.
The Notice for the AGM will be sent to shareholders in advance of the 20 working days stipulated in the Code.
Annex 2 to Board Corporate Governance statement: Summary of Director and shareholder governance provisions in the  
Articles of Association
Area of section 1 of the Code Commentary
Directors
Appointments to the Board The Company’s Articles set out clear powers of removal, appointment, election and re-election of directors.  
A director may be removed either by a unanimous resolution of fellow directors or by an ordinary resolution  
of the Company in general meeting. As regards appointments, the Board may appoint additional directors  
at any time but such appointees must, if they wish to continue, be elected by shareholders by an ordinary 
resolution at the AGM following their appointment. Directors may also be appointed by election at the AGM.  
The Articles also provide that no term of office may exceed the period between election or re-election by 
shareholders and the AGM in the third year following such election or re-election. Although the Board complies 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code annual re-election provision for FTSE 350 companies, it is not 
intended to amend the Articles in this respect. 
Re-election to the Board The Articles of Association of the Company provide that, following a director’s election by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting immediately following his or her initial appointment by the Board, each director’s term 
of office before being required to submit himself or herself to shareholders for re-election is three years. This 
term has historically been shortened to one year for any non-executive director who has served on the Board  
for nine years or more. As referred to above, it is intended that all directors will generally submit themselves  
for re-election annually.
Relations with shareholders
Procedure at Annual  
General Meeting
Voting at the Annual General Meeting is conducted on a show of hands unless a poll is called for (which the 
Chairman himself would do if the proxies he held indicated any sort of close result). Advance voting on a poll is 
not offered. However, shareholders’ proxy votes can be submitted electronically through the CREST settlement 
system and the Company’s Registrar’s website and a proxy may cast his vote on a show of hands or on a poll  
in different ways in respect of different blocks of shares within the same holding. 72
“ The Nomination Committee seeks to ensure that the Board, its 
committees, and those filling other leadership positions, have the 
right balance of experience and qualities to deliver the strategic 
leadership, values, management and framework of controls required 
for the Group’s success.”
 Roger Taylor, Chairman
Nomination Committee report
Terms of reference
The Nomination Committee (the Committee)  
is responsible for assisting the Board in its 
oversight of succession planning both at Director 
level and for key executives throughout the 
Group. This includes the identification and 
nomination, for the approval of the Board,  
of all candidates for Board appointment and for 
proposed election or re-election to the Board.
When reviewing succession planning the 
Committee’s terms of reference require  
it to give full consideration to the challenges 
and opportunities facing the Group and what 
skills and expertise are needed in the future. 
Following the publication of the Davies Report 
the Committee, with Board approval, reviewed 
and amended its terms of reference to state 
explicitly the current practice of considering 
diversity, including diversity of experience and 
gender, when reviewing succession planning. 
The Board has also agreed a statement on 
diversity which can be found in the ‘Corporate 
Governance’ section of ‘Investor Relations’  
on the Company’s website.
The Committee’s terms of reference also require 
the Committee to keep under review the 
leadership needs of the organisation, both 
executive and non-executive, with a view to 
ensuring the continued ability of the organisation 
to compete effectively in the marketplace.
The re-nomination of directors to the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) is considered  
on a case by case basis before recommendations 
are made. The Committee also recommends  
to the Board the appointment of, and changes  
to, membership of the Board’s main Committees. 
No director may participate in any decision 
regarding his or her own position. The 
Committee’s terms of reference are available in 
the ‘Corporate Governance’ section of ‘Investor 
Relations’ on the Company’s website.
Membership, meetings and attendance
The Committee’s membership, number of 
meetings and attendance during the year are set 
out in the ‘Board and Committee meetings and 
attendance’ section of the Board’s Corporate 
Governance statement ( pp62). 
The Committee received and considered detailed 
papers and information sufficiently in advance  
of its meetings for its members to consider them 
appropriately, making suggestions for 
improvements when required.
Activities
The main activities of the Committee may  
be split into three key areas; the review and 
composition of the board; the recruitment  
of an additional independent non-executive 
director; and the succession planning of key 
executives and for the Chairman. 
The review and composition of the 
Board
After the annual internal review of the general 
size, structure and composition of the Board 
conducted in 2010, the Committee concluded 
that, although this was still appropriate, the  
Board would benefit from the recruitment  
of an additional independent non-executive 
director as detailed below. Following the 
recruitment of Sir Alan Collins in 2011, a further 
review was undertaken which has concluded  
that the Board balance and the composition  
of each main Board Committee, now increased  
in number by the Risk & Solvency Committee, 
remains appropriate. 
In reviewing the non-executive membership of 
the Board (illustrated  pp62), the Committee 
noted that the seven non-executive members  
of the Board demonstrate an appropriate  
mix of insurance and other financial sector 
knowledge to enable the non-executives 
collectively to fulfil their role of challenge and 
oversight. All the non-executive directors, save for 
Messrs Buchanan, Davey and Sir Mark Wrightson, 
have served as non-executives for six or fewer 
years. The Nominations Committee and the 
Board, following rigorous review, decided that,  
in view of the specialist and complex nature  
of insurance written by Amlin and the years  
Leadership and Succession
of experience that these non-executives have,  
it would be highly beneficial to the Company to 
extend their tenure and to allow them to continue 
in their roles as non-executive directors. 
In reviewing the executive membership of the 
Board the Committee concluded that the skills 
and experience executive directors bring to the 
Board are complementary to each other. 
Following a recommendation from the Committee 
earlier in 2011 Mr Simon Beale, the Underwriting 
Director of Amlin London, was appointed as an 
additional executive director at the 2011 AGM.
There is also regular, formal and direct reporting 
to the Board by other senior Group executives, 
most frequently in 2011 from the Chief Risk 
Officer (Mr Illingworth) and the Chief Investment 
Officer (Mrs Styles). 
The recruitment of an additional 
independent non-executive director
During 2010 the Committee concluded that an 
additional independent non-executive director 
should be recruited in 2011 to share in the 
increasing Committee work following the 
constitution of the Risk & Solvency Committee.
Accordingly, in late 2010, the Committee 
approved an appropriate specification, based 
upon its review of the general structure, size, 
composition and diversity of experience of the 
Board and appointed external search consultants 
to assist in the recruitment process. This process 
culminated in the recruitment of Sir Alan Collins 
in September 2011. The Board believes that 
Sir Alan Collins brings valuable experience and 
skills to the Board which will add to its diversity. 
Given Sir Alan’s public sector background and 
experience in international trade, the Board 
believes he will assist in developing the Group’s 
international profile. His biographical details  
may be found earlier in this report ( pp60). 
Succession Planning
During the year the Chairman indicated that  
he may wish to retire at the AGM in 2012. 
Succession plans to cover this eventuality,   Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
led by the senior independent director, were 
discussed and reviewed by members of the 
Committee in the absence of the Chairman  
and with all other Board members as appropriate. 
The directors, after reviewing all aspects of the 
Chairman’s role and the mix of skills required to 
fulfil this, concluded that there were sufficiently 
qualified candidates already on the Board and 
that there was no need to seek further external 
candidates. Following further consultation with 
the other directors the Committee concluded,  
in 2012, that Mr Richard Davey should be 
appointed as Chairman following the AGM  
to be held in 2012.
Non-executive director succession plans, 
including in respect of the Chairman or for  
his successor, led by the senior independent 
director, were also reviewed by members  
of the Committee during the year. Neither the 
Chairman, nor any other non-executive director, 
took part in any discussions concerning their 
own positions.
In September 2011 the Committee concluded 
its regular review of the succession plan 
regarding senior executive roles (including 
directors) in the Group. With a few exceptions, 
the plan continues to identify short term 
contingencies for fulfilling each role at short 
notice as well as one or more potential internal 
candidates as permanent successors. The 
Committee was satisfied that the overall plan  
is well conceived and effectively managed.  
The Committee paid particular attention to the 
few roles in respect of which the plan is less 
well developed, recognising the need to widen 
diversification at a senior level but remaining 
cogniscent of recruiting individuals on merit 
and their suitability for the role. 
Board and Committee evaluation
The Committee took account of the conclusions 
of the annual Board evaluation and of the 
evaluations undertaken for each individual 
director, when considering the nomination  
of directors for re-election at the 2012 AGM,  
and was able to recommend to the Board  
the nomination of all directors wishing to stand 
for re-election. The nomination of Sir Alan Collins 
was also recommended to the Board. Further 
details of the directors proposed for election  
or re-election at the next AGM (to be held in 
May 2012) may be found earlier in this report  
( pp60). The Committee has also recently 
conducted its own annual self-evaluation and 
concluded that it had during 2011 fulfilled  
its duties effectively. The conclusions of the 
Committee evaluation were reported to the 
Board in early 2012. The Committee has, 
following approval by the Board, appointed  
an external advisor, Independent Board 
Evaluation, to assist in the performance 
evaluation of the Board in 2012. 
By Order of the Board, on the recommendation 
of the Nomination Committee

insurance experience provides an appropriate 
group of experienced professionals to fulfil  
the duties of the Committee. Mr Buchanan,  
Sir Alan Collins and Mr Davey (as its chairman), 
also serve on the Risk & Solvency Committee, 
retaining a strong link between the risk and  
audit review processes. 
Mr Buchanan is also a member of the 
Remuneration Committee and ensures that the 
Audit Committee has input on the assessment  
of ‘Remuneration Risks’ and the controls put in 
place to mitigate any risks identified. 
The Chairman of the Company, the Group Chief 
Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Chief 
Risk Officer and the Head of Internal Audit usually 
attend the Committee’s meetings.
The Committee received and reviewed detailed 
papers and information sufficiently in advance  
of its meetings for its members to consider  
them appropriately, making suggestions for 
improvements to these papers when required.  
At least once a year the Committee meets,  
both on its own and with the external auditors, 
without any executive management present.  
The Committee also meets privately with the 
Head of Internal Audit, who has a private line  
of communication with the Committee Chairman. 
His executive reporting line is to the Group Chief 
Executive and he is appointed, and may only  
be dismissed, by the Committee. During the  
year the Committee also met with the Group 
Finance Director without any other executive 
management present. 
Activities
The Committee’s activities may be divided into 
three interlinked areas: financial reporting and 
external audit; internal control; and internal audit. 
Whilst consideration of risk is now within the 
remit of the Risk & Solvency Committee, the 
Audit Committee also received reports on risk  
to enable it to consider these three main areas. 
The Committee also meets jointly with the Risk  
& Solvency Committee on an annual basis to 
consider the Statement on Internal Controls and 
Terms of reference
The terms of reference of the Audit  
Committee (the Committee) are designed to 
enable it to take an independent view of the 
appropriateness of the Group’s accounting 
policies, practices and reporting; compliance 
and internal control processes and internal 
audit process and effectiveness. The terms  
of reference also place responsibility on the 
Committee to consider the appointment and 
fees (both audit and non-audit) of the external 
auditors, who have unrestricted access to it. 
The terms of reference were reviewed during 
the year, such review including a gap analysis  
to ensure their Solvency II compliance. The 
opportunity was also taken then to standardise 
wordings between Group Committees.
The Committee’s new terms of reference, which 
continue to take full account of the Smith Report 
on the role of audit committees, are available in 
the ‘Corporate Governance’ section of ‘Investor 
Relations’ on the Company’s website. 
While the Committee has authority to engage 
its own independent external advice at the 
Company’s expense should it deem it 
necessary; it did not find it necessary to seek 
external advice during the year, other than  
from the external auditors.
Membership, meetings and attendance
The Committee’s membership, number of 
meetings and attendance during the year are set 
out in the ‘Board and Committee membership 
and attendance’ section of the Board Corporate 
Governance statement. Both the Nomination 
Committee, in making its recommendations  
to the Board, and the Committee in its own 
self-evaluation, reviews the Committee’s 
membership. Sir Alan Collins was appointed to 
the Committee on his appointment to the Board, 
on the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee. Further details of the qualifications 
and experience of Committee members may be 
found earlier in this report ( pp60). In the view 
of the Board, the combination of audit, wider 
financial services, international trade and 
the Principal risks and uncertainties identified  
for the business. The first of such meetings  
was held in early 2012. In order to assist the 
Committee in its role, additional briefing sessions 
have been arranged covering Solvency II updates.
Financial reporting and external audit
The prime financial reporting focus of the 
Committee during the year was, as ever, on  
the integrity of the Company’s interim results 
statements and its Annual Report and accounts. 
The Committee was satisfied that the significant 
assumptions underlying the reported figures, 
including in particular those relevant to reserving, 
were justified and that there was appropriate and 
meaningful disclosure of the critical judgements 
and key estimates made, which took account  
of significant loss events during the year.  
To assist the Committee in reaching this view 
reports were considered on the reserving process 
and benchmarking exercises were reviewed.  
The Committee has considered the Annual 
Report in its entirety and is satisfied that, viewed 
as a whole, the Report is fair and balanced.  
In addition, each Interim Management Statement 
of the Company was reviewed by the Committee.
The Committee reviewed the external  
auditors’ engagement and service plans, their 
independence and the extent and reasons for 
them providing non-audit services (a breakdown 
of the fees for which is set out in note 13  
to the Accounts). In accordance with the policy 
adopted in 2010 which covers the level and 
type of non-audit services permissible  
and the approval processes for using such 
services, the Committee has considered  
the provision of non-audit services provided  
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), in 
particular where these relate to aspects of the 
internal audit function, and remains satisfied 
that this has not compromised their 
independence as auditors.
Reports were received from the external auditors 
in respect of each set of financial statements, 
highlighting the material judgemental areas, 
which were then discussed by the Committee 
Audit Committee report
Monitoring and challenge
“ The Audit Committee provides independent monitoring,  
guidance and challenge to executive management. Its aim  
is to ensure high standards of reporting, controls and compliance,  
in the belief that excellence in these areas enhances the effectiveness 
of the business.”
 Nigel Buchanan, Committee Chairman Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
with the auditors alongside reports from 
management. The Committee assesses the 
effectiveness of the external auditors at least 
annually and, following the review undertaken 
during the year, considers that this continues  
to be demonstrated, based on reports from 
management and from its own observations.  
A more detailed review of Amlin’s selection  
of external auditors was last undertaken  
in 2009 when PwC were appointed following  
a comprehensive, competitive tender process. 
Internal control
Details of the Committee’s role regarding internal 
control issues are set out in the ‘Board internal 
control statement’ ( pp66) within the Board 
Corporate Governance statement. 
Internal audit
The Committee reviewed the plans and work 
undertaken during the year by the Group’s 
Internal Audit department, including reports 
relating to overseas subsidiaries, and the 
consequent actions agreed with management. 
Reporting to the Committee includes summaries 
of the findings of all internal audit reports, 
enabling members of the Committee to question 
the Head of Internal Audit on any report. The 
Committee closely scrutinised management’s 
progress in addressing the issues raised, and it 
continues to challenge management to move 
more quickly when it considers it appropriate.
The Internal Audit department has paid particular 
attention to the improvements made in ACI  
to strengthen key controls and has reported 
progress to the Audit Committee. Further details 
may be found on page ( pp66). 
The Committee also monitored the Group’s 
compliance with Lloyd’s and other regulatory 
requirements and recommendations, and 
reviewed the main ‘whistle blowing’ procedures 
operated by the Group. 
Committee evaluation 
During the year the Committee conducted its 
annual self-evaluation of its terms of reference, 
composition, procedures, contribution and 
effectiveness. The Committee concluded that 
during 2011 it had received sufficient, reliable, 
and timely information from management to 
enable it to fulfil its responsibilities and that it had 
fulfilled the duties placed upon it by its terms of 
reference. The conclusions of its evaluation were 
agreed and reported to the Board in early 2012.

of the Audit Committee

“ The Risk & Solvency Committee was set up in 2011 to lead the 
review process for, and make recommendations regarding, risk 
management, risk appetite, solvency, economic and regulatory 
capital and associated regulatory reporting.”
 Richard Davey, Committee Chairman
Risk & Solvency Committee report
Terms of reference
The terms of reference of the Risk & Solvency 
Committee (the Committee) are designed to 
enable it to lead the review of risk management, 
risk appetite, solvency and capital. The 
Committee will also be responsible for reviewing 
and making recommendations to the Board 
regarding the Own Risk & Solvency Assessment 
(ORSA) prior to submission to the regulator,  
and to review the adequacy, effectiveness and 
governance of the Group’s internal model. The 
terms of reference also provide for review, jointly 
with the Audit Committee, of the effectiveness  
of internal controls and risk management systems 
to enable recommendation to the Board for 
approval of the internal control statement. 
The terms of reference were agreed by the 
Board in advance of the Committee’s first 
meeting which was held in March 2011. They 
were reviewed during the year, such review 
including a gap analysis to ensure their 
Solvency II compliance. The opportunity  
was also taken then to standardise wordings 
between Group Committees.
The Committee’s new terms of reference are 
available in the ‘Corporate Governance’ section  
of ‘Investor Relations’ on the Company’s website. 
Membership, meetings and attendance
The Committee’s membership and number  
of meetings and attendance during the year are 
set out in the ‘Board and Committee membership 
and attendance’ section of the Board Corporate 
Governance statement. Both the Nomination 
Committee in making its recommendations  
to the Board, and the Committee in its own 
self-evaluation, reviews the Committee’s 
membership. Sir Alan Collins was appointed to 
the Committee on his appointment to the Board 
in November 2011, on the recommendation of 
the Nomination Committee. All the Committee’s 
members (Messrs Davey, Buchanan, Taylor and 
Sir Alan Collins), are considered to have adequate 
experience to enable them to fulfil their duties. 
Further details can be found on page ( pp60).
Mr Buchanan is also a member of the 
Remuneration Committee and ensures  
that the Risk & Solvency Committee has input 
on the assessment of ‘Remuneration Risks’ 
and the controls put in place to mitigate any 
risks identified.
The Group Chief Executive, the Group  
Finance Director, the Chief Risk Officer and 
the Head of Internal Audit usually attend the 
Committee’s meetings.
The Committee received and considered 
detailed papers and information sufficiently  
in advance of its meetings for its members  
to consider them appropriately, making 
suggestions for improvements when required. 
Maintaining a risk balance
Activities
The Committee’s activities may be divided into 
three main areas: risk management framework, 
business risk and ORSA review and internal 
model governance. The Committee receives 
regular reports on these areas from the Chief  
Risk Officer and from the Group Executive Risk 
Committee. The Committee also meets jointly 
with the Audit Committee on an annual basis  
to consider the Statement on Internal Controls 
and the Principal risks and uncertainties identified 
for the business. The first of such meetings was 
held in early 2012. Details of the Committee’s 
role regarding internal control issues are set  
out in the ‘Board internal control statement’  
( pp66) within the Board Corporate  
Governance statement. 
Risk management framework
The Group’s risk management framework was 
formalised and adopted by the Board in 2008, 
but its review is now within the remit of this 
Committee. During the year the Committee 
reviewed and agreed a revision of the framework 
which was proposed to, and adopted by, the 
Board. A diagram showing the framework may  
be found earlier in this report ( pp44). The 
Committee has received reports on development 
of the framework during the year and has noted 
that processes have been improved to enhance 
the quality of risk assessment output.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
Business risk and ORSA review
The Committee has reviewed the risk exposures 
facing the Group and considered whether these 
are managed within agreed risk tolerances and,  
if not, whether management actions and plans  
to mitigate this are adequate. During the year  
the Committee has reviewed the adequacy and 
appropriateness of stress and scenario tests, 
using reports from the Risk Assessment and 
Monitoring Department as well as its own 
experience to challenge and recommend further 
test scenarios. In doing so it also considered the 
Group’s Reinsurance programme, and the risk 
diversification credit which is incorporated  
in the Group’s internal capital model. Additionally 
the Committee has reviewed and approved  
the key Risk Indicators which form part of the 
Management Information reports used 
throughout the Group.
The Committee reviewed, amended and  
agreed the principal risk and uncertainties 
detailed on page 46 and identified some of the 
emerging risks which the Group will monitor  
in the longer term. 
The ORSA Report was reviewed at each of the 
Committee meetings and challenge over the 
content and format offered. 
Internal model governance
The Committee has been able to review the 
adequacy of the Group’s internal model, using 
both non-independent and independent validation 
reports as guidance. 
In order to assist the Committee in this role, 
briefing sessions have been arranged covering 
Solvency II updates, and the areas of expert 
judgement used in the development, validation 
and control of the internal model.
Committee evaluation and reporting
The Committee has conducted its first self-
evaluation of its terms of reference, composition, 
procedures, contribution and effectiveness.  
The Committee concluded that, during 2011,  
it had received sufficient, reliable, and timely 
information from management to enable it to 
fulfil its responsibilities and that it had fulfilled the 
duties placed upon it by its terms of reference. 
The conclusions of its evaluation were agreed  
and reported to the Board early in 2012.

“ Amlin aims to build a sustainable business through the consistent 
application of our values in relationships with shareholders, 
employees, clients and other stakeholders. We seek to make a positive 
contribution to the communities in which we operate, placing integrity 
and professional excellence at the heart of our business practice. ” 
 Charles Philipps, Chief Executive
Corporate Responsibility
Our Vision to be the “reference point for  
quality” in each of our markets is underpinned  
by a set of core values which both determine  
and reflect the way in which all employees of  
the Amlin Group are expected to engage with  
our stakeholders, both internal and external  
to the business. It is Amlin’s policy to conduct  
all aspects of its business in an honest, open and 
ethical manner.
Our corporate responsibility activity related to 
Marketplace and Employees is reported to the 
CEO and thence the Board. Activities relating  
to Charity & Community and the Environment  
are reported through the Corporate Advisory 
Panel to the CEO, who reports to the Board.
Marketplace
Amlin remains one of the largest participants  
in the Lloyd’s market, although we sourced  
only 61% of our 2011 premium in the market. 
We value the opportunities presented through 
Lloyd’s worldwide network and during 2011, 
formed a new terrorism consortium of agents 
based in Lloyd’s Asia, Singapore. Amlin 
professionals participate in a number of market 
working groups involved in the conduct and 
development of the market. 
We continued to focus during 2011 on the 
development of our non-Lloyd’s European 
platforms, Amlin Corporate Insurance (pp.41)  
and Amlin Re Europe (pp.39). 
Broker relationships
The majority of Amlin’s business is broker 
generated, both within the Lloyd’s market and 
through national and regional networks. We 
closely manage these key relationships within 
each business, maintaining an open dialogue  
and sharing data with the aim of improving our 
service to cedants and insureds. Additionally,  
we receive independent feedback through 
industry surveys such as the London Market 
Claims Study ( pp28-29). 
Amlin Corporate Insurance is a member of the 
Dutch Insurance Association Exchange (VNAB) 
which accounted for €1,019 billion of industrial 
and commercial gross written premium in 2010. 
The insurers and brokers within VNAB operate in 
accordance with the so-called “Beursprinciples” 
and the majority of ACI’s business is written 
under this code. Executive Vice President,  
Michiel Vervliet is Chairman of the insurer 
membership and ACI underwriters play an active 
role in various technical subgroups.
We recognise the potential conflicts inherent in 
the traditional broker compensation model and 
attempt to manage these appropriately. We have 
adopted a Broker Remuneration Policy to guide 
all areas of the business in this sensitive area. 
2011 saw the introduction of the Bribery Act 
2010 and increased scrutiny of the financial 
services sector as a whole. We have taken  
the opportunity to review and where necessary, 
improve our policies and standards relating  
to professional conduct and client service. 
In 2010, Amlin became the first London market 
insurer to achieve Corporate Chartered Insurer 
status. All 420 frontline underwriting and claims 
staff from Amlin London and Amlin UK were 
included in this submission.
Employees 
Amlin’s Vision includes being recognised as “the 
place to work”, with staff who understand our 
strategy and their role in delivering and exceeding 
our goals. An important element in achieving this 
is being a responsible employer, operating first 
class employment practices and actively engaging 
with our employees ( pp48-49). We encourage

Since the Group’s combined workforce now 
exceeds 1,000 in more than four European 
countries, we are setting up a Group-wide 
employee representative group. We undertake 
regular employee opinion surveys, the next  
of which is planned for mid-2012. 
Amlin seeks to align employee interests further  
by awarding shares to all eligible employees 
under the Share Incentive Plan. This annual 
award is subject to the Company’s overall 
performance and in April 2011 an award was 
made to the value of £1,000. At 31 December 
2011, 19.4% of employees had a stake in 
Company equity valued in excess of £10,000. 
The good conduct of employees in their 
management of business relationships and with 
colleagues is critical to creating pride in the 
Company and to our aspiration to be a socially 
responsible company. Amlin’s core values are an 
important part of the Code of Conduct and during 
2011, further work was undertaken to embed our 
culture and values across the enlarged Group.
Diversity
Amlin pursues a policy of diversity, be that  
of skills, experience, nationality or gender and in 
accordance with the Group’s equal opportunities 
policy. We are committed to the benefits of a 
diversified workforce, reflected in most levels  
of staff. This will be monitored as efforts are made 
to widen diversification at senior level, including 
increasing the number of female members of the 
senior team both by promotion and recruitment 
over the next few years.
Amlin currently has a balance of skills and 
diversity on the Board, though there is only one 
female director. It is our aspiration that by the  
end of 2015, 20% of the Board should be made 
up of women. Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Community
In the UK
Amlin’s UK charity and community activities  
are guided and facilitated by a panel which  
meets at least quarterly and comprises senior 
representatives from each UK business area.  
In 2011, we broadened our support to UK 
charities with a focus on education and health. 
Firstly, we continued to fund a Clinical Nurse 
Specialist at Imperial College Healthcare NHS 
Trust for Macmillan Cancer Support. Secondly, 
we again sponsored the Art for Youth London sale 
at the Royal College of Art, generating £88,000 
profit for UK Youth in 2011 and taking the total 
funds raised from this event to over £1 million. 
We built on this relationship by initiating the 
Amlin Platinum Programme, which funds ten 
candidates selected by UK Youth from across  
the country to undertake vocational training  
for a variety of local charities. Thirdly, we enabled 
120 pupils from an inner London school to 
participate in a one week adventure run by the 
Outward Bound Trust. Our Chief Executive serves 
as a trustee of this charity. 
In 2011, ten Amlin managers delivered our  
third Community Action Learning project at 
Newlands Bishop Farm, near Solihull. The farm  
is run as a commercial enterprise and offers 
people with learning difficulties the opportunity  
to gain practical skills with which to work in the 
local community centre. This unique programme 
within the Lloyd’s market again met our 
objectives, both in terms of community benefit 
and as a management development opportunity. 
We have elected to find a new community partner 
for 2012, probably within Europe.
Our annual charity go-karting event in July raised 
over £40,000 for several Amlin charities. Amlin 
UK, our Chelmsford-based commercial insurance 
business, has supported local charity Farleigh 
Hospice for several years, raising a total of 
£94,559 by 31 December 2011.

Philanthropy is an important part of corporate  
life in Bermuda and Amlin Bermuda plays an 
active role in the local community. The corporate 
giving programme focuses on organisations 
involved in youth, education and sport. 2011 
beneficiaries from the $100,000 budget included 
WindReach, Bermuda Sloop Foundation,  
Outward Bound Bermuda and the Bermuda Lawn 
Tennis Association. 
Amlin’s scholarship programme for Bermudian 
students continued in 2011, with $75,000  
of grants offered through the Association of 
Bermuda International Companies Education 
Awards (ABICEA) and The Bermuda Foundation 
for Insurance Studies. Scholarship recipients 
worked with the Company during college breaks 
and senior Amlin executives supported the 
ABICEA through board, committee, interview 
panel and mentoring panel membership.
Amlin Singapore has sponsored the General 
Insurance Association’s Global Internship 
Programme from the outset and provides 
speakers for their Talent Outreach Project.  
In 2011, the business sponsored the Welfare 
Handicap Association annual lunch.
Environment
Underwriting catastrophe risk is a core  
part of our business and 2011 saw 
unprecedented losses from a range of weather 
related events. Our principal risks and 
uncertainties are listed earlier in this report  
( pp46), together with controls, mitigation 
strategies and accountabilities. Amlin also 
evaluates the risks and opportunities presented 
by climate change through the Climate  
Change & Environmental Panel, which  
is composed of senior underwriters,  
chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and meets  
at least quarterly.
Amlin’s CEO is a member of the Geneva 
Association and participates in their discussions. 
The objectives of the Association’s climate-linked 
research have been to identify and analyse issues 
of specific relevance to the insurance industry, 
such as the likely range of future claims costs, 
and the political, educational and social 
challenges to be addressed. 
In 2011 Amlin continued to engage with  
the Risk Predication Initiative organised by the 
Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, notably in 
research in forecasting extreme weather events. 
The frequency and severity of 2011 catastrophes 
have also highlighted the potential effects  
of systemic risk from modelling and we are 
exploring a potential research partnership  
into this discipline.
We measure our annual carbon footprint 
including data from all Group companies over 
which financial control was exercised and for 
whom financial results were published in that 
year. We include employee commuting, waste/
recycling and water usage to give a full picture  
of our corporate impact. Amlin’s 2010 footprint 
was 5.28 tonnes per employee inclusive  
of these factors (2009: 5.64) or 3.56 tonnes  
if compared with the scope of most FTSE 
calculations (2009: 4.57).
We seek to identify new opportunities to  
reduce or contain energy and resource usage.  
In 2011 we introduced electronic boardpacks for 
the majority of boards, committees and for the 
distribution of management information, together 
with iPads for senior managers across the Group. 
This should over time reduce our paper and  
print consumption.
Reporting
Amlin has been a member of the FTSE4Good UK 
Index since June 2001. We have participated in 
the Carbon Disclosure Project since 2007 and 
contribute to the ClimateWise submission by the 
Lloyd’s market, which was awarded gold standard 
rating by the PriceWaterhouse-Cooper’s 
Independent Review.
In April 2011 Deloitte LLP provided ISAE3000

Directors’ remuneration report
Aligned with our objectives
Committee Activities in 2011
Amlin employees have made a great contribution towards achieving our strategic objectives in what  
has been a challenging year, as highlighted in both the Chairman ( pp12) and the CEO’s statement  
( pp18).
There have been no significant changes in remuneration arrangements since those described a year 
ago, with changes only to the Profit Commission scheme as detailed later in this report. Other minor 
changes have been made to remuneration policies and procedures to reflect changes in employment 
(retirement) and pensions law.
The Committee undertook a further review during the year of remuneration risk and acknowledged  
that no changes are required to the Company’s remuneration arrangements and that current controls 
remain appropriate. 
Bonus paid in 2011
Our over arching principle is to provide appropriate levels of remuneration to our directors,  
senior executives and employees reflecting a contribution of the financial performance of the Group 
and the individual’s achievements in meeting annual personal performance objectives. It has been 
Amlin’s long-standing practice to defer payment of bonuses in respect of the Profit Commission 
scheme for Underwriters until the second and third years following the underwriting year for which 
the bonus has been earned. Profit Commission payments in respect of results of the 2008 and  
2009 underwriting years have been made to the relevant directors and senior executives during 
2011. These bonuses therefore reflect rewards earned for prior performance. Payments under  
the Group Bonus Scheme reflect the individual component only as no payments were made under 
the business component.
Priorities for 2012
Public and regulatory focus on senior executive and financial services remuneration remains a key  
issue both in the UK and the EU. The Committee will continue to review all aspects of the Company’s 
remuneration structures, policies and procedures to ensure that, as well as complying with regulation, 
all these elements support the strategic objectives of the Company, and offer appropriate levels  
of incentive for the employees.

The Committee
Committee members
The Committee’s membership comprises 
three independent non-executive directors  
in accordance with the Committee terms of 
reference. Further details of the Committee 
members can be found ( pp60) and ( pp65). 
Committee activities 
The Committee’s terms of reference, which  
are published on the Company’s website, are,  
in summary; to determine the total individual 
remuneration package of each executive director  
of the Company, the Chairman, the Company 
Secretary and certain other senior Group employees 
(in each case including exit terms); and to 
recommend to the Board the framework and broad 
policies of the Group in relation to senior executive 
remuneration. The Committee also determines  
the targets for performance-related remuneration 
and exercises the Board’s powers in relation  
to all the Company’s share and incentive plans. 
Advice to the Committee
During 2011, the Committee had access to 
advice from inside and outside the Group from:
  The Chairman of the Company (Mr Taylor)
  The Chief Executive (Mr Philipps)
  Group HR Director (Mr Farrow)
  The then Company Secretary (Mr Pender)
  The Chief Risk Officer (Mr Illingworth) 
  New Bridge Street
The Committee’s independent remuneration

Remuneration Strategy
Amlin’s remuneration policies are designed to support its vision and strategic objectives, specifically:
  To secure the maximum  
possible alignment between  
the interests and long term  
career development of executive 
directors and other senior 
employees with the ambitions  
of the Group and the creation  
of value for shareholders.
  To have first class employment 
practices, contributing to Amlin 
being “the place to work” for  
high quality people in its sector. 
This requires levels and structures 
of remuneration that are 
appropriate to attract, retain, 
incentivise and reward the high 
calibre talent that is required  
for the success of the Group.
  To reward management focus 
both on financial measures,  
such as return on equity and 
underwriting returns, and on 
longer term objectives such as 
underwriting cycle management 
and the long term sustainability  
of the business.
  When determining remuneration, 
the Committee will take into 
account pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the  
Group and in the sector.
Amlin’s Group Remuneration Policy comprises guiding principles and policies which are applicable to the Group as a whole.
The Committee regularly reviews the policy and principles outlined above to ensure that the Group’s remuneration practices continue to be in the best 
interest of the Company and its shareholders. 82
Overall remuneration levels
During the year the Committee reviewed and 
re-affirmed the Group Remuneration Policy, 
comprising guiding principles and policies 
applicable to the Group as a whole, which was 
discussed and agreed by the Board. This and  
the other principles and policies adopted are 
reflected in this report. 
Amlin’s key remuneration policy is to ensure  
that base salaries across all categories of staff  
will be determined by the job, market rate and 
personal performance (with the market rate 
having regard to the median for the appropriate 
market). Variable pay will be designed so that  
top quartile performance will be rewarded  
with top quartile remuneration. In determining 
individuals’ remuneration, the Group takes 
account of remuneration statistics for the non-life 
insurance sector in which the Group operates 
and, where applicable for certain roles, wider 
remuneration statistics.
This policy of aiming to encourage and  
reward superior, rather than merely average, 
performance is considered the most appropriate 
to support the success of the Group. Salaries  
are generally reviewed as at 1 April each year.  
Pay and employment conditions of employees 
and wider associate undertakings were also  
taken into consideration in determining  
Board remuneration.
In the UK remuneration for underwriters and 
those performing other technical insurance 
related roles is strongly influenced by the  
Lloyd’s sector. Lloyd’s underwriting businesses 
tend to relate a significant proportion of the 
potential rewards of underwriters to the absolute 
profitability of the relevant underwriting unit, 
often on an uncapped basis. Similar remuneration 
structures and policies have applied for staff  
in Amlin Bermuda. The remuneration policies 
applied in the Group’s businesses in the 
Netherlands, Belgium, France and Switzerland 
operate on a similar basis to that of the UK, 
maintaining an appropriate balance between  
local and existing Amlin practices. 
Group remuneration policy is reviewed and 
agreed by local remuneration Committees  
in the ACI and Amlin AG businesses to ensure 
local practices are observed. 
In all spheres of operation, the Committee aims 
to keep the market practices of its competitors 
for staff under review and believes that, as market 
and Amlin’s own practices evolve, it is important 
to ensure that remuneration structures continue 
to support the Group’s competitive advantage.
Directors’ remuneration report continued
External background
Throughout the year the Committee kept under 
review any emerging regulatory and market 
practices including those initiated by the EU.  
The Committee’s approach, as well as complying 
with the principles, codes and regulations that 
apply to Amlin, continues to be to consider the 
rationale and analysis behind other proposals, 
that may not strictly apply to Amlin, on their 
merits and to consider voluntary application  
when appropriate. 
Overall structure of directors’ 
and employees’ remuneration
The remuneration of all executive directors 
consists of three principal elements: (1) base 
salary, benefits and pension contributions; (2) 
short term performance rewards (on an annual  
or underwriting year basis); and (3) longer term 
performance rewards (measured over three or five 
year performance periods). This is also the case 
for other senior executives throughout the Group 
although the balance between the three elements 
varies according to seniority and location. 
Underwriters and other senior executives below 
main Board level are also eligible to receive 
significant proportions of their total remuneration 
as performance related benefits.
Following the review of senior non-underwriters’ 
remuneration in 2009, the Committee believes that 
the overall balance between fixed and performance 
rewards is appropriate and no further changes were 
made in this respect in 2011. 
Executive remuneration structure in 2011
The structure of the various elements of senior 
executive remuneration has not changed over  
the last year. Senior executives participate in a Long 
T erm Incentive Plan measured over a three year 
performance period (the L TIP) and through one  
of two other long term plans with the potential to 
earn significant rewards by reference to five year 
performance periods, thereby incentivising the longer 
term sustainability of the business (the Capital Builder 
Plan for underwriters and the Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) for non-underwriters). 
The split of annual remuneration of each current 
executive director in 2010 and 2011 is summarised 
in the chart opposite. Bonus and PC payments are 
those paid or due at the year end. Long term 
incentive plan awards or payments are not included.
The division between fixed and annual 
performance payments show that a significant 
proportion of directors’ remuneration in respect 
of both years was performance related. Payments 
in respect of 2011 which only affected the  
non-underwriting executive directors, have 
reduced the total quantum of variable pay.  
This was due to no payments being made under 
the Group Business component of the Group 
Bonus Scheme. The splits between the categories 
of reward, together with the longer term 
performance rewards described later in this 
report, reflect the Committee’s objective of 
aligning management and shareholders’ interests.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
Variable remuneration payments for underwriting 
directors have increased in 2011. Underwriting 
executive directors participate in the Profit 
Commission scheme, details of which can be 
found ( pp85). Payments made in 2011 to 
underwriting executive directors are deferred 
bonus payments in respect of the second, third 
and fourth years following the underwriting year

Remuneration received
The remuneration received in respect of the  
year ended 31 December 2011 by each of the 
directors in respect of their periods of service  
as directors, excluding pension contributions  
and long term incentive plan payments, is shown 
in the table ( pp83). In addition, Mr Hextall 
received and retained a non executive director’s 
fee of £27,000 from the City of London 
Investment Trust PLC (2010: £24,000). Where 
applicable, the amounts shown as paid to 
non-executive directors include fees paid by or  
on behalf of the Company’s subsidiaries. The total 
base salaries received in 2011 by Messrs Beale, 
Carpenter, Hextall and Philipps increased by 3.9% 
3.1%, 4.7% and 3.1% respectively over 2010. 
The annual bonuses and/or profit commission 
amounts shown are those paid or payable in 
respect of the year. Messrs Hextall and Philipps
received performance bonuses under the Group 
Bonus scheme, in respect of their personal 
performance related element of their bonus  
only. The amounts awarded reflect the 
considerable progress achieved in a number  
of areas, including preparation for Solvency II, 
and represents 20% and 30% of their  
bonus potential for Messrs Philipps and 
Hextall respectively.

Salary & benefits 
Non performance-related benefits to which 
executive directors and other employees are 
generally entitled are private health insurance, 
cover for death in service and permanent 
disability and a choice of other benefits,  
such as subsidised gym membership, private 
dental costs, etc. Senior staff, including 
executive directors, also receive a car allowance. 
Details of the policy on base salary can be found 
( pp82), together with remuneration received 
by each executive director ( pp83).
Pensions 
The Company pays a percentage of base salary 
into a Group occupational and/or a stakeholder 
pension plan. Executive directors serving during 
the year participate in the relevant Group 
pension plans on the same basis as other senior 
employees. Pensionable salary is base salary 
only. The Group has both defined contribution 
(DC) and defined benefit (DB) schemes.  
At the year end, 406 out of the Group’s total 
employees of 1,548 were accruing any element 
of DB pension. These included 61 out of 1,021 
staff in the UK and Bermuda (2010: 66 out of 
844) and 345 out of 422 at ACI (2010: 349 out
of 382). DB participants included two of the  
four executive directors.
In respect of DC pensions, the Group 
contributes a percentage of base salary 
depending on seniority, age and the percentage 
of salary (if any) that the employee chooses  
to contribute. The maximum total DC employer 
contribution made for any director in 2011,  
for a director with only DC contributions and 
aged over 50, was 9.8% of base salary  
(2010: 20.9%). In 2011 a salary sacrifice option 
was introduced for UK employees in respect  
of employee DC pension contributions, with  
the consequential employer NIC saving being 
shared equally between the Group and an 
additional payment into the employee’s DC 
pension. From April 2011, those Directors  
and other UK staff who exceeded the £50,000 
UK annual pension tax relief allowance were 
given the option to convert the excess into a 
non-pensionable taxable allowance adjusted for 
employer contributions to ensure this is cost 
neutral to the Group.
From April 2012 those Directors and other UK 
staff who have applied for and received fixed 
protection under the HMRC rules who anticipate 
exceeding the new lowered lifetime allowance  
of £1.5 million will be given the option to receive 
a non-pensionable pension allowance on a cost 
neutral basis to the Group.
The Group’s DB schemes for UK and, when 
applicable, UK-originated staff working overseas 
have been closed to new entrants since 1998 
and the scheme for ACI Belgian employees 
since September 2009. The ACI Netherlands  
DB scheme remains open for qualifying new 
employees. Remaining active DB members of 
the UK scheme continue to accrue additional 
years’ service under the schemes but generally 
only based on 2006 pensionable salaries, with 
salary increases from April 2006 onwards being 
pensioned through DC arrangements. Further 
details of the Group’s commitments in respect 
of DB pensions are set out in note 32 to the 
Accounts. The DB employee contribution rate  
in the UK is 5% of DB pensionable salary  
(6% in the Netherlands and nil in Belgium).  
DB employer contribution rates vary according 
to actuarial advice in order to deliver the 
promised levels of pension. The employer 
contribution rate for the main UK scheme  
is currently 19%.

Annual bonus scheme (Group Bonus Scheme)
For those executive directors and other 
employees who are not directly involved in 
underwriting activities, the Group’s shorter term 
performance incentive is a cash bonus scheme. 
The Group Bonus scheme rewards and 
incentivises participants against a mixture of 
business performance, measured by reference 
to the Group’s return on equity (ROE) compared 
with target returns set by the Committee at the 
beginning of each year, and the individual’s 
performance, measured against agreed 
stretching personal objectives. The mix of 
business and individual bonus elements varies 
by seniority, with 70% of the potential target 
reward at the most senior role levels, including 
participating executive directors, being rewarded 
on Group business performance and 30% on 
personal performance. The total ‘Target’ and 
maximum bonus levels also increase with 
seniority. In respect of 2011, 75% of base salary 
was payable to executive directors for ‘Target’ 
performance, rising to a potential maximum 
payment of 165% of base salary. Similarly 
proportional scales apply below director level  
for non underwriting staff. 
For directors and those at other senior 
management levels, any element of payment  
of annual bonus in respect of 2010 and 
subsequent years that is above the base salary 
maximum percentage for the relevant 
management level for 2009 (for example,  
120% for executive directors) will be deferred  
for three years from the usual date of payment. 
Total or partial claw-back of such deferred cash 
bonus will also apply in the event either of the 
Committee finding that a participant has not 
complied with internal standards or controls  
or has caused reputational damage to the 
Company, or if any results or accounts on which 
the bonus was based proves to be incorrect or 
requires to be re-stated. Provisions also apply 
whereby a leaver during the three year deferral 
period will forfeit the deferred bonus, unless 
they leave for one of a number of specified 
“good leaver” reasons, including circumstances 
agreed by the Committee to be exceptional.  
In view of the material potential long term 
share-based incentive component in all senior 
executive remuneration, the Committee believes 
that this degree of deferment and potential 
clawback of annual cash bonus payments 
provides an appropriate overall balance between 
immediate and deferred performance related 
pay, and between payment in cash and in shares.
The Committee sets thresholds for the business 
performance element of the bonus potential on 
an annual basis. The thresholds set vary over the 
insurance cycle and the Committee believes that 
higher thresholds are appropriate when insurance 
market margins are low and higher thresholds 
are appropriate when margins are higher. The 
Committee also has regard to the anticipated 
investment returns.

Profit Commission (PC) schemes
Shorter term incentives for underwriters (whether 
or not they are executive directors of Amlin plc) 
in the UK and Bermuda businesses, and for 
certain other underwriting division staff, consisted 
until the 2010 underwriting year principally of a 
cash profit share relating to underwriting profits 
in respect of each underwriting year (known as 
profit commission or PC). 
For 2010 and prior years PC was paid on  
an underwriting year basis, usually partly 
related to the business unit in which the 
relevant participant works and partly to  
wider Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Bermuda 
underwriting performance. Rewards were  
also divided between those which were purely 
calculated as a percentage of underwriting 
performance relative to external peers and/or 
other business unit’s underwriting profit which 
could be paid out under the 2010 and earlier 
year’s scheme in respect of each underwriting 
year was 4.5%, unless the business unit 
achieved a superior result to its market peers 
in which case the highest maximum applying 
to any division was 4.8%. Around 3% of each 
underwriting year’s profit of Amlin Bermuda 
was also made available to a parallel scheme 
for those contributing to that subsidiary’s 
results, with further discretionary payments 
made so that up to around 4.5% of its 
underwriting profit over the long term was  
paid out under the scheme. 
Significant structural changes were made to the 
scheme in respect of the 2011 and subsequent 
underwriting years, as follows: 
  Participation is now restricted to underwriters 
with underwriting authority, with other 
underwriting division staff moving to the 
Group Bonus Scheme (GBS); 
  The scheme consists of two elements;  
the previous underwriting profit basis  
(PC element) and a GAAP based performance 
award similar to the GBS. The latter is spilt 
50:50 between a Group ROE-based award 
and an award based on performance against 
personal objectives; 
  Profit pools have been rationalised to more 
closely align to the present divisional structure 
of the business rather than by reference  
to historic structures; and 
  All payments are capped as a percentage  
of annual salary, based on job role. These 
caps have been set at levels so as not to  
harm the competitiveness of Amlin’s position  
in the market, recognising that an incentive 
structure for underwriters with a high 
potential proportion of variable pay is critical 
to the continuing success of the Group. 
In addition, provisions have been introduced  
so that a loss in one year will be offset against 
profits in another. 
The revised arrangements involve an allocation 
of 4% of relevant underwriting profit to the PC 
element, compared with up to 4.83% previously. 
The GAAP performance award element has 
been modelled to cost an estimated further  
1% of profit over an underwriting cycle, making 
estimated total potential rewards of 5% of 
relevant underwriting profit overall. 
For all underwriting years, the PC element will 
continue to crystallise at the end of 36 months 
from the start of an underwriting year with,  
at the Committee’s discretion (which it has 
exercised in recent years), the possibility of 
payments on account of up to 30% of the 
forecast reward a year earlier. In this way, 
despite it being an annual scheme, rewards are 
based on an assessment of liabilities, and hence 
underwriting profits, struck between two and 
three years after business is written, by which 
time the uncertainty over the level of those 
liabilities has materially reduced. 
Payment made in, or as at the end of, 2011  
under the PC scheme to underwriters, including 
executive directors, are therefore bonuses 
principally in respect of performance in respect  
of the 2009 and 2010 underwriting years.  86

Longer term performance rewards
Performance Share Plan
The Amlin Performance Share Plan 2004 (PSP) 
is intended to aid the recruitment, retention, 
motivation and reward of a small number of key 
senior executives who are not underwriters, 
including relevant executive directors.  
Awards have been made each year since 2004. 
During the year awards were made to a total  
of 24 participants (2010: 24) over an aggregate 
of 697,807 shares (2010: 661,558). The 
Committee intends to continue making similar 
discretionary annual awards, although the 
criteria for inclusion may vary. The rules of  
the PSP provide that no individual may receive 
an annual award over shares valued on grant  
at more than 100% of base salary.
During 2011 the maximum such value  
was awarded to the Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director. Once the vesting level is 
determined after five years in accordance with 
the performance condition, and provided the 
relevant participant is still employed by the 
Group, an award can be exercised within the 
following 30 months. In certain restricted  
or exceptional circumstances, and with the 
agreement of the Committee, an early leaver 
may be able to exercise early on a pro rata basis 
(subject to a performance condition measurement 
over the shorter period to the leaving date).
PSP performance condition
The extent to which PSP awards vest depends  
on a sliding scale of the Group’s average annual 
post tax return on net tangible assets (Return on 
NTA) over the ensuing five years. This absolute 
performance measure balances the relative 
measures of the Group’s Long Term Incentive 
Plan. The average return is calculated after five 
years, with no re-testing. The targets and scales 
may vary with each grant at the discretion of  
the Committee but the scale for all of the grants 
to date is as detailed in this report ( pp93). 
The Committee may make adjustments to  
take account of variations in capital and similar 
matters. In the event of the Company being 
subject to a takeover or similar event before the 
normal vesting date, vesting will take place to  
the extent that the Committee is satisfied that the 
performance condition has been satisfied up to 
that early vesting date, with the proportion of the 
award which vests also depending on the time 
that has elapsed since the award was made.
Capital Builder Plan
The Amlin Capital Builder Plan 2006 (Plan)  
is designed to reward senior underwriters  
if they exceed long term target underwriting 
returns over rolling five year performance 
periods. The Committee believes that the  
Capital Builder Plan is a significant retention  
and recruitment tool for those underwriters who 
are likely to be most significant in determining 
the Group’s underwriting profitability and 
development over each performance period. 
Awards have been made under the Plan to 
between 50 and 60 participants from Amlin 
London, Amlin UK and Amlin Bermuda in 2006 
to 2011 inclusive and are intended to be made 
on a similar basis in 2012. A similar Plan has 
been introduced for employees in Amlin AG. 
Payments under the Plan may be made at the 
Company’s discretion in either cash or shares 
and have a cap of £1 million on the total amount 
that may be paid to a participant in respect  
of each rolling five year performance period. 
Payments will be made over the two years after 
the end of each performance period. The first 
payment under the current Plan, in respect  
of the performance period 2006 to 2010 was 
made in 2011. This payment was up to 70%  
of each pool allocated, with the balance to  
be paid in 2012. Payments in respect of the 
performance period 2007 to 2011 will be 
payable in 2012 based on the results to the  
end of 2011.
Amlin Long Term Incentive Plan 2006  
(the LTIP)
The LTIP replaced grants of executive share 
options from 2007 onwards. Both senior 
underwriters and senior non-underwriters, 
including executive directors, participate  
in the L TIP . Awards were made in 2011 to 108 
participants in all parts of the Group (2010: 86), 
over a total of 1,648,895 shares (2010: 
1,274,498). 
The L TIP’s primary performance condition is a 
relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measure. 
The precise performance conditions are set by 
the Committee at each award. For all the awards 
made to date the extent to which awards vest 
depends on the Company’s TSR over the ensuing 
three years relative to an index of TSRs the 
following is the comparator group of insurers.
The constituents of the index for the 2011 
awards were: Axa, Hannover Ruckversicherung 
AG., Muenchener Ruckversicherung AG., Royal 
Sun Alliance Insurance Group plc, SCOR S.E, 
Swiss Re, Zurich Financial Services Limited, 
Beazley plc, Catlin Group Limited, Chaucer 
Holdings plc, Hardy Underwriting Group plc, 
Hiscox plc, Novae Group plc, Ace Group,  
Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Argo Group 
International Holdings Limited, Chubb 
Corporation, Everest Re Group Limited, Fairfax 
Financial Holdings Limited, Markel Corporation, 
PartnerRe Limited, RenaissanceRe Holdings 
Limited, Transatlantic Holdings Incorporated, 
Validus Holdings Limited, White Mountains 
Insurance Group Limited, W.R. Berkley 
Corporation and XL Group plc. 
Irrespective of relative TSR, no award will  
vest unless the Committee is satisfied that  
the Company’s financial performance over  
the performance period has been satisfactory. 
The performance period is always a single three 
year period with no provision for re-testing the 
performance conditions. 
Awards may be made each year at the  
discretion of the Committee, based on seniority 
and with no individual receiving awards over 
shares having a market value on grant in excess 
of 100% of annual base salary (or, exceptionally, 
200% for a senior new recruit). In 2011 the 
maximum such value awarded was 100%  
of base salary to the Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director. Once the vesting level is 
determined after three years, and provided  
the relevant participant is still employed by  
the Group, awards are exercisable within the 
following 30 months. The L TIP’s provisions are 
similar to those of the PSP , as referred to above, 
on such matters as early leavers and variations 
in capital.
Executive share option schemes 
(Executive Option Schemes)
Executive share options were granted at the 
discretion of the Committee under the Approved 
and Unapproved Amlin Executive Share Option 
Schemes each year from 1997 to 2006 to 
executive directors and other staff (whether 
underwriters or not) above a certain level  
of seniority and were subject to performance 
conditions. No further grants can be made.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Executive Director arrangements
Policy on service agreements and  
their termination
The Group does not offer service agreements 
with notice periods in excess of six months, 
except in the case of executive directors  
of the Company and the most senior level of 
management for whom up to a 12 month notice 
period may apply. The Company is mindful  
of the need to balance the potential contractual 
advantages of longer notice periods against the 
potential cost in the event of termination at the 
Group’s initiative. In cases of early termination  
by the Group, the Group observes the guidance 
on best practice issued in December 2002 and 
subsequently revised in 2008, by the Association 
of British Insurers and the National Association  
of Pension Funds. In such circumstances, the 
Group seeks to reduce, where practicable, the 
compensation payable by taking account of the 
duty of the employee to mitigate his or her loss.
In particular, consideration is given to structuring 
a proportion of termination payments on a 
phased payment basis pending the executive 
finding new employment. The need to take a 
robust view in settling cases involving poor 
performance is also recognised. Details of each 
executive director’s service contract applicable 
during the year are set out in the section entitled 
‘Executive directors’ service contracts’ below. 
Policy on outside appointments
The Group’s policy is to allow executive directors 
and other appropriate senior employees to 
accept one substantive non-Amlin related outside 
non-executive appointment, subject to permission 
being obtained in each case and to acceptable 
procedures for managing any potential conflicts 
of interest. Such appointments are in the Group’s 
interest and can often provide useful experience 
for the executive concerned. The Committee has 
a policy that the first £30,000 per annum of such 
fees earned are retained by the employee.
Executive directors’ service contracts
The dates of the service or employment contracts 
of each director who served as an executive 
during the year, all of which are with the 
Company’s subsidiary, Amlin Corporate Services 
Limited, are as stated below. Salaries have been 
periodically reviewed since the original contract 
dates, with the current annual base salaries as  
at the date of this report being as stated below.

S C W Beale 7 Nov 1994 £312,000

R A Hextall 26 Nov 1999 £420,000
C E L Philipps 20 Feb 1997 £565,000
All of the contracts remain in force at the date  
of this report and are on a full time basis. The 
contracts provide for 12 months’ notice of 
termination by either party. There are no special 
provisions for compensation on termination  
in any director’s contract other than that the 
employer has the right to pay salary in lieu of  
any required period of notice. Executive directors’ 
service or employment contracts are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office. 
Shareholding targets
An objective was set when the Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced in 2006  
that executive directors would retain or build up 
shareholdings in the Company to the value of at 
least 125% of their base salaries and other senior 
executives to the value of at least 50%. The 
shareholdings of all the executive directors were 
above the target throughout 2011, mostly by a 
substantial margin. Of the other senior executives 
covered by the policy (the Group Management 
Committee), all those who have been with the 
Group since 2006 have met their shareholding 
targets and the rest are expected to do so as 
incentive plans vest. The targets were reviewed 
by the Board during the year and re-affirmed as 
remaining appropriate. The Committee believes 
that the combination of these shareholdings and 
the structure of performance incentives continue 
to ensure that the interests of management and 
shareholders in the success of the Company are 
closely aligned.
Non executive Director 
arrangements
The fees paid during the year to non-executive 
directors of the Company are included in the 
‘Directors’ remuneration received’ table earlier  
in this report ( pp83). Such fees, other than 
those of the Chairman, are determined by the 
Board. The Board receives recommendations  
in this respect from a committee chaired by the 
Chairman, with the Chief Executive and two other 
directors (one executive and one non-executive 
member of the Committee, each of which  
rotates each year) as the other members. 
Recommendations and decisions are made 
taking account of professional advice and other 
information on the level of such fees paid by 
comparable companies for comparable services.
The Chairman’s remuneration is determined  
by similar criteria, but by the Remuneration 
Committee. The minimum time commitments 
given by each director, as detailed in Annex 1  
All-employee share plans
The Company offers HM Revenue and Customs 
approved Sharesave options, the current plan 
having been adopted in 2008 with a ten year life 
for new grants. An annual offer was made in 
September 2011. Sharesave offers are made 
under the plan to staff in all jurisdictions where 
local tax and regulation makes this practicable 
without amending the plan, which does not 
include Continental Europe. The 2011 sharesave 
offer was open to all applicable employees who 
were employed by the Group on 1 July 2011. 
Exercises are not subject to any performance 
condition. The Committee considers that  
the plans are successful in encouraging staff  
at all levels to build up interests in the Company 
at an acceptable accounting and administrative 
cost to the Company. Since 2007 the Company 
has also operated a HM Revenue and Customs 
approved all employee Share Incentive Plan 
(SIP) allowing offers of shares at no cost  
to employees. Such free shares are offered  
or allocated to all Group staff meeting  
an employment qualification period. The 
Committee has a policy of making an award  
of free shares each year, on an equal basis  
to all eligible executive directors and staff 
(subject to a pro rata adjustment, where 
permitted, for part time employees), subject to 
the annual results. The quantum, between nil 
and the annual maximum level of £3,000 worth 
of shares per employee, is decided in the light  
of the return on equity achieved in the previous 
year. In March 2011, the level was £1,000 
(2010: £3,000) with a take-up of 98% of eligible 
employees (2010: 98%). Reflecting 2011’s ROE 
being lower than an appropriate threshold no 
award will be made in 2012.  88

Executive directors’ pensions
Pension details, as applicable for each executive director who served as a Director during the year (non-executives not being eligible), are shown in the table 
below. Mr Beale’s figures are for the full year, notwithstanding him joining the Board part way through. The total DC employer contributions for the directors 
were £133,366 (2010: £194,269). The increase in accrued pension during the year is before the effects of inflation. The changes in total transfer values 
during the year are shown before the effects of inflation and after deduction of the individual’s DB contributions during the year. The inflation measure used 
for the purposes of this disclosure is the change in RPI.
Transfer values are calculated in accordance with regulations 7 to 7E of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) Regulations 1996, as amended. 
Only base salary is pensionable.

to the Board Corporate Governance statements, 
are also taken into account. The Board’s policy  
is that non-executive fees should be set by 
reference to the fees paid by financial services 
companies and listed companies generally of a 
similar size and complexity. Each non-executive 
director is paid a basic fee and is paid further  
for additional services, such as committee  
or subsidiary Board responsibilities.
Non-executive directors have contracts for 
services rather than employment contracts.  
They are not eligible for any of the Group’s 
pension, share or incentive schemes but may,
by the agreement of the Board, be paid additional 
fees (calculated on an appropriate day rate)  
in the event of exceptional levels of additional 
time being required, for instance in response  
to corporate developments. No such fees  
were paid in 2011 (2010: nil). Their terms  
of appointment are formalised in letters of 
appointment, copies of which are available  
for inspection at the Company’s registered  
office and which are updated from time to time. 
Non-executive directors are appointed on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee 
and they may be removed, or not nominated for 
re-election, in each case in accordance with the 
Articles of Association of the Company and the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2010. 
If at the end of a term of office a non-executive 
director is not nominated to continue, the  
director is not entitled to any extra payment  
on termination. In other circumstances three 
months’ notice of termination may be given  
by either side or, in the case of notice by the 
Company, three months’ fees in lieu of notice. Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
Executive directors’ Capital Builder Plan participations and estimates to date
The applicable classes of business which will determine the rewards payable to each of the directors of the Company participating in the Capital Builder  
Plan are the classes which they themselves underwrite (or underwrote) or the classes over which they had direct influence at the relevant time and the 
underwriting results of Syndicate 2001 (the part of the business in which both directors were principally engaged) as a whole. There was no material change 
in the classes in which Mr Carpenter participates between the 2010 and 2011 awards. Awards were made in each of the years 2007 to 2011 inclusive, in 
respect of performance periods of five underwriting years commencing in the year each respective award was made. Forecasts of rewards in respect of all 
performance periods are subject to change, particularly in respect of later performance periods. Subject to that caveat, the forecast rewards based on earned 
premium and reserving as at 31 December 2011, for the periods stated to date, are as set out below. Where a positive result on the syndicate is less than  
a shortfall against the demanding return targets on individual classes, no payment will be due (as in the case of Mr Carpenter on each of the years as 
estimated to date).

Executive director’s PSP , LTIP and Share Option participations
As described earlier in this report, all of these incentive plans involve options being granted to relevant UK-based participants over shares in the Company, 
whether at exercise prices determined in relation to the market price at the date of grant (executive options), a discount to such price (Sharesave) or at  
a nominal exercise price of £1 in total per exercise (PSP and LTIP). As at 31 December 2011 the options held under these plans by executive directors,  
all of whom were directors throughout the year, and any changes during the year, are set out in the tables on the next two pages. In addition each executive 
director was awarded 260 free shares in the SIP in April 2011 (2010: 772). SIP shareholdings are included in the directors’ shareholding interests set out  
in the Directors’ report. The share price on the date of directors’ 2011 PSP and LTIP awards (8 March) was 398.6p.

Measurements against PSP performance conditions were determined by the Committee in early 2011 and early 2012 respectively and are summarized 
above. For 2006 awards the average return on net tangible assets over the ensuing five year period exceeded the threshold for maximum vesting of 20%. 
For 2007 awards the average return on net tangible assets over the ensuing five year period was 19.4% and therefore only 97.6% of the award vested.

Measurements against LTIP performance conditions were similarly determined. In this case the primary performance conditions only partly met in 2007 
leading to a partial vesting of the award. For the 2009 award the Committee concluded that a nil vesting was appropriate.
Use of unissued and existing shares for incentive plans
The rules of all those of the Company’s incentive plans which can result in the issue or transfer of shares to participants include limits on the overall number 
of unissued shares over which options may be granted. The only employee schemes under which either unissued or treasury shares are committed to be 
issued are the executive share option schemes, the Sharesave plans and the schedules to the PSP and LTIP applying to awards to participants in Continental 
Europe. New shares were also issued in 2007 to the trustee of the Share Incentive Plan as SIP Free Shares but in subsequent years such shares were 
purchased in the market. Shares awarded under the PSP and LTIP are intended to be satisfied from shares held, or to be purchased, by the Group’s ESOT 
unless overseas requirements dictate otherwise. 
Grants of options over new and/or treasury shares under any selective plan, after deducting any such options which have lapsed, are limited to 5% of the 
issued share capital in any 10 year period. Grants over new/treasury shares under any scheme are also limited to 10% over 10 years. The percentages  
of the year end shares in issue, together with the equivalent percentages a year earlier, relating to each of these limits are shown in the table below.

Of the total potential commitment of the ESOT as at 31 December 2011 (which is presented on the basis that all awards vest in full), it then held (and holds 
as at the date of this report) 2,179,168 shares (2010: 2,811,679 against a commitment of 4,549,356). It is intended that the balance will be purchased in 
the market by the ESOT, using funds advanced by the Company, before they are required. The changes in the shares held by the ESOT during 2011 resulted 
from the exercises of options and vesting of awards over a total of 632,511 shares.
Total Shareholder Return performance
The graphs below illustrate the total shareholder return performance of the Company’s ordinary shares relative to the FTSE 350 and the FTSE All Share 
Insurance indices respectively (Amlin’s shares are a constituent of both) over the five years to 31 December 2011. Comparisons are shown with both these 
indices as the performance of Amlin’s shares is affected both by the general UK stock market in companies of its size and by its insurance sector. The graphs 
show the values, at each year end from 2006 to 2011 inclusive, of £100 invested in the Company’s shares on 31 December 2006 compared with the values 
of £100 invested in the relevant index on the same date. To produce a fair value, each point on the graphs is the average of the relevant return index over 
the 30 days preceding the relevant year end.

Other Statutory Information 
Principal activity, Business Review  
and key performance indicators
The Group’s principal activity is non-life insurance 
and reinsurance underwriting in the Lloyd’s 
market, Bermuda and Continental Europe.  
A review of the Group’s business, and 
developments during the year, is set out  
in the Annual Report (Strategic Overview  
and Performance sections,  pp2). Further 
information is provided in the risk disclosure  
note and in this Governance section of the Annual 
Report ( pp111 and  pp59 respectively).  
The Review and Performance sections, risk 
disclosure note and Governance section together 
include the information and analysis required  
by section 417 of the Companies Act 2006  
to be included in a Business Review, including 
information on key performance indicators, the 
Group’s financial and risk management policies. 
Such information and analysis is hereby 
incorporated by reference into this report.
Share capital, treasury shares and 
dividends
The Company’s share capital during  
the year consisted of ordinary shares  
of 28.125p each (Shares).
There were 502,076,006 Shares in issue,  
at the year end (2010: 502,076,006), including 
Shares held in treasury throughout the year.  
No Shares were bought back into treasury during 
the year (2010: also nil). 488,309 Shares were 
transferred out of treasury during the year to 
service exercises of employee share options 
(2010: 1,270,343), leaving 5,387,392 Shares  
in treasury at the year end (2010: 5,875,701). 
There have been no issues of Shares or further 
share buy backs or transfers into treasury since 
the year end but a further 32,663 Shares had  
by 29 February 2012 been transferred from 
treasury to satisfy employee share options, 
leaving 5,354,729 Shares in treasury at that date.
An interim dividend of 7.2p per share  
(2010: 7.2p) was paid on 6 October 2011 to 
shareholders on the register on 9 September 
2011. The directors now propose a final dividend 
of 15.8p per Share (2010: a second interim  
of 15.8p), to be paid on 24 May 2012 to 
shareholders on the register at the close  
of business on 10 April 2012. This makes  
total dividends for the year of 23.0p per share 
(2010: 23.0p). Those shareholders wishing  
to use any of these dividends to purchase further 
shares were, and are, able to participate in a 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Details of the Plan 
are available on the Company’s website and 
shareholders are being reminded of the Plan  
as this Annual Report is being published. 
Directors
The directors’ biographical details are set out 
earlier in this report ( pp60). Mr Holt retired  
at the end of the 2011 Annual General Meeting 
and Mr Beale was appointed as a director at that 
same meeting. Sir Alan Collins was appointed  
on 14 November 2011. All directors, save for  
Mr Taylor, will offer themselves for election or 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting on  
17 May 2012 (AGM), in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code provision for annual 
re-election of all FTSE 350 companies’ directors 
or in accordance with the Company’s Articles  
of Association. This is detailed in the separate 
Notice of AGM, and as referred to in the Board 
Corporate Governance Statement.

Corporate governance and  
Directors’ remuneration
The Board Corporate Governance Statement  
and reports from the Board’s Nomination,  
Audit and Risk & Solvency Committees are set 
out with other reports earlier in this Governance 
section. Details of the Company’s rules on the 
appointment and removal of directors, and on 
how the Company’s Articles of Association may 
be amended, are set out in the section entitled 
‘Articles of Association’ in the Board Corporate 
Governance Statement ( pp71). Details of 
Directors’ remuneration and of the Board’s 
Remuneration Committee are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, also earlier  
in this Governance section.
Employment policies
The People section of the Review provides 
commentary on the Group as an employer, 
including its commitment to training and 
professional development. The Group recognises 
the importance of employee engagement and 
therefore operates the Amlin Consultation Forum 
in the UK and Works Councils in the Netherlands 
and Belgium as frameworks for discussion and 
consultation between staff and management  
in these three countries where the great majority 
of Group employees work. In addition to 
engagement through line managers, employee 
communication is also facilitated by intranet 
communication and a regular Group e-newsletter. 
The Group’s equal opportunities policy aims  
to ensure that no employee, in application for 
initial employment or as an existing employee 
(including in the event of a change in his or  
her circumstances), receives less favourable 
treatment because of his or her gender  
(including gender reassignment), marital  
or family status, actual or perceived sexual 
orientation, age, ethnic origin, race, colour, 
nationality, national origin, creed, political 
affiliation, part-time status, disability, or any  
other condition, unless differing treatment  
can be shown to be legally justifiable. Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
Copies of the Group’s policies, some applying  
to the whole Group and some to the UK with 
local variations outside the UK, on professional 
qualifications, family leave, flexible working, 
sabbaticals, staff harassment and equal 
opportunities are available on the Company’s 
website or from the Secretary on request.  
The Group’s health and safety policy and details 
of its local application are publicised to staff, 
including by intranet. Its operation in the UK  
is monitored by a staff Health and Safety 
Committee. The Chief Operations Officer,  
Mr Andrew Grant, who reports to the Group  
Chief Executive, is responsible for oversight  
of health and safety throughout the Group.
Corporate responsibility and  
charitable donations
A Corporate Responsibility report is set out  
earlier in this Governance section ( pp78).  
The Group Chief Executive is responsible  
at Board level for leading, and reporting to the 
Board on, the Group’s initiatives on corporate 
responsibility related matters. Relevant policies 
and terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website.
As part of a wider corporate responsibility  
and community budget, the Group made 
charitable donations during the year of £169,193 
(2010: £142,287). The charities budget in the  
UK is managed by a Community and Charities 
Panel chaired by a senior underwriter. Non-UK 
subsidiaries’ community and charities budgets 
are managed locally under the direction  
of their boards.
Political donations
The Group made no political donations during  
the year (2010: nil). 
Supplier payment policy and 
performance
The Group’s policy is to pay suppliers in 
accordance with agreed terms of business. 
Whenever possible, purchase orders are placed 
on the basis of the Group’s standard terms  
and conditions which include provision for the 
payment of suppliers within 30 days of the end  
of the month in which the Group receives the 
goods or in which the services are provided. 
During the year there was a review of trading 
terms and a revised policy was adopted by the 
Group, creditor days represented approximately 
30 days (2010: 30 days). 
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of AGM, to be held at noon on 
Thursday 17 May 2012 at the offices of the 
Company at St Helen’s, 1 Undershaft, London, 
EC3A 8ND, is contained in a separate circular to 
shareholders which is being mailed or otherwise 
provided to shareholders at the same time  
as this report.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has made third party indemnity 
provisions for the benefit of its directors and 
certain directors of the Company’s subsidiaries. 
The current indemnities of the directors of the 
Company were entered into during 2008,  
with the exception of Mrs Bosse (2009) and  
Sir Alan Collins (2011). All of such indemnities 
remain in force at the date of this report.
Authorisation of directors’ conflicts  
of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association permit  
the authorisation of a director’s potential conflict 
of interest or duty, for instance arising from a 
director’s appointment as a director of another 
company which may have a business relationship 
with the Group. Such authorisations may be given 
by the remaining directors who are independent 
of the potential conflict. A number of 
authorisations have been approved by the Board 
in this manner. Such authorisations do not 
remove a director’s duty to ensure that any actual 
conflict of interest or duty, should it arise, is dealt 
with appropriately, usually by the director taking 
no part in the relevant Board or Committee 
decision. A Register of approved Conflicts is 
maintained and available for inspection at the 
Company’s Registered Office.
Going concern 
The Group’s business, risk and financial 
management, performance and position, 
together with factors that are likely to affect 
future development, are described in the 
Performance section of this Annual Report  
( pp36). Capital management strategy, which 
covers how regulatory and economic capital 
needs are measured and how capital is deployed, 
is described under Financial Management  
on page ( pp50). The financial position  
of the Group, including commentary on cash  
and investment levels, currency management, 
insurance liability management, liquidity and 
borrowings, is also covered in that section. 
In addition note 2 to the accounts describes 
capital management needs and policies, and  
note 3 covers underwriting, market, liquidity and 
credit risks which may affect the financial position 
of the Group. 
The Group has considerable financial resources  
to meet its financial needs and, in much of the 
Group, manages a mature portfolio of insurance 
risk through an experienced and stable team. The 
directors believe that the Group is well positioned 
to manage its business risks successfully in the 
current uncertain economic environment.
After making enquiries, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the annual 
report and accounts.
Directors’ Responsibilities
Directors’ statement on the disclosure  
of information to the auditors
Each director at the date of the approval  
of this report confirms that:
  so far as they are aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and
  they have taken all the steps that they  
ought to have taken as a director in order  
to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish  
that the Company’s auditors are aware  
of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions  
of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Auditors
A resolution is to be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting for the re appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors  
and to authorise the Audit Committee  
to determine their remuneration.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
The directors are responsible for preparing  
the Annual Report, the Remuneration Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
the law the directors have prepared the Group 
and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view if 
the state of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to: 
  Select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
  Make judgements and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; 
  State whether applicable IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements; 
  Prepare the financial statements on the  
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the company will continue  
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient  
to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and 
the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the  
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website and legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination  
of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
Pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority each  
of the directors, whose names and functions are 
listed in the section of the Annual Report entitled 
‘Board of Directors’ confirm that, to the best of 
each person’s knowledge and belief: 
  The financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the  
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and loss of the 
Group and Company; and 
  The directors’ report contained in the  
annual report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and Group, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Amlin plc
We have audited the group financial statements 
of Amlin plc for the year ended 31 December 
2011 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, and the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows and the related notes 1-40.  
The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on page 96, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the group financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has  
been prepared for and only for the company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for  
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about  
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Amlin Annual Report 
2011 to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications  
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the group financial statements: 
  give a true and fair view of the state of the 
group’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of 
its loss and cash flows for the year then ended; 
  have been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
and 
  have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006  
and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
  the information given in the Directors’  
Report for the financial year for which the 
group financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the group financial statements; 
and
  the information given in the Corporate 
Governance Statement set out on pages 62-71 
with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems and about share  
capital structures is consistent with the 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required  
to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect  
of the following: 
  Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
  we have not received all the information  
and explanations we require for our audit; or
  a corporate governance statement has not 
been prepared by the parent company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
  the directors’ statement, set out on page 95,  
in relation to going concern; 
  the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code specified  
for our review; and
  certain elements of the report to shareholders 
by the Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent 
company financial statements of Amlin plc  
for the year ended 31 December 2011 and on 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
Notes to the accounts 
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
 
1. Summary of significant accounting 
policies and critical accounting 
judgements and estimates 
Amlin plc (the Company) is a public limited 
company registered in England and Wales.  
The address of the registered office is  
St Helen’s, 1 Undershaft, London EC3A 8ND. 
The basis of preparation, basis of consolidation 
and significant accounting policies adopted in 
the preparation of Amlin plc and subsidiaries’ 
(the Group) consolidated financial statements 
are set out below. 
Basis of preparation 
These consolidated financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted for use in the European Union (EU). 
The consolidated financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation and 
Companies Act 2006.  
The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on the historical cost basis 
except for cash and cash equivalents, financial 
assets and liabilities, share options, and pension 
assets which are measured at their fair value.  
Except where otherwise stated, all figures 
included in the consolidated financial 
statements are presented in millions of British 
Pounds Sterling (sterling) shown as £m rounded 
to the nearest £100,000. 
The accounting policies adopted in preparing 
these financial statements are consistent with 
those followed in the preparation of the Group’s 
annual financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2010, unless otherwise stated. 
In accordance with IFRS 4, the Group has 
applied existing accounting practices for 
insurance contracts, modified as appropriate,  
to comply with the IFRS framework and 
applicable standards. 
As a result of Amlin Re Europe’s inclusion  
as a separate reportable segment and minor 
modifications to the internal reporting to the 
chief operating decision maker, the 
comparative segmental reporting information 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 has 
been restated. Further details are provided  
in note 4. 
As part of the process to improve the 
presentation of the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements, certain changes have been 
made to the presentation of underwriting and 
non-underwriting expenses in note 9, derivative 
financial instruments in note 3.3 (fair value 
hierarchy) and note 17, loans and receivables in 
note 19, deferred acquisition costs in note 20 
and other payables in note 30, to better reflect 
the nature of underlying transactions. 
Improvements have also been made in the 
presentation relating to the average number  
of employees in note 11, amounts receivable  
by directors and key management personnel 
under long term incentive schemes in note 10 
and note 38 and share options and awards  
in note 28. These changes in presentation  
have no effect on the previously reported net 
income, shareholders’ equity or net assets. 
Comparative information has been amended  
to reflect these changes. 
Basis of consolidation 
The financial statements consolidate the 
accounts of the Company and subsidiary 
undertakings, including the Group’s 
underwriting through participation on Lloyd’s 
syndicates. Subsidiaries are those entities  
in which the Group, directly or indirectly,  
has the power to govern the operating and 
financial policies in order to gain economic 
benefits or are, in substance, controlled  
by the Group and includes the Company’s 
employee benefit trusts. The financial 
statements of all subsidiaries are prepared for 
the same reporting year as the parent company. 
Consolidation adjustments are made to convert 
subsidiary accounts prepared under different 
accounting standards into IFRS so as to remove 
the effects of any different accounting policies 
that may exist. Subsidiaries are consolidated 
from the date that control is transferred to the 
Group and cease to be consolidated from the 
date that control is transferred out.  
All inter-company balances, profits and 
transactions are eliminated. 
Details of principal subsidiaries included within 
the consolidated financial statements can be 
found in note 37. 
Adoption of new and revised Standards 
(a) Standards, amendments to published standards 
and interpretations effective on or after 1 January 
2011 
The accounting policies adopted are  
consistent with those of the previous financial 
year, except for the following new and amended 
IFRS and IFRIC interpretations effective as  
of 1 January 2011: 
• IAS 24 (revised), ‘Related party disclosures’ 
• IAS 32 (amended), ‘Financial instruments: 
Presentation – Classification of rights 
issues’ 
• IFRIC 14 (amended), ‘Prepayments  
of a minimum funding requirement’ 
• IFRIC 19, ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities 
with equity instruments’ 
• Annual improvements to IFRSs. 
Adoption of these revised standards and 
interpretations did not have any material  
effect on the financial performance or position 
of the Group.  
The effects of these changes are as follows: 
IAS 24 (revised), ‘Related party disclosures’  
IAS 24 (revised) clarifies the definition  
of a related party to simplify the identification  
of such relationships and to eliminate 
inconsistencies in its application. The revised 
standard introduces a partial exemption of 
disclosure requirements for government-related 
entities. There is no material impact on the 
Group or Company’s financial statements.  
IAS 32 (amended), ‘Financial instruments: 
Presentation – Classification of rights issues’ 
IAS 32 (amended) amends the definition  
of a financial liability in order to classify rights 
issues (and certain options or warrants) as 
equity instruments in cases where such rights 
are given pro rata to all of the existing owners 
of the same class of an entity’s non-derivative 
equity instruments, or to acquire a fixed 
number of the entity’s own equity instruments 
for a fixed amount in any currency. There  
is no impact on the Group or Company’s 
financial statements. 
IFRIC 14 (amended), ‘Prepayments of a 
minimum funding requirement’ 
The amendment to IFRIC 14 provides guidance 
on assessing the recoverable amount of a net 
pension asset. The amendment permits an 
entity to treat the prepayment of a minimum 
funding requirement as an asset. The 
amendment does not have an impact on the 
financial statements of the Group or Company. 
IFRIC 19, ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with 
equity instruments’ 
The interpretation clarifies that equity 
instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish  
a financial liability qualify as consideration paid.  
The equity instruments issued are measured  
at their fair value. In case this cannot be  
reliably measured, they are measured at the  
fair value of the liability extinguished. Any gain 
or loss is recognised immediately in profit or 
loss. The adoption of this interpretation has no  
effect on the financial statements of the Group 
or Company.  104

Annual improvements to IFRSs 2009-2010 
In May 2010, the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) issued its annual 
amendments to IFRSs and the related Bases  
for Conclusions and guidance made. The IASB 
uses the annual improvements process to make 
necessary, but non-urgent, amendments to 
IFRSs that will not be included as part of a 
major project. The amendments primarily 
remove inconsistencies and clarify wording.  
The Group has adopted the amendments to 
standards as they come into effect for the 
reporting period beginning on 1 January 2011. 
However, these amendments have no material 
impact on the Group or Company’s financial 
statements. 
(b) Standards, amendments to published standards 
and interpretations early adopted by the Group 
In 2011, the Group did not early adopt any 
new, revised or amended standards. 
(c) Standards, amendments to published standards 
and interpretations that are not yet effective and 
have not been early adopted by the Group 
Standards issued but not yet effective up to  
the date of issuance of the Group’s financial 
statements are listed below. The Group  
intends to adopt these standards when they 
become effective. 
IFRS 7 (amended), ‘Financial instruments: 
Disclosures – Transfers of financial assets’ 
The amendment to IFRS 7 is effective for  
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. 
The amendment introduces more extensive 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about 
the transfer of financial assets to assist users  
in understanding the implications of transfers  
of financial assets and the potential risks that 
may remain with the transferor. The amendment  
is deemed to have no material impact on the 
Group or Company’s financial statements. 
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments: Classification 
and measurement’ 
IFRS 9 as issued reflects the first phase  
of the Board’s work on the replacement  
of IAS 39 and applies to the classification and 
measurement of financial assets as defined  
in IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition 
and measurement’. The standard is proposed  
to be effective for annual periods beginning on  
or after 1 January 2015
1
. In subsequent phases, 
the Board will address hedge accounting and 
derecognition. The adoption of IFRS 9 will have 
an effect on the classification and measurement 
of the Group’s financial assets.  
(1) Subject to EU endorsement 
However, the Group has determined that the 
effect shall be quantified in conjunction with  
the other phases when issued to present a 
comprehensive picture. 
IFRS 9 amendments to incorporate financial 
liabilities 
The amendments to IFRS 9 issued in October 
2010 incorporate the classification and 
measurement of financial liabilities and are 
proposed to be effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2015
1
.  
The amendments only affect the measurement 
of financial liabilities designated at fair value 
through profit or loss using the Fair Value 
Option (FVO). All other requirements in IAS 39 
in respect of liabilities are carried forward  
into IFRS 9.  
For FVO liabilities, the amount of change  
in the fair value of a liability that is attributable 
to changes in own credit risk must be presented 
in other comprehensive income (OCI). The 
remainder of the change in fair value is 
presented in profit or loss, unless presentation 
of the fair value change in respect of the 
liability’s credit risk in OCI would create  
or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit  
or loss. The amendments are deemed to have 
no impact on the financial statements of  
the Group. 
IFRS 7 (amended), ‘Financial instruments: 
Disclosures – Offsetting financial assets and 
financial liabilities’ 
The amendment to IFRS 7 is effective for 
annual reporting periods beginning on or  
after 1 January 2013
1
. The amendment 
introduces new disclosure requirements 
intended to allow investors to better compare 
the different offsetting of financial assets and 
financial liabilities under IFRS and US GAAP. 
The amendment is likely to have an impact  
on the disclosures made by the Group in respect 
of its financial assets and financial liabilities. 
IAS 32 (amended), ‘Financial instruments: 
Presentation – Offsetting financial assets and 
financial liabilities’ 
The amendments to IAS 32 clarify the 
requirements for offsetting financial instruments 
and are applicable for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014
1
. The 
amendments are not expected to have a 
material impact on the financial statements  
of the Group on adoption. 
IAS 12 (amended), ‘Income taxes – Deferred tax: 
Recovery of underlying assets’ 
The amendments to IAS 12 relate to the 
measurement of deferred tax on investment 
properties. They are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2012
1
 and will 
have no impact on the financial statements  
of the Group or Company on adoption. 
IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ 
IFRS 10 is effective for annual periods 
beginning 1 January 2013
1
, with retrospective 
application. It replaces the portion of IAS 27, 
‘Consolidated and separate financial 
statements’ that addresses the accounting for 
consolidated financial statements. IFRS revises 
the definition of ‘control’, the key factor in 
determining whether an entity is consolidated. 
The adoption of IFRS 10 may have an impact 
on which entities the Group consolidates within 
its financial statements. 
IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ 
IFRS 11 is effective for annual periods 
beginning 1 January 2013
1
, with retrospective 
application. It replaces IAS 31, ‘Interests in joint 
ventures’ and SIC-13, ‘Jointly-controlled entities 
– non-monetary contributions by venturers’. 
The standard clarifies the definition of a joint 
arrangement and uses the principle of control  
in IFRS 10 to define joint control. The standard 
also removes the option to account for jointly-
controlled entities using the proportional 
consolidation method. The standard is not 
expected to have a significant impact on the 
financial statements of the Group. 
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of interests in other 
entities’ 
IFRS 12 is effective for annual periods 
beginning 1 January 2013
1
, with retrospective 
application. It includes all of the disclosures  
that were previously included in IAS 27 related  
to consolidated financial statements, as well  
as all of the disclosures that were previously 
included in IAS 31 and IAS 28, ‘Investment  
in associates’. A number of new disclosures are 
also required, including the judgements made 
by management in determining whether it 
controls an entity. The standard will impact  
the disclosures made by the Group in respect  
of its interests in subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements and associates on adoption. 
IAS 27, ‘Separate financial statements’ and  
IAS 28, ‘Investments in associates and joint 
ventures’ 
As a result of the issuance of IFRS 10, IFRS 11 
and IFRS 12, consequential amendments have 
been made to IAS 27 and IAS 28. IAS 27 now 
contains requirements only relating to separate 
financial statements, while the amendments  
to IAS 28 incorporate the accounting for joint 
ventures. Both standards have been renamed 
as a result of these amendments, and are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2013
1
.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
 
   
IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ 
IFRS 13 is effective for annual periods 
beginning 1 January 2013
1
 and is to be applied 
prospectively. The standard establishes a single 
source of guidance under IFRS for fair value 
measurement and introduces new disclosures 
to help users to better assess the valuation 
techniques and inputs used to measure fair 
value. The standard will impact the disclosures 
made by the Group in respect of fair value 
measurement on adoption. 
IAS 1 (amended), ‘Presentation of financial 
statements’ 
The amendment to IAS 1 is effective for annual 
periods beginning 1 July 2012
1
. The 
amendment will require companies to group 
together items within other comprehensive 
income that may be reclassified to the profit  
or loss section of the income statement. The 
amendments reaffirm existing requirements 
that items in other comprehensive income  
and profit or loss should be presented as  
either a single statement or two consecutive 
statements. Upon adoption, the amendment 
will result in changes to the presentation of the 
Group’s other comprehensive income. 
IAS 19 (amended), ‘Employee benefits’ 
The amendment to IAS 19 is effective for 
annual periods beginning 1 January 2013
1
 and 
is to be applied retrospectively. The amendment 
eliminates the option to defer the recognition  
of gains and losses resulting from defined 
benefit plans (referred to as the ‘corridor’ 
approach), removes the options for the 
presentation of gains and losses relating  
to those plans and improves the disclosure 
requirements in respect of defined benefit  
plans and the risks arising on those plans.  
The amendment will impact the presentation  
of gains and losses and disclosures in respect  
of the Group’s defined benefit plans. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of financial statements requires 
the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities. Although these estimates 
are based on management’s best knowledge  
of current events and actions, actual results 
may ultimately differ from those estimates. 
Insurance contract liabilities 
The most significant estimate made in the 
financial statements relates to unpaid insurance 
claim reserves and related loss adjustment 
expenses of the Group.  
The estimated provision for the total level of 
claims incurred changes as more information 
becomes known about the actual losses for 
which the initial provisions were set up. The 
change in claims costs for prior period insurance 
claims represents the claims development of 
earlier reported years incurred in the current 
accounting period. The carrying value of the 
Group’s net outstanding claims reserves  
at 31 December 2011 is £2,656.6 million  
(2010: £2,248.8 million). In 2011, there has 
been a net positive development of £112.6 
million (2010: £156.5 million) for the Group, 
reflecting favourable experience in the 2010  
and prior reported years. Note 3 provides  
further details of the method the Group applies  
in estimating insurance contract liabilities. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
The methods and assumptions used by the 
Group and Company in estimating the fair value 
of financial assets and financial liabilities are 
described in note 3. The carrying values of the 
Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities 
at 31 December 2011 are £4,080.4 million 
(2010: £4,310.1 million) and £11.0 million 
(2010: £9.7 million) respectively. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are recognised on the 
acquisition of a subsidiary, on the purchase  
of specific rights to renew a particular 
underwriting portfolio and on internally 
developed computer software. 
The value of such intangibles arising from the 
acquisition of a subsidiary or specific renewal 
rights is largely based on the expected cash 
flows of the business acquired and contractual 
rights on that business. Certain key 
assumptions are used to assess the value  
of the intangible such as past underwriting 
performance and past renewal values of 
underwriting business. These are the subject  
of specific uncertainty and a reduction in 
underwriting profitability or renewal patterns  
of business acquired may result in the value  
of the intangible being impaired and written  
off in the current accounting period.  
The value of computer software comprises all 
costs directly attributable to its development.  
The carrying value of the Group’s intangible 
assets (excluding goodwill) at 31 December 
2011 is £142.3 million (2010: £122.7 million). 
Note 22 provides details of any current 
impairments of intangible assets. 
Goodwill impairment  
The Group determines whether goodwill  
is impaired at least on an annual basis.  
This requires an estimation of the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
goodwill is allocated. Details of the key 
assumptions used in the estimation of the 
recoverable amounts are contained in note 22. 
The Group has allocated goodwill to cash 
generating units based on a number of factors, 
which include how the entity’s operations are 
monitored. Note 22 provides further details. 
The carrying value at the reporting date of 
goodwill is £76.6 million (2010: £61.8 million).  
Taxation  
Uncertainties exist with respect to the 
interpretation of complex tax regulations  
and the amount and timing of future taxable 
income. The wide range of international 
business relationships and the long-term  
nature and complexity of existing contractual 
agreements could necessitate future 
adjustments to tax income and expense already 
recorded. The Group establishes provisions, 
based on reasonable estimates, for possible 
consequences of audits by the tax authorities  
of the respective countries in which it operates. 
The amount of such provisions is based on 
various factors, such as experience of previous 
tax audits and differing interpretations of tax 
regulations by the taxable entity and the 
responsible tax authority. Such differences  
of interpretation may arise on a wide variety  
of issues depending on the conditions  
prevailing in the country of the respective 
Group company’s domicile. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all 
unused tax losses to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which the losses can be utilised. 
Significant management judgement is required 
to determine the amount of deferred tax assets 
that can be recognised, based upon the likely 
timing and the level of future taxable profits, 
together with future tax planning strategies. 
The carrying value at the reporting date  
of the deferred tax asset is £26.9 million  
(2010: £14.7 million), and of the deferred tax 
liability is £42.4 million (2010: £87.8 million).  
Staff incentive plans 
The Group recognises a liability and expense  
for staff incentive plans based on a formula that 
takes into consideration the underwriting profit 
after certain adjustments. Underwriting profit  
is estimated based on current expectation of 
premiums and claims and will change as more 
information is known or future events occur. 
Where estimates change, related staff incentive 
plan liabilities may also change. 
The carrying value at the reporting date  
of the liability for the staff incentive plans  
is £31.1 million (2010: £48.6 million).  106

Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group participates in the Lloyd’s 
Superannuation Fund defined benefit scheme 
and also operates defined benefit schemes  
in the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. 
The amounts included in these financial 
statements are sensitive to changes in the 
assumptions used to derive the value of the 
scheme assets and liabilities.  
A loss of £18.3 million (2010: £5.9 million gain) 
has been recognised in the Statement  
of Comprehensive Income and a debit  
of £4.2 million (2010: £1.9 million) has been 
recognised in the Income Statement. Note 32 
provides further details on the Group’s 
retirement benefit obligations. At 31 December 
2011, the Group recognised a balance sheet 
liability of £30.8 million (2010: £15.3 million)  
in respect of its defined benefit plans. 
Significant accounting policies 
Foreign currency translation 
The Group and Company present their accounts 
in sterling since it is subject to regulation in the 
United Kingdom and the net assets, liabilities 
and income of the Group and Company are 
currently weighted towards sterling. US dollar 
and euro revenues are significant but the 
sterling revenue stream is also currently 
material. All Group entities conduct business  
in a range of economic environments, although 
these are primarily the United Kingdom, United 
States of America and Continental Europe.  
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated  
at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet 
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated at the rate prevailing in the period in 
which the asset or liability first arose. Exchange 
differences are recognised within other 
operating expenses. 
The results and financial position of those 
Group entities whose functional currency is not 
sterling are translated into sterling as follows: 
• Assets and liabilities for each balance  
sheet presented are translated at the 
closing exchange rate at the date of  
the balance sheet; 
• Income and expenses for each income 
statement are translated at the exchange 
rates at the date of each transaction, or a 
practical approximation to these rates; and 
• On consolidation all resulting exchange 
differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising  
on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated 
as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.  
Where contracts to sell currency have been 
entered into prior to the year end, the 
contracted rates have been used. Differences 
arising on the translation of foreign currency 
amounts on such items are included in other 
operating expenses. 
Details of the principal exchange rates used  
are included in note 33. 
Product classification 
Insurance contracts are defined as those 
containing significant insurance risk if, and  
only if, an insured event could cause an insurer 
to make significant additional payments in  
any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack 
commercial substance, at the inception of  
the contract.  
The significance of insurance risk is dependent 
on both the probability of an insured event  
and the magnitude of its potential effect.  
Any contracts not considered to be insurance 
contracts under IFRS are classified as 
investment contracts.  
Based on the current assessment, all of the 
products underwritten by the Group’s insurance 
entities are insurance contracts within the 
scope of IFRS 4, ‘Insurance contracts’.  
Insurance contracts premium 
Gross written premium comprise premium  
on insurance contracts incepting during the 
financial year together with adjustments to 
premiums written in previous accounting 
periods. The estimated premium income  
in respect of facility contracts, for example 
binding authorities and lineslips, is deemed  
to be written in full at the inception of the 
contract. Premium is disclosed before the 
deduction of brokerage and taxes or duties 
levied on them.  
The proportion of gross written premium, gross 
of commission payable, attributable to periods 
after the balance sheet date is deferred as a 
provision for unearned premium. The change in 
this provision is taken to the income statement 
in order that revenue is recognised over the 
period of the risk. 
Premium is recognised as earned over the 
policy contract period. The earned element  
is calculated separately for each contract on a 
365ths basis where the premium is apportioned 
over the period of risk. For premium written 
under facilities the earned element is calculated 
based on the estimated inception date and 
coverage period of the underlying contracts. 
Acquisition costs 
Acquisition costs comprise brokerage incurred 
on insurance contracts written during the 
financial year. They are incurred on the same 
basis as the earned proportions of the premium 
they relate to. Deferred acquisition costs are 
amortised over the period in which the related 
revenues are earned. Deferred acquisition costs 
are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period and are written off where they are no 
longer considered to be recoverable. 
Reinsurance premium ceded 
Reinsurance premium ceded comprise 
premium on reinsurance arrangements  
bought which incept during the financial year, 
together with adjustments to premiums ceded 
in previous accounting periods. The proportion 
of reinsurance premium ceded attributable  
to periods after the balance sheet date is 
deferred as reinsurers' share of unearned 
premium. Reinsurance premium ceded  
is earned over the policy contract period  
on a basis consistent with the related 
insurance contracts. 
Insurance contracts liabilities 
Claims paid are defined as those claims 
transactions settled up to the balance sheet date 
including internal and external claims settlement 
expenses allocated to those transactions.  
Unpaid claims reserves are made for known or 
anticipated liabilities under insurance contracts 
which have not been settled up to the balance 
sheet date. Included within the provision is  
an allowance for the future costs of settling 
those claims. This is estimated based on past 
experience and current expectations of future 
cost levels. 
Unpaid claims reserves are estimated on an 
undiscounted basis. Unpaid claims reserves 
acquired through a business combination are 
measured at fair value, using an applicable  
risk-free discount rate and having regard to  
the expected settlement dates of the claims. 
Provisions are subject to a detailed quarterly 
review where forecast future cash flows and 
existing amounts provided are reviewed and 
reassessed. Any changes to the amounts held 
are adjusted through the income statement. 
Provisions are established above an actuarial 
best estimate, reflecting a risk premium relating 
to the uncertainty of the actual level of claims 
incurred. There is therefore a reasonable 
chance of release of reserves from one year  
to the next.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements
107
Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
 
   
The unpaid claims reserves also include, where 
necessary, a reserve for unexpired risks where, 
at the balance sheet date, the estimated costs 
of future claims and related deferred acquisition 
costs are expected to exceed the unearned 
premium provision.  
Reinsurance contracts held 
Contracts entered into by the Group with 
reinsurers under which the Group is 
compensated for losses on contracts issued  
by the Group and that meet the classification 
requirements for insurance contracts are 
classified as reinsurance contracts held. 
Insurance contracts underwritten by the Group 
under which the contract holder is another 
insurer (inwards reinsurance) are included 
within insurance contracts. 
The benefits to which the Group is entitled 
under its reinsurance contracts held are 
recognised as reinsurance assets. These assets 
consist of short-term balances due from 
reinsurers, as well as longer term receivables 
that are dependent on the expected claims and 
benefits arising under the related reinsured 
insurance contracts. Amounts recoverable from 
or due to reinsurers are measured consistently 
with the amounts associated with the reinsured 
insurance contracts and in accordance with the 
terms of each reinsurance contract.  
Where there is objective evidence that a 
reinsurance asset is impaired, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount of the reinsurance 
asset to its recoverable amount and recognises 
that impairment loss in the income statement. 
Salvage and subrogation reimbursements  
Some insurance contracts permit the Group  
to sell (usually damaged) property acquired  
in settling a claim (for example, salvage).  
The Group may also have the right to pursue 
third parties for payment of some or all costs 
(for example, subrogation).  
Estimates of salvage recoveries are included  
as an allowance in the measurement of the 
insurance liability for claims, and salvage 
property is recognised in other insurance assets 
when the liability is settled. The allowance is the 
amount that can reasonably be recovered from 
the disposal of the property.  
Subrogation reimbursements are also 
considered as an allowance in the 
measurement of the insurance liability for 
claims and are recognised in other assets  
when the liability is settled. The allowance  
is the assessment of the amount that can be 
recovered from the action against the liable 
third party. 
Net investment income 
Dividends and any related tax credits are 
recognised as income on the date that the 
related listed investments are marked ex-
dividend. Other investment income, interest 
receivable, expenses and interest payable are 
recognised on an accruals basis. 
Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the chief operating decision maker. The chief 
operating decision maker, which is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing the 
performance of the operating segments, has 
been identified as the Board of Directors of the 
Company.  
Business combinations 
i. Business combinations before 1 January 2010 
The acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted 
for using the purchase method. The cost of 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of 
assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, 
and equity instruments issued by the Group  
at the date of exchange, plus any costs directly 
attributable to the business combination. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed, meeting the 
conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, 
‘Business combinations’, are recognised at their 
fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective  
of the extent of any minority interest. The 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
ii. Business combination after 1 January 2010 
The Group policy is to apply IFRS 3 (revised)  
to all acquisitions taking place on or after  
1 January 2010. Business combinations are 
accounted for using the acquisition method.  
The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair 
value of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the 
Group at the date of exchange. Under IFRS 3 
(revised), with the exception of the costs of 
registering and issuing debt and securities  
that are recognised in accordance with IAS 32 
and IAS 39 (i.e. as a reduction in proceeds),  
all other acquisition-related costs are to be 
expensed as incurred. 
When the Group acquires a business, it 
assesses the financial assets and liabilities 
assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual 
terms, economic circumstances and pertinent 
conditions at the acquisition date. Identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed, meeting the conditions  
for recognition under IFRS 3, are recognised  
at their fair value at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of the extent of any minority 
interest. The excess of the fair value of 
consideration transferred over the fair value  
of the Group’s share of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
For each business combination, the Group 
measures any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets.  
Interests in associate entities 
Investments in associates are accounted for 
using the equity method. 
Associates are all entities over which the  
Group has significant influence but no control, 
generally accompanying a shareholding of 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The 
Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition 
profits and losses after tax is recognised in the 
income statement each period, and its share  
of the movement in associates’ net assets is 
reflected in the investments’ carrying values  
in the balance sheet. 
Interests in joint ventures 
Investments in joint ventures are accounted  
for using the equity method. 
Operations held for sale 
Assets and liabilities held for disposal as part  
of operations which are held for sale are shown 
separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The relevant assets are recorded at the lower  
of their carrying amount and their fair value, 
less the estimated selling costs.  
Intangible assets 
i. Syndicate capacity 
Lloyd’s syndicate participations that have  
been purchased in the Lloyd’s capacity auctions 
are capitalised at cost. Syndicate capacity is 
considered to have an indefinite life as it will 
provide benefits over an indefinite future period 
and is therefore not subject to an annual 
amortisation charge. The continuing value  
of the capacity is reviewed for impairment 
annually by reference to the expected future 
profit streams to be earned from the cash-
generating units to which the intangible asset  
is allocated, with any impairment in value being 
charged to the income statement.   108

policies and critical accounting 
judgements and estimates continued 
ii. Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to  
1 January 1999 was written off to reserves. 
Goodwill recognised between 1 January 1999 
and the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 
2004) was capitalised and amortised on a 
straight line basis over its estimated useful life. 
Following the transition to IFRS this goodwill  
is stated at net book value at 1 January 2004. 
Goodwill that was recognised subsequent to  
1 January 2004 is capitalised. Goodwill is tested 
for impairment annually, or when events or 
changes in circumstance indicate that it might 
be impaired, by comparing the net present 
value of the future earnings stream of the cash-
generating unit to which goodwill has been 
allocated, against the carrying value of the 
goodwill and the carrying value of the related 
net assets. 
iii. Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets comprise costs directly 
attributable to securing the intangible rights  
to broker, customer relationships and costs 
directly attributable to internally-developed 
software. Costs are recognised as intangible 
assets where they can be identified separately 
and measured reliably and it is probable that 
they will be recovered by directly related future 
profits. Other intangible assets are reviewed for 
impairment losses at each reporting date or 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Other intangible assets are carried 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis based on the estimated 
useful economic life of the assets, which is 
estimated to be between five and fifteen years, 
and is charged to other operating expenses  
in the income statement. 
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at historical 
cost less accumulated depreciation and 
provision for impairment where appropriate. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the 
asset and the costs attributable to bringing the 
asset to its working condition for its intended 
use. Depreciation is calculated on the straight 
line method to write down the cost of such 
assets to their residual values over their 
estimated useful lives as follows: 
 
Leasehold land  
and buildings 
Over period 
of lease
Freehold buildings 5% per annum
Motor vehicles 33% per annum
Computer equipment 
20% to 33% per 
annum
Furniture, fixtures and 
leasehold improvements 20% per annum
The carrying values of property and equipment 
are reviewed for impairment when events  
or changes in circumstance indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired. If any such 
condition exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of impairment and the difference is 
charged to the income statement. 
Gains and losses on disposal of property and 
equipment are determined by reference to their 
carrying amount and are taken to the income 
statement. Repairs and renewals are charged to 
the income statement when the expenditure is 
incurred. The freehold land is not depreciated. 
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets at fair 
value through profit and loss (FV) or available 
for sale. The classification depends on the 
purpose for which the financial assets were 
acquired. Management determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. 
Other than investments in certain unlisted 
insurance intermediaries (see below), the  
Group classifies its financial investments as FV. 
This classification requires all fair value changes 
to be recognised immediately within the 
investment return line in the income statement. 
Within the FV category, fixed maturity and 
equity securities are classified as ‘trading’  
as the Group buys with the intention to resell. 
All other securities are classified as ‘other than 
trading’ within the FV category. 
The Group has investments in certain unlisted 
insurance intermediaries which are treated  
as available-for-sale and are measured at fair 
value, unless their fair value cannot be reliably 
measured, in which case they are valued  
at cost less impairment. Changes in fair  
value of investments are included in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which 
they arise. They are tested for impairment 
annually, or when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that impairment  
might have occurred. When securities classified 
as available-for-sale are sold or impaired,  
the accumulated fair value adjustments 
recognised in equity are included in the  
income statement as ‘gains and losses from 
investment securities’. 
Purchases and sales of investments are 
recognised on the trade date, which is the date 
the Group commits to purchase or sell the 
assets. These are initially recognised at fair 
value, and are subsequently re-measured at fair 
value based on quoted bid prices. Transaction 
costs are recognised directly in the income 
statement when incurred. Changes in the fair 
value of investments are included in the income 
statement in the period in which they arise.  
The uncertainty around valuation is discussed 
further in note 3. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments primarily 
include currency swaps, currency and interest 
rate futures, currency options, catastrophe 
linked instruments and other financial 
instruments that derive their value mainly from 
underlying interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates or catastrophe risk. Derivatives are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which  
a derivative contract is entered into. They are 
subsequently measured at fair value, with their 
fair values obtained from quoted market prices 
or, where these are not available, by using 
valuation techniques such as discounted cash 
flow models or option pricing models. Changes 
in the fair value of derivative instruments  
are recognised immediately in the income 
statement unless the derivative is designated  
as a hedging instrument. As defined by IAS 39 
‘Financial instruments: Recognition and 
measurement’, the Group designates certain 
foreign currency derivatives as hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations. The Group 
documents at the inception of each hedging 
transaction the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items, as well as its 
risk management objectives and strategy for 
undertaking various hedging transactions. The 
Group also documents its assessment, both at 
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of 
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging 
transactions are highly effective in offsetting 
changes in fair values of hedged items. 
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
related to the effective portion is recognised  
in other comprehensive income. The fair values 
of derivative instruments used for hedging 
purposes are disclosed in note 17. Gains and 
losses accumulated in equity are included  
in the income statement when the foreign 
operation is partially disposed of or sold. 
Embedded derivatives with risks and 
characteristics which are not closely related  
to the host contract, and where the combined 
instrument is not measured at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognised in profit or 
loss, are separated from the host contract and 
measured at fair value.   Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are measured at 
amortised cost using an effective interest  
rate. Appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the 
income statement when there is evidence  
that the asset is impaired. These are reversed 
when the triggering event that caused the 
impairment is reversed. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are stated initially at the 
consideration received net of transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated  
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Any difference between amortised cost 
and the redemption value is recognised in the 
income statement over the period of the 
borrowings. Transaction costs on borrowings 
are charged through the income statement  
over the period of the borrowings. 
Finance costs 
Finance costs mainly comprise interest payable 
on subordinated loans and commissions 
charged for the utilisation of letters of credit. 
These costs are charged to the income 
statement as finance costs, as incurred.  
Fees paid for the arrangement of debt and 
letter of credit facilities are charged to finance 
costs over the life of the facility. In addition, 
transaction costs and interest payable in 
respect of the issue of catastrophe linked 
instruments are charged to finance costs over 
the life of the contract. Gains or losses on any 
derivative component of catastrophe linked 
instruments are included in investment return.  
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the 
balance sheet at fair value. For the purposes  
of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits 
held on call with banks and other short-term, 
highly liquid investments which are believed  
to be subject to insignificant risk of change  
in fair value. 
Treasury shares 
Treasury shares are deducted from equity.  
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, 
sale, issue or cancellation of the treasury 
shares. Any consideration paid or received  
is recognised directly in equity. 
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share are based on the profit 
attributable to shareholders and the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the 
period. Shares held by the Employee Share 
Ownership Trust (ESOT) and treasury shares  
are excluded from the weighted average 
number of shares. 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by 
dividing profit after tax by the weighted average 
number of issued shares during the year. 
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by 
dividing profit after tax by the adjusted average 
number of shares in issue. The adjusted 
average number of shares assumes conversion 
of dilutive potential ordinary shares, being 
shares from the Executive Share Option 
Scheme (ESOT), Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) , Performance Share Plan (PSP), Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Sharesave scheme. 
Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases 
whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards to the 
Group. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are 
charged to the income statement in the period 
in which they become payable in accordance 
with the terms of the lease. 
Employee benefits 
i. Pension obligations  
The Group participates in a number of pension 
schemes, including several defined benefit 
schemes, defined contribution schemes and 
personal pension schemes. 
The Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund scheme  
is a multi-employer defined benefit scheme. 
Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI) 
participates in two defined benefit schemes. 
Amlin Re Europe’s (ARE) pension scheme is 
classified as a defined benefit scheme in 
accordance with IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’. 
The defined benefit obligation and associated 
pension costs are calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. This method sees each period  
of service as giving rise to an additional unit  
of benefit entitlement and measures each unit 
separately to build up the final liability. The cost 
of providing these benefits is charged to the 
income statement to spread the pension cost 
over the service lives of employees. Actuarial 
gains and losses arising from the recognition 
and funding of the Group’s pension obligations 
are recognised in other comprehensive income 
during the period in which they arise. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet  
in respect of defined benefit pension plans  
is the present value of the fair value of plan 
assets less the defined benefit obligation at the 
balance sheet date, together with adjustments 
for unrecognised past service costs and for 
restrictions on the recognition of a defined 
benefit asset due to an asset ceiling. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligation  
is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high 
quality corporate bonds, and that have terms  
to maturity approximating to the terms of the 
related pension liability. In respect of ACI’s 
defined benefit scheme in the Netherlands, the 
fair value of the plan assets reflects the benefits 
that accrue to ACI under the insurance policy 
taken out to meet its obligations. This is also  
the case for ARE’s defined benefit scheme.  
Pension contributions to defined contribution 
plans are charged to the income statement 
when due.  
ii. Equity compensation plans (equity-settled) 
The Company operates a number of executive 
and employee share schemes. Options issued 
after 7 November 2002 are accounted for  
using the fair value method where the cost for 
providing equity compensation is based on the 
fair value of the share option or award at the 
date of the grant. The fair value is calculated 
using an option pricing model and the 
corresponding expense is recognised in the 
income statement over the vesting period.  
The accrual for this charge is recognised in 
equity shareholders’ funds. When the options 
are exercised, the proceeds received net  
of any transaction costs are credited to share 
capital for the par value and the surplus to 
share premium. 
iii. Equity compensation plans (cash-settled) 
The Group operates the Amlin Capital Builder 
Plan which is deemed a cash-settled share-
based payment arrangement. The cost of  
cash-settled transactions is measured initially  
at fair value at the grant date. Further details 
are given in note 28. The fair value is expensed 
over the period until the vesting date with 
recognition of a corresponding liability. The 
liability is remeasured at each reporting date  
up to and including the settlement date with 
changes in fair value recognised in profit  
or loss. 
iv. Other benefits  
Other employee incentive schemes and long-
term service awards, including sabbatical leave, 
are recognised when they accrue to employees. 
A provision is made for the estimated liability 
for long-service leave as a result of services 
rendered by employees up to the balance  
sheet date. 
Other income  
Fee income from providing information services 
is recognised on an earned basis.  110
Notes to the accounts continued 
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
  
1. Summary of significant accounting 
policies and critical accounting 
judgements and estimates continued 
Taxation 
Income tax expense represents the sum of the 
tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable 
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from 
net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years  
or that are never taxable or deductible. The 
Group’s and Company’s liability for current tax 
is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and 
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities  
in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect 
of taxable temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and associates,  
and interests in joint ventures, except where  
the Group and Company is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it  
is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets  
is reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will  
be available to allow all or part of the asset  
to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the substantively 
enacted tax rates that are expected to apply  
in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited to profit or loss, except when it relates 
to items charged or credited directly to other 
comprehensive income or equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also charged or credited 
directly to other comprehensive income or 
equity respectively. 
Deferred tax is recognised on the profits of 
overseas subsidiaries where it is reasonably 
foreseeable that distribution of the profit back 
to the UK will take place and the UK dividend 
exemption is not expected to apply. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s 
shareholders is recognised as a liability in the 
Group’s and Company’s financial statements  
in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Other payables 
Other payables are measured at amortised cost. 
They represent liabilities to pay for goods or 
services that have been received or supplied  
in the normal course of business, invoiced  
by the supplier before the period end, but for 
which payment has not yet been made.  
2. Capital 
The capital structure of the Group consists  
of equity attributable to equity holders of the 
Company, comprising issued capital, reserves 
and retained earnings as disclosed in the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 
and note 26, and subordinated debt as 
disclosed in note 31. For business planning 
purposes, account is also taken of the Group’s 
debt facilities as disclosed in note 31. 
Amlin Corporate Member Limited, which 
supports Syndicate 2001, is required to hold 
regulatory capital in compliance with the rules 
issued by the UK’s Financial Services Authority 
(FSA) and is also subject to Lloyd’s capital 
requirements. Under FSA rules, the corporate 
member must hold capital in excess of the 
higher of two amounts. The first is the Pillar 1 
requirement, as prescribed by EU directives, 
calculated by applying fixed percentages to 
premiums and claims. The second, Pillar 2,  
is an Individual Capital Assessment (ICA) 
calculated internally by the firm. The ICA is 
defined as the level of capital that is required  
to contain the probability of insolvency, over  
a one year timeframe, to no greater than  
0.5%. The ICA calculation basis is generally 
considered to be broadly equivalent to a BBB 
insurance financial strength rating. The ICA 
calculation considers all ultimate losses 
incurred over a one year business planning 
horizon, and any prior year reserve movements. 
For the purposes of setting Lloyd’s capital 
requirements, Lloyd’s currently uplifts all ICAs 
by 35% (2010: 35%) to bring the capital to a 
level to support a higher financial strength 
rating. The final capital requirement is then 
subject to a minimum of 40% (2010: 40%)  
of the syndicate’s agreed regulatory premium 
capacity limit. At 31 December 2011 the 
agreed Economic Capital Assessment (ECA)  
as a percentage of the proposed underwriting 
capacity for the following year of account  
is 42.3% (2010: 46.0%).  
The Syndicate also benefits from mutualised 
capital within the Lloyd’s Central Fund, for 
which a variable annual levy, for 2011 of  
0.5% (2010: 0.5%) of Syndicate gross premium, 
is payable. 
The ICA is reviewed annually by Lloyd’s and 
periodically by the FSA. The FSA expect 
management to apply their rules continuously. 
If a firm breaches its Pillar 1 capital it must 
cease trading; if Pillar 2 capital is breached 
steps must be taken urgently to restore capital 
to the required level. Due to the nature of the 
Lloyd’s capital setting process, Funds at Lloyd’s 
requirements are formally assessed and funded 
twice yearly at discrete periods and must be 
met for the Syndicate to continue underwriting. 
At 31 December 2011 Amlin Corporate Member 
Limited funded the agreed FAL requirement of 
£497.0 million (2010: £476.1 million) to support 
underwriting for the following year of account. 
The Group does not seek to retain any assets in 
excess of the Lloyd’s capital requirement within 
the Lloyd’s framework and any surplus is paid 
to the corporate entities in the Group. 
Amlin AG is supervised by the Swiss Financial 
Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the 
Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). 
FINMA supervision is composed of various 
qualitative assessments, governance 
requirements and minimum solvency levels. 
Amlin AG provides regulatory solvency 
reporting to FINMA, under the rules of Solvency 
I and the Swiss Solvency Test (SST). Solvency I 
is based on the Swiss statutory financial 
statements and required capital is calculated  
as a fixed percentage of premiums,  
claims reserves and/or net amount at risk.  
The SST is based on an economic view and 
required capital is derived from an internal 
capital model.  
The internal model as well as the 2011 SST  
is still subject to approval by FINMA. Amlin AG 
calculates available and required capital under 
the SST using the aforementioned model. The 
minimum ratio for Solvency I as well as for the 
SST is set at 100% (the SST minimum ratio 
became legally binding in 2011). For both ratios 
Amlin AG exceeds the 100% minimum ratio. 
Under BMA regulations, Amlin AG is licensed  
as a Class IV insurer and the minimum solvency 
margin is the greater of US$100 million, 50%  
of net premiums written in the current financial 
year, 15% of claims reserves and the Enhanced 
Capital Requirement (ECR). The ECR is calculated  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements
111
Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
 
   
on an annual basis through either the Bermuda 
Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR) model  
or an approved internal model. In addition,  
as a Class IV insurer, the company is required  
to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio such that  
the value of ‘relevant assets’ is not less than  
75% of its ‘relevant liabilities’. Amlin AG met this 
requirement at 31 December 2011. 
For trading purposes, Amlin AG believes that  
it is necessary to hold at least US$1 billion  
of capital, which is currently in excess of the 
minimum required by the BMA and FINMA. 
Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI)  
is required to hold regulatory capital in 
compliance with the rules issued by its 
regulator and as prescribed by EU directives.  
Regulatory capital is calculated by applying 
fixed percentages to premiums and claims.  
At 31 December 2011, ACI’s available 
regulatory capital was €240.7 million  
(2010: €341.9 million), compared to a 
minimum requirement of €117.0 million  
(2010: €117.0 million). For wider commercial 
reasons, ACI’s capital is managed so as to 
support its financial strength ratings. 
The method by which the Group  
manages its capital base is described  
on page 50 of the Performance section  
under Financial Management. 
In addition to regulatory capital requirements, 
the Group believes that it should retain a level 
of capital within the Group to allow it to grow its 
exposures materially in the aftermath of a major 
insurance disaster, but also to respond to other 
opportunities to enhance long term growth, for 
example through acquisition. The overall capital 
held by the Group is driven by the business mix, 
nature and objectives of each business unit and 
its context within the wider Group. 
3. Risk disclosures  
3.1 Underwriting risk 
The Group accepts underwriting risk in a  
range of classes of business through Lloyd’s 
Syndicate 2001, Amlin Corporate Insurance 
N.V. (ACI) and Amlin AG (including the latter’s 
branch operation, Amlin Bermuda). Syndicate 
2001’s portfolio is underwritten by Amlin 
London, Amlin UK and through the Group’s 
wholly owned French coverholder, Amlin France 
SAS. Amlin France also writes business on 
behalf of ACI. The bias of the Group’s portfolio 
is towards short-tail property and accident risk 
but liability coverage is also underwritten. 
In underwriting insurance or reinsurance 
policies the Group’s underwriters use their skill 
and knowledge to assess each risk and they use 
exposure information and data on past claims 
experience to evaluate the likely claims cost and 
therefore the premium that should be sufficient 
(across a portfolio of risks) to cover claims 
costs, expenses and to produce an acceptable 
profit. However, due to the nature of insurance 
risk there is no guarantee that the premium 
charged will be sufficient to cover claims  
costs. This shortfall may originate either from 
insufficient premium being calculated and 
charged or may result from an unexpected,  
or unprecedented, high level of claims.  
A number of controls are deployed to limit the 
amount of insurance exposure underwritten. 
Each year a business plan is prepared and 
agreed which is used to monitor the amount of 
premium income, and exposure, to be written 
in total and for each class of business. Progress 
against this plan is monitored during the year. 
The Group also operates under a line guide that 
determines the maximum liability per policy 
that can be written for each class (on a gross  
or net of facultative reinsurance basis) and for 
each underwriter. These limits can be exceeded 
in exceptional circumstances with the approval 
of senior management. Apart from the UK and 
international comprehensive motor liability 
portfolios, which have unlimited liability, all 
policies have a per loss limit which caps the  
size of any individual claim. For larger sum 
insured risks facultative reinsurance coverage 
may be purchased. The Group is also exposed 
to catastrophe losses which may impact many 
risks in a single event and again reinsurance  
is purchased to limit the impact of loss 
aggregation from such events. These reinsurance 
arrangements are described in the section on 
page 118. 
Insurance liabilities are written through 
individual risk acceptances, reinsurance treaties 
or through facilities whereby the Group is 
bound by other underwriting entities. Facility 
arrangements delegate underwriting authority 
to other underwriters, or to agents acting as 
coverholders, that use their judgement to write 
risks on the Group’s behalf under clear 
authority levels. 
The insurance liabilities underwritten by the 
Group are reviewed on an individual risk, or 
contract, basis and through review of portfolio 
performance. Claims arising are reserved upon 
notification. Each quarter the entire portfolio  
of business is subject to a reserving process 
whereby levels of paid and outstanding (advised 
but not paid) claims are reviewed. Potential 
future claims are assessed with a provision for 
incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims being 
made. This provision is subject to review by 
senior executives and an independent internal 
actuarial assessment is usually carried out by 
the in-house actuarial team to determine the 
adequacy of the provision. Whilst a detailed and 
disciplined exercise is carried out to provide for 
claims notified, it is possible that known claims 
could develop and exceed the reserves carried.  
Furthermore, there is increased uncertainty  
in establishing an accurate provision for IBNR 
claims and there is a possibility that claims may 
arise which, in aggregate, exceed the reserve 
provision established. This is partly mitigated  
by the reserving policy adopted by the Group 
which is to carry reserves in excess of the 
actuarial best estimate. 
The review of claims arising may result in 
underwriters adjusting pricing levels to cater for 
an unexpectedly higher trend of claims advices 
or payments. However, this may not be possible 
in a competitive market and underwriters may 
respond either by accepting business with lower 
expected profit margins or declining to renew 
policies and thus reducing income. Also, there 
is a portfolio of risks already underwritten which 
cannot be re-priced until renewal at the end  
of the policy period. 
The Group is exposed to the impact of large 
catastrophe events such as windstorms, 
earthquakes or terrorist incidents. Exposure  
to such events is controlled and measured 
through loss modelling, but the accuracy of this 
exposure analysis is limited by the quality of 
data and the effectiveness of the modelling.  
The Group’s broad risk appetite guidelines  
are set out on page 44. It is possible that  
a catastrophe event exceeds the maximum 
expected event loss. This is particularly the case 
for the direct property proportion of the loss 
exposure where models are used to calculate  
a damage factor representing the amount of 
damage expected to exposed aggregate insured 
values from a particular scenario. Errors, or 
incorrect assumptions in the damage factor 
calculation can result in incurred catastrophe 
event claims higher, or lower, than predicted 
due to unforeseen circumstances or 
inadequacies in data or the models used.  
As explained on page 118 reinsurance is 
purchased to protect against the impact of  
any individual or series of severe catastrophes. 
However, the price and availability of such 
cover is variable and the amount of loss 
retained by the Group may therefore also 
increase or reduce. The Group will alter its 
insurance and reinsurance exposures to take 
account of changes in reinsurance availability, 
capital levels and profitability in order to  
remain within the risk appetite guidelines.   112

3. Risk disclosures continued 
The Group has recently acquired coverage for 
US hurricane, US earthquake and European 
windstorm perils of up to $150 million from  
a Bermudian special purpose insurer, Tramline 
Re Ltd, which in turn has placed a catastrophe 
bond into the capital markets. 
This transaction provides the Group with fully 
collateralised protection over a three year 
period from 1 January 2012 and is in addition 
to the protection the Group purchases through 
the traditional reinsurance marketplace. 
The bond provides significant protection against 
a remote aggregation of catastrophe events  
for the Group. Through the use of an aggregate 
trigger it protects against both severity and 
frequency of losses. 
Sections A to E below describe the business 
and the risks of Amlin London, Amlin UK,  
Amlin France, Amlin AG, which includes Amlin 
Re Europe and Amlin Bermuda, and Amlin 
Corporate Insurance.

Catastrophe reinsurance protects insurance 
companies against catastrophic losses, such  
as windstorm or earthquake, which may impact 
more than one risk written by the client.  
This portfolio is a key part of the insurance risk 
written by the Group. Programmes are placed 
on a layered or excess of loss basis. Territorial 
exposures, from a number of programmes, are 
much higher, but are carefully recorded and 
analysed through loss simulations or realistic 
disaster scenarios.  
Per risk property reinsurance is also written  
on an excess of loss basis but covers loss or 
damage to any single risk within the reinsured’s 
portfolio. This portfolio protects insureds 
against large individual property losses and  
will also be affected by large catastrophes. 
Proportional reinsurance covers a proportional 
share of a reinsureds portfolio of business 
subject to payment of commission and/or  
profit commission. Almost all proportional 
reinsurance written by the Group in this class  
is property business and risk exposure is limited 
to US$7.5 million for any one risk. Proportional 
reinsurance is normally written with an 
occurrence limit. 
The portfolio of reinsurance business  
is written with the aim of achieving territorial 
diversification. However, as experienced  
in 2011, a severe catastrophe to a major 
economic zone in Europe, Japan, Australasia  
or the US is likely to result in an overall loss to 
the portfolio prior to retrocessional reinsurance. 
Amlin London operates to a maximum loss  
limit applicable to refined scenarios which  
is an allocation of a total Group tolerance.  
A. (ii) Other reinsurance risks 
Amlin London also writes other reinsurance 
classes which contribute diversified exposure  
to the portfolio. The main classes with the

excess of loss basis. 
The special risks account is mostly terrorism

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
 
   
Property cover is provided to large commercial 
enterprises with high value locations and/or 
many locations, and also for small commercial 
property. The perils covered include fire,  
flood, wind and earthquake damage. Business 
interruption cover is also provided for loss  
of earnings sustained due to the perils and 
properties covered but may also be extended to 
connected enterprises. Terrorism cover is given 
on a limited basis particularly where required by 
local regulation, but nuclear and bio-chemical 
coverage is excluded from standard property 
cover in most territories.  
Direct and facultative property insurance  
is written for the full value of the risk, on  
a primary or excess of loss basis, through 
individual placements, or by way of delegated 
underwriting facilities given to coverholders 
(‘binding authorities’). Binding authority 
arrangements delegate the day to day 
underwriting to underwriting agents working  
on our behalf and therefore, for these contracts 
we are reliant on coverholders exercising 
underwriting judgement on our behalf. 
Coverholders must have local regulatory 
approval, be Lloyd’s registered and also 
approved by the Amlin Binding Authority 
Committee. For all binding authorities facilities 
we receive a monthly or quarterly bordereau 
which is checked by our underwriting staff.  
The underwriting is controlled by setting clear 
authority levels for coverholders stipulated 
within the binding authority agreement, 
regularly monitoring performance and 
periodically carrying out underwriting visits 
and/or commissioning third party audits.  
The coverholder is incentivised to produce  
an underwriting profit through the payment  
of profit commission. However, with the  
day to day underwriting not controlled by  
the Group, there is a risk that coverholder 
underwriting, or claim decisions, are made 
which would not have been made by Amlin 
underwriters or claims staff. The maximum 
value insured under the Binders class is 
currently limited to US$3 million at any  
one location.  
The property portfolio is also exposed to  
an above average frequency of individual fire, 
explosion or weather related claims. The 
premium charged for the coverage given may 
not be sufficient to cover all claims made in  
any year, particularly in a year in which there is 
an abnormal frequency of claims. This account 
is mainly situated in the US and is therefore 
exposed to large catastrophe events such  
as California earthquake and hurricane losses.  
A. (iv) US casualty risks 
The US casualty portfolio of business provides 
insurance and reinsurance cover to individuals, 
or companies, in order to indemnify them 
against legal liability arising from their activities 
and actions or for incidents occurring on their 
property. The account is currently written to  
a maximum liability of US$6 million on any  
one claim but average lines are US$0.8 million  
on any one claim. 2011 gross premium was 
£53 million.  
The portfolio is made up of specialist general 
casualty, professional indemnity, medical 
malpractice and errors and omissions cover. 
Small amounts of directors’ and officers’ 
liability and auto liability are also written.  
In 2011 the professional lines liability portfolio 
has increased following the appointment  
of a dedicated underwriter. This class includes 
professional indemnity cover given to  
US lawyers, accountants, architects and 
engineers. It is written to a maximum liability  
of US$10 million on any one claim. 
The casualty portfolio is mostly written  
on a claims notified basis (responding to all 
claims made during a defined period) except  
for small amounts of general liability business 
which may be written on a losses occurring 
basis (the policy responds to losses which occur 
during the period even if reported after the 
policy has expired).  
Claims from this class emanate from 
professional error, negligence or an accident 
which causes injury, damage or financial loss. 
The account is vulnerable to a high frequency  
of claims, but not individual large losses as  
the cost to the Group of any individual claim  
is small. Claims frequency may be impacted  
by a generic claim type which impacts many 
individuals and (re)insurance policies such as 
poor housing design or bad medical practice. 
The size of many individual claims is subject to 
the decisions arising from the US court system 
which can be higher than anticipated. There  
is also the potential for US courts to impose a 
‘bad faith’ judgement on insurers if it is deemed 
that the insurer has acted improperly in trying 
to avoid contractual obligations. Such awards 
can, in exceptional circumstances, be much 
higher than the value of the insurance claim. 
A. (v) Accident and health, auto and special 
risks 
Amlin London also writes other property and 
casualty classes which contribute diversified 
exposure to the portfolio.  
The main classes with the maximum sum 
insured lines are shown below:

(2) Maximum line size is after business written and  
ceded by specific proportional treaties to Amlin Bermuda. 
(3) Premium is stated gross of acquisition costs and excludes 
adjustments in respect of prior periods. 
The accident and health class is written through 
medical expense schemes in the US and direct 
personal accident cover, or personal accident 
reinsurance, worldwide. Medical expense cover 
is subject to a high frequency of claim and 
significant medical cost inflation. Personal 
accident insurance and reinsurance could be 
impacted by a single or series of accidents to 
high value insured individuals or from a multiple 
death and injury event such as an air crash  
or natural catastrophe.  
The auto class covers property damage  
only (fire, theft and collision) in the US  
and property damage and third party motor 
liability combined cover in other international 
territories. This class could be impacted by 
unexpected claim frequency, a multi vehicle 
event such as a severe flood and also large 
bodily injury award claims emanating from  
an accident. 
The special risks class is made up of insurance 
of nuclear installations, contingency business 
and film finance risk.  114

the sterling limits.  
(2) Maximum line size is after business written and ceded  
by specific proportional treaties to Amlin Bermuda. 
(3) Premium is stated gross of acquisition costs and excludes 
adjustments in respect of prior periods. 
The hull and cargo account is worldwide, 
covering property damage to ships and loss, or 
damage, to a large variety of cargo or goods in 
transit. The hull account can include machinery 
breakdown and the portfolio written includes 
lower value tonnage, smaller ‘brownwater’ 
vessels and fishing boats as well as larger ‘blue 
water’ ocean hull risks such as cruise liners, 
tankers and bulk carriers. These accounts  
can be impacted by attritional claims of a small 
size as well as a single individual large claim. 
The cargo account in particular could also  
be involved in a major natural catastrophe loss. 
In an economic recession, it is expected that 
premium income will fall as trade reduces and 
hull values are impacted by reduced freight 
rates. It is also possible that claims frequency 
could increase due to increased economic 
pressures affecting fraud and theft claims. 
The energy portfolio is mainly offshore rig and 
construction policies which may be impacted  
by large individual claims from construction 
fault or property damage such as fire or 
explosion, but is also exposed to severe 
catastrophe losses, for example in the North 
Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The account includes 
control of well to limit loss of oil and avoid 
pollution and also some business interruption 
cover which indemnifies companies for loss of 
production. 
War business includes aviation, marine and  
on land terrorism coverage. The account is 
exposed to single incidents or a series of losses 
arising from concerted action. Political risk, 
confiscation and contract frustration business  
is also written.  
Specie business consists of the insurance 
against damage or theft to fine art, the  
contents of vaults and other high value goods 
including jewellers’ block and cash in transit. 
The fine art may be shown at exhibitions which 
have very high aggregate values at risk. The 
class is therefore exposed to the potential  
for a frequency of small claims and also large 
individual losses. Some specie is written in 
catastrophe zones e.g. California. 
The bloodstock account provides coverage  
for death, illness or injury to horses mainly in 
the UK. Business from the US, Australia and 
South Africa is also written. This covers racing 
or eventing horses and breeding studs. The 
average value insured is below £1 million but 
there is the potential for an aggregate loss, 
such as a stable fire, which could cause 
multiple claims.  
Crowe Livestock, a leading Lloyd’s coverholder 
for the insurance of livestock writes a broad 
portfolio of protection for livestock and 
specialist products such as zoo animals,  
with a maximum line of any one policy of 
US$10 million. The company also writes 
employers’ liability cover for livestock business 
up to a limit of £10 million. Again, an event 
affecting several animals across many policies 
such as disease could result in a loss 
significantly higher than this.  
Yacht business covers property damage and 
third party injury for small leisure boats and 
craft. The bulk of the account is smaller value 
yachts in the UK and Europe, although there 
are a number of binders written by coverholders 
elsewhere, such as Scandinavia, Canada and 
Australia. There is an expectation of a large 
number of small claims, as average values are 
low in comparison to other claims written in the 
Group. Third party liability yacht claims arise 
from injury or damage caused by one of our 
policyholders to third parties. There is also the 
potential for a large catastrophe loss such as a 
UK windstorm where there are large aggregate 
sums insured in coastal regions such as 
southern England. Following the acquisition  
of Lead Yacht in January 2011, the Group  
also writes a lead share of a portfolio of large 
private yachts. 
The marine liability portfolio is written to protect 
ship-owners, harbours, charterers and energy 
companies against damage or injury to third 
parties. This includes the potential for pollution 
damage and clean up claims. The account 
could suffer a large catastrophe incident from a 
collision causing death of crew and passengers 
or an oil, or chemical, spill which could incur 
large clean up costs.  
A. (vii) Aviation risks  
The Group, through Syndicate 2001, 
underwrites direct and facultative aviation 
business domiciled in most parts of the world.

ceded by specific proportional treaties to Amlin Bermuda. 
(3) Premium is stated gross of acquisition costs and excludes

The airline account is exposed to large claims 
arising from property damage, death or injury 
arising from aircraft accidents. The domicile  
of the airline and passengers has a notable 
influence on the cost of claims, for example  
US court awards are generally higher.  
The general aviation account covers smaller 
aircraft or cargo and covers owners or 
operators, against loss or damage and third 
party injury. The risk excess account is a book 
of general aviation reinsurance business written 
to protect a small number of insurers against 
large general aviation claims. 
Airport liability insurance covers airport 
operators, refuellers and air traffic controllers 
against losses arising from injury caused by 
their activities or occurring on their premises. 
Product liability covers manufacturers against 
accidents arising from faulty parts or 
equipment, or poor servicing of aircraft. Both 
airport and product liability coverage is written 
on a losses occurring basis meaning that claims 
advices can be made after the policy has 
expired. Space insurance covers property and 
liability during launch and the operation of  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements
115

satellites whilst in orbit for a limited period, 
normally of one year.  
The aviation account is subject to both small 
and large claims. Claims involving loss of life  
or serious injury to high earning passengers or 
third parties are subject to the ongoing inflation 
of court awards particularly in the US. Large 
accidents involving the potential death of 500 
or more passengers are feasible and could 
potentially result in a gross claim to the 
business of more than the vertical reinsurance 
programme if, for example, two large aircraft 
were to collide. Space losses are generally large 
single claim amounts caused by launch failure 
or operational failure in orbit. The principal 
aviation accounts are protected by a 
reinsurance programme on both a risk sharing 
(proportional) and excess of loss basis. The 
Group reinsurance arrangements are discussed 
on page 50. The space account is written with 
risks shared with Amlin Bermuda but is not 
protected by excess of loss reinsurance.

Amlin UK writes three classes of UK liability 
business. The vast majority of the business 
emanates from the UK with the balance mainly 
from Ireland and Canada.  
Employers’ liability insurance protects 
employers against accident or injury to 
employees. This is written on a losses occurring 
basis (covering events that occurred in the 
policy period even if they are not notified until 
after expiry) for limits up to £27 million per 
employer.  
Public liability insurance provides coverage, 
often written in conjunction with employers’ 
liability, for accident or injury occurring to 
clients, customers or another third party as a 
result of contact with the insured’s personnel, 
property or products. This is written on a losses 
occurring basis currently, for limits up to  
£12 million per assured.  
Professional indemnity covers liability which 
may arise from services provided by the 
assured, for example as a result of negligence 
or error which may lead to financial or physical 
loss. This includes, but is not limited to, services 
from architects, engineers, surveyors, 
advertising firms, medical professionals and 
financial advisors and is written on a claims 
made basis (covering losses notified in the 
policy period). A proportion of this income is 
generated by a single coverholder, Manchester 
Underwriting Management, which is also 
developing a portfolio of product recall business 
which indemnifies producers against the costs 
of replacement production for specific goods. 
Amlin UK package policies combine one  
or more of the liability coverages mainly 
employers’ and public liability with motor 
and/or property damage protection. Stand 
alone property protection is also written within 
this class, mainly on a 100% basis for small and 
medium commercial and household properties.  
In January 2011 the Group acquired JR Clare 
Underwriting Agencies Limited, a managing 
general agent specialising in UK household  
and commercial property insurance. 
The property owners account has continued  
to develop since the recruitment of an 
underwriting team in June 2009 and through 
the hiring of a specialist high value homes 
underwriting team in December 2011. This 
portfolio is exposed to eastern European 
weather conditions whereby a large windstorm, 
flood or winter freeze could result in a large 
number of small claims. 
Through AUA Insolvency Risk Services Ltd,  
an FSA registered broker, Amlin UK writes a 
portfolio of UK insolvency practitioners which 
provides protection against fraud or negligence 
committed by the practitioners and also 
protects the property assets under their 
management.  
The Group also writes a small account of 
financial institutions policies covering fidelity, 
professional indemnity and directors’ and 
officers’ liability for companies providing 
financial services. The current maximum line  
is £6 million. Approximately half of the income 
is from western European financial institutions 
with the balance spread broadly by territory. 
Coverage is given on a claims made basis. 
The expected claims costs from these lines  
of business may be impacted by larger than 
anticipated damage awards to injured parties  
as well as due to an unforeseen increase in  
generic claims such as industrial disease or 
other health hazards. It is expected that claims 
frequency will increase during an economic 
downturn as unemployment leads to an 
increase in action against employers and people 
are more likely to seek redress for third party 
advice or behaviour which may have led to 
financial loss or injury. It is also possible that 
many claims could arise under many policies 
from a common cause such as financial advice 
or generic building defect. The financial 
institutions account could be affected by  
a major fraud or a series of related liability 
claims arising from banking, investment activity, 
stockbroking or other practices. The property 
portfolio could sustain a large loss from the 
effects of a UK windstorm or flood event. 
B. (ii) UK motor insurance risks 
The Division’s motor insurance risk is 
predominantly UK business covering fire,  
theft, collision and third party property and 
bodily injury liability. 2011 gross premium was 
£127 million. Under the requirements of UK  
law third party liability coverage is unlimited, 
but matching reinsurance is purchased. The 
account is biased towards commercial clients 
such as coach operators, haulage companies, 
commercial vehicle fleets and company 
executive fleets. The Division leads facilities  
for fleets involved in the transportation of 
hazardous waste. A small UK agriculture facility, 
a taxi book and a specialist private car account 
are also written.  
Claims frequency has improved in recent  
years due to car and road safety measures but 
can fluctuate due to factors such as weather 
conditions. UK inflation is a key factor in 
determining the size of motor claims. Car 
values affect the size of theft claims and for 
physical damage claims size is linked to repair 
costs. Inflationary pressure on court awards 
within the UK and Irish legal systems impacts 
liability claim values. Government intervention 
such as liability award limit changes or expense 
recoveries for government bodies, including the 
National Health Service, will also impact claim 
size. For the motor account, severe bodily injury 
and catastrophe damage claims (e.g. UK flood) 
are limited through the purchase of a 
reinsurance programme, the highest layer of 
which is unlimited.  
Motor insurance is a highly competitive  
area of insurance and pricing levels fluctuate. 
Whilst underwriters accept business subject  
to sufficient rates per vehicle, in a year where 
there is an unexpectedly high level of claims  
the total premium may not be sufficient to 
cover all the claims. There is also a risk that 
legal changes impact bodily injury payments  116

C. Amlin France 
In May 2010 Anglo French Underwriters SAS 
(AFU) and the French operations of Amlin 
Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI) were merged  
to form Amlin France. Prior to the merger AFU 
was the foremost managing general agent 
serving Lloyd’s in France and ACI had started  
to build a property and liability co-insurance 
business in France. The merger has created  
a business with increased critical mass with 
greater recognition in the French market.  
Drawing business from a large network of 
brokers across France, Amlin France is able  
to offer a wide range of direct and facultative 
insurance products designed to respond to the 
needs of both individuals and corporate clients. 
Amlin France’s business is situated 
predominantly in France.  
Amlin France writes a diverse book of business 
on behalf of Syndicate 2001 including property, 
cargo, professional liability and specie through 
a network of more than 1,350 independent 
retail brokers. Although the vast majority  
of these risks have been written on behalf  
of Syndicate 2001 or ACI, there continue to  
be a limited number of policies which do not 
involve the Group. The portfolio consists of the 
following classes with maximum and average 
line sizes:

(2) Maximum line size is shown after facultative reinsurance. 
In respect of property, Amlin France acts as 
both a leading underwriter and co-insurer for 
industrial high hazard risks providing material 
damage insurance for the industrial and 
commercial premises of small and medium 
sized enterprises. Amlin France also provides  
a comprehensive package, including liability 
cover for discotheques, bowling alleys, 
restaurants, bars and casinos. Perils offered 
include fire, lightning and associated risks, 
electrical damage, water damage, storm, 
tempest, hail, snow and glass breakage. 
Optional coverages include business 
interruption, indirect losses, theft from 
individuals and theft from break-ins. Building 
insurance is also offered for owners who  
are not occupiers. 
In the marine class, Amlin France provides 
yacht insurance which includes cover for 
damage, theft and liability as well as for the 
costs of marine assistance and marine personal 
accident. Worldwide stock and transit insurance 
is also provided with All Risks coverage granted 
on a start to finish basis from the point of 
supplier to the point of delivery. Transit cover 
includes all periods when the goods are 
stocked, in whatever location and without any 
break in coverage. 
Jeweller's block cover is provided for high value 
contents. All risks coverage is given for stock 
within the premises, including for break-in, 
hold-up, fire and water damage. Cover is also 
given for commercial retail premises such as 
gunsmiths, perfume and clothing shops and  
art galleries, including damage caused to art 
while on show at exhibitions and damage to art 
kept in private residences. A comprehensive 
multi-risk product is provided for retailers which 
includes an extension for fire and water damage 
within the premises, liability coverage and the 
preservation of goodwill or business 
interruption following a loss. 
Professional indemnity and financial guarantee 
insurance is provided to insurance and banking 
intermediaries as well as financial advisers,  
real estate agents and financial and investment 
consultants. This is a multi-layered package 
which responds to the particular needs of 
several regulated professions which may 
require differing types of cover. 
Amlin France also offers insurance for events, 
including cancellation cover, organisers’ 
liability, all risks exhibition cover and all risks 
coverage on equipment belonging to, hired  
by or installed by the assured. Amlin France 
also provides personal accident insurance for 
professions involving risk and the practice of 
sporting activities which are deemed hazardous. 
For ACI, Amlin France writes a portfolio of large 
property and liability risks. The property book  
is mostly written on a co-insurance basis for 
commercial or industrial premises. The liability 
account provides general liability coverage for 
French industrial and commercial enterprises. 
D. Amlin AG  
In October 2010 the Group re-domiciled its 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Amlin Bermuda Ltd, 
from Bermuda to Switzerland following 
approval from the Swiss Financial Market 
Authority and the Bermuda Monetary Authority. 
The Zurich-based underwriting business (trading 
as Amlin Re Europe) writes all major non-life 
reinsurance classes. Amlin Bermuda Ltd, which 
was established in December 2005, has 
become a Bermuda-based branch of Amlin AG.

The Zurich portfolio consists of both direct and 
intermediary produced business from Europe, 
Israel and a few other countries in Africa and 
the Middle East. 
The book of business is predominantly  
treaty reinsurance with an emphasis on  
liability classes. 
The motor portfolio is written on a proportional 
and excess of loss basis and is at risk from 
increases in frequency or severity of motor 
accident claims, bodily injury or third party 
property claims payments which may take 
several years to settle. Unlimited and limited 
motor business is written. Whilst the original 
premium and the investment income generated 
are expected to be more than sufficient to meet 
such claims, there is no guarantee that this will 
be the case, particularly due to inflation or 
super imposed inflation from changes to court 
awards. The aim is to diversify the portfolio 
across several territories in order to reduce the 
impact of a single legal jurisdiction changing 
claims policy.

products liability claims. The liability account 
also includes some professional liability 
reinsurance. Again this business is long-tail  
in nature. 
The Zurich office also writes both property  
risk and catastrophe excess of loss business 
and a book of property proportional treaties. 
This portfolio is subject to European windstorm 
and flood events as well as earthquakes in 
zones such as Israel, Turkey, Italy and Portugal. 
A retrocessional reinsurance programme is 
purchased as discussed on page 50.  
In 2011, through the appointment of a 
specialist underwriter, the construction and 
engineering portfolio was expanded. This 
provides property and liability reinsurance  
cover for construction projects which may  
be of several years’ duration. 
Amlin Re Europe has written a marine excess of 
loss account which includes maritime exposures 
across the world. There is also a book of 
personal accident reinsurance and smaller 
portfolios of terrorism and credit business. 
D (ii). Amlin Bermuda 
The geographic spread of all Amlin Bermuda 
classes is shown below: 
Notes: 
(1) Geographical split only includes direct business. 
Amlin Bermuda has continued to write a 
portfolio of reinsurance business on a direct 
basis and to reinsure part of the Syndicate 
2001 portfolio. The direct written portfolio 
consists of the following classes with maximum

Notes: 
(1) Premium is stated gross of acquisition costs and excludes

Amlin Bermuda’s direct business has strong 
similarities to the portfolio of the Reinsurance 
business unit of Amlin London. All of the 
business written emanates from London broker 
markets and is frequently seasoned business 
already underwritten by Syndicate 2001. Risk 
balance is provided by a whole account quota 
share of Syndicate 2001. This is further 
supplemented by a number of specific variable 
quota share treaties on short tail classes such 
as property and energy.  
Property reinsurance is written through treaty 
arrangements on a proportional, individual risk 
excess of loss, or catastrophe excess of loss 
basis. The catastrophe reinsurance portfolio  
is the largest class of insurance risk written by 
Amlin Bermuda. Exposures to each programme 
are currently limited to US$12.5 million per  
risk and US$75 million any one catastrophe 
programme. Overall catastrophe loss limits are 
applied in relation to specific scenarios as an 
allocation of total Group tolerances. The current 
highest modelled loss is US$239 million at  
1 January 2011. 
Since 2011 Amlin Bermuda has bought a more 
significant reinsurance programme as discussed 
on page 50. 
The special risks account includes small 
premium classes mostly relating to terrorism 
reinsurance but also includes nuclear, short-
term trade credit and contingency which is 
written in all parts of the world. In 2010 the 
portfolio of special risks was expanded to 
include Trade Credit reinsurance which covers 
companies against the non-payment of monies 
due as goods or services from trade partners 
locally or overseas. 
The accident and health class is written  
through medical expense schemes in the US 
and provides personal accident reinsurance 
worldwide. Personal accident reinsurance could 
be impacted by a single or series of accidents 
to high value insured individuals or from a 
multiple death and injury event such as an air 
crash or natural catastrophe.  
The growth in the casualty class during 2011 
reflects the appointment of a dedicated 
underwriter writing US casualty business, similar 
to the portfolio written by Syndicate 2001. 
E. Amlin Corporate Insurance  
In July 2009 Amlin acquired Fortis Corporate 
Insurance N.V., subsequently renamed Amlin 
Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI), a leading 
commercial insurer operating in the Benelux.  
As described in Section C, ACI’s French 
operation was merged with Amlin France  
in May 2010. 
ACI writes four main classes of business;  
motor, liability, property and marine, mainly  
for commercial clients locally. Exposures are 
predominantly in Belgium, the Netherlands and 
France apart from marine transportation risks  
or where an insured has exposures overseas.

3. Risk disclosures continued 
ACI’s property account is mainly large 
schedules of properties (e.g. for municipalities) 
written on a co-insurance basis in the 
Netherlands and larger commercial industrial 
clients in Belgium and France. The company is 
a leader in both territories. Overseas exposure 
is written mainly from the large commercial 
industrial portfolio where there are client 
operations overseas. The engineering book 
includes contractors all risks, machinery 
breakdown and some computer equipment. 
The marine portfolio covers general cargo,  
a large commodities book for Belgian and 
French trading corporations, hull, land 
equipment, shipbuilders’ risk (where ACI are a 
recognised market leader), inland hull and large 
yachts. This portfolio is being re-underwritten 
due to high loss ratios in some sub-classes and 
the mix of business is therefore likely to change.  
ACI also underwrites a range of marine 
products via an agency agreement with 
RaetsMarine including marine liability, cargo 
and hull. 
The non-marine liability portfolio in the 
Netherlands is professional indemnity and 
general liability written on a claims-made basis, 
particularly for property related professions and 
miscellaneous professions such as travel 
operators. In Belgium, ACI are a recognised 
leader in medical liability and general liability  
is written on a losses occurring form. 
Across the portfolio maximum and average  
line sizes are higher for ACI than those written 
in Amlin London. This reflects the leading 
position of the company in the local industrial, 
commercial and marine markets. Furthermore, 
there is limited aggregation between this 
portfolio and catastrophe reinsurance business 
written elsewhere in the Group and ACI’s book 
is protected by reinsurance on a per risk and 
catastrophe excess of loss basis.  
The commercial motor account is comprised  
of domestic company fleets including a large 
leasing and rental fleets portfolio written in the 
Netherlands and a smaller portfolio in Belgium. 
Over 70% of the account is cars, vans or 
commercial vehicles.  
Captive business is written in Belgium as 
fronting for captive reinsurers of large industrial 
companies. ACI retain small amounts of these 
risks but receive a fronting fee. Analysis is 
carried out on captives to manage potential 
credit risk. 
Reinsurance arrangements  
Syndicate 2001 purchases proportional 
reinsurance to supplement line size and to 
reduce exposure on individual risks, notably  
for aviation and large property risks. A part  
of the premium ceded under such facilities is 
placed with Amlin Bermuda and a separate 
proportional facility protects the excess of loss 
reinsurance portfolio through a Special Purpose 
Syndicate at Lloyd’s, Syndicate 6106. Syndicate 
2001 also purchases a number of excess of loss 
reinsurances to protect itself from severe 
frequency or size of losses. The structure of the 
programme and type of protection bought will 
vary from year to year depending on the 
availability and price of cover.  
On large risks, individual facultative reinsurance 
may be bought which protects against a loss  
to that specific risk. 
Specific risk excess of loss reinsurance is 
purchased for each class of business. The 
amount of cover bought depends upon the line 
size written for each class. The deductibles or 
amounts borne prior to recovery vary from class 
to class as do the amounts of co-reinsurance  
or unplaced protection. Specific programmes 
are purchased to deal with large individual  
risk losses, such as fire or large energy losses,  
and these programmes may be combined  
at a higher level into a general programme  
for larger losses. 
UK and French direct property business is 
protected by a European wind programme which 
also protects ACI’s Dutch and French exposures. 
The combined claims to Syndicate 2001 from 
several losses which aggregate in a single 
catastrophe event are protected by catastrophe 
cover. A separate excess of loss programme  
is purchased to protect the excess of loss 
reinsurance portfolio against such losses. Since 
2006, the amount of excess of loss reinsurance 
purchased is lower and in 2011 first loss cover 
responded to losses exceeding US$135 million. 
The 2012 programme has been restructured  
to provide first loss protection in excess of 
US$60 million for international catastrophe 
losses. In addition, the combined aggregate  
and catastrophe protection has been renewed 
to provide lower level cover in the event of 
multiple losses to the portfolio. 
For 2012 the excess of loss programme 
purchased by Amlin Bermuda has also been 
restructured to provide first event cover for 
international losses at a similar level to the 
London placement (deductibles vary slightly by 
territory and peril). Enhanced first event cover 
for US losses and additional vertical protection 
has also been purchased. In addition the 
combined aggregate and catastrophe excess  
of loss protection has been renewed.  
Amlin Re Europe places quota share and 
catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance to 
protect the property portfolio. Motor excess  
of loss protection is also purchased. 
ACI buys a comprehensive programme for each 
class of business. Specific cover is placed for 
engineering, personal accident, motor, liability 
and energy. A general programme protects  
the remaining marine exposures. The property 
account is protected by both per risk and 
catastrophe excess of loss programmes with the 
latter additionally protecting European property 
business written by Amlin UK and Amlin France. 
There is no guarantee that reinsurance 
coverage will be available to meet all potential 
loss circumstances as, for very severe 
catastrophe losses, it is possible that the full 
extent of the cover bought is not sufficient.  
Any loss amount which exceeds the programme 
would be retained by the Group. It is also 
possible that a dispute could arise with a 
reinsurer which reduces the recovery made. 
The reinsurance programme is bought to cover 
the expected claims arising on the original 
portfolio. However, it is possible for there to  
be a mismatch, or a gap in cover, which would 
result in a higher than expected retained loss. 
Many parts of the programme also have limited 
reinstatements and therefore the number of 
claims which may be recovered from second or 
subsequent major losses is limited. It is possible 
for the programme to be exhausted by a series 
of losses in one annual period and it may not be 
possible to purchase additional reinsurance at 
all or for an acceptable price. This would result 
in the Group bearing higher losses from further 
events occurring. It should also be noted that 
the renewal date of the reinsurance 
programmes does not necessarily correspond 
to that of the business written. Where business 
is not protected by risk attaching reinsurance 
(which provides coverage for the duration of all 
the policies written) this reinsurance protection 
could expire resulting in an increase in possible 
loss retained by the Group if renewal of the 
programme is not achieved.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Realistic Disaster Scenario (RDS) analysis 
The Group has a defined event risk tolerance 
which determines the maximum net loss that 
the Group intends to limit its exposure with 
respect to major modelled catastrophe event 
scenarios. Currently this is a maximum of £350 
million for Group. The Group Catastrophe Risk 
team are responsible for aggregating potential 
scenarios and as at 1 January 2012 levels of 
exposure are significantly below the potential 
maximum tolerance, the largest, the Japanese 
Earthquake scenario being £314 million for the 
Group. At present the Group is not utilising the 
full extent of its risk tolerance. 
These scenarios are extraordinary events –  
with an occurrence probability of less than 1  
in 100 years estimated for the natural peril or 
elemental losses. The Group also adopts risk 
tolerance maximum net limits for a number  
of other non-elemental scenarios, including 
aviation collision and North Sea rig loss. 
The risk tolerance policy recognises that there 
may be circumstances in which the net event 
limit could be exceeded. Such circumstances 
include changes in rates of exchange, non 
renewal or delay in renewal of reinsurance 
protection, reinsurance security failure, or 
regulatory and legal requirements.  
A detailed analysis of catastrophe exposures is 
carried out every quarter and measured against 
risk tolerance. The following assumptions and 
procedures are used in the process: 
• The data used reflects the information 
supplied to the Group by insureds and 
ceding companies. This may prove to be 
incomplete, inaccurate or could develop 
during the policy period; 
• The exposures are modelled using a mixture 
of stochastic models and underwriter input 
to arrive at ‘damage factors’ – these factors 
are then applied to the assumed aggregate 
exposure to produce gross loss estimates. 
The damage factors may prove to be 
inadequate; 
• The reinsurance programme as purchased 
is applied – a provision for reinsurer 
counterparty failure is included in the 
analysis but may prove to be inadequate; 
and 
• Reinstatement premiums both payable  
and receivable are included.  
There is no guarantee that the assumptions and 
techniques deployed in calculating these event 
loss estimate figures are accurate. 
Furthermore, there could also be a loss which 
exceeds these figures. The likelihood of such a 
catastrophe is considered to be remote, but the 
most severe scenarios modelled are simulated 
events and these simulations could prove  
to be unreliable.  
Insurance liabilities and reinsurance assets: 
Calculation of incurred but not reported (IBNR) 
and claims development 
The Group adopts a rigorous process in  
the calculation of an adequate provision for 
insurance claim liabilities. The overriding aim is 
to establish reserves which are expected to be 
at least adequate and that there is consistency 
from year to year. Therefore, the level of 
reserves are set at a level above the actuarial 
‘best estimate’ position. However, there is  
a risk that, due to unforeseen circumstances, 
the reserves carried are not sufficient to meet 
insurance claim liabilities reported in future 
years on policy periods which have expired. 
Process and methodology 
The reserving process commences with the 
proper recording and reporting of claims 
information which consists of paid and notified 
or outstanding claims. For the London market 
business information is received through 
Xchanging (the London market bureau) and,  
in the case of Amlin UK business, service 
companies, ACI, Amlin Bermuda and Amlin Re 
Europe, directly from brokers and policyholders. 
Claims records are maintained for each policy 
and class. For notified or outstanding claims,  
a case reserve is established based on the  
views of underwriting management and claims 
managers, using external legal or expert advice 
where appropriate. This reserve is expected to 
be sufficient to meet the claim payment when  
it is finally determined. For some classes  
of business, particularly liability business, 
settlement may be several years after the  
initial notification of the claim, as it may be 
subject to complexities or court action. For 
claims received from Xchanging, the market 
reserve is generally set by the lead underwriter, 
but there are circumstances on larger claims 
where the Group will post higher reserves than 
those notified.  
To establish a provision for IBNR claims,  
the underwriting and claims teams in the UK, 
Bermuda, France and Switzerland use their 
experience and knowledge of the class of 
business to estimate the potential future 
development of each class for every underwriting 
year. ACI adopt a different approach with Group 
Actuarial producing a set of best estimate 
reserves to which local management add 
additional prudence based on their knowledge 
of the business. Statistics are used in all cases 
to fully recognise the different potential 
development of each class of business. The 
development period varies by class, by method 
of acceptance and is also determined by the 
deductible of each policy written. For casualty 
business, the policy form will determine 
whether claims can be made on a claims  
made (as advised) or as a losses occurring 
(determined by date of loss) basis. This has a 
significant impact on the reporting period in 
which claims can be notified. In setting the 
IBNR provision estimates are made for the 
ultimate premium and ultimate gross claims 
value for each underwriting year. Allowance  
is then made for anticipated reinsurance 
recoveries to reach a net claim position. 
Reinsurance recoveries are calculated for 
outstanding and IBNR claims, sometimes 
through the use of historical recovery rates  
or statistical projections, and provisions are 
made as appropriate for bad debt or possible 
disputes. The component of ultimate IBNR 
provision estimates and reinsurance recoveries 
that relates to future events occurring to the 
existing portfolio is removed in order to reflect 
GAAP accounting practice. 
To assist with the process of determining  
the reserves, triangulation statistics for each 
class are produced which show the historical 
development of premium, as well as paid and 
incurred losses, for each underwriting year, 
from inception to the date of review. ACI has 
similar statistics based on the date of premium 
receipt and claim advice rather than policy 
inception. Each class triangulation is also 
independently analysed by the internal actuarial 
team using actuarial software as appropriate. 
The aim of the actuarial exercise is to produce 
‘best estimate’ ultimate premium and claims 
amounts which can be compared to, or used  
to produce, the figures proposed by divisional 
management. Amlin London, Amlin UK, Amlin 
France and ACI meetings are held in which 
executive management, actuarial staff and 
business management discuss claims issues 
and analyse the proposed and independently 
generated reserves to conclude the provision  
to be carried.  
For Amlin Bermuda, which commenced 
underwriting in 2005, historical statistics for 
Syndicate 2001’s relevant classes of business 
have been used as a guide for actuarial review 
in addition to Amlin Bermuda’s own data  
and the review discussion is conducted  
in conference or by email correspondence.  
The review process for Amlin Re Europe is 
conducted in a similar manner. 
Final reserve submissions are provided for the 
approval of Boards, as required.  120

Areas of uncertainty 
The reserves established can be more or less 
than adequate to meet eventual claims arising. 
The level of uncertainty varies significantly from 
class to class but can arise from inadequate 
case reserves for known large losses and 
catastrophes or from inadequate provision  
for IBNR. The impact on profit before tax  
of a 1% improvement/deterioration in the total 
net claims reserves would be £26.6 million 
gain/loss (2010: £22.5 million). 
Large loss case reserves are determined 
through careful analysis of the individual claim, 
often with the advice of legal advisers. Liability 
claims arising from events such as the 11 
September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US  
are examples of cases where there continues  
to be some uncertainty over the eventual value 
of claims.  
Property catastrophe claims, such as 
earthquake or hurricane losses, can take several 
months, or years, to develop as adjusters visit 
damaged property and agree claim valuations. 
Until all the claims are settled it requires an 
analysis of the area damaged, contracts 
exposed and the use of models to simulate  
the loss against the portfolio of exposure in 
order to arrive at an estimate of ultimate loss  
to the Group. There is uncertainty over the 
adequacy of information and modelling of 
major losses for a period of several months 
after a catastrophe loss. Account should also  
be taken of factors which may influence the  
size of claims such as increased inflation or  
a change in law.  
The long tail liability classes, for which a  
large IBNR has to be established, represent  
the most difficult classes to reserve because 
claims are notified and settled several years 
after the expiry of the policy concerned.  
This is particularly the case for US liability 
written on a losses occurring basis. 
The use of historical development data, 
adjusted for known changes to wordings  
or the claims environment, is fundamental to 
reserving these classes. It is used in conjunction 
with the advice of lawyers and third party 
claims adjusters on material single claims. 
The allocation of IBNR to the reinsurance 
programme is an uncertain exercise as there  
is limited knowledge of the size or number  
of future claims advices. The assumption over 
future reinsurance recoveries may be incorrect 
and unforeseen disputes could arise which 
would reduce recoveries made. 
The estimated premium income in respect  
of facility contracts, for example binding 
authorities and lineslips, is deemed to be 
written in full at the inception of the contract 
and may turn out to be more or less then 
initially estimated.  
Internal capital modelling of risk 
To improve the Group’s risk management 
capability, and assessment of capital 
requirements, Amlin has developed a stochastic 
model covering all entities of the Group. This 
enables standalone modelling for each entity  
as well as a consolidated Group total position. 
The output from the model includes a 
distribution of outcomes of all material risks, 
giving distributions for: reserves for prior written 
liabilities, investment performance, and new 
business underwriting performance. The result 
is a combined view of the expected best 
estimate mean profitability and the range  
of possibilities around it.  
The model requires the input of a large number 
of explicit parameters. Those inputs are based 
on many different sources of information 
including detailed historical data on premium 
and claims, forecast income and exposures, 
estimated rating levels and catastrophe loss 
data from proprietary models applied to the 
Group’s portfolio. It enables projection of an 
estimated mean ultimate loss ratio and the 
distribution of results around it. The model 
explicitly recognises diversification credit, since 
class results are not all strongly correlated and 
thus individual classes are unlikely to all 
produce losses (or profits) in the same year. 
Due to the inherent uncertainty of predicting 
the key drivers of business performance, 
including in particular claims levels, any 
individual simulation of the model viewed in 
isolation cannot be relied upon as an accurate 
forecast. However, the output from many 
thousands of simulated results can provide a 
picture of the possible distribution of business 
results. This output is useful in developing  
an understanding of the losses which may  
be borne by the business at varying levels  
of probability. 
There are a large number of uncertainties and 
difficulties in achieving accurate results from 
the model. Some of the key issues are: 
• The model is based on a best estimate view 
of business volumes and rate expectations, 
which may not be borne out in practice; 
• A significant change in the portfolio of 
business could result in the past not being  
a reliable guide to the future; 
• Changing external environmental factors 
may not be assessed accurately; 
• Model risk may be significant in such  
a complex and developing discipline; 
• Key assumptions over levels of correlation 
between classes may over time prove to  
be incorrect; and 
• Catastrophe model inputs, which estimate 
the severity and frequency of large 
catastrophes on the portfolio, may  
be incorrect. 
The result reproduced in the table below 
represents the modelled loss sustained by  
the business from a single 1 in 200 bad year 
i.e. at the 0.5 percentile. This probability is  
the calculation benchmark required by the FSA 
and Lloyd’s. However, it does not represent  
the level of capital required for the Group to 
support current and expected business levels, 
which should be considered over a longer 
period of modelling. Furthermore, the Group is 
required to carry higher levels of capital which 
are sufficient in the eyes of rating agencies and 
clients. This analysis includes the modelling  
of the Group.

The Group’s net aggregate reserve releases from all prior years amounted to £112.6 million (2010: £156.5 million). In part, this arises from the 
Group’s reserving philosophy which aims to make the most recent years, with the greatest uncertainty of result, prudently reserved leaving a potential 
for subsequent release. 
This differs from the £211.7 million increase in reserves stated in the claims development table above as the table above is on an underwriting year 
basis and the surpluses in this narrative are on an annually accounted basis. The table above excludes any net aggregate reserve releases from 2002 
and prior years. Also the table above excludes ACI, which is accounted for on an accident year basis and for which net reserve releases are £6.6 million 
(2010: £43.4 million). The ACI table also excludes any net aggregate reserve releases from 2002 and prior years. 
Further details on these reserve releases and other aspects of the underwriting performance are included in the Performance Section of this  
Annual Report.  122

3.2 Financial investment risk 
Market risk 
Risk management 
The following section describes the Group’s investment risk management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.  
The Group has two main categories of assets: 
Underwriting assets. These are premiums received and held to meet future insurance claims.  
Capital assets. These are the capital required by the regulators to support the underwriting business plus working capital and surplus funds. Apart from 
the outstanding borrowings, these assets do not have specific current liabilities attached to them.  
Investment governance 
The Group manages its investments in accordance with investment frameworks that are set by the Boards of Amlin plc and its subsidiaries. These 
frameworks determine investment governance and the investment risk tolerance. They are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the Boards’ 
fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities are being met. Day to day management of the investments is delegated to the Investment Management 
Executive or members of the relevant subsidiary’s executive, who are advised by the Chief Investment Officer.  
The Investment Management Executive comprises the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Chief Investment Officer, and meets at least 
quarterly to consider whether the strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation ranges are appropriate to optimise investment returns within 
the risk tolerances set by the Boards. Group Investments, led by the Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for tactical asset allocation and the 
appointment of external investment managers and custodians. 
The Investment Advisory Panel, which consists of external investment professionals as well as members of the Investment Management Executive, 
meets quarterly. The Panel provides challenge to the Group’s view of future economic activity and asset class performance. In addition, Group 
Compliance and external lawyers provide advice on investment regulations. 
Risk tolerance 
Investment risk tolerances are set by the Board of Amlin plc and its subsidiaries. The investment process is driven from the risk tolerance which is 
determined by reference to factors such as the underwriting cycle and the requirements of the capital providers. In a hard underwriting market capital 
preservation is paramount in order to support the insurance business and, therefore, the risk tolerance for the capital assets will be low. Conversely, 
the risk tolerance for the underwriting assets under these circumstances will be relatively high due to the strong cash flow. In a soft underwriting 
market the opposite applies.  
Investment risk is independently monitored by the Risk Assessment and Monitoring department using a bespoke investment risk model. The Head  
of Investment Risk reports regularly to the Investment Management Executive and to the Group Risk Committee. 
Strategic asset allocation 
Each of the Group’s principal subsidiaries has its own strategic asset allocations which are set according to its risk tolerance and liabilities. 
The strategic asset allocation for capital assets are set by using a Value at Risk (VaR
(1)
) model, to determine the optimum asset allocation for the current 
risk tolerance which ensures that appropriate solvency levels are maintained.  
The expected timescale for future cash flows in each currency is calculated by the Group Actuarial team. The average durations are the neutral position 
for the strategic asset allocation for the policyholders’ funds.  
Tactical ranges around these strategic asset allocations provide flexibility to ensure that an appropriate risk/reward balance is maintained in changing 
investment markets.  
Investment management 
The investments are run on a multi-asset, multi-manager basis. Exposure to the asset classes is achieved using physical or derivative instruments and 
may be managed by Group Investments or by outsourced managers, on a segregated, pooled or commingled basis
(2)
. The manager selection is based 
on a range of criteria that leads to the expectation that they will add value to the funds over the medium to long-term. The managers have discretion  
to manage the funds on a day to day basis within investment guidelines or prospectuses applicable to their funds that ensure that they comply with  
the investment frameworks. The managers performance, compliance and risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.  
(1) VaR is a statistical measure, which calculates the possible loss over a year, in normal market conditions. As VaR estimates are based on historical market data this should not be viewed as an 
absolute gauge of the level of risk to the investments. 
(2) Segregated funds are managed separately for the Group. Pooled funds are collective investment vehicles in which the Group and other investors purchase units. Commingled funds combine 
the assets of several clients.   Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Note: The table above includes all bond and equity investments. 
Valuation risk  
The Group’s earnings are directly affected by changes in the valuations of the investments held in the portfolios. These valuations vary according to  
the movements in underlying markets. Factors affecting markets include changes in the economic and political environment, risk appetites, liquidity, 
interest rates and exchange rates. These factors have an impact on the Group’s investments and are taken into consideration when setting strategic 
and tactical asset allocations. The price of holdings can also vary due to specific risks, such as the corporate strategy and companies’ balance sheet 
structure, which may impact the value of individual equity and corporate bond holdings. This is mitigated by holding diversified portfolios. 
Group assets are marked to market at bid price. Prices are supplied by the Group’s custodians whose pricing processes are covered by their published 
annual audits. In accordance with their pricing policies, prices are sourced from market recognised pricing vendor sources. These pricing sources use 
closing trades, or where more appropriate in illiquid markets, pricing models. These prices are reconciled to the fund managers’ records to check for 
reasonableness. Mark to market valuations for over the counter derivatives are supplied by the custodian and checked to the relevant counterparty  
and Bloomberg. Property funds are based on the most recent price available, which in some instances may be a quarter in arrears. Where a property 
transaction has taken place the transaction price is used if it is the most recent price available.  
As an additional check, where available, prices as at 31 December 2011 have been verified by the Group using available quoted prices on Bloomberg 
to verify that the prices used are a good estimation for fair value. As at 31 December 2011, a limited number of stale prices were identified, the overall 
value of which are considered immaterial. Further details on the fair value measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities are included in  
note 3.3. 
The valuation of investments is sensitive to equity risk. The impact on profit before tax of a 1% improvement/deterioration in the total market value of 
shares and other variable yield securities would be a £2.0 million gain/loss (2010: £3.5 million). Sensitivities in relation to other risks are considered  
in the remainder of note 3.2.  130

Interest rate risk  
Investors’ expectations for interest rates will impact bond yields
(3)
. Therefore, the value of the Group’s bond holdings is subject to fluctuation as bond 
yields rise and fall. If yields fall the capital value will rise, and visa versa. The sensitivity of the price of a bond is indicated by its duration
(4)
. The greater 
the duration of a security, the greater its possible price volatility. Typically, the longer the maturity of a bond the greater its duration. The maturity 
bands of the Group’s bond holdings at year end are shown below.

Note: The table above excludes pooled investments of £1,348.7 million (2010: £1,523.5 million).  
The duration of underwriting assets is set with reference to the duration of the underlying liabilities. It should be noted that the liabilities are not 
currently discounted and therefore their value is not impacted by interest rate movements. Cash is raised, or the duration of the portfolio reduced,  
if it is believed that yields may rise and therefore capital values will fall.  
The average durations of the bond and cash portfolios for the underwriting assets and associated insurance liabilities of Syndicate 2001, Amlin AG and 
Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI) at year end were as follows:

Note: The table above includes pooled investments. 
The average duration of assets and liabilities in Japanese yen and New Zealand dollars are currently not separately modelled. 
The asset durations above are calculated by the custodian. Some differences occur between custodian durations and those reported by the fund 
managers due to the use of different prepayment assumptions. Using fund manager calculations for 31 December 2011, the following asset year 
durations would result: sterling 0.4; US dollars 1.0; euro 0.9; and Canadian dollars 1.7. As an additional check, where available, durations as at  
31 December 2011 have been verified by the Group using Bloomberg data. In all instances, the duration differences are within the ranges permitted  
by the investment guidelines. Liabilities durations are calculated by the Group actuarial team.

(3) The yield is the rate of return paid if a security is held to maturity. The calculation is based on the coupon rate, length of time to maturity and the market price. It assumes coupon interest paid 
over the life of the security is reinvested at the same rate. 
(4) The duration is the weighted average maturity of the security’s cash flows, where the present values of the cash flows serve as the weights.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
Foreign exchange risk 
The exposure to translation, revaluation and asset liability currency matching risk, combine to form the Group’s overall exposure to foreign 
exchange risk. The Group’s reporting currency is sterling and significant subsidiary functional currencies are sterling, euro and US dollar. The 
Group holds assets and liability balances in base currencies of sterling, euro, US dollar, Canadian dollars, New Zealand dollars and Japanese yen.  
Translation risk 
Foreign exchange translation risk exposure arises when business is written in non-functional currencies. These transactions are translated into  
the functional currency of the relevant Group entity at the prevailing spot rate once the premium is received. Consequently, there is exposure to 
currency movements between the exposure being written and the premium being converted. Payments in non-functional currencies are converted 
back into the policy currency at the time a claim is to be settled, therefore, the Group is exposed to exchange rate risk between the claim being 
made and the settlement being paid.  
Revaluation risk 
The Group is subject to revaluation risk as a result of the translation into the Group’s sterling reporting currency of the balance sheets of the Group 
companies that have a non-sterling functional currency. At 31 December 2011 the material balance sheets that have a non-sterling functional  
currency were Amlin AG’s Bermuda branch with net assets of US$1,360.9 million, Amlin Corporate Insurance with net assets of €226.1 million and  
the Solo Absolute Bonds and Currency Fund with net assets of €234.8 million (2010: US$1,573.9 million, €320.5 million and €nil respectively). 
Foreign exchange gains and losses on investments in overseas subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income in accordance with  
IAS 21 ‘The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates’. The loss recognised in other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2011 
was £38.9 million (2010: £17.6 million gain). This reflects the movement in the US dollar rate from 1.56 at the start of the year to 1.55 at the balance 
sheet date and the movement in the euro rate from 1.17 at the start of the year to 1.20 at the balance sheet date. In order to mitigate the impact of 
these currency fluctuations, the Group adopts a policy of hedging up to 50% of the net currency exposure resulting from the net investments in these 
subsidiaries. For this purpose, the Group uses options that are accounted for as hedges of net investments in overseas subsidiaries, in accordance  
with the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. Consequently all realised and unrealised fair value gains and losses on the hedging instruments  
are taken to reserves to match the underlying movement in the valuation of the net investment in overseas subsidiaries, which includes applicable  
fair value adjustments and goodwill. At the year end, hedges were in place for US$589.0 million (2010: US$729.0 million) and €164.0 million  
(2010: €204.0 million). These were in the form of long sterling calls/US dollar puts funded by short sterling puts/US dollar calls and long sterling 
calls/euro puts funded by short sterling puts/euro calls. The net valuation of these trades was a £0.8 million liability (2010: £1.4 million asset) at the 
year end. The net realised and unrealised gain from hedging options recognised in reserves at the year end was £2.4 million (2010: £4.2 million loss).  
In relation to revaluation of overseas subsidiaries, if the USD/GBP exchange rates were to improve by 10%, this would result in a decrease of  
£97.7 million in exchange loss recognised in other comprehensive income. This decrease would be offset by a valuation loss of £22.7 million on  
the designated portion of the hedging instruments. The same exchange rate deterioration would result in an additional £79.3 million exchange loss 
through consolidated reserves. This loss would be offset by a valuation gain of £14.0 million on the designated portion of the hedging instruments.  
If the EUR/GBP exchange rate were to improve by 10%, this would result in a decrease of £84.0 million in exchange loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income. This decrease would be offset by a valuation loss of £6.4 million on the designated portion of the hedging instruments.  
The same exchange rate deterioration would result in an additional £3.9 million exchange loss through consolidated reserves. This loss would be  
offset by a valuation gain of £10.2 million on the designated portion of the hedging instruments.  
Asset liability matching by currency risk 
If a liability in a currency, other then the functional currencies of sterling, euro and US dollars, is considered to be sufficiently large following  
a major event, for example such as the 2010 and 2011 New Zealand earthquakes, that currency will be bought and held as a base currency  
to cover the potential liability. 
Underwriting assets are held in the base currencies of sterling, euros, US dollars, Canadian dollars, New Zealand dollars and Japanese yen,  
which represent the majority of the Group’s liabilities by currency, thus limiting the underwriting asset liability matching currency risk.  132

Further foreign exchange risk arises until non-sterling profits or losses are converted into sterling. Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by converting the 
subsidiaries’ functional currency profits into the Groups reporting currency. Given the inherent volatility in some business classes, a cautious approach 
is adopted on the speed and level of sales, but the Group seeks to extinguish all currency risk on earned profit during the second year after the 
commencement of each underwriting year. This approach avoids the inherent dangers of ‘lumpier’ sales. It is not the intention to take speculative 
currency positions in order to make currency gains.  
At 31 December 2011 the investment managers held some forward foreign exchange contracts in their portfolios to hedge non-base currency 
investments. These were transacted with banks with a short term rating of at least A1 and are marked to market in investment valuations.   Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Liquidity risk 
It is important that the Group’s companies can pay their obligations as they fall due. Levels of cash are therefore managed on a daily basis and buffers 
of liquid assets are held in excess of the immediate requirements. This is to reduce the risk of being forced sellers of any of the Group’s assets, which 
may result in realising prices below fair value, especially in periods of below normal investment market liquidity.  
The Group funds its insurance liabilities with a portfolio of cash and debt securities exposed to market risk. The following table indicates the contractual 
timing of cash flows arising from assets and liabilities for management of insurance contracts as of 31 December 2011:

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that the Group becomes exposed to loss if a specific counterparty fails to perform its contractual obligations in a timely manner 
impacting the Group’s ability to meet its claims as they fall due. Credit risk can also arise from underlying causes that have an impact upon the 
creditworthiness of all counterparties of a particular description or geographical location. The Group is exposed to credit risk in its investment portfolio 
and with its premium and reinsurance receivables. The table below shows the breakdown at 31 December 2011 of the exposure of the bond portfolio 
and insurance and reinsurance receivables by credit quality

(5) Credit ratings on debt securities are State Street composite ratings based on Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch, depending on which agency/agencies rate each bond. 
Insurance and reinsurance 
The table includes premium receivables, representing amounts due from policyholders. The quality of these receivables is not graded, but based on 
historical experience there is limited default risk relating to these amounts. Premium credit risk is managed through a number of controls that include 
broker approval, annual financial review and internal rating of brokers and regular monitoring of premium settlement performance. 
Also included are reinsurance receivables, which represent the amounts due at 31 December 2011, as well as amounts expected to be recovered  
on unpaid outstanding claims (including IBNR) in respect of earned risks. These are stated net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts. The credit  
risk in respect of reinsurance receivables including reinsurers’ share of outstanding claims is primarily managed by review and approval of reinsurance 
security by the Group’s Reinsurance Security Committee, prior to the purchase of the reinsurance contract. Guidelines are set, and monitored,  
that restrict the purchase of reinsurance security based on the Group’s own ratings for each reinsurer and Standard & Poor’s ratings. The Group  
holds collateral from certain reinsurers including those that are non-rated. At 31 December 2011 the Group held collateral of £226.5 million  
(2010: £124.5 million) as security against potential default by reinsurance counterparties. Provisions are made against the amounts due from certain 
reinsurers, depending on the age of the debt and the current rating assigned to the reinsurer. The impact on profit before tax of a 1% variation in the 
reinsurance assets would be £6.7 million (2010: £4.4 million). The details of overdue reinsurance assets and insurance receivables are provided in 
notes 18 and 19. 
Investments 
As well as failure of a counterparty to perform its contractual obligations, the price of government and corporate bond holdings will be affected by 
investors’ perception of a borrower’s creditworthiness. Credit risk within the investment funds is managed through: restrictions on the exposures by 
credit rating, as determined by the rating agencies, the credit research carried out by the investment managers and by holding diversified portfolios. 
£21.0 million of bonds held at 31 December 2011 were subject to downgrades during the year (2010: £2.5 million).  
The Group’s largest non-government counterparty as at 31 December 2011, excluding liquidity funds, has an AA rating and is valued at £63.7 million 
(2010: £46.8 million). The investment comprises cash of £53.8 million (2010: £24.1 million), corporate bonds of £9.4 million (2010: £7.4 million), 
asset backed securities of £0.5 million (2010: £nil) and £nil mortgage backed securities (2010: £15.3 million).  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

3.3 Fair value methodology 
For financial instruments carried at fair value the Group has categorised the measurement basis into a fair value hierarchy as follows: 
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market is one in which transactions for the asset  
occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide readily and regularly available quoted prices.  
Level 2 – Inputs to a valuation model other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
Level 3 – Inputs to a valuation model for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) and are significant  
to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not 
available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date (or market 
information for the inputs to any valuation models). As such, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions it is considered that market participants 
would use in pricing the asset. 
Shares and other variable yield securities 
Listed equities traded on a primary exchange are classified as Level 1. Unlisted equities are valued using internal models, based principally upon 
management’s assumptions, and are classified as Level 3.  
Debt and other fixed income securities 
The fair value is based upon quotes from pricing services where available. These pricing services derive prices based on an average of quotes provided 
by brokers. Where multiple quotes are not available, the fair value is based upon evaluated pricing services, which typically use proprietary cash flow 
models and incorporate observable market inputs, such as credit spreads, benchmark quotes and other trade data. If such services do not provide 
coverage of the asset, then fair value is determined manually using indicative broker quotes, which are corroborated by recent market transactions  
in similar or identical assets.  
Where there is an active market for these assets and their fair value is the unadjusted quoted market price, these are classified as Level 1. This is 
typically the case for government bonds. Level 1 also includes exchange-traded bond funds, where fair value is based upon quoted market prices and 
the funds are actively traded. Where the market is inactive or the price is adjusted, but significant market observable inputs have been used by the 
pricing sources, then these are considered to be Level 2 inputs. This is typically the case for government agency debt, corporate debt, mortgage and 
asset backed securities and catastrophe bonds. Certain assets, for which prices or other market inputs are unobservable, are classified as Level 3. 
Property funds 
The fair value is based upon valuations provided by the fund manager. The inputs into that valuation are primarily unobservable and, as such, these 
assets are classified as Level 3. 
Participation in investment pools 
These are investment funds and the value is based upon unadjusted, quoted and executable prices provided by the fund manager. These are classified 
as Level 1, except where there is evidence these are not being actively traded at the fund manager’s price. 
Derivatives 
Listed derivative contracts, such as futures, that are actively traded are valued using quoted prices from the relevant exchange and are classified as 
Level 1. Margin or collateral relating to derivatives are classified as Level 1. Over-the-counter currency options are valued by the counterparty using 
quantitative models with multiple market inputs. The market inputs are observable and the valuation can be validated through external sources. These 
are classified as Level 2. Certain derivatives for which prices or other market inputs are unobservable, are classified as Level 3. This is typically the case 
for catastrophe linked instruments.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

The majority of the Group’s investments are valued based on quoted market information or other observable market data. The Group holds 3.0% 
(2010: 2.2%) of its assets at a fair value based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments. Where estimates are used, these are based on a 
combination of independent third party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible. While such 
valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would 
not change the fair value significantly.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

4. Segmental reporting 
Management has determined the Group’s operating segments based on the management information reviewed by the Board of Directors of the 
Company that are used to make strategic decisions. All operating segments used by management meet the definition of a reportable segment under 
IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’.  
The Group is organised into seven operating segments. Segments represent the distinct units through which the Group is organised and managed. 
These segments are as follows: 
• Amlin London, consisting of the Reinsurance, Property & Casualty, Marine and Aviation business units, underwritten via Syndicate 2001; 
• Amlin UK, underwriting commercial insurance in the UK domestic market, via Syndicate 2001; 
• Amlin France, which writes a diverse book of specialty business in France, via Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V.; 
• Amlin Bermuda, which writes predominantly property reinsurance business, via Amlin AG, including reinsurance ceded by Syndicate 2001; 
• Amlin Re Europe, which writes continental European non-life reinsurance business, via Amlin AG; 
• Amlin Corporate Insurance, a leading provider of marine, corporate property and casualty insurance in the Netherlands and Belgium; and 
• Other corporate companies, comprising all other entities of the Group including holding companies. 
Included within the intra group items column are consolidation adjustments. 
Amlin Re Europe was established in October 2010 to write Continental European non-life reinsurance business. The business written by Amlin Re 
Europe in 2010 was not material to the Group and was reported within the Amlin Bermuda segment in the annual financial statements. As a result  
of its increased contribution to the Group’s financial position and performance in the current period, Amlin Re Europe has been identified as a separate 
reportable segment in accordance with IFRS 8. Additionally, to ensure continued consistency with the management information provided to the Board 
of Directors, each operating segment now includes the insurance intermediary and service entities, which generate income and expenses directly 
related to that respective segment, and intra-group commission income and certain operating expenses have been reclassified as acquisition costs and 
underwriting expenses respectively. Accordingly, the information for the year ended 31 December 2010 has been restated to reflect these changes. 
Transactions between segments are carried out at arm’s length. The revenue from external parties reported to the Board of Directors is measured  
in a manner consistent with that in the income statement and revenues are allocated based on the country in which the insurance risk is located. 
Management considers its external customers to be the individual policyholders, and as such the Group is not reliant on any individual customer.  140

Underwriting profits and losses are recognised in the technical account on an annual accounting basis, recognising the results in the period in which 
they are earned. UK corporation tax on Syndicate 2001’s underwriting result is charged in the period in which the underwriting profits are actually  
paid by the Syndicate to the corporate member subsidiary. This creates a deferred tax position. 
Deferred tax is provided on the underwriting result with reference to the forecast ultimate result of each of the years of account. Where this is  
a taxable loss, deferred tax is only provided on the movement on that year of account to the extent that forecasts show that the taxable loss will  
be utilised in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax (before netting off) has been provided on the underwriting result for this accounting period  
of £10.5 million (2010: £68.9 million). 
Reconciliation of tax expense 
The UK standard rate of corporation tax is 26.5% (2010: 28.0%), whereas the tax charged for the year ended 31 December 2011 as a percentage  
of loss before tax is 22.9% (2010: 14.4%). The reasons for this difference are explained below:

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
 
The Group’s reinsurance subsidiary, Amlin Bermuda Ltd, was re-domiciled from Bermuda to Switzerland during 2010 and renamed Amlin AG.  
The company now operates in Switzerland as Amlin Re Europe, with the Bermudian business operating as a branch. The Group’s tax provision for  
2011 has been prepared on the basis that Amlin AG is non-UK resident for UK corporation tax purposes and is exempt from the UK controlled foreign 
company regime. The corporation tax rate for profits earned by the Bermudian branch of Amlin AG is currently nil% (2010: nil%). The combined rate 
which is applicable to profits arising for the Swiss operation only, of Swiss cantonal and federal taxes is 21.2% (2010: 21.2%) 
Deferred tax has been provided for at the local tax rate in force when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The tax rates used are: 
• UK – 25.0% (2010: 27.0%); 
• Netherlands – 25.0% (2010: 25.0%); 
• Bermuda – nil% (2010: nil%); and 
• Switzerland – 21.2% (2010: 21.2%). 
The Budgets in June 2010 and March 2011 announced a change in the main rate of UK corporation tax. The UK tax rate applied for deferred tax 
purposes (25.0%) was enacted in July 2011. Further reductions in the UK corporation tax rate have been announced, which will ultimately reduce  
the corporation tax rate to 23.0%. These subsequent reductions have not yet been enacted or substantively enacted and therefore the rate at which 
deferred tax is provided remains 25.0% in accordance with IAS 12. The estimated impact of the reduction from 25.0% to 23.0% will be a reduction  
in the net deferred tax liability of £4.2 million (2010: £2.6 million). 
The Group is subject to US tax on US underwriting profits. No provision has been made in respect of such tax arising in 2011 (2010: £nil) as any net 
provision is likely to be immaterial.

15. Net foreign exchange losses 
The Group recognised net foreign exchange losses of £10.2 million (2010: £12.3 million) in the income statement during the year. 
The Group writes business in many currencies and although a large proportion of the Group’s balance sheet assets and liabilities are matched, 
minimising the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s result, it is not practical to match exactly all assets and liabilities in 
currency. Accounting standards also require that certain classes of assets and liabilities be translated at different rates (see foreign currency translation 
accounting policy).  
Included within the Group’s foreign exchange losses in the income statement are: 
 
2011
£m
2010
£m
Net losses on underwriting transactions and translation of underwriting assets  
and liabilities at closing rates  (5.9) (5.8)

and liabilities at closing rates (4.1) (4.5)
Non-underwriting exchange losses (4.3) (6.5)

Debt and other fixed income securities include pooled funds, and other fixed income securities. The valuation of these funds is £1,348.7 million  
(2010: £1,523.5 million). Included in these funds at 31 December 2011 is £75.4 million (2010: £nil) in respect of the Leadenhall Value Insurance 
Linked Investments Fund and the Leadenhall Diversified Insurance Linked Investments Fund. The Group ceased to consolidate these funds with effect 
from 1 June 2011 and 2 August 2011 respectively, with additional external investment resulting in the disposal of the Group’s controlling interests  
by way of dilution.  
Participation in investment pools includes units held in money market funds. 
The Group holds hedged and non-hedged derivatives. Hedged derivatives are designated at inception and qualify for hedge accounting under  
IAS 39. Non-hedged derivatives either do not qualify for hedge accounting or the option to hedge account has not been taken. Improvements  
have been made to the disclosure of 2010 comparative values for derivative financial instruments, previously included within other financial assets 
at fair value through income, in order to better reflect their classification under IFRS. There is no impact on the total value of derivative financial 
instruments and net financial assets at 31 December 2010. 
Derivative instruments include margins and collateral of £10.9 million (2010: £1.2 million). Details are included in note 29.

In connection with the purchase accounting for the acquisition of Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V., the Group adjusted claims reserves and related 
reinsurance recoveries to fair value on acquisition. The reduction to the original carrying value of £39.1 million and £6.4 million to claims reserves  
and reinsurance recoveries respectively is being recognised through a charge to the income statement over the period the claims are settled. This net 
charge is £4.0 million in 2011 (2010: net charge £3.3 million). 
The fair value was based on the present value of the expected cash flows with consideration for the uncertainty inherent in both the timing of, and the 
ultimate amount of, future payments for losses and receipts of amounts recoverable from reinsurers. The nominal amounts were discounted to their 
present value using an applicable risk-free discount rate.  
The total reinsurers’ share of claims reserves and unearned premium reserves is set out in the table below: 
 
2011
£m
2010

Reinsurers’ share of insurance liabilities 686.8 454.4
Less provision for impairment of receivables from reinsurers (19.4) (16.0)
Reinsurance assets 667.4 438.4
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a quarterly basis by reviewing counterparty payment history and credit grades  
provided by rating agencies. The credit ratings of the Group’s reinsurance assets are shown in note 3.2. As at 31 December 2011 there were no 
reinsurance assets greater than 3 months overdue (2010: £4.0 million, which were fully provided for). The Group holds collateral of £226.5 million 
(2010: £124.5 million) in relation to reinsurance assets. Details are included in note 29.  
The Group has recognised a total net impairment loss of £0.1 million (2010: £11.4 million) on reinsurance assets and insurance and reinsurance 
receivables. 
The carrying amounts disclosed are reasonably approximate to the fair value at the reporting date.

were incorrectly disclosed within the current portion of loans and receivables in the prior period. There is no impact on the total value of loans

Notes to the accounts continued 
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
 
19. Loans and receivables, including insurance and reinsurance receivables continued 
Receivables arising from reinsurance contracts are comprised principally of amounts recoverable from reinsurers in respect of paid claims and 
premium receivables on inward reinsurance business, including reinstatement premium. 
The Group assesses its insurance and reinsurance receivables for impairment on a quarterly basis by reviewing counterparty payment history and  
for circumstances which may give rise to a dispute or default. As of 31 December 2011 insurance and reinsurance receivables at a nominal value  
of £50.5 million (2010: £117.2 million) were greater than 3 months overdue and provided for on the basis of credit rating to the value of £11.3 million 
(2010: £24.2 million).  
The carrying amounts disclosed above are reasonably approximate to the fair value at the reporting date.  
The ageing analysis of insurance and reinsurance receivables overdue, before impairment provision, is as follows: 
 
2011
£m
2010

3 to 6 months 10.9 18.9
6 to 9 months 14.6 14.0
Greater than 9 months 25.0 84.3
 50.5 117.2
The Netherlands and Belgium business of Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. does not currently produce an ageing report for insurance receivables  
due to the interaction of local market practice and the office’s internal systems. The total level of insurance receivables in the Netherlands and Belgium 
is £88.4 million (2010: £90.3 million). The provision for non-recovery is £5.0 million (2010: £3.2 million). 
Other receivables comprise principally of amounts receivable from investment managers for financial investments sold, input VAT and other  
sundry receivables.

Additions to goodwill during the year of £16.3 million relate to the acquisitions of J R Clare Underwriting Agencies Limited (£4.8 million) and Lead 
Yacht Underwriters Limited (£11.5 million). Further details on these acquisitions are provided in note 39. 
Syndicate participations represent the ongoing rights to trade on Syndicate 2001 within the Lloyd’s insurance market.  
Broker and customer relationship intangibles include those acquired in relation to AUA Insolvency Risk Services Limited, Amlin Corporate Insurance 
N.V. (ACI) and Amlin France Holdings SAS, the net book value being £11.0 million (2010: £12.1 million), £21.7 million (2010: £24.0 million) and  
£3.0 million (2010: £4.7 million) respectively. These intangibles are being amortised over a period of 13, 15 and 5 years respectively, and their 
remaining amortisation life is 12, 13 and 2 years respectively. 
Computer software represents the costs that the Group has incurred on internally developed software relating to a new underwriting platform for ACI.  
It is expected that this software will be amortised over ten years from the date that it is completed. 
Goodwill and the intangible asset in relation to syndicate participations are considered to have an indefinite life. As such, they are tested for impairment 
annually. Computer software is also tested for impairment annually on the basis that it is not yet ready for use. All other intangible assets are tested for

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
 
For the purpose of impairment testing, intangible assets are allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs), identified according to the way in 
which management operates and monitors the business. The intangible asset relating to the syndicate participations supports the underwriting in Amlin 
London, Amlin UK and Amlin France. In 2010 this intangible asset was not allocated to these three CGUs and the impairment testing was performed 
based on aggregate Syndicate 2001 profit forecasts. In 2011, following improvements to the Group’s impairment testing methodology, the syndicate 
participations intangible asset has been allocated to the three CGUs on the basis of the benefit expected to be derived from the asset. 
The analysis of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets by CGU is shown below:

(1) The Amlin London goodwill balance comprises the goodwill from three cash-generating units. The largest individual balance is the goodwill from the acquisition of Lead Yacht Underwriters 
Limited totalling £11.5 million (2010: £nil). 
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. Value in use is calculated for each 
CGU using a discounted cash flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by management and discounted at an 
appropriate discount rate. 
Key assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: 
• Cash flow projections are based on the budgeted operating profit for each CGU contained within the most recent business plans approved  
by management, and adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation. As such, these forecasts reflect the best estimate of future cash flows 
based on historical trends and expected growth rates. The period covered by the projections is 5 years. The most significant assumptions used 
to derive the operating profit include an assessment of the market cycle, retention rates, claims inflation, outwards reinsurance expenditure  
and long-term investment return. 
• In order to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period, a long term average growth rate of 2.5% has been assumed for all 
CGUs, based on historical growth rates and management’s estimates of future growth. 
• A risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate of 8.5%, has been applied to each CGU’s cash flow projection, which reflects a combination of factors 
including the Group’s expected return on equity and costs of borrowing. 
In each case, the results of this exercise indicate that the recoverable amount exceeds the intangible asset’s carrying value and would not be sensitive 
to reasonable possible changes in assumptions.  
23. Associates and joint venture 
a) Associates 
i) Miles Smith Holding Limited (MS Holding) 
During 2011, Amlin Corporate Services Limited’s (ACS) investment in Miles Smith Limited (MS Limited) of 19.9% was transferred to MS Holding,

ii) Share awards 
Details of the Group’s share awards are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report in the Governance section.  
At 31 December 2011, the total awards over new or treasury shares outstanding, or committed to be met by the Group’s Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (ESOT), or shares held in Trust under these schemes are summarised below: 
 
Number of 
shares under 
conditional award
2011 Vesting period 
Number of 
shares under 
conditional award

LTIP grants 3,592,717 2011 to 2014 2,887,977 2011 to 2013
PSP grants 2,549,456 2011 to 2016 2,216,940 2011 to 2015
SIP grants 1,899,117 2010 to 2014 1,803,998 2010 to 2013
Amlin Special 74,167 2012 to 2014 61,470 2011 to 2013
The comparative information on SIP grants have been restated by 257,239 shares. 
iii) Modifications to share-based payment arrangements 
LTIP and PSP awards are normally exercisable from three and five years after grant respectively. During 2010, the period for rewards exercised 
following these vesting periods was extended from 6 to 30 months. The effect of these modifications on the fair value of awards granted was not 
material. There have been no modifications to share-based payment arrangements in 2011. 
iv) Options from the ESOT  
The trustee of the ESOT held 2,179,168 ordinary shares as at 31 December 2011 (2010: 2,811,679 ordinary shares) to meet potential future exercises 
of executive awards and long term incentive plans. The ESOT shares are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The market value of Amlin 
plc ordinary shares on the last trading day of the year being 30 December 2011 was 313.9 pence per share (2010: 408.9 pence per share). 
The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT are incorporated into the consolidated financial statements. The ESOT waives the right  
to dividends on ordinary shares in excess of 0.01 pence per each share ranking for an interim or final dividend. 
v) Fair value of options and awards 
At 31 December 2011, the weighted average fair values of options and awards granted during the year were 29.49 pence per option and 163.22 pence  
per award respectively (2010: 56.17 pence and 189.02 pence). 
The ‘Black Scholes’ option pricing model has been used to determine the fair value of the option grants and share awards listed above. The assumptions 
used in the model are as follows: 
 2011 2010
Weighted average share price on grant (pence) 346.66 249.63
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 271.86 194.21
Expected volatility 30.00% 30.00%
Expected life (years) 3.00 – 7.50 3.00 – 7.50
Risk free rate of return 1.50% – 5.00% 2.00% – 5.00%
Expected dividend yield 2.00% – 7.00% 2.00% – 7.00%
Volatility 
The volatility of Amlin plc’s share price is calculated as a normalised standard deviation of the log of the daily return on the share price. In estimating 
30% volatility, the volatility of return for six months, one year and three year intervals are considered. As a guide to the reasonableness of the volatility 
estimate similar calculations are performed on a selection of Amlin’s peer group.  160
Notes to the accounts continued 
For the year ended 31 December 2011 
 
28. Share options and share-based incentive awards continued 
Interest rate 
The risk free interest rate is consistent with government bond yields. 
Dividend yield 
The assumptions are consistent with the information given in the report and accounts for each relevant valuation year. 
Staff turnover 
The option pricing calculations are split by staffing grades as staff turnover is higher for more junior grades. Furthermore historical evidence suggests 
that senior employees tend to hold their options for longer whereas more junior levels within the organisation appear to exercise earlier. In addition, 
senior employees hold a larger proportion of the options but represent a smaller group of individuals.  
Market conditions 
The Group issues options that include targets for the Group’s performance against a number of market and non-market conditions. Failure to meet 
these targets can reduce the number of options exercisable. In some circumstances no options may be exercised. Assumptions are made about the 
likelihood of meeting the market and non-market conditions based on the outlook at the time of each option grant. 
b) Cash settled scheme 
The Group rewards senior underwriters through payments under the Capital Builder Plan (the Plan) if they achieve performance below the target loss 
ratio for their class(es) of business or business area over the five year period of each award under the Plan. Under the scheme rules, the Group has  
the option to settle the awarded bonus in the shares of the Company as an alternative to cash payment. In accordance with IFRS 2, the Plan is deemed 
to be a cash-settled share-based payment arrangement.  
Provision for payments of an award under the Plan is calculated every year where actual profits exceed the target profit on a cumulative basis over the 
performance period to date under the Plan. The rate of accrual for each five year performance period is determined at the start of the period reflecting 
the share of the excess return payable and committed under the terms of the Plan. 
Under this approach, the services received and the related liability are recognised as the services are rendered, in that the liability at any point in time 
for the Plan reflects the level of actual performance by underwriters in relation to the target.  
The carrying amount and the intrinsic value of the liability under this Plan at the end of 2011 are £3.4 million (2010: £8.7 million) and included in note 
30 for other payables. 
The income in the year arising from the cash settled scheme reflects the movement in the provision of payments under the Capital Builder Plan, 
following performance below the Plan’s target. 
29. Restricted funds held/placed by the Group 
At 31 December 2011, the Group holds restricted funds in the form of trust fund investments, letter of credit (LOC) collaterals, initial margin calls  
on derivative financial instruments and collateral received from reinsurance counterparties.  
Trust funds 
Syndicate 2001 holds gross assets of £3,131.2 million (2010: £2,839.8 million), matched by gross liabilities of £2,642.7 million (2010: £2,240.3 
million), which are held within individual trust funds. The Group cannot obtain or use these assets until such time as each Syndicate underwriting year 
is closed and profits are distributed, or an advance profit release is made. Furthermore, £11.5 million (2010: £6.6 million) of Amlin Singapore and 
Amlin Labuan’s assets are held within trust funds and restricted from use within the working capital of the Group until settlement has been made  
to Syndicate 2001. 
Money market funds 
At 31 December 2011 Amlin AG recognises US$150.0 million (2010: US$nil) of money market funds in relation to the sale of catastrophe linked 
instruments. The use by the Group of the funds is restricted. Details of the corresponding liability are included in note 31. 
LOC facilities 
At 31 December 2011, US$211.8 million (2010: US$181.7 million) of Amlin Bermuda’s assets are restricted for use by the Group. These assets are 
collateral for the LOC facility drawn at the end of the year. Details are included in note 31.  
Financial assets and liabilities 
Derivative instruments traded across the Group give rise to collateral being placed with, or received from, external counterparties. At 31 December 
2011 the Group placed £3.4 million (2010: £0.1 million held) of collateral in relation to over the counter options and £7.5 million (2010: £1.3 million) 
in relation to listed futures.  
Insurance and reinsurance collateral received 
At 31 December 2011 Syndicate 2001 recognised £0.9 million (2010: £1.9 million) of cash drawn down from LOC facilities as a liability on the balance 
sheet. This has been received from reinsurance counterparties as a guarantee for business written and is included within total funds held by Syndicate 
2001. Collateral of £161.4 million (2010: £228.1 million) and £162.0 million (2010: £120.2 million) is held in third party trust funds to guarantee 
Syndicate 2001 against insurance and reinsurance counterparties respectively. Furthermore, collateral of £45.7 million (2010: £37.2 million) and 
£17.1 million (2010: £nil) is held in third party trust funds as a guarantee against reinsurance counterparties to Amlin Bermuda and Amlin Re Europe 
respectively. Collateral held in third party trust funds is not recognised as assets pertaining to the Group but is available for immediate drawdown  
in the event of a default.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

principal amount plus any outstanding accrued interest. In March 2011, Amlin plc purchased the rights and obligations in respect of the €30 million 
subordinated debt issued by Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. (ACI). 
The directors’ estimation of the fair value of the Group’s subordinated debt is £368.3 million (2010: £384.6 million). The aggregate fair values are 
based on a discounted cash flow model. This model uses a current yield curve appropriate for the remaining terms to maturity. The discount rate used 
was 1.05% (2010: 2.80%).  162

a secured US$200 million letter of credit (LOC). The facility is guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiaries Amlin Corporate Services Limited and Amlin 
(Overseas Holdings) Limited. The secured LOC is secured by a fixed charge over a portfolio of assets managed by Insight Investment Management 
(Global) Limited with State Street Bank and Trust Company as custodian. As at 31 December 2011 the facility was undrawn (2010: undrawn).  
Amlin AG has a secured US$250 million LOC facility with Lloyds TSB Bank plc and the Royal Bank of Scotland plc as lead arrangers. The facility is 
secured by a registered charge over a portfolio of assets managed by Aberdeen Asset Management Inc with State Street Bank and Trust Company  
as custodian. As at 31 December 2011, US$194.7 million of LOC were issued (2010: US$174.6 million). The total value of restricted assets as  
at 31 December 2011 was US$211.8 million (2010: US$181.7 million).  
In June 2009, ACI entered into a credit facility with Fortis Bank Nederland N.V. as arranger. The facility provides a guarantee to a third party  
of up to €10.0 million and a guarantee/standby LOC for up to £22.5 million. As at 31 December 2011, €28.5 million of guarantees were issued  
(2010: €28.7 million). There are no restricted assets to secure the facility. 
b) Catastrophe linked instrument 
In December 2011 the Group issued a catastrophe linked instrument, which provides it with $150 million fully collateralised protection against extreme 
severity and/or frequency of US perils and European windstorm events above a pre-set scale and in the aggregate in a calendar year. The instrument 
has a duration of three years and will be redeemed on 31 December 2014. The carrying amount disclosed above is reasonably approximate to the fair 
value at 31 December 2011. 
32. Retirement benefit obligations  
The Group participates in a number of pension schemes, including defined benefit, defined contribution and personal pension schemes. The total

a) Defined benefit schemes 
i) The Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund funded defined benefit scheme 
Scheme description 
The scheme is operated as part of the Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund (the Fund).  
Historically the Fund has catered for a number of employers in the Lloyd’s market. As a consequence of the consolidation in the market, employers 
closing final salary schemes and some companies failing, there are now only two (2010: three) employers with active members in the Fund. A large 
proportion of the liability of the Fund relates to employers no longer participating in the Fund. The assets of the Fund are pooled and the current active 
employers are responsible collectively for the funding of the Fund as a whole. 
For the purposes of determining contributions to be paid, the Trustee has split the Fund into a number of notional sections. This is a notional split and 
has no legal force. Previously this notional split allowed for separate sections in respect of each employer’s active members and one combined section 
for non-employed members of all current and former employers. 
With effect from 31 December 2002, the Trustee altered this notional split so that, from that date, the active employers contributing to the Fund, 
including the Amlin Group, have individual notional sections comprising the notionally allocated assets in respect of their active employees, deferred 
pensioners and pensioners, and their corresponding liabilities. A separate notional fund is maintained for members whose former employers no longer 
contribute to the Fund (Orphan Schemes). The Group is also liable for a proportion of the Orphan Schemes’ liabilities. 
Since this alteration and the exit of other employers the Group has been able to more clearly identify its expected contribution requirement to the Fund 
and to ascertain its share of the assets and liabilities with sufficient certainty to account for the pension as a defined benefit scheme and bring the 
assets and liabilities of the scheme onto the balance sheet of the Group.  
During the year the number of active employers participating in the Fund was reduced to two. It is uncertain how the Trustee will allocate the revised 
Orphan Schemes’ liabilities between the two remaining employers. However, the Group’s share of the assets and liabilities of the Fund will increase 
and an actuarial estimate of the allocation has been included at 31 December 2011. This has resulted in an increase in the defined benefit obligations 
of £34.0 million and an increase in the plan assets of £34.2 million, which are included in actuarial (gains)/losses recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.  Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements

Amlin plc Annual Report 2011
 
Fund contributions 
Contributions are paid to provide for the cost of benefit accrual. The rate of contribution agreed with the Trustee is 16% (2010: 19%) paid  
by the employer plus 5% (2010: 5%) member contributions, in each case of pensionable earnings, and totalled £2.8 million (2010: £0.9 million).  
The expected contribution to the fund for the year ending 31 December 2012 is £2.6 million by the Group and £0.2 million by plan participants. 
The total amounts paid in respect of the Fund are analysed in the table below:

2010

Contributions relating to:  
Annual top up payment  2.0 –
Ongoing funding 0.6 0.7
Group share of total payment 2.6 0.7
Funding assessment assumptions 
The funding position of the Fund is assessed every three years by an independent qualified actuary. Contributions are made at the funding rates 
recommended by the actuary, which vary across different sections of the Fund reflecting the notional sections then adopted, and typically include 
adjustments to amortise any funding surplus or shortfall over a period. Amounts paid under the scheme are charged to Syndicate 2001 or other  
Group companies. Actuarial amounts quoted below are for the Group’s notional share of the scheme. 
The last completed formal valuation of the Fund was as at 31 March 2010 and was completed in June 2011 by Mr R N Wharmby, Fellow of the 
Institute of Actuaries, and used the projected unit credit actuarial method. 
On 30 June 2011, the Group agreed a schedule of contributions with the Trustee. The schedule requires seven separate payments of £2.0 million to 
the Fund over a period of seven years. The first payment was made in July 2011, with six further annual payments commencing on 31 March 2012. 
The present value of the future payments has been recognised as a liability at 31 December 2011, to the extent that the contributions will not be 
available after they are paid into the Fund, as the Fund’s rules do not allow the Group to receive a refund of contributions in any circumstances. 
The Group has also entered into an agreement with the Trustee to hold certain funds within an escrow account. These funds would be transferred  
to the Trustee in full for the purpose of defined benefit funding if any one of a number of enforcement events within the agreement were to occur.  
The Group made a payment of £5.0 million to the escrow account in July 2011. Two further payments to the escrow account of £5.0 million and  
£4.0 million will be made in June 2012 and June 2013 respectively. The Group considers it unlikely that any one of the enforcement events defined 
within the agreement will occur. In both cases, the additional defined benefit funding is in respect of the Group’s notional section of the notionally 
allocated assets and liabilities of the Fund. 
For the purpose of providing disclosure in accordance with IAS 19, the Group has requested the actuary to update the 2010 valuation to 31 December 
2011 using appropriate techniques and the following assumptions: 
 
2011
% pa 
2010
% pa
Price inflation 3.2 3.6
Rate of increase in pensions payment: 
– LPI (maximum 5% pa) 3.1 3.5
– LPI (minimum 3% pa, maximum 5% pa) 3.3 3.8
– LPI (maximum 3% pa) 2.5 2.6
Rate of increase of statutory revaluation on deferred pension 2.2 2.9
Discount rate 4.8 5.4
During 2005 the Group reviewed its remaining defined benefit arrangements and made a number of changes to the schemes’ operations, which  
were implemented during 2006. In particular, in order to remove much of the risk associated with salary inflation, the scheme was changed to allow 
members to continue accruing additional years’ service under the schemes, but these accruals would be generally based on March 2006 pensionable 
salaries. Future salary increases are pensionable through the defined contribution schemes. Therefore the salary inflation assumption used for the 
ongoing valuation is now nil% (2010: nil%). 
In 2010 the UK Government announced that inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rather than the Retail Price Index (RPI) would  
be used as the measure for minimum increases to occupational pensions. In accordance with the Fund’s revaluation rules, CPI has been used  
as an assumption in valuing the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2011.  164

ii) ACI defined benefit plans  
Scheme description 
ACI operates defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of its employees. These plans are funded partly by means of employee contributions. 
Under these plans, benefits are based on years of service and level of salary. Pension obligations are determined based on mortality, employee 
turnover, wage increases and economic assumptions such as inflation, value of plan assets and discount rate. The discount rate is set on the basis  
of the yield (on the valuation date) of debt securities issued by blue-chip companies.  
In addition to pension charges, costs of defined benefit plans also include other post-employment benefits such as reimbursement of part  
of the health insurance premiums and favourable conditions on financial products (e.g. mortgage loans), which continue to be granted to  
employees after retirement.

Scheme description 
In Switzerland, ARE operates a pension scheme which meets the classification of a defined benefit plan under IAS 19. In accordance with Swiss 
legislation, ARE provides for occupational pension insurance, the regulations of which, as may be amended from time to time, apply to both ARE  
and the employee. The insured salary is based on the agreed compensation exclusive of bonus and/or other benefits granted by ARE. The employees 
pay a portion of the premiums determined in the applicable pension fund regulations.

the Group to receive a refund of contributions in any circumstances. As such, a liability has been recognised to the extent that asset gains arising from 
the contributions will not be available after they are paid into the Fund. At 31 December 2010 the ceiling limit on asset gains is attributable to the Fund 
being in surplus at that date.

39. Business Combinations 
a) JR Clare Underwriting Agencies Limited 
On 25 January 2011 Amlin Corporate Services Limited acquired the entire share capital and voting rights of JR Clare Holding Company Limited and  
its subsidiary undertaking JR Clare Underwriting Agencies Limited, which is a managing general agent of UK household and commercial insurance.  
The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the consideration paid and the resulting goodwill have been revised from those disclosed 
in the subsequent events note of the Annual Report 2010, following the completion of the acquisition accounting for the business combination.  
The revised purchase consideration is an initial £1.3 million with two further amounts of £1.0 million payable 24 months and 36 months after  
the acquisition date. The revised fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is £1.8 million net liability and the fair value of the consideration  
is £3.0 million, resulting in the recognition of £4.8 million of goodwill on acquisition. The goodwill arose from the premium paid for acquiring a new 
book of household and commercial insurance business. JR Clare Holding Company Limited was placed into voluntary liquidation in September 2011, 
with Amlin Corporate Services Limited becoming the new immediate parent company of JR Clare Underwriting Agencies Limited.  
b) Lead Yacht Underwriters Limited 
On 3 February 2011 Amlin Corporate Services Limited acquired the entire share capital and voting rights of Lead Yacht Underwriters Limited,  
an underwriting agency of yacht insurance.  
The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the consideration paid and the resulting goodwill have been revised from those disclosed 
in the subsequent events note of the Annual Report 2010, following the completion of the acquisition accounting for the business combination.  
The total revised consideration is £16.1 million, consisting of an initial £10.1 million paid on completion and a further £6.0 million payable  
between 2012 and 2016, subject to the financial performance of Lead Yacht Underwriters Limited. The revised fair value of the net assets acquired is 
£3.2 million and the fair value of the consideration is £14.7 million, resulting in the recognition of £11.5 million of goodwill on acquisition. The goodwill 
arose from the premium paid for acquiring a platform to further develop the Group’s existing yacht business and diversify its underwriting portfolio.

Company Balance Sheet, the Parent Company Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity,  
and the Parent Company Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 41 to 53. The financial reporting framework that has been applied  
in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as applied  
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 96, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance  
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Amlin Annual Report 2011 to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:  
• give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its cash flows for the year then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions  
of the Companies Act 2006; and  
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion:  
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and  
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the parent company financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:  
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or  
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or  
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.  
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Amlin plc for the year ended 31 December 2011.

given in note 45. 
Financial investments are measured at fair value, details of which are given in notes 3 and 43.  
Financial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and financial investments, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries. As at the balance 
sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired. 
Financial liabilities owed by the Company are largely in respect of long-term borrowings (details of which are provided in note 31) and amounts due  
to subsidiaries. Amounts due to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date. 
Interest rate risk 
Loans to and from subsidiaries are at floating rates of interest. The Company is therefore exposed to fluctuations in these rates. 
Currency risk 
The Company has entered into derivative contracts on behalf of the Group to hedge the net currency exposure, which results from the translation  
of the net assets of Amlin Bermuda and Amlin Corporate Insurance N.V. These derivative contracts in the form of options have been accounted for  
as hedges of net investments in overseas subsidiaries by the Group, under which fair value gains and losses are taken to other comprehensive income 
to match the underlying movement in the valuation of the net investment in the overseas subsidiaries. In the Company these gains and losses are 
taken to profit or loss.  
The Company’s amounts due from subsidiaries include a loan of €272.6 million (2010: €272.6 million) which forms part of the net investment in Amlin 
Corporate Insurance N.V. referred to above and hedged at a Group level. The Company is exposed to gains and losses on this loan in its profit or loss.  
The Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through its borrowings. At 31 December 2011, the Company had two subordinated loans  
of US$50.0 million each. The resulting foreign exchange loss in the Company and the Group for the year was £0.2 million (2010: £2.0 million). 
53. Contingent liabilities 
The Company has no contingent liabilities at 31 December 2011 (2010: £nil), other than that in respect of a funding arrangement entered into with the 
Trustee of the Lloyd’s Superannuation Fund defined benefit pension scheme. Further details are provided in note 32.  Amlin plc Annual Report 2011

Electronic communications and voting
The Company has adopted electronic shareholder 
communication. This enables the Company to 
circulate hard copies of the Annual Report and 
other shareholder documents only to those who 
opt to receive them. Other shareholders may 
notify an email address to which a link is sent  
or, failing that, they receive a paper notification 
informing them as and when such reports 
become available on our website. If any 
shareholder wishes to opt back in to receiving 
printed shareholder documents, or wishes to 
notify their email address for the first time or 
amend a previous notification, they should 
contact our registrar Computershare. We also 
provide electronic proxy voting facilities  
for shareholders in respect of our AGM  
(and generally intend to do so for any other 
shareholders’ meetings), for shares held  
in both CREST and certificated form.
Amlin shares
Amlin’s ordinary shares have a premium listing 
on the London Stock Exchange. The share price  
is reported daily in the Financial Times and  
other UK newspapers with share price services  
as well as being on the Company’s and many 
other websites. 
The UK capital gains tax position 
regarding the B Shares issue 
(2007/2008)
The detailed UK and US tax position of all aspects 
of the return of capital and share consolidation 
that was completed early in 2008 was set out  
in a circular to shareholders dated 16 November 
2007, copies of which are available from the 
Company Secretary and on the Amlin website. 
This involved the replacement of each nine 
ordinary shares of 25p each in the Company 
previously held by shareholders by nine B Shares 
of 22.4p each and eight consolidated ordinary 
shares of 28.125p each (New Shares). All of such 
B Shares have subsequently been redeemed.
Further to that circular, the market value of a  
New Share for UK tax purposes on the first day 
on which its price was quoted (17 December 
2007) was 302.125p. The market value on the 
same date of a B Share for UK tax purposes was 
considered to be 22.3p. As the B Shares were  
not traded on any stock exchange, its value  
was calculated by reference to its redemption 
value of 22.4p on the first redemption date  
of 14 January 2008, with a discount applied  
to take account of the minimum period prior  
to redemption. Accordingly, shareholders subject 
to UK taxation of capital gains may apportion the 
allowable expenditure in relation to their holdings 
of ordinary shares of 25p each prior  
to 17 December 2007 as follows: 
  Holdings of new ordinary shares of 28.125p 
each: 92.333%
  Holdings of B Shares: 7.667%

shown above from the 2007 final dividend onwards are per consolidated 28.125p ordinar y share rather than per the previous 25p shares 
Details of the proposed final dividend in respect of 2011 are set out in the Chairman’s statement ( pp.12).

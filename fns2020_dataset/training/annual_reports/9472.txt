CHaiRman’s 
statement
I joined Lombard Risk as Chairman 
on 1 May 2010 with the result 
that my own direct experience 
of the Company covers only the 
current financial year. The year to 
date has been a period in which 
the company has been able to 
reap the benefit of the efforts and 
investment made in the previous 
financial year. This has resulted in 
revenue growth of more than 30% 
in the first four months of the 
current financial year, and a return 
to profitability during that time. 
The board and executive team are 
focused on continued operational 
improvements and efficiency to 
accompany the revenue growth 
being achieved. Costs have 
been cut but have also been 
accompanied by investment 
in those areas which we believe 
will drive future growth.
I will report in greater detail 
at the time of the interim 
financial statements but my first 
impressions are of a company 
with considerable potential. I am 
grateful to the Board, investors 
and advisors alike for making me 
feel welcome at Lombard Risk.

summaRy The year saw the Company 
making steady progress. While 
we incurred a loss for the year 
ended 31 March 2010, the board 
believe that the work done in the 
year has laid the foundation for 
growth in future periods. This 
has subsequently been seen in 
the first few months of the year 
ending 31 March 2011, during 
which we have registered year 
on year growth of over 30% 
per annum. In the collateral 
management software business 
we continued to win contracts 
and grow organically, while 
implementation at the major Tier 1 
Continental European bank 
announced in April 2009 
progressed through the year 
and resulted in acceptance in 
April 2010. In the regulatory 
compliance business a lot of 
work was performed ahead 
of the major new UK Financial 
Services Authority (“FSA”) 
regulations on Liquidity 
Standards, which have provided 
a major revenue opportunity; 
however since these regulations 
were finalised later than expected, 
in October 2009, and software 
was not ready until April 2010, 
the revenue recognised in the 
year ending 31 March 2010 
was negligible. During the year 
we raised equity funds that 
eliminated all our borrowings 
and strengthened our balance 
sheet. In the post-financial crisis 
environment in which customers 
and investors are more risk averse 
than usual, these were all events 
that took us in the right direction.
Revenues for the year increased 
by 3% to £8.95m (2009: £8.69m). 
Our loss after tax was £1.58m 
(2009: £1.16m) but this included 
£0.11m of interest and, following 
a thorough review of revenue, one 
time provision in respect of bad debts 
from previous periods of £0.18m.
We invested heavily in resource 
for COLLINE
®
 during the year, 
although much of that investment 
was to support a major contract 
and other large contracts. The 
Risk and Trading business traded 
profitably, so that more than 
100% of the loss was in the 
Regulatory Compliance business 
which represented 47% of 
revenues. The weakness in the 
regulatory business in the first 
half was expected as few final 
decisions were being taken by UK 
regulatory customers before the 
FSA had finalised its policy on 
liquidity, and the weakness in the 
second half was primarily an issue 
of revenue recognition owing to 
the extended regulatory deadlines. 
An appreciable number of 
contracts were won during 
the second half, but the revenue 
will be recognised in the year 
ending 31 March 2011.
In the post-crisis international 
financial environment, there is 
a move away from a light touch 
regulatory regime in the UK and 
in many other countries, and there 
is little if any sign of this changing 
following the change of UK 
Government. In the UK this 
began with a complete reform 
of Liquidity Reporting and the 
board believes that this move away 
from light touch regulation offers

summaRy COntinued considerable opportunity to the 
Company in the coming years. 
As well as the Liquidity Standards 
announced by the FSA, new FSA 
policy statements on Stress Testing 
have been published and FSA 
consultation papers have been 
published about Capital Standards 
which are likely to lead to more 
regulatory change in 2011 and 
2012. There are considerable 
regulatory opportunities in all the 
countries in which the Company 
operates, with world regulators 
seemingly close to an agreement 
on a “Basel 3” capital regime.
The Board considers that the 
outlook for our COLLINE
®
 collateral 
management software remains 
promising with strong new 
business demand expected 
to continue, including switching 
away from competitor systems 
to COLLINE
®
 together with likely 
revenue growth from existing 
customers. The Company has now 
proved the scalability and resilience 
of the product (i.e. its ability to 
cope with large volumes and to 
withstand the loss of individual 
servers without ceasing to 
function) through its deployment 
in a leading Tier 1 Continental 
European bank operating in 
an international environment. 
Given that most of our revenues 
come from banks and financial 
services companies, the Board 
considers that the Company’s 
products are well placed with an 
emphasis on collateral management, 
liquidity and regulatory compliance. 
We are the global number 2 in 
both collateral management 
software and in bank regulatory 
reporting software.
finanCial Revenues for the year increased 
by 3% to £8.95m (2009: £8.69m). 
Our loss after tax was £1.58m

£0.11m of interest and a one-time 
provision in respect of bad debts 
from previous periods of £0.18m 
following a thorough review. 
Stripping out these items would 
have shown a reduced underlying 
loss of £1.3m and an adjusted cost 
base of £10.2m for the year. Net 
cash was £0.7m at 31 March 2010 
(2009: £0.15m less £1.33m of 
director loans).

As anticipated in former statements, 
the financial crisis has been 
beneficial for our COLLINE
®
 
collateral management software 
product. This product now 
handles substantially all of the 
key requirements of a collateral 
business including margining, 
repo and securities lending, 
trade reconciliation, inventory 
management and reporting 
including regulatory reporting 
(e.g. for Fed-15 reports and 
outputs to regulatory liquidity 
reporting). During the year we 
completed projects with Loomis, 
Sayles & Co, Pacific Life, ABN-
AMRO and began a project with 
BNP Paribas Securities Services. 
We also made good progress 
with implementation of a major 
contract with a Tier 1 Continental 
European bank concluded at the 
end of the financial year ended 
31 March 2009, and have 
demonstrated COLLINE
®
’s 
scalability, resilience and 
performance in that bank’s own 
environment using active-active 
clustering in multiple data centres, 
user locations in three continents 
and well over 150 users. This 
means that the Board has every 
confidence that our solution is 
scalable from the smallest collateral 
user to the largest global bank. 
Oberon
®
, our most established 
product, continues to move 
forward with functional and 
performance enhancements 
and remains profitable. 
During the year we launched our 
LISA
®
 product and we have now 
signed up several new customers 
for it. LISA
®
 will be a risk product 
which is complementary to our 
regulatory products, starting with 
Liquidity Risk and using the most 
modern technology. Lombard Risk 
has always been strong on risk 
management and the Board 
considers that the convergence 
of risk and regulation plays 
to our strengths.
RegulatORy and COmplianCe 
sOftwaRe pROduCts Lombard Risk is the market leader 
for UK Bank regulatory reporting 
with approximately 130 of 
the 350 banks in the UK and 
approximately 15 investment firms 
in the UK using the STB-Reporter 
product for regulatory reporting 
to the FSA. 
This depth of customer base clearly 
gives the Company opportunities 
to sell additional functionality 
to existing customers. When the 
announcement of new regulations 
is imminent there tends to be a lull 
in activity before those regulations 
are actually finalised and this was 
the case during the year with the 
FSA ’s final new regulations on 
Liquidity Reporting and Liquidity 
Stress Testing not being published 
until October 2009. Consequently 
there was very little revenue in the 
period under review from this 
source except from analysis work 
on the impact of the consultation 
papers. The Company has now won 
The financial highlight of the 
period was the raising of £2.83m 
of equity, of which £1.75m was 
from institutions and investors on 
AIM, and the balance of £1.08m 
was in either new money or loan 
conversions from Directors and 
former Directors. After deduction 
of fees and expenses of around 
£0.2m, this allowed the Company 
to repay all its Director loans of 
£1.63m and its overdraft, reduce 
its creditors to a lower number 
of creditor days, as well as retain 
a reserve for working capital.
Recurrent revenue has historically 
been a healthy proportion of 
revenues at the Company. Recurrent 
annual revenues for the Group were 
at around £4.4m p.a at the year 
end (2009: £4.3m). In addition, 
the revenue profile remains fairly 
well spread. This recurrent number 
has continued to grow during the 
current financial period and as 
a result of contracts already won, 
the Board expects this to grow 
throughout the remainder of the 
current period.

sOftwaRe pROduCts COntinued 30 contracts related to this initiative 
for Liquidity Reporting or Liquidity 
Stress Testing, and is very busy 
rolling out the solution to these 
customers in the current financial 
year. The FSA has also ended up 
changing its originally stated plans 
to subject all foreign bank branches 
to UK Liquidity Reporting, and many 
such firms were able to negotiate 
modifications/waivers to these rules. 
The Liquidity Reporting and Stress 
Testing regulatory regime which 
comes into effect in the UK in 
2010 seems likely to be followed 
in 2011 by new Capital Standards 
and Stress Testing and there is a 
timetable for regulatory change 
including a new “Basel 3” accord. 
This opportunity is by no means 
confined to the UK, although the 
Board believes that the weight of 
our customer base gives us more 
ability to leverage the opportunity 
in the UK than elsewhere.
The Board considers that the 
Company’s ability to offer global 
solutions has been greatly enhanced 
through our now having regulatory 
offerings available or under 
production for several EMEA 
and Asian countries as well as 
the United States. Our Singapore 
office made a number of worthwhile 
product wins including business 
in Singapore, won away from our 
main competitor, and we obtained 
our first two customers for 
Japanese reporting. 
peRsOnnel and pRemises
During the period under review 
we continued to make new hires 
appropriate to the expected 
growth of parts of the business 
but we also benefited from cost 
actions taken before the financial 
year end. We continue to take 
actions designed to establish 
profitability in all parts of the 
business and to re-allocate 
resources to those parts of the 
business where we see the best 
prospects. The Board intends that 
costs will continue to be contained 
overall and that they are reduced 
as a percentage of any revenue 
rises as proportionately more work 
is carried out in Shanghai and 
we achieve greater efficiency gains. 
We now have more than half of 
our Group headcount in Shanghai.
I agreed to split my combined 
Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer role at the time of the 
institutional fund-raising, and 
the Board and I were delighted 
to welcome Philip Crawford as 
our  new Non-executive Chairman 
from 1 May 2010. At the same 
time Mike Shinya joined as a 
Non-executive Director. Both Philip 
and Mike have very heavyweight 
experience as senior executives in 
the IT industry at large companies 
such as EDS and Oracle and their 
experience will help take the 
Company forward to the next level. 
While so many people worked 
hard during the year, special 
thanks are due to the teams 
in London and Shanghai led by 
Nick Davies and Helen Bramley 
who did so much to ensure the 
success of major Colline projects. 
Many late nights were worked 
by many to ensure that 
deadlines were met. 
At Board level special thanks 
are due to Ian Peacock, our 
Non-executive Deputy Chairman, 
who retires at the AGM. Ian has 
been with the Company for over 
ten years in various capacities 
and I have always valued his wise 
counsel and incisive questioning 
over that time. Thanks are also 
due to Chris Langridge who 
joined us in April as COO and 
Finance Director to help us 
with some of our strategic 
initiatives including cost cutting. 
Chris will not be standing for 
re-election at the AGM and 
a permanent replacement

pROspeCts The Group has seen more than 
30% year on year revenue growth 
in the first four months of the 
current financial year, and taking 
into account recurrent revenue 
and the contracted revenues which 
the Board believes should be 
recognisable by 31 March 2011, 
this is a promising start to the new 
financial year. We continue to see 
a healthy sales pipeline for our 
COLLINE

 collateral management 
software following the substantial 
Tier 1 Continental European bank 
going live. In addition, the Board 
believes that some of the new 
regulatory driven industry initiatives 
on central counterparty and 
messaging should help us win 
additional business. In addition 
the Board foresees no end to the 
increase in bank and securities 
firm regulation, and is optimistic 
that this will have a positive 
effect on the Group’s regulatory 
compliance business, albeit that 
this benefit will continue to come 
in waves with peaks and troughs 
in demand around regulatory 
deadlines. The climate for the 
next few years is for mandatory 
additional spend on regulation. 
The key issue for us is what share 
of this spend the Group can achieve 
and the scale of investment required 
to make this a major international 
profit opportunity for us, rather 
than whether that opportunity exists. 
In this changing environment the 
Board continues to believe that, 
as changes in legislation are 
adopted and credit risk and 
liquidity risk management are ever 
more tightly controlled, risk and 
regulatory software will be in 
demand. Lombard Risk, as

Directors’ report 
For the year enDeD 31 March 2010
The Directors submit their annual report together with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”). The financial statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable IFRS and UK GAAP have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
In so far as each of the Directors is aware:
  there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
  the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
principal activities anD business review
The Company is a holding company. The principal activities of the Group are the provision of trading, valuation and risk management systems 
and regulatory compliance systems to the financial markets. A review of these activities, future developments and financial risk management 
is provided in the Chairman’s statement and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. This information forms a part of the Directors’ report.
Key perForMance inDicators
The Directors have monitored the performance of the Group with particular reference to the following key performance indicators:
  turnover by product line compared to prior year;
  cash management – actual compared to budget; and
  operating costs by location compared to prior periods.
results anD DiviDenDs
The audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010 are set out on pages 15 to 31. The Group’s loss for the year after taxation 
amounted to £1,584,351 (2009: loss £1,098,937). The Directors do not propose a dividend for the year (2009: £Nil).

research anD DevelopMent
Research and development expenditure incurred on the Group’s suite of products has all been expensed to the income statement in the relevant period.
going concern
The financial statements have, as in previous years, been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have formally considered this 
issue in the light of the operating losses in the current and earlier years, and the consequent operating cash outflows during these periods.
In forming an opinion that the Company and the Group is a going concern, the Directors have taken particular note of the positive trading 
performance in the year to date, both in the signing of new business contracts, and in the realised financial results. These show an up-turn in 
the Group’s performance and, in particular, a backlog of contracted revenue which gives a clear view of revenues through the next three quarters. 
The level of this revenue is such that the Group is not reliant on substantial forecasted new business to generate sufficient funds for its operations.
The Directors have prepared the cashflow forecasts for the periods ending 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2012 which show that the 
Company and Group have sufficient facilities for ongoing operations. Whilst there will always remain some inherent uncertainty within the 
aforementioned forecasts, the Directors believe the Company and Group have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010.
auDitor
A resolution to re-appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditor and to authorise the Directors to agree their remuneration will be placed before 
the forthcoming AGM of the Company.

corporate governance report 
For the year enDeD 31 March 2010
policy stateMent
The Board is committed to high standards of integrity and corporate governance, consistently seeking to apply the principles set out in the 
Combined Code (“the Code”) although recognising that as an AIM company the Company is not required to comply with the provisions 
of the Code and, largely because of its size, does not comply with a number of them. This statement, together with the Directors’ report and 
the report of the Board to shareholders on Directors’ remuneration, explains how the Group has applied the principles set out in the Code.
internal controls
The Directors are responsible for the systems of internal control. Although no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss, the Group’s systems are designed to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance that problems are identified 
on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately. The Board considers that there have been no substantial weaknesses in internal financial controls 
resulting in any material losses, contingencies or uncertainties, and thus disclosable in the accounts. The Board has considered the need for an 
internal audit function and has concluded that there is no current need for such a function within the Company.
accounting policies
The Board considers the appropriateness of its accounting policies on an annual basis. The Board believes that its accounting policies and 
estimation techniques are appropriate in particular in relation to income recognition, research and development and deferred expenses.
boarD oF Directors
The Board, comprising a Non-executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and three Non-executive Directors, is responsible for the overall 
strategy and direction of Lombard Risk Management plc as well as for approving potential acquisitions, major capital expenditure items and 
financing matters. The Board has a formal schedule of business reserved to it and meets regularly during the year. Advice from independent 
sources is available if required. The Board monitors exposure to key business risks, reviews the strategic direction of the Company, the annual 
budgets and progress against those budgets.
The Board members and their roles are described on page 8. The Executive Directors have service contracts, which are terminable upon periods 
between three and twelve months’ notice. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, one third of the Directors are required to 
retire by rotation at the AGM.
shareholDer relations
The Company recognises the importance of dialogue with all of its shareholders. The AGM is an opportunity to communicate with institutional and 
other shareholders. Additional information is supplied through the circulation of the interim report and the Annual Report and Accounts. Lombard 
Risk Management plc maintains up to date information on the investor section of its website www.lombardrisk.com.
Every shareholder receives a full Annual Report after each year end and has access to an Interim Report online after each half year end. Care is 
taken to ensure that any price sensitive information is released to all its shareholders, institutional and private, at the same time in accordance 
with London Stock Exchange requirements.
auDit coMMittee
The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board chaired by Ian Peacock and also comprises Brian Crowe and Philip Crawford. The Report 
of the Audit Committee can be found on page 13.
reMuneration coMMittee

regarding his own remuneration.

1. accounting policies
(a) basis oF preparation
These consolidated financial statements are for the year ended 31 March 2010. They have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as at 31 March 2010, as adopted 
by the European Union. They have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Board to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application 
of accounting policies, the reported amounts of balance sheet items at the period end and the reported amount of revenue and expense during 
the reporting period. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
However, the actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on going basis.
new stanDarDs, aMenDMents anD interpretations
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have 
been published but are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements will be adopted by the Group’s accounting policies for the first period beginning after 
the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the 
Group’s financial statements is provided below. Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have 
a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
  IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” (effective 1 January 2013) 
IFRS 9 addresses the classification and measurement of financial assets and will replace IAS 39. The Standard is mandatory for accounting 
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013, subject to adoption by the European Union.
  Annual Improvements 2009 (effective 1 July 2009 and later) 
The IASB has issued Improvements for International Financial Reporting Standards 2009. Most of these amendments become effective 
in annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 or 1 January 2010. The Group has made a preliminary assessment of the proposed 
amendments and does not believe that the effect on the Group’s financial statements will be significant.
(b) changes in accounting policies
The Group has adopted the following new Standards, Interpretations, Revisions and Amendments to IFRS issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board and adopted by the European Union, which are relevant and effective for the Group’s financial statements for the annual 
period being 1 April 2009:
  IAS 1 (revised) “Presentation of financial statements”
  IFRS 8 “Operating segments” 
IAS 1 (revised) “Presentation of financial statements” requires presentation of a comparative balance sheet at the beginning of the first comparative 
period in some circumstances. Management considers that this is not necessary because the 2008 balance sheet is the same as that previously published.
IFRS 8 “Operating segments” – The standard replaces IAS 14 “Segment Reporting” and requires entities to adopt the ‘’management approach’’ 
to report on their operating segments. The Group’s accounting policy on operating segments is presented below.
(c) basis oF consoliDation
The Group accounts consolidate the financial statements of the Parent Company (Lombard Risk Management plc) and its subsidiary undertakings 
over which it has full control (see note 5 to the Parent Company balance sheet). A description of the principal activities and operations of the 
Group can be found in the Director’s report on pages 10 and 11.
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March 2010. 
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in 
the year are included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. All of 
the Group’s assets and liabilities existing at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date. Profits 
or losses on intra group transactions are eliminated in full. Goodwill arising on consolidation was written off to reserves prior to 1 April 1999. 
Goodwill arising after this date is capitalised and under IFRS 3 goodwill is not amortised, but an impairment test is performed as appropriate, 
but at least annually. The value of goodwill is to be written down according to the outcome of the impairment test.
(D) segMent reporting 
In identifying its operating segments, management generally follows the Group’s product lines. The Group operates two main product 
segments: Regulatory compliance software and Risk management and trading software. Regulatory compliance software is for regulatory, 
anti-money laundering and compliance systems to financial markets. Risk management and trading software provides trading, valuation and 
risk management systems to the financial markets. Each of these product lines is managed separately as each of these product lines requires 
different technology and other resources as well as marketing approaches. Corporate overheads, assets and liabilities which are not directly 
attributable to either product line are not allocated to segments.

(e) going concern
The financial statements have, as in previous years, been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have formally considered this issue 
in the light of the operating losses in the current and earlier years, and the consequent operating cash outflows during these periods.
In forming an opinion that the Company and the Group is a going concern, the Directors have taken particular note of the positive trading 
performance in the year to date, both in the signing of new business contracts, and in the realised financial results. These show an up-turn in 
the Group’s performance and, in particular, a backlog of contracted revenue which gives a clear view of revenues through the next three quarters. 
The level of this revenue is such that the Group is not reliant on substantial forecasted new business to generate sufficient funds for its operations.
The Directors have prepared cashflow forecasts for the periods ending 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2012 which show that the Company and 
Group have sufficient facilities for ongoing operations. Whilst there will always remain some inherent uncertainty within the aforementioned 
forecasts, the Directors believe the Company and Group have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010.
(F) revenue
Revenue represents the value of goods sold and services provided during the year, stated net of Value Added Tax. Revenue and loss before tax 
are wholly attributable to the principal activities of the Group.
The recognition of revenue depends on the type of income:
Licence income  For long-term projects which do not include the up front delivery of immediately usable software, revenue 
is recognised on both the consultancy and initial licence elements in line with the estimated percentage 
of completion of the project. That part of licence and maintenance revenue invoiced simultaneously with 
the initial licence but considered to relate to the period when the licence is deemed to be live is deferred 
in its entirety until the live date, following which it is released to profit in equal daily instalments over the 
duration of the relevant licence or maintenance. For other projects which do include the up-front delivery 
of immediately usable software, revenue is recognised in accordance with the invoicing schedule on a percentage 
completion basis. For non-refundable licences revenue is recognised in full on customer acceptance.
Customisation income Recognised once the customisation has taken place.
Maintenance income Recognised evenly over the term of the maintenance contract.
Rental income  Recognised evenly over the term of the rental contract.
Data subscription income  Recognised evenly over the term of the data contract.
Training income Recognised when the relevant courses are run.
(g) property , plant anD equipMent
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. No depreciation is charged during the 
period of construction. Leasehold property is included in property, plant and equipment only where it is held under a finance lease.
The cost of computer hardware, fixtures, fittings and equipment, is written down to the residual value and is depreciated in equal annual instalments 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The residual values of assets or groups of like assets and their useful lives are reviewed annually.
The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows: 
Computer hardware two years 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment four years
(h) gooDwill
Goodwill, representing the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired, 
is capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Negative goodwill is 
recognised immediately after acquisition in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
(i) intangible assets
research anD DevelopMent
Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
  completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
  the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
  the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
  the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there is a market for the output 
from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used in generating such benefits;
  there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and
  the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
coMputer soF tware
The cost of computer software, net of estimated residual value and impairment, is depreciated in equal annual installments over one to two 
years based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The residual values of assets or Group of like assets are reviewed annually.

1. accounting policies continueD
(J) Financial instruMents
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, trade receivables and trade and other payables. Derivative instruments are not used 
by the Group and the Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
l oans anD receivables
Loans and receivables are initially stated at their fair value plus transaction costs, then subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, if applicable, less impairment losses. Provisions against trade receivables are made when there is objective evidence that the Group 
will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write down is 
determined as the difference between the assets’ carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
c ash anD cash equivalents
The Group manages short-term liquidity through the holding of cash and highly liquid interest bearing deposits. Only deposits that are readily 
convertible into cash, with no penalty of lost interest, are shown as cash or cash equivalent.
traDe payables
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are recorded initially at fair value; all transaction 
costs are recognised immediately in the Statement of comprehensive income. All other financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of 
direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are re measured at each reporting date at fair value, with changes in fair value 
being recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income. All other financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, with interest related charges recognised as an expense in finance cost in the Statement of comprehensive income.
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
Where debt has been converted into equity, the liability is extinguished at no gain no loss. The equity is measured at the carrying value of the 
extinguished debt.
(K) Foreign exchange
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in 
a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which 
they were initially recorded are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Exchange differences on non-monetary items are 
recognised in the statement of changes in shareholders equity to the extent that they relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item taken 
to the statement of changes in shareholders equity, otherwise such gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income.
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate at the date of transaction. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation 
of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to the “Foreign exchange reserve” in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation 
the cumulative translation differences (including, if applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the Statement of 
comprehensive income as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
(l) t axation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year. The tax credit arises from the UK legislation regarding the treatment 
of certain qualifying research and development costs, allowing for the surrender of tax losses attributable to such costs in return for a tax rebate.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of 
goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting 
profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary 
differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. In addition, tax losses available 
to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the underlying 
deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated 
at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the Statement of comprehensive income, except 
where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity (such as the revaluation of land) in which case the related deferred 
tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
(M) leaseD assets
The Group does not hold any finance leases.
All leases referred to are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the Statement of comprehensive 
income on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.
Where leased buildings are vacated or under utilised a provision is made for the loss of benefit over the remainder of the lease.

(n) pension costs
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group 
in independently administered funds. The amount charged to the income statement represents the contributions payable to the schemes in respect 
of the accounting period.
(o) share options issueD to eMployees
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 April 2006 are recognised in the 
financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of 
the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date using a Binomial model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the options were granted.
All equity settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the Statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding credit 
to “other reserves”.
If vesting periods or other non market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate 
of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share options 
expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment 
is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to that estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, and where appropriate, 
share premium.
(p) iMpairMent testing oF gooDwill, other intangible assets anD property , plant anD equipMent
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating 
units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those 
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the 
Group at which management monitors the related cash flows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill, other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, and those 
intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are 
tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an internal discounted 
cash flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the 
carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception 
of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
(q) Key JuDgeMent in applying the entity’s accounting policies an D gooDwill iMpairMent
The Group’s management makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based 
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a reasonable risk 
of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
recognition oF revenue
Revenue is recognised according to the accounting policies as stated and is dependent upon the type of income. Where contracts include 
different elements of revenue, those elements are recognised in line with those policies, with fair values attributed to each component part.
Judgement is used in the recognition of revenue from long term projects. 
If work is contracted on a fixed cost basis, revenue is recognised in line with an estimation of the percentage of completion of the project. 
This estimation is based upon the views of the consultants implementing the projects as to the proportion of the project completed and this 
is supported by data from a time recording system. There is, however, an element of judgment involved that can impact the recognition of revenue. 
This process and individual project recognition is reviewed regularly to ensure that, whilst still subjective, the reflection of revenue is the best 
approximation possible.
Where projects include the up-front delivery of immediately usable software, the element of non-refundable licence revenue is recognised on receipt 
of the software by the customer, with other revenue being recognised in line with the performance of the contracted services. The unbundling 
of this contract revenue requires management to exercise judgement as to the relative fair values of the component parts of the contract.
gooDwill iMpairMent
An impairment loss is recognised if the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
To determine the recoverable amount, management estimates expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and determines a suitable 
interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In the process of measuring expected future cash flows management 
makes assumptions about future operating results. These assumptions relate to future events and circumstances. The actual results may vary, 
and may cause significant adjustments to the Group’s assets within the next financial year.
In most cases, determining the applicable discount rate involves estimating the appropriate adjustment to market risk and the appropriate 
adjustment to asset-specific risk factors.

The Group has received to date research and development tax credits of £816,082 (2009: £816,082) relating to financial years ended 31 March 2002 
to 2007. As for all companies that have received these credits, the amounts are subject to potential future HM Revenue & Customs clawback. 
During the year ended 31 March 2010 no tax losses (2009: £Nil) were surrendered in exchange for the research and development tax credit.

8. DiscontinueD operations
Independent Valuation and Risk Services Limited (“IVRS”) was sold by the Group on 14 February 2008. In the year ended 31 March 2009, 
the Group received the full and final settlement of contingent consideration from the disposal, totalling £58,721. This was recognised in the 
Income Statement in the year ended 31 March 2009.
9. loss per share
Basic loss per share has been calculated by dividing the loss after taxation by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during 
each period.
Diluted loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all 
dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares; those share options granted under the 
Enterprise Management Incentive Plan. When a loss is incurred, since the conversion of potential ordinary shares to ordinary shares would 
decrease the net loss per share, options are not dilutive and therefore diluted and basic losses per share are the same (see note 17).

The goodwill relates solely to the acquisition of the STB Systems Limited, since renamed Lombard Risk Compliance, which was acquired in 2005 
and which constitutes the Group’s regulatory compliance business. An impairment review has therefore been carried out on this cash-generating unit. 
In accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” the cash-generating unit has been assessed by comparing its carrying value to its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an internal 
discounted cash flow evaluation.
For the year ended 31 March 2010, the goodwill recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations, which are based 
on detailed ten year discounted forecast cash flows. Cash flows for the regulatory compliance business are based on management forecasts, 
which are approved by the board and reflects management’s expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin based on past 
experience as well as the current order book. Management has used a ten year period in the cash flow projections as the regulatory compliance 
business experiences a low level of customer turnover and the technology is based on regulations which, whilst subject to periodic amendment, 
are unlikely to be withdrawn.
The calculations substantially rely on an existing order book for the year ended 31 March 2011. For the years 2012 to 2015, 5% is forecast for 
existing recurrent revenue with 0% growth rate used for 2016 to 2020. No annual growth has been taken into account for new business when 
preparing these value-in-use calculations.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions: impairment testing is dependent on management’s estimates and judgements, in particular 
in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Management has concluded that no 
reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its recoverable account.
The table below shows the impairment change that would be required if the assumptions in the calculation of the goodwill value in use were changed:
     25% increase in discount rate 25% decrease in growth rate

14. Financial risK ManageMent anD Financial instruMents
The Group’s multi national operations expose it to financial risks that include market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk. 
The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained 
unchanged from previous years.
MarKet risK
Market risk for the Group encompasses all those market risk factors that impact the value of the Group’s assets and liabilities and the expected 
value in base currency of the Group’s revenues and costs. The main risk factors are currency risk, inflation risk, and interest rate risk. The Group’s 
policies for managing these are as follows:
i) currency risK
The Group is exposed to translational and transactional foreign exchange risk as it operates in various currencies, including US Dollars, the Euro, 
Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollars and Singapore Dollars. Although, through its owns software, the Group has access to sophisticated models 
for the management of foreign exchange risk, there has been no use of foreign exchange derivatives to manage this position on the basis that 
historically the overall effect on the Group’s income statement has not been large enough to warrant this activity. Whilst the Group operates 
in various different currencies, it has low net exposure to any individual currency at the balance sheet date and consequently no sensitivity 
analysis on currency is provided.
ii) inFlation risK
The Group has exposure to the inflationary effect of operating in countries in which it operates, offset by its ability to raise prices in those 
countries in which it sells. The Group’s cost base is mainly exposed to the inflation rates and changes in payroll taxes in the United Kingdom, 
the United States and China. The inflation rate for salaries in specialised parts of the financial sector in a financial centre such as London, New York 
or Shanghai is often different from the relevant country’s overall rate of wage inflation. Most of the Group’s software contracts give the Group 
the ability to raise prices on a formula linked to the inflation rate of the currency of the contract. No specific hedging of inflation risk has been 
carried out.
iii) interest rate risK
Interest rate risk arises primarily on the investment of the Group’s cash balances or on its borrowings and the present value of the Group’s 
receivables. The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained cash reserves and Director loans at fixed rates. When the Group is 
a net depositor of funds, the Group stands to gain if interest rates rise and to lose if interest rates fall, ignoring any possible positive or negative 
correlation effects with business demand for the firm’s products or inflationary pressures on the firm’s cost base that might arise from changes 
in interest rates. When the Group is a net borrower of funds, the opposite is the case. Although through its own Oberon
®
 software the Group 
has access to sophisticated models for the management of interest rate risk, there has been no use of interest rate derivatives to manage this 
position on the basis that the amounts are not large enough to warrant this activity. The policy of the Group is to monitor exposure to interest 
rate risk and take into account potential movements in interest rates as well as liquidity considerations when selecting methods of financing.
creDit risK
Most of the Group’s business is with banks, asset management firms and other high quality companies, and the Group’s bad debt experience 
over 15 years has been negligible. The Group consequently has not considered taking out credit insurance and is not likely to do so in the 
foreseeable future. Deposits are placed with high quality banks.
Although through its own Firmament
®
 software the Group has access to sophisticated models for the management of credit spreads and credit 
derivatives, there has been no use of credit derivatives to mitigate counterparty risk and no such use is contemplated.

14. Financial risK ManageMent anD Financial instruMents continueD
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below:

Trade and other receivables     1,195,140 2,338,588
     1,897,334 2,489,587
operational risK
The Group has numerous operational risks, ranging from control over bank accounts to its processes for delivering and supporting software 
to a required level of quality and on a timely basis, and retention and recruitment of key personnel. A key risk, as for any company, is the 
reputation risk that might arise from poor execution, non-delivery or late delivery of a high profile project or breach of client confidentiality 
for sensitive data. Further risks may arise where late delivery of software or untimely delivery of related services causes a client to miss regulatory 
deadlines. A detailed operational risk review is outside the scope of this report, but the Board attaches importance to maintaining appropriate 
internal controls to identify and limit these risks.
liquiDity risK
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring that sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and by investing cash assets 
safely as well as profitably. At 31 March 2010 the Group financial liabilities were as follows:
     2010 2009

All amounts are short term and payable in 0 to 3 months. 
15. provisions
As at 31 March 2009 the Group had an office provision for space surplus to its needs, which it had been unable to re let because of the current 
economic conditions. The lease on the office space run until September 2009 and the Group made provision for the contracted cost of the 
surplus space up to the date of expiry of the lease. As at 31 March 2010, the surplus office lease had expired and the group released all the 
provision made in the year ended 31 March 2009 in full to the income statement.

attend any meetings of the Company or have any rights to participate in any return of capital (except on a winding up). The deferred shares 
are not transferable other than with the consent of all the Directors of the Company.
share issue
During the year the Company issued 70,750,000 0.5p ordinary shares at the then market value of 4p each. The Company recorded this transaction 
as £353,750 issuance of Ordinary Share Capital and recognised £2,476,250 as Share Premium, from which was netted of £194,121 of issue costs. 
Part of the shares issued was to the Company Directors, further details of which are provided in note 20.
17. share options
eMployee share options charge
The fair value is based on a number of assumptions as stated below.
In accordance with the accounting policy stated under note 1(o) on page 22, the volatility of the Company’s shares for the relevant period has 
been estimated at 30%, giving rise to a charge to the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2010 of £19,771, (2009: £11,246), with 
the same amount being credited to reserves. The expected volatility has been based on historical volatility, using market prices of Lombard Risk 
Management plc shares between 4 September 2004 and 31 March 2008.
equity settleD share-baseD payMents
The Company has a share option scheme for all employees. Options are granted to employees based on the discretion of the Directors 
to reward performance. The vesting period is usually five years. The options are settled in equity once exercised. If the options remain 
unexercised after a period of five years from the date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Company.

notes to the coMp any Financial st ateMents
For the year enDeD 31 March 2010
1. accounting policies
(a) basis oF preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that Act, the separate 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and on a historical cost basis.
(b) going concern
The financial statements have, as in previous years, been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have formally considered this issue 
in the light of the operating losses in the current and earlier years, and the consequent operating cash outflows during these periods.
In forming an opinion that the Company and Group is a going concern, the Directors have taken particular note of the positive trading 
performance in the year to date, both in the signing of new business contracts, and in the realised financial results. These show an up-turn in 
the Group’s performance and, in particular, a backlog of contracted revenue which gives a clear view of revenues through the next three quarters. 
The level of this revenue is such that the Group is not reliant on substantial forecasted new business to generate sufficient funds for its operations.
The Directors have prepared cashflow forecasts for the periods ending 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2012 which show that the Company and 
Group have sufficient facilities for ongoing operations. Whilst there will always remain some inherent uncertainty within the aforementioned 
forecasts, the Directors believe the Company and Group have sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of these financial statements.
Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010.
(c) Foreign exchange
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
(D) DeFerreD taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
(e) leaseD assets
All leases held by the Company are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the profit and loss account 
on a straight line basis over the lease term.
(F) FixeD anD intangible assets
Depreciation is provided using the following rates and bases so as to write off the cost or valuation of fixed and intangible assets over their 
useful lives in the Company’s business:
Computer software 50% to 100% straight line
Computer hardware 50% straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 25% straight line
(g) investMents in subsiDiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.

in quantity and quality chairman’s statement
The year 2004 included two events which represented major milestones
in Mediasurface’s development and marked a significant turning point for
the Company.
Firstly, in March 2004 the Company launched Mediasurface Version 5.0 which
included the innovative new product Morello which empowers the business user
to leverage the full benefit of Content Management Software. In short, the product
has been received positively by existing and potential new customers alike.
The Company is now well positioned to compete effectively going forward.
Secondly, in August 2004 the Company successfully floated on the London
Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market raising £2 million before placing
costs. The flotation has now given the Company the resources to fully exploit
the potential of Morello in the market place, develop further releases and provide
a basis for further acquisitions in the future.
Revenues increased by 4.7% to £5.4 million during the year, together with tight
cost control, losses for the full year were reduced from £1.44 million for the year
ended 30 September 2003 to £0.41 million in the year under review. Cash reserves
stood at £1.40 million. 
In line with stated policy, earnings for the foreseeable future will be re-invested
to finance the growth of the Company and acquisition strategy. Consequently
the Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend. 
We were pleased to welcome the Rt Hon. Francis Maude MP to the Mediasurface
Board in August 2004. His experience of government has given us a breadth of
understanding in one of the Company’s important customer segments.
The full financial impact of Morello has not been felt in the financial year under
review due to the length of new business sales cycles, however, the Company
is now engaged with major new opportunities and the Directors are confident
these will drive revenue growth in the coming financial year.

02 MEDIASURFACE PLC Report and Financial Statements 2004 chief executive’s report
The year ended 30 September 2004 represented another year of considerable
improvement for the business as a whole recording an improvement in both
revenue and a further very significant reduction in trading losses, continuing the
trend established by the management team installed in late 2002. Both of these
improvements have however been achieved without compromising the company’s
investment in Research and Development, the long term future of the business.
Mediasurface is a software company earning a large portion of its revenues through
the licencing of its products and as such these products must be perceived to be
innovative, well differentiated and of real value to the end customer. In order to
achieve this the Company has developed a vision which has guided all of our
product development and all of our sales and marketing messaging. It is vital for
a software company such as Mediasurface to have such a vision and to remain
innovative enough to grow and attract new customers.
The Company’s vision is to empower “typical” business users with the capability
to build significant applications (websites, intranets and extranets) using extremely
easy to use commonplace desktop tools that are already familiar to them. These
users now have the ability to build, manage and run very significant applications
capable of scaling to very high levels of load with perhaps very large user
communities without the dependency on significant technical resources. The
business user should however be secure in the knowledge that the underlying
technology, which they need never be exposed to, is fully compliant with their
Company’s corporate IT standards and that the use of Mediasurface products
releases their IT resources for deployment on other added value activities.
We summarise this vision into nine words
“Serious websites, driven by business people, loved by IT”. 
It is this vision and the incremental steps the Company has taken to realise
it has delivered continued improvements in revenues and trading results.
In March of 2004, the Company made the most significant step yet towards
realising this vision through the release of its new flagship product, Morello
(www.hellomorello.com). This application is built using the Microsoft .NET framework
and Windows technology which is core technology for the vast majority of the
world’s desktops. As a consequence business users are now able to leverage
the power of their familiar desktop applications to participate fully in the content
lifecycle that underpins their applications. This new addition to the Mediasurface
suite has provided the Company with real differentiation in sales cycles which has
led to the Company being far more competitive in the marketplace, this is reflected
in sales pipeline improvements in all geographies. The Company intends to
continue to further develop its products in line with its vision during 2005.
Sales revenues during 2004 improved for the Company but perhaps the most
significant indicators come from the new business and new product to existing
customer revenue ratios. In 2003 existing customer revenue with our old product
instituted 59% of revenues with 41% from new business or product and in 2004
37% from old customers and product and 63% from new business and new
product. This demonstrates both the value of the new Morello product and also
MEDIASURFACE PLC Report and Financial Statements 2004 03 04 MEDIASURFACE PLC Report and Financial Statements 2004
the Company’s new found competitive capability. Another significant factor has
been the Company’s rejuvenation of its US business which, although still in its
early phase has led to an increase in US revenues of 27% compared to 2003.
Our mainland European business based in the Netherlands also remained strong
delivering 36% of corporate sales. It is the Directors’ belief that the short term
focus for the Company should remain focussed on our three geographies UK,
US and Benelux. The nature of the sales cycles (typically six to nine months)
together with the relative size of individual sales transaction when compared to the
Company’s overall revenues has meant that during 2004 the Company has been
vulnerable to sales slippage, where for example sales transactions fail to conclude
prior to a half or full year end. To a certain degree the Company remains vulnerable
to this however three factors should mitigate against this during 2005.
• As a result of the marketplace’s interest in Morello, more opportunities are
being generated which in turn should provide the Company with greater
coverage to replace any slipping revenue. 
• The Company continues to grow recurring revenues, up 5.5% compared
to last year, which reduces the dependency on new business sales. 
• The Company has commenced activities to provide Small and Mid-sized
Enterprises (‘SME’s’) with a hosted version of our products which they can
pay for on a monthly fee basis. This proposition is attractive to the SME
market because of the reduced initial capital outlay and is now facilitated
by the Morello product. This hosted or ASP model will deliver more modest
total deal sizes and greater volumes which will smooth out and reduce the
dependency on larger transactions close to half-year or full-year ends.
The listing of the Company on the AIM market was completed for a number of
reasons as stated in the prospectus. However one which should be individually
mentioned is Merger and Acquisition. The benefit to the Company of such a listing
can now be realised during 2005 and indeed in subsequent years to enable it
to execute purchase transactions to fuel its other inorganic growth strategy. The
Directors believe the Company is well placed to execute appropriate acquisitions
through the strength of the incumbent management team and should now have
the “management bandwidth” to undertake such transactions. 
The twin streams of the growth strategy (organic and acquisition) will continue
to be deployed during 2005 and these coupled with the maintenance of good
fiscal governance and cost control will remain the management team maxims.
The Directors believe that the improvements made during 2004 coupled to this
maxim should see the Company well placed to further build on its improvements
in revenues and trading position.

INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board takes responsibility for establishing and maintaining reliable systems of control in all areas of operation.
These systems of control, especially of financial control, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that no material loss or misstatement has occurred.
The key features of the system of internal control are set out below:
• The Group has established a clearly defined and focused management structure which is subject to
regular review
• The Group prepares and monitors financial reporting on a monthly basis against budget, forecast and other
key performance indicators
• The Group conducts regular internal systems reviews of Subsidiary operations

reviewed by the Board.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES
United Kingdom Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year,
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group as at the end of the financial
year and of the profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements,
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departure
disclosed and explained in the accounts;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the financial position of the Company and Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act. They are also responsible for the system of internal control,
safeguarding the assets of the Company and Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Directors’
Report and other information included in the Annual Report is prepared in accordance with UK company law.
They are also responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report includes information required by the AIM rules.
The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The work carried out
by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and accordingly, the auditors accept no liability
for any changes that may have occurred to the information contained in the accounts since they were initially
presented on the web site.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and the dissemination of the accounts and other information
included in annual accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 10 MEDIASURFACE PLC Report and Financial Statements 2004

Profit and Loss account, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Balance Sheet, the Cash
Flow Statement and related notes 1 to 26. These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost
convention and the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest

RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
As described in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities the Company’s Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the accounts in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
United Kingdom Auditing Standards. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not
consistent with the accounts, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if the information specified by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
accounts. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Report, the
Directors’ Report and the Report on Corporate Governance. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the accounts. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the accounts. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made
by the Directors in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to
the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the accounts are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the accounts.
OPINION
In our opinion the accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as
at 30 September 2004 and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and under
the historic cost convention. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
The Group has made a loss for the year of £406,121, however, the Company has net assets of £1,456,968 and
the Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts, which predict that the Group will generate increasing levels of
income and as a result a positive net cash position. Therefore the Directors consider the going concern basis to
be appropriate.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Mediasurface plc and its subsidiary
undertakings drawn up to 30 September 2004.
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision
for impairment.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses representing any excess of
the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is
capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which is two years. Provision
is made for any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation
is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value,
of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
Leasehold improvements Unexpired period of lease 
Office equipment and computers two years
Furniture and fixtures two years
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered)
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or
a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences
between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised
in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all
evidence available, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are re-valued unless by the balance sheet date there is
a binding agreement to sell the re-valued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been
recognised in the financial statements. Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and
it is more likely than not that the tangible gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the
replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to
the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement
to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary. MEDIASURFACE PLC Report and Financial Statements 2004 17
Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing
differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Revenue recognition and long-term contracts
Revenue from the sale of software relates mainly to perpetual licences, which provide the customer with the
right to use the Group’s products. Where additional services are not essential to the functionality of the software
then revenue is recognised in full on delivery when the following conditions are met:
• persuasive evidence is available that a legally binding agreement exists; 
• the fee is fixed or determinable; and
• collection is probable. 
Maintenance revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the related agreement.
Revenue generated from consultancy and training contracts is recognised when the work is performed.
Pension costs and other post retirement benefits
The Company does not operate any defined benefit schemes. For defined contribution schemes the amount
charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the
contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions
actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange at the dates of the transactions or,
if hedged, at the forward contract rates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the
balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward
contract rates.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their
balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the
opening net assets and results of overseas operations are dealt with through reserves. All other exchange
differences are included in the profit and loss account.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those
attached to owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the
lease terms and their useful lives. The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities,
while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce
a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are
dealt with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments
are not made on such a basis. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are
similarly spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where the period to the review date on
which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate is shorter than the full lease term,
in which case the shorter period is used.
Finance costs
Finance costs of debt, non-equity shares and non-equity minority interests are recognised in the profit and loss
account over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Where the finance costs
for non-equity shares and non-equity minority interests are not equal to the dividends on these instruments,
the difference is also accounted for in the profit and loss account as an appropriation of profits. 18 MEDIASURFACE PLC Report and Financial Statements 2004

Research and development tax credit (331,273) (785,741)
Total current tax (331,273) (785,741)
The tax credit arose from a research and development tax credit claim for the years ending 30 September 2003,
of £227,044 and 30 September 2004 of £104,229. (2003: Years ended 30 September 2001 of £521,175 and
30 September 2002 of £264,566).
In addition, a deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of tax losses available to carry forward
against future taxable profits and timing differences relating to depreciation in excess of capital allowances as
the Directors consider there is insufficient evidence that the assets will be recovered. The amount of the asset
not recognised at 30% is £7,382,430 (2003: £4,675,539). These assets will be recovered if the Group makes
future taxable profits.
The difference between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard
rate of UK corporation tax to the loss before tax is as follows:

16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DISCLOSURE UNDER FRS 13
The Group uses a limited number of financial instruments comprising cash and short-term deposits and various
items such as trade debtors and creditors, which arise directly from operations. The main financial risks faced
by the Group are those of interest rate, foreign currency movements and cash liquidity. The Board agrees
policies for managing each of these risks as appropriate. The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
In respect of interest rate risk, the Group finances its operations through a mix of cash flow from current
operations together with cash on deposit and bank and other borrowings. Any borrowings are generally at
floating rates of interest and no uses of interest rate swaps have been made. In respect of liquidity risk, the
Group ensures it has adequate cover through the availability of cash resources.
Mediasurface Inc and Mediasurface BV, whose revenues, expenditures and cash flow are denominated in
dollars and euros respectively, provide a natural hedge against foreign currency risk. Gains and losses arising
from this foreign currency exposure are shown in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The fair values of the Group’s sterling, dollar and euro financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from
their book values. The Group considers the interest and foreign currency risk to be immaterial to the accounts. 24 MEDIASURFACE PLC Report and Financial Statements 2004

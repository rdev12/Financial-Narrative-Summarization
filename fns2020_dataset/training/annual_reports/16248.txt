STRONGER THAN BEFORE. THIS GIVES US THE CAPACITY TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE

UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA
ANNUAL REPORT 2002
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
IN NOVEMBER 2002 – FOLLOWING SIX YEARS AS A NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR – I TOOK
OVER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE UBM BOARD FROM RONNIE HAMPEL. I HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN EXCITED BY THE POTENTIAL AND THE INTERACTION OF THE MEDIA AND
TECHNOLOGY BUSINESSES AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WAS ATTRACTED
TO UNITED IN THE FIRST PLACE. ANOTHER MAJOR REASON WHY I WAS SO ENTHUSIASTIC
IN TAKING ON THE CHAIRMANSHIP IS BECAUSE OF UBM’S LONG TRACK RECORD IN
AMBITIOUSLY AND INNOVATIVELY CREATING VALUE THROUGH ITS BUSINESSES.
We invest steadily and patiently, both organically and by judicious acquisition to create major value for shareholders.
The ITV assets, which have been sold, and the Garban (now ICAP) business, now demerged, were both built up – largely
organically – over many years. five was started from scratch, and in just six years has taken 7.5 per cent of the television
advertising market with a particularly strong financial performance in 2002. Today’s core information service businesses
of market research, news distribution and professional media have roots within United stretching back to the 1970’s and
in some cases well beyond – some of CMPi’s and UAP’s major titles were launched in the nineteenth century!
In 2002, a major priority was restructuring the cost base in order to protect profit against the severe market downturn.
The numbers speak for themselves: over the past two years we have identified actions to reduce our fixed cost base
by over 25 per cent, securing £180m in annualised cost reductions. This has not however distracted us from the
fundamental task of creating future revenue growth and all of the divisions, often working together, have continued
to develop and launch a wide range of new products – building on long-term creative relationships with customers.
With a year-end net cash positive position of £94m, UBM’s balance sheet is even stronger than before. This gives us
the capacity to continue to expand the business, launching new products and expanding geographically to better
serve our customers. All such investment proposals are subjected to rigorous financial hurdles.
For the financial year 2002, EPS was 16.5p, down from 17.9 pence in 2001 reflecting the difficult trading conditions.
Nonetheless, the operating margin of 7.2 per cent in the second half of the year represents a significant improvement
on the 5.0 per cent for the same period in 2001. The board is recommending a final dividend for the year of 4 pence
per share, making the total dividend payable 7 pence per share. This is in line with our revised progressive dividend
policy announced last year and, if approved by shareholders at the AGM, it will be paid on 29 May 2003 to
shareholders on the register on 14 March 2003.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ronnie Hampel for his outstanding stewardship as chairman over the last
three years. Ronnie led the board in an exemplary manner during a period of significant corporate activity in which the
company transformed itself from broad-based consumer and business media interests into a sharply focused
professional information services company. We will miss his wise counsel. On behalf of the board and employees of
UBM, I would like to thank him for his major contribution to UBM and to wish him well in his continuing pursuits.
I would also very much like to thank all our employees for their contribution and commitment during 2002. They are
the creative and operational talent of UBM and the customer relationships they have cemented during this
challenging year have done much to consolidate UBM’s long term growth prospects. CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
2002 WAS ANOTHER VERY DIFFICULT YEAR. SEVERE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON
TECHNOLOGY ADVERTISING AND NEWS DISTRIBUTION REVENUES IN THE US PUSHED US
PROFITS* DOWN BY 58 PER CENT. IN CONTRAST, OUR EUROPEAN AND ASIAN BUSINESSES
– CMPi, CMP ASIA, UAP AND NOP RESEARCH – DELIVERED STRONG PERFORMANCES WITH
PROFIT* OF £44.9M, AHEAD BY APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD.
Action to improve operating efficiencies throughout the group has reduced fixed costs by £180m or over 25 per cent
against the 2000 base. These improvements and our success in building market share and protecting yields have left
group profit attractively geared to an improvement in revenues.
We have steadily increased our investment in new products with over 40 launches in 2002 at a cost of £20m which,
in their first year, generated revenue of £17m.
In the second half of 2002 our US high tech business achieved some stability for the first time in two years with revenue
at 55 per cent of the peak 2000 levels. Substantial cost reductions enabled CMP Media to meet its target of an operating
profit in the fourth quarter. The news distribution business was hit by the de-listing of many US companies – there were
16 per cent fewer Nasdaq companies at the year end – and by the weak state of the financial markets. NOP World’s UK,
syndicated US media and automotive businesses all performed well in 2002 but the healthcare and ad hoc sectors suffered
a marked deterioration and traded at a loss. Action has been taken to ensure these businesses trade profitably in 2003.
CMP Asia delivered revenue growth and improved profit and launched nine new exhibitions. CMP Information’s revenue
was down, reflecting closures and tough markets, but profit nearly doubled thanks to a wide ranging cost reduction
programme. UAP improved margins and increased profit by more than one third on steady turnover. This was thanks to
a maiden profit from Auto Exchange, the free pickup auto advertising publication, after five years of investment.
Stringent financial management, with tight control of working capital and capital expenditure, has improved our
already strong balance sheet. Cash conversion of around 140 per cent produced a net cash position at the year end
of £94m. Our robust balance sheet ensures that we can continue to invest in new products and achieve global reach,
both organically and, where appropriate, by acquisition.
five (formerly Channel 5), the principal holding in our investment portfolio, made excellent progress with strong
gains in advertising and audience share.
Current Trading and Outlook as at 28 February 2003
Trading conditions continue to be tough in 2003. In the first two months of the year professional publishing revenues
are in line with recent trends. PR Newswire’s revenue continues to be adversely affected by the uncertain state of
financial markets. In the UK, NOP has made a good start and in the US our continuous research businesses are well
set to make further progress. Revenues in the healthcare and ad hoc businesses remain under pressure.
The outlook for revenue has however been clouded by growing corporate uncertainty in the face of geopolitical
concerns. Against this difficult background we will strive to manage our cost base in line with actual revenues.
In 2003 we are targeting – in the absence of a sharp decline in revenues – an improvement in the group margin from
8.2 per cent in 2002 to around 10 per cent.
Professional publishing margins should benefit from the turnaround to profit at CMP Media in the US and the benefits of
the extensive restructuring at CMPi and UAP in the UK. PR Newswire continues to take action to reduce costs in the face
of the current weakness in revenues. The strength of our continuous market research business in the US, a resilient UK
business and the actions being taken to reduce costs in the US ad hoc business should improve market research margins.
We will continue to build, and at the right time realise, the value of our investment portfolio. five is on course to make
further gains in advertising share and to break into profit in 2003.
The company intends to purchase its own shares in the market from time to time under the existing authority granted
by shareholders.
We remain firmly committed to our strategy of patiently building shareholder value through improvements in
operational performance, investment in new products and sensibly priced acquisitions and market share gains.

OPERATING REVIEW
PROFESSIONAL MEDIA
PROFESSIONAL MEDIA REVENUE WAS £475.0M, A DECREASE OF 21.8 PER CENT OVER
2001. OPERATING PROFIT AT £29.7M WAS UP 35.6 PER CENT, REFLECTING THE
IMPRESSIVE RESULTS FROM CMP ASIA, CMP INFORMATION AND UAP.
CMP Media’s continuing US revenue of $359m was
44.3 per cent down on the 2000 base of $644.7m.
Most of the £118m revenue reduction was mitigated by
cost savings, and as a result, the business moved into
an operating profit in the fourth quarter.
In 2002, CMP Media’s titles again significantly
increased market share to 28.4 per cent of ad page
volumes compared with 24.9 per cent in 2001. CMP
Media defended yields stoutly, holding the decline to
6.2 per cent year-on-year – despite a 30.4 per cent
volume decline in the market.
CMP Media’s healthcare business achieved
revenue growth of 3 per cent, despite difficult market
conditions, with a solid increase in demand during the
second half of the year.
CMP Media’s £7m strong organic investment
programme generated incremental revenue of £7m.
New product launches within the technology business
included the magazine Optimize – a strategic title spun
off from Information Week in late 2001; NetSeminar
Services – a web seminar product which utilises
streaming video and audio broadcasts for marketing
purposes; and the Institute of Partner Education &
Development – a specialist training business.
Within the Healthcare division Med Reach has
been launched for pharmaceutical companies
organising promotional events.
CMP Asia delivered another good performance with
reported turnover up 4.3 per cent to £51.1m and profit up
2.2 per cent to £13.7m. Margins held firm at 27 per cent,
despite the investment in new exhibition launches.
CMP Asia’s excellent performance was achieved
in the face of some challenging market conditions in
the US and generally poor conditions in the cruise ship
and leather markets. The jewellery and beauty groups
performed extremely well with record attendance in
their prime shows.
KSS’s health events and publications have
strengthened the Asian portfolio and promises an
excellent base for growth in the key Japanese market.
This year CMP Asia launched nine new shows, three of
which were in China. These new events generated over
£2m in revenue and are scheduled to run again.
CMP Information (CMPi) benefited from its business-
wide initiative to improve profitability and operational
efficiency. Profits increased by 84.1 per cent to £12.7m,
and margins more than doubled from 5.3 per cent in
2001 to 11.2 per cent in 2002.
This improvement in profitability was achieved
despite a reduction in general advertising and marketing
spend in CMPi’s main markets. The music and medical
markets saw a marked downturn in advertising.
Conversely, the agriculture sector rebounded strongly
following the foot & mouth crisis in 2001. Many of
CMPi’s market-leading events registered improvements
in performance such as the Interiors Event, the UK’s
second largest exhibition; CPhI, the pharmaceutical
ingredients event; and IFSEC, one of the world’s leading
security shows.
CMPi new product launches this year included
Intra, a title aimed at interior designers and architects;
CPhI Japan, targeting the pharmaceutical ingredients
market in Japan; Firex South, aimed at the UK fire
prevention market; and IFSEC China, extending CMPi’s
successful security show to the Chinese market.
United Advertising Publications (UAP), despite an
increase in revenue of only 1.2 per cent to £58.1m,
achieved a very strong 35.1 per cent increase in profits
to £12.7m. Margins rose to 21.9 per cent (2001: 16.4
per cent).
Every one of UAP’s titles recorded an increase in
profits for the year, with Exchange & Mart, Daltons
Weekly, Trader and Trade-it recording significant profit
gains, despite a general decline in the advertising
market. Increased circulation and market share was
achieved by the two principal titles, Exchange & Mart
and Daltons Weekly. The improvement in profit across
the range of titles is largely due to the substantial cost
savings made by the business.
Auto Exchange, the free pick-up motoring
publication, moved into profit for the year, after five
years of investment.
Investment in new projects continued and
included the completion of the Daltonsbusiness.com
website; and the development of Exchange & Mart
content for publication in Auto Exchange titles. NEW PRODUCT

Continuing weak markets in the US, a sharp reduction
in the number of listed companies and the low levels
of M&A and IPO activity, together with a wave of
corporate scandals, made companies particularly
publicity-averse. Customers traded down to PR
Newswire’s lower cost distribution options leading to a
24 per cent decline in the level of messages outbound
from the US. Some “discretionary” or non-regulatory
products were particularly affected by general corporate
cost-cutting.
In PR Newswire’s core US distribution business,
message volume was 11 per cent below 2001 but
average revenue per message was up 4 per cent –
boosted by the increased regulatory message length
and volume following the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley.
Canada Newswire, although also suffering from
a tough local economy, proved to be resilient and
PR Newswire share from this JV held firm at US$12m
of revenue and US$4.1m of operating profit.
Globally, including PR Newswire Europe, Canada
Newswire and other PR Newswire business locations,
PR Newswire’s market share is up 2.2 per cent to 40.0 per
cent, with the fourth quarter alone up 3.1 per cent. In the
US, market share held firm at 52 per cent of earnings
release volumes.
Revenue was boosted by the growth of new products
such as MultiVu and Online MediAtlas, although these
were loss making as they are still in their start-up period.
PR Newswire Europe experienced similarly
difficult market conditions. PR Newswire’s Disclose
product has, since its launch in April 2002, captured
over 10 per cent of all announcements issued and has
signed up over 30 per cent of FTSE 100 companies.
£7m was invested in new products to generate
£6m in revenues. The Online MediAtlas was launched in
the UK and US during the year as were French, German
and Spanish versions. MultiVu, the new division
specialising in the production and distribution of video
news releases and other multimedia content,
contributed $5m in revenues since May. PR Newswire
also strengthened its presence in the developing
Chinese market with the creation of the leading
international corporate announcement distributor in
China – Xinhua PR Newswire – a new venture with the
largest government-backed news agency.

MARKET RESEARCH
REVENUES AT NOP WORLD INCREASED BY 9.3 PER CENT TO £213M. ADJUSTING FOR
THE EFFECTS OF ACQUISITIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE, UNDERLYING REVENUE
DECREASED BY 10.6 PER CENT. PROFITS DECREASED BY 25.4 PER CENT TO £17.9M
OR BY 21.0 PER CENT ON AN UNDERLYING BASIS. THE UK OPERATIONS, US
CONTINUOUS MEDIA AND THE AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESSES PERFORMED STRONGLY
AND CONTRIBUTED ALL OF THE PROFITS IN 2002. THE HEALTHCARE AND CUSTOM
BUSINESS IN THE US EXPERIENCED SHARP DOWNTURNS IN REVENUES WHICH HAVE
NECESSITATED EXTENSIVE COST REDUCTION PROGRAMMES.
NOP World Health was particularly impacted by the
major market research trend to rapid growth in online
data collection. At Market Measures Cozint (MMC) this
grew from $7m in 2001 to $30m in 2002. Much of this
has been cannibalistic, as traditional forms of data
collection in the core custom businesses have switched
to the internet. Internet research typically sells at a 10-
15 per cent discount to traditional methods. This has
had the effect of reducing the margin on custom
research. Nonetheless, these margins should improve in
the longer term as more volume is processed through
increasingly automated systems.
At the same time as this transformation was
taking place, the pharmaceutical industry experienced
slower growth, fewer product approvals from the FDA
and more patent expirations. This reduced market
research expenditures in areas which supported new
product development and led to clients taking lower
cost options. The effects of these changes in 2002 have
been a decline in revenues in the old MMI business,
a reduction in margin on custom research and
considerable investment in next-generation products.
MMC has responded to these challenges and
opportunities by moving to online faster, increasing the
number of syndicated studies and developing a new
generation of sales force effectiveness tracking
methodologies. A major new product in this area is
ScripDriver, a marketing science product which not only
quantifies sales and prescription data, but analyses that
data and adds insight. Utilising methodologies already
successful in AFI, ScripDriver links promotions, brand
health and patient dynamics to provide a complete picture
of the prescribing decision process. All results are reported
online. ScripDriver completed concept testing with clients
at the end of 2002 and was launched in early 2003.
Although NOP UK’s revenues were in line with
last year’s, profit increased due to strong performances
from the Business and Healthcare divisions and to
margin improvements in both Automotive and Mystery
Shopping.
Mediamark Research (MRI) maintained its
impressive record with improved revenue performance
and profits and success in renewing all of its multi-year
contracts.
RoperASW’s revenues were reduced by client
budget pressures and competitive pricing. Profitability
was diluted by the investment in new product
introductions including the US online Panel and
LifeMatrix.
Both Allison-Fisher (AFI) & NOP Auto US
achieved increased revenues and profits. AFI’s strong
syndicated sales and new additional custom business
drove topline growth. NOP Auto’s US revenue was
boosted by the opening of a new office in California.
Organic initiatives reduced profits by £2m with
eight major new projects developed, including the
online consumer panel within RoperASW, the launch of
the joint MRI/RoperASW LifeMatrix – a market
segmentation product which offers a combined brand,
marketing, and media strategy, the development of a
major Roper NOP Consulting offer and also some major
product extensions. 14

ANNUAL REPORT 2002
FINANCIAL REVIEW
THE OPERATING CASH FLOW* FROM THE BUSINESS RESULTED IN A CASH
CONVERSION RATE OF 140 PER CENT. ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES
DELIVERED ROBUST CASH PERFORMANCES. WITH £94M OF NET CASH AT THE
YEAR END, UBM HAS RETAINED A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND FINANCIAL
FLEXIBILITY.
Cash Flow
The operating cash flow* of the business was £91.0m,
which exceeded operating profits of £64.9m and
resulted in a cash conversion rate of 140.2 per cent. All
of the businesses achieved a strong cash performance,
for example, CMP Media generated £6.2m despite
incurring a £9.4m loss; whilst PR Newswire’s US
business profits declined from $50m to $29m.
However, it generated more cash in 2002 ($37.0m),
than in 2001 ($36.3m).
Capital expenditure for the year was £10.9m, significantly
less than depreciation of £23.2m. This reflected the tight
control of all aspects of expenditure, coupled with
increased emphasis on organic investments, where the
investment is primarily in people and is consequently
expensed rather than capitalised. Working capital inflow
was £16.3m, reflecting a strong performance in all
divisions, for example debtor days is at an all time low in
NOP at 55 and in UAP at 46.
Cash outflows for the year included £8.2m of additional
funding for five, significantly less than planned due to its
much improved financial performance. PR Newswire
invested £3.0m in establishing a commercial relationship
with Xinhua in China. There were no acquisitions in 2002,
although £19.0m was paid in relation to disposals from
previous years. We received a tax cash inflow of £15.3m,
reflecting the reclaiming of tax from previous years and
utilisation of tax losses. We also had outflows in relation to
our property provisions of £14.9m and in relation to our
2001 restructuring costs of £20.2m. Cash benefited from
the exchange impact on our net US dollar borrowings by
£24m. After paying £14.4m in respect of dividends, overall
cash increased by £44.2m during the year.
Balance Sheet
We have retained our strong balance sheet and our
financial flexibility. We have £93.5m of net cash,
comprising £693.0m of cash and £599.5m of debt,
furthermore we have undrawn committed banking
facilities of £500m.
Our balance sheet includes £169.5m of fixed asset
investments. Included in this is our investment in five,
which has a book value of £119.1m, and a number of
other investments which we intend to realise in the
medium term. Whilst no disposals took place in 2002
we have since the year end sold our investment in
Sporting Index for £9.0m.
The group’s tax creditor of £277.4m represents a
prudent assessment of the potential tax liability for
prior tax years across different geographies, including
amounts relating to the group’s £3.2bn of disposals in
2000. This liability has been consistently classified as a
short-term creditor in line with accounting convention.
We do not currently expect the cash outflow in 2003
in respect of this creditor to exceed £10m.
At present we have no net borrowings, however in the
current financial climate we believe a prudent ratio of
operating profit to interest is five, which implies that we
could accommodate a net debt position of up to £400m.
Investment Performance
We benchmark investments against our cost of capital,
estimated to be 8 per cent, and returning value to our
shareholders. As a consequence of these strict financial
criteria and decreasing values, we did not complete any
acquisitions in 2002. In relation to our 2001
acquisitions, performance was mixed. Whilst Allison-
Fisher, ANP and KSS performed in line or ahead of plan,
Roper Starch and Cyperus operated at significantly
below plan and as a consequence an impairment was
taken against their value.
We constantly monitor the performance of our organic
investments, which to date have a mixed performance,
reflecting the volatile markets in which we operate. We
expect a number of these innovative investments will
make a positive contribution to our profitability in

UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA
ANNUAL REPORT 2002
Exceptional items
In 2002 these total £158.2m compared to £495.5m last
year, and reflect a £30m property restructuring
provision, £114.2m charge for impairment and £14m
relating to prior year disposals.
Impairment
There is a charge for goodwill impairment of £114.2m.
The charge has been made following a review of the
goodwill across the business in the light of difficult trading
conditions. The impairment principally relates to three
main businesses. Within NOP World, the Roper Starch
business acquired in 2001 has experienced a weakening of
the market in its custom business, and has failed to meet
its business plan. In News Distribution, the UK and
European businesses have also experienced reduced
demand, and have incurred losses in 2002. In Professional
Media, CMP Media has seen continued difficult market
conditions. The impairment charge of £114.2m has been
separately reported as an exceptional operating cost.
Pensions
We have adopted the accounting requirements of FRS
17: “Retirement Benefits” for the year ended 31
December 2002, and have restated the comparative
information accordingly. There is no material difference
between the charge to the profit and loss account
under FRS 17 compared to SSAP 24; however, under
FRS 17, a part of the overall cost of £6.8m is shown
separately as a £2.1m financing charge.
The adoption of FRS 17 means that the net deficits on
the group’s defined benefit pension schemes are shown
as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet. At 31
December 2002, the aggregate deficit was £90.9m. At
31 December 2001, the deficit was £41.0m; the
movement in the year reflects the significant decline in
equity values over the period.
Treasury and Finance
The group’s treasury function is principally concerned
with managing internal and external funding
requirements, the monitoring of working capital and
management of key financial market risks. Its activities
are carried out in accordance with policies approved by
the board and are subject to regular review and audit.
Contracts are entered into with approved counterparties
and not on a speculative basis. The group borrows
centrally on behalf of its subsidiaries to maximise
flexibility and minimise price. In 2002 no new debt was
issued but the group exercised its option to redeem its
£180m convertible bond for par in January 2002.
The group has four fixed rate borrowings: a $250m 7.25
per cent bond redeemable in July 2004, a $250m 7.75
per cent bond redeemable in July 2009, a $125m 8.04
per cent private placement redeemable in September
2004 and a $400m convertible bond, redeemable on or
after December 2004. To reduce the interest cost of this
debt the group entered into a number of transactions. It
repurchased $75m of its bonds, invested in $205m of
credit linked notes and entered into $1,000m of interest
rate swaps. These transactions, which are detailed in
note 22 in the accounts, had the effect of reducing
interest costs by around £20m in 2002 and will result in
further savings in 2003 and beyond. The group also
entered into £50m of sterling swaps in 2002 and £170m
in early 2003 to reduce its exposure to a reduction in
sterling interest rates.
The group retains a £500m revolving credit facility
available until August 2006 provided by a syndicate of
relationship banks. The drawn margin on this facility is
45 basis points and there are no net assets or gearing
covenants, the interest cover covenant (ratio of
operating profits to net interest paid) is three times.
The facility was undrawn at the end of 2002.
Foreign currency transaction exposures are covered as
they arise using forward foreign exchange contracts.
There are no material contacts outstanding at the end
of 2002. We do not hedge profit translation exposures,
as these are accounting rather than cash exposures.
However, as shown above foreign currency borrowings
are used where appropriate to provide an economic
hedge against investment in overseas territories.
Our long term credit rating is investment grade with a
Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB and Moody’s Baa2 with
stable outlook.
Going Concern
Having reviewed the groups liquid resources, borrowing
facilities and cash flow forecast, the directors believe
that the group has adequate resources to continue as a
going concern for the foreseeable future. 16

ANNUAL REPORT 2002
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 (the “Act”) as amended by the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 and has been approved by the board. Disclosure relating to remuneration policy, long term incentive arrangements, total
shareholder return and non-executive directors’ remuneration policy is not subject to audit. Disclosure relating to individual directors’ remuneration on page
20, directors’ interests in share options and other long term incentive schemes on pages 23 to 25, and pensions information on page 21 has been audited.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The board has delegated to the remuneration committee responsibility for determining the company’s policy on the remuneration of executive directors and
specific approval of the remuneration package and terms of employment for each of the executive directors of the company and for other senior executives
of the group.
In determining remuneration policy, the committee has regard to the provisions of the Combined Code. All its members are non-executive directors; it is
chaired by John Botts, who is also the senior independent director. The other members are Jonathan Newcomb, Christopher Powell, Adair Turner, Geoff
Unwin, Fields Wicker-Miurin and, until his retirement in November 2002, Sir Ronald Hampel; all are considered by the company to be independent. The
chief executive attends committee meetings by invitation; he is not present for discussion on matters concerning his own remuneration. Meetings are also
attended by the company secretary, Anne Siddell, and the legal and personnel director, Jane Stables.
Shareholders have been given an opportunity to vote on the company’s remuneration policy at every annual general meeting since 1998. A resolution
seeking shareholder approval of this directors’ remuneration report will be proposed at this year’s annual general meeting.
REMUNERATION POLICY
All of the company’s personnel policies, including its policy on remuneration for executive directors, are driven by the requirement to attract, motivate and
retain the best available talent in highly competitive markets.
The company aims to strike an appropriate balance between fixed and performance related or variable remuneration. Non-performance related aspects
include base salary, cash allowances and contributions to pensions arrangements. Performance related aspects include annual bonus arrangements and other
long term incentive arrangements such as executive option schemes and executive equity participation plans. By this means the company is better able to
recognise and reward outstanding performance and contribution at the appropriate level. The company believes the contribution made by the performance
related elements of the directors’ packages should constitute a significant proportion of the total remuneration package and should incentivise them by
means of annual and medium term objectives to achieve stretching corporate goals for the benefit of shareholders. The committee intends to review its
policy on performance related remuneration during 2003, with particular reference to the balance between cash and equity based awards. The company
believes that executive directors’ and senior management’s pay arrangements ensure that they work effectively as a team in addition to encouraging
individual creativity and delivery against goals.
The company encourages directors to build up a shareholding in the company by means of the Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan which is described
on page 19. There is no requirement for directors to hold shares in the company.
The company’s policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration is described on page 26.
Executive directors’ service contracts
It is the company’s policy that all executive directors should have service contracts that are terminable on no more than one year’s notice, and that
contracts should not have a fixed term. Contracts provide for automatic termination on retirement at age 60. All directors are subject to re-election by
shareholders every 3 years. Details of the service contracts of those executive directors who served during the year are as follows:-
Director Contract date Notice Period
C Hollick 31.10.2001 1 year
C Gregson 31.12.2001 1 year
M Wall 24.11.2000 1 year
N Wilson 06.07.2001 1 year
The description on page 21 sets out the calculation of Clive Hollick’s pension entitlement if his service were terminated by the company following a change
of control. If Clive Hollick or Charles Gregson’s employment were terminated other than for cause (summary dismissal), they would be entitled to a
payment, calculated by reference to their unexpired period of notice, of up to one year’s salary and benefits and 50 per cent of average annual bonus over
the preceding 3 years (excluding any special bonus). Under Malcolm Wall and Nigel Wilson’s contracts, any payment on early termination would be by
reference to the unexpired period of notice, subject to a duty to mitigate.
Base salary for each director is determined annually with effect from 1 January. The company regularly participates in executive remuneration surveys that
provide information on the practice of major public companies to measure the competitiveness of the directors’ base salaries. In addition to measurement
against competitive market data, factors such as inflation, the individual’s responsibilities, the company’s performance and the salary policy throughout the
group as a whole are taken into account when determining base salary levels. No increases were made in base salary levels for executive directors during
2002, nor have any been made in 2003, thus leaving executive directors’ base salary levels unchanged since 1 January 2001. Benefits comprise non-
pensionable car and cash benefit allowances.
The executive directors are eligible for an annual bonus dependent on the achievement of qualitative and quantitive targets which are set by the committee
at the beginning of the year. Targets customarily include a combination of factors which recognise both relevant company performance and individual
objectives. The annual bonus is normally capped at 60 per cent of base salary, with the full bonus becoming payable only if targets are substantially
exceeded. Bonuses earned are paid in cash or the individual may be invited to invest his bonus in the company’s Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan
which is described below. 19
UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA
ANNUAL REPORT 2002
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Long term Incentive Arrangements
Executive share options
It is the company’s policy to award executive directors executive share options to reward past performance and to incentivise future performance.
Such awards are currently made under the United Business Media 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme (the “2000 Scheme”) which was established,
with shareholder approval, in April 2000.
Options are granted at market value and the committee determines the appropriate level of each grant having regard to corporate objectives, market
forces and individual circumstances. It was decided in December 2000 to award options to approximately twenty senior employees of the group
(including executive directors) over a period of two years with a maximum value of 12 times salary. This was considered to be appropriate given the
wish to incentivise these key individuals during a time of great organisational change, and in light of the restructured group’s increased exposure to
US markets and the need to compete for talent in those markets. Options with a value of approximately 12 times salary have been granted to Clive
Hollick and Malcolm Wall, with a value of approximately 11 times salary to Charles Gregson and with a value of approximately 9 times salary to Nigel
Wilson. Half of the options granted in each tranche will vest after three years and half after four years, subject to fulfilment of the performance
condition described below. Awards to other participants in the 2000 Scheme are generally made on a phased basis, with annual awards of up to 3
times salary being usual.
The exercise of options under the 2000 Scheme is subject to a performance condition which requires growth in earnings per share to exceed the
increase in the Retail Price Index by an average of 3 per cent per annum over the measurement period. If this condition is met, options with a face
value equal to 0.75 times salary will vest. In order for the whole award to vest, growth in earnings per share must exceed inflation by an average of 5
per cent per annum. A sliding scale applies between these two figures. These performance conditions are measured over a period of three to six years
from the date of grant, with a fixed start date. No re-testing is permitted after six years from the date of grant.
The committee considers that a performance condition based on long term earnings per share growth is an appropriate means of incentivising
directors and that the targeted growth levels of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent above inflation are appropriately stretching. As and when options
are due to vest, the company’s auditors will be asked to confirm whether the performance conditions have been met.
Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan
The United Business Media 2000 Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan (“SEEPP”) was established with shareholder approval in April 2000.
Invitations are issued annually by the committee and there is no automatic entitlement to participate. Under the SEEPP selected senior executives
(including executive directors) may waive part or all of their annual bonus and receive an interest in shares in the company (“bonus shares”) to the
equivalent value. The executive may also be granted a right to acquire shares (“matching shares”) in the company equal in value to the gross amount
of the bonus foregone at a nominal price. A matching share award will normally be exercisable in full between the fourth and tenth anniversaries of
its grant, but only to the extent that the attached bonus shares are still held on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant. Two thirds of a matching
share award may only be exercised if growth in earnings per share exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index by up to 5 per cent per annum over
the period of four years commencing with the year of grant; the remaining one-third requires no performance condition. No re-testing of
performance conditions is permitted. These conditions are in accordance with the committee’s policy as outlined above.
Other long term incentive arrangements
Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson also hold outstanding awards under executive option and other incentive plans previously operated by the
company which have now closed. Executive directors are also entitled to participate in the Sharesave scheme, under which eligible employees around
the group may acquire options over ordinary shares of the company at a discount of up to 20 per cent of their market price, using the proceeds of a
related SAYE contract.
Further details of these plans, including an explanation of performance conditions, and of the outstanding awards held by executive directors, are set
out on pages 23 to 25.
External appointments
It is recognised that by holding the office of a non-executive director of another company, an executive director may gain valuable knowledge and
experience that can benefit the company. The policy therefore provides for executive directors to accept not more than two outside corporate
directorships, subject to board approval which may be given or withheld at the board’s discretion. An executive director may retain the fees received
for a non-executive directorship. 20

secretarial services provided; £51,552 of this amount has been paid in 2003. With effect from 1 October 2000, 50 per cent of the fees otherwise payable
to Sir Ronald Hampel were provided to him in the form of a provisional allocation of ordinary shares in the company to which he would become entitled,
subject to certain conditions, on his retirement from the board. The cash equivalent of these provisional allocations of shares has been reported as part of
Sir Ronald’s remuneration for the periods in question. He became unconditionally entitled to receive the shares on 5 November 2002.
4. Geoff Unwin’s fees increased with effect from 5 November 2002, when he succeeded Sir Ronald Hampel as chairman. Adair Turner’s fees increased from

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Pension entitlement
Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson are members of the United Pension Plan which is an approved defined benefit scheme. The company meets the full cost
of the benefits. Normal retirement age is 60. The pension entitlement is two thirds of Final Pensionable Salary, which is the annual average of the best three
consecutive Pensionable Salaries in the last ten years.
Under Clive Hollick’s contract any bonus paid after 5 April 2001 is not pensionable; this means that if he remains in office until normal retirement age of 60
(20 May 2005) he will receive his already earned pension entitlement of £726,000 per annum. If he retires earlier this entitlement will be reduced pro rata
on a sliding scale. The pension would normally also be subject to a discount if drawn prior to normal retirement date. If Clive Hollick’s service were
terminated by the company following a change of control he would be entitled to receive the pension of £726,000 per annum, reduced to reflect
completed service plus his one year’s notice period.
Under the terms of Charles Gregson’s service contract, the definition of Pensionable Salary includes annual bonus up to 50 per cent of base salary; this is a
longstanding term of his service contract. If Charles Gregson’s service were terminated by the company without his consent he would be entitled to an
immediate pension calculated as a proportion of his pension entitlement at age 60, based on his Final Pensionable Salary at the date of termination.
As members of the United Pension Plan Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson receive increases on their pensions in payment of 5 per cent per annum or RPI, if
less, for all pensionable service. The widow’s pension for the two executive directors is two thirds of their pension.
The company contributes to personal pension plans for other executive directors.
The following tables show the pension figures required to be disclosed by both the Act (Table 1) and the current UKLA listing rules (Table 2) which have
not, as yet, been withdrawn.
Table 1 shows accrued pension entitlements at 31 December 2002 for Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson with the increase in pension accrued during the
year together with prior year and current year end transfer values. These transfer values represent the amount that would have been payable assuming the
executive left service at the year end.
It should be noted that during the year, as a consequence of changes introduced by the Government to the basis used for calculating Minimum Funding
Requirements the Trustees of the scheme amended the basis for calculating transfer values. The equivalent transfer values at 31 December 2002 on a like for
like basis are also shown for information. A significant proportion of the increase disclosed has arisen due to the change in the basis and as a consequence
of falling equity markets.
Details of the contributions paid by the company during the year to personal pension plans in respect of the other executive directors are also shown.

The graph below shows UBM’s total shareholder return performance over the five years since 31 December 1997 as compared to the FTSE Media index,
which has been chosen as UBM is a constituent of that index. During the period two major restructuring events monetised shareholder value which had
been created over many years; these were the demerger of Garban (now ICAP), and the return of a £1.25bn special dividend following the disposal of
UBM’s three ITV licences to Granada Media for £1.75bn. Since the demerger the ICAP shares have significantly outperformed the FTSE 100. In accordance
with the requirements of the Act, the ‘UBM (Divs Reinv)’ line assumes that the benefits received by shareholders from these two events were reinvested in
UBM shares; it shows a 49 per cent decline in shareholder return compared to a 19 per cent decline in the return for the FTSE Media index. Within this
‘UBM (Divs Reinv)’ line the element which relates to the UBM share price decline since 31 December 2000 primarily reflects the severe deterioration in market
conditions affecting the group’s ongoing US businesses. The ‘UBM/ICAP (Capital Return on Deposit)’ line reflects ICAP’s outperformance and the monetisation
of value represented by the special dividend, and shows an increase in shareholder value of 16 per cent.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN OPTIONS OVER UBM SHARES (continued)
Options granted under the 2000 Scheme are subject to the performance conditions as described on page 19. Options granted to Clive Hollick and Charles
Gregson under the United 1994 Executive Scheme are subject to a performance condition which requires EPS growth to exceed inflation by an average of
2 per cent per annum over a three year period. At the time of setting up the 1994 Executive Scheme this performance measure was in line with existing
market practice. The performance condition has been met in respect of all outstanding options held by these executive directors under the United 1994
Executive Scheme, which are consequently fully vested. All options were granted at market value and for no consideration.
Options granted to Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson under the MAI Executive Schemes are not subject to any performance conditions; at the time these
schemes were established it was not customary to require performance conditions. All options were granted at market value of the corresponding MAI
shares at the date of grant and were converted into options over shares in the company upon the merger of the company and MAI in 1996. No
consideration was payable for the grant of options under these schemes.
Options granted under the MAI Sharesave scheme and United SAYE scheme are not subject to performance conditions as these are all-employee schemes.
There have been no variations in the terms and conditions of scheme interests during the year.

Awards under the LTIP were made in the form of a provisional allocation of shares which become receivable on or after the third anniversary of the
allocation date, subject to the performance condition being met. This condition requires the group’s total shareholder return (i.e. share price movement and
dividends paid), when compared with that of FTSE 100 companies over the three year period, to place the group in at least 50th position within the FTSE
100. The shares will vest in full at 25th position or above, while 20 per cent of the shares will vest at 50th position. Shares will be allocated proportionately
on a sliding scale between 25th and 50th position. The scheme rules give discretion to the committee to allow limited re-testing if the condition was met
after the third year; no such re-testing is undertaken.
The last awards under the LTIP were made in 2000. The performance condition was not met in relation to these awards, which will consequently lapse on
3 March 2003. No further awards will be made.
* The value of shares that vested during the year is calculated at 585 pence, the market value on the date on which the shares were transferred to the
directors.
** Market value of LTIP shares as yet unvested is calculated at 290 pence, the closing mid-market price on 31 December 2002. 25

subject to a longer vesting period (up to seven years) but no performance conditions are attached.
Notes:
* Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson gave up cash bonuses that would otherwise have been receivable by them in order to receive awards under the SEEPP.
The bonus was paid to each individual’s funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (“FURBS”) and used by the FURBS Trustees to purchase shares
from the SEEPP Trustees. A matching award was granted over an equal number of shares. The table shows the total bonus shares and matching awards.
The bonus shares are included in the director’s beneficial interest in shares shown on page 22; the amount used to purchase the bonus shares was
included in the director’s reported remuneration for the year in which the award was made.
** This award comprises 222,487 bonus options and 34,689 matching awards granted to Clive Hollick in exchange for options previously held under the
Meridian Broadcasting Executive Share Option Scheme.
‡ These options were granted in exchange for options previously held under the MAI 1989 Purchase Only Share Option Scheme, the rights to which were
waived by Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson. Both the bonus options and an equal number of matching options are exercisable in full.
+ The SEEPP bonus shares/options and matching awards were adjusted to reflect the capital reorganisation which took place on 23 April 2001, whereby
every shareholder received 44 B shares and 29 new ordinary shares in place of every 44 ordinary shares previously held.
† The market value of the matching awards is calculated at 290 pence per ordinary share, the closing mid-market price on 31 December 2002, and 245
pence per B share.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The fees of the chairman and non-executive directors are considered and approved by the board as a whole, having regard to current market practice. Non-
executive directors’ fees were last reviewed in 2000, at which time the board decided that in order to link the interests of non-executive directors more
closely with those of shareholders, part of their fees should be paid in the form of ordinary shares. All non-executive directors with the exception of the
chairman receive a fee of £25,000 per annum which is paid in cash. A further £10,000 per annum is provisionally allocated in the form of ordinary shares in
the company. The directors will become entitled to receive these shares when they leave the board, subject to certain conditions. The directors’ fees include
membership of board committees; an additional £5,000 per annum is paid to the chairmen of the remuneration and audit committees respectively. As
chairman, Sir Ronald Hampel received a fee of £100,000 per annum paid in cash, and a further £100,000 was provisionally allocated in the form of ordinary
shares in the company as described above. He became entitled to receive these shares when he retired from the board in November 2002. Sir Ronald’s
appointment was terminable by either party on not less than twelve months’ notice.
Geoff Unwin succeeded Sir Ronald as chairman in November 2002. His contract, which was entered into on 5 November 2002, is terminable by either party
on not less than twelve months’ notice, such notice not to be given before 1 November 2003. He receives a fee of £100,000 per annum paid in cash and a
further £100,000 per annum is provisionally allocated in the form of ordinary shares in the company as described above. Mr Unwin’s contract contains no
provision for payment of compensation on early termination. The other non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the company; each has a
notice period of 6 months. Their terms of appointment contain no provision for payment of compensation on early termination. Non-executive directors are
not entitled to participate in the company’s share option or pension schemes. Each director’s appointment (including that of the chairman) is reviewed
every 3 years. The table below shows the date on which each non-executive director was first appointed to the board and the year in which he or she was
last re-elected by shareholders.

ANNUAL REPORT 2002
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
COMBINED CODE COMPLIANCE
This report describes the manner in which the board has applied the principles of the Combined Code on corporate governance which is appended to the
listing rules of the Financial Services Authority. The board considers that during 2002 the company complied fully with the provisions of Section 1 of the
Combined Code. The company has complied with the internal control provisions by establishing the procedures necessary to implement the guidance
issued in September 1999 (the Turnbull Committee report) and by reporting in accordance with that guidance.
THE BOARD
Under the company’s articles of association, at each annual general meeting any director then in office who has been appointed by the board since the
previous annual general meeting and any director who at the date of the notice convening the annual general meeting had held office for more than 30
months since he was last appointed or re-appointed by the company in general meeting shall retire from office, but is eligible for re-appointment.
During the greater part of 2002 there were eleven board members in total, comprising the chairman (part time), chief executive, three other executives and
six non-executive directors. That number was reduced to ten following the retirement of the chairman, Sir Ronald Hampel, on 5 November 2002. Sir Ronald
was succeeded as chairman by Geoff Unwin, who has served as a non-executive director of the company since 1996 and previously chaired the audit
committee. The roles of chairman and chief executive are separate, and the board has nominated John Botts as the senior independent non-executive
director. The board receives regular written reports from all executive directors; the chief executive reports principally on matters of strategy and
development, the chief operating officer provides detailed reports on the day to day operations of the group’s businesses, the chief financial officer reports
on accounting, treasury and tax matters, and reports are also received from the executive director responsible for the group’s investments.
The primary function of the board is to set the group’s strategy and to oversee the effective implementation of that strategy. Scheduled board meetings take
place approximately seven times a year, with additional meetings being convened if circumstances require. There is an established agenda of items to be
considered at the board meeting and the board also receives presentations from executive directors and from divisional management and other senior
executives on specific issues. The chairman meets separately with the chief executive on a regular basis and other informal meetings and discussions take
place between directors as appropriate.
The board has three principal committees, all of which have written terms of reference. Details of these committees are as follows:-
The audit committee was chaired by Geoff Unwin until November 2002 and its other members were John Botts, Sir Ronald Hampel and Adair Turner.
Following Sir Ronald Hampel’s retirement another non-executive director, Jonathan Newcomb, was appointed as a member of the committee and Adair
Turner was appointed chairman of the committee. All members of the committee are non-executive directors and are considered by the company to be
independent. The committee meets at least four times a year. Meetings are also attended by the chief financial officer, deputy CFO, head of internal audit,
company secretary and external auditors. The audit committee’s terms of reference were reviewed during the year in the light of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
2002, US legislation introduced in July 2002 to which the company is subject by virtue of the listing of its ordinary shares on NASDAQ in the form of
American Depositary Receipts. The committee now has authority to appoint, review and remunerate the external auditors and to pre-approve their
engagement for both audit and non audit services; it also reviews the independence and objectivity of the auditors and reviews the group’s accounting
procedures and financial control environment. The committee has established policy guidelines on the nature of non audit work which may be undertaken
by the auditors. These guidelines identify a number of categories of work where the auditors will not be employed, including financial due diligence
assignments on potential acquisitions and financial systems consultancy. The committee has also put in place procedures for the pre approval of any fees
payable to the auditors for those non audit services which fall within the policy guidelines.
It is the company’s policy to review its external audit arrangements every five years; during the year the committee carried out such a review, as a result of
which Ernst & Young LLP were appointed as auditors to the company in May 2002.
The remuneration committee is chaired by John Botts and its other members are Sir Ronald Hampel (until November 2002), Jonathan Newcomb,
Christopher Powell, Adair Turner, Geoff Unwin and Fields Wicker-Miurin. All members of the committee are non-executive directors and are considered by
the company to be independent. Further details of the committee’s activities are set out in the directors’ remuneration report on page 18. The company
was among the first to invite its shareholders to vote on its remuneration policy in 1998 and has done so at all subsequent annual general meetings. In
accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which have now come into effect, shareholders will be given the opportunity at this
year’s annual general meeting to vote on the remuneration report as a whole.
The nomination committee was chaired by Sir Ronald Hampel until November 2002 and is now chaired by Geoff Unwin. Its other members are Clive
Hollick and John Botts. The committee meets as required to review the structure, size and composition of the board and to identify candidates, both
executive and non-executive, whose skills and experience are considered to be of value to the company.
In addition to the principal committees the finance committee, comprising any two directors to include at least one of the chief executive and chief financial
officer, approves and facilitates the group’s treasury and financial operations within limits established by the board. The company secretary acts as secretary
to all the above committees.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The directors believe that effective corporate governance is strengthened by the presence of a strong independent element on the board. Of the ten board
members, 60 per cent (including the chairman) are non-executive directors; all are considered by the company to be independent. Biographies of all of the
directors currently in office are set out on pages 16 and 17, and illustrate the range of experience of directors.
The board is considering the recommendations of the Higgs report on the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors which was published in January
2003, and will review its procedures in the light of those recommendations. 28

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The company considers its annual and interim reports to be of primary importance in keeping shareholders informed about the activities and progress of the
group. In addition to these reports the company also provides updated trading information prior to the start of each close period. Financial and other
information about the company is published on its website, which has links to the websites of other businesses in the group.
The company maintains an ongoing dialogue with its major institutional shareholders by means of meetings and presentations as appropriate. Consultation
is undertaken with the ABI and other bodies representing shareholders’ interests on matters which the company considers appropriate. All shareholders are
welcome at the annual general meeting where they have the opportunity to ask questions of all the directors, including the chairman as well as the
chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The board is responsible for maintaining the effectiveness of the group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing the effectiveness of such systems. The
system is intended to enable the group to identify and manage the risks inherent in its business and accordingly can provide only reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material mis-statement or loss.
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the key financial, operating and compliance risks faced by the group, which has been
in place during the year and continues in force. This process accords with the Turnbull guidance issued in September 1999 and is regularly reviewed by the
board. The process aims to identify and evaluate risks which are specific to each of its businesses; it is undertaken at a divisional level and the results co-
ordinated and reviewed by the audit committee. The board reviews the effectiveness of the group’s system of internal control by means of regular reports
from management and from independent monitoring functions as described below.
Day to day management of the group’s businesses is delegated to the chief executive and the executive directors within the financial and strategic
objectives for the group as approved by the board. The chief executives of the individual businesses are accountable for the conduct and performance of
their division within the agreed strategy and they are authorised to act in accordance with the system of delegated authorities which is monitored by the
internal audit department and reviewed periodically by the board.
Individual businesses are responsible for complying with the group’s financial reporting system which includes a comprehensive budgeting and financial
reporting mechanism, providing monthly trading results, balance sheet and cash flow statements recorded against corresponding figures for the budget and
the previous year. This information is reported regularly to the board in the form of management accounts. Individual businesses are also responsible for
compliance with certain group policies and guidelines set out in the group’s financial policies and procedures manual and the group policy manual.
The internal audit department undertakes periodic reviews of individual businesses to assess their control status. Internal and external audit report to the
board on significant exceptions and internal audit follow up on these until they are resolved. 29
UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA
ANNUAL REPORT 2002
We have audited the group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002 which comprise the Profit and Loss Account, the Balance Sheets of
the group and company, the group Cash Flow Statement, the Statement of Group Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Reconciliation of Movements in
Group Shareholders’ Funds and the related notes 1 to 32. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out
therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for
our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other
information comprises the Report of the Directors, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s
Review, Operating Review, Financial Review, Board of directors, Five Year Financial Summary, Financial Calendar, Shareholder Information and Corporate
Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on
a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
OPINION
In our opinion
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group as at 31 December 2002 and of the loss of the
group for the year then ended
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA
ANNUAL REPORT 2002
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
The directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002.
ACTIVITIES, BUSINESS REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENT
During 2002 the group’s principal activities were in the areas of market research, news distribution and professional media. The current activities of the
group are described in more detail on pages 6 to 13. The financial review on pages 14 and 15 contains details of the performance of the group and its
divisions during the year, and the operating review on pages 8 to 13 gives an indication of future developments.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR AND DIVIDENDS
The results for the year are set out in the group profit and loss account on page 33. After accounting for dividends totalling £24.2m (including the
proposed dividend of £13.5m and an accrued LIBOR related B share dividend of £0.6m), the balance to be transferred from reserves is £263.2m. The
directors recommend a final dividend of 4 pence per share for the year ended 31 December 2002 to be paid on 29 May 2003 to those shareholders on the
register on 14 March 2003. An interim dividend of 3 pence per share was paid on 24 October 2002, making a total for the year of 7 pence (2001: 12

A dividend of 8.77 pence per B share will be paid on 24 April 2003 to holders of B shares on the register on 14 March 2003.

1 November 2003. Adair Turner does not have a service contract. Adair Turner and Geoff Unwin are considered by the company to be independent.
The interests of the directors in office at 31 December 2002 in the shares of the company and its subsidiary undertakings are set out in the directors’
remuneration report on pages 18 to 26.
No director had a material interest in any contract other than a service contract with the company or any subsidiary at any time during the year.
CHANGES IN SHARE CAPITAL
The issued share capital of the company at 1 January 2002 was 335,005,854 ordinary shares of 25 pence each, 10,480,642 B shares of 8 23/44 pence each, and
132,484,195 deferred shares of 8 23/44 pence each. The ordinary shares and B shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The deferred shares are unlisted.
During the year 555,040 ordinary shares were issued in connection with the exercise of options under the company’s share option schemes, of which
300,000 were issued to the Qualifying Employee Share Trust to satisfy the exercise of options under the United SAYE Scheme and MAI Sharesave Scheme.
2,118 ordinary shares were issued on conversion of the company’s 6.125 per cent convertible bonds and a further 52,341 ordinary shares were issued to Sir
Ronald Hampel on his resignation from the board. In accordance with a resolution passed at the annual general meeting held on 2 May 2002, the
outstanding 132,484,195 deferred shares were purchased by the company for an aggregate price of one penny and were cancelled under the provisions of
the Companies Act. The company also repurchased a further 2,934,255 B shares with a nominal value of £0.2m for consideration of £7.2m and cancelled
them under the provisions of the Companies Act.
The issued share capital of the company at 31 December 2002 was 335,615,353 ordinary shares of 25 pence each and 7,546,387 B shares of 8 23/44 pence each.
At the annual general meeting held on 2 May 2002, shareholders authorised the company to purchase up to 33,505,797 ordinary shares and up to
10,480,642 B shares. These authorities were still valid at 31 December 2002 and will expire at the conclusion of the annual general meeting to be held on
15 May 2003. Resolutions to renew them will be put to shareholders at that meeting.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
During 2002 the company continued to implement the longer term initiatives established in 2001 to reward, retain and develop its employees, and sought
opportunities to benchmark itself against industry best practice.
Where possible, subsidiaries continued to support and develop the principles of flexible working as it has been demonstrated that employees value highly
ways to help balance home and work priorities more effectively. These initiatives include in particular the increased use of homeworking, which helps to
rationalise the use of office accommodation.
The online corporate voluntary benefits programme for employees launched in 2001 continued to ensure that employees had access to a wide variety of
benefits and services to maximise their spending power.
All divisions continued to make management development a priority in 2002. A range of customised training solutions were offered at local level in order to
underpin retention of staff initiatives and ensure managerial skills were developed to meet new business requirements and cope with the difficult trading conditions.
Progress continues to be made in furthering the company’s commitment to diversity, which is championed at board level. Diversity forums were set up in 2002
in the US and UK to develop targeted initiatives aimed at recognising and valuing the diversity of the group’s employees and creating a supportive and highly
productive working environment for all. The company continued its membership of Opportunity Now to benchmark progress and take stock of best practice.
Employees throughout the group receive regular updates on corporate performance, business objectives and development through various formal and
informal channels of communication, including local intranet sites and group meetings. A series of web chats were held during the year to allow employees
from across the group a real time opportunity to provide feedback to and ask questions of divisional and board level executives. Good use of divisional staff
consultative forums was also made to ensure employees received timely communication on relevant issues.
Selection of employees is determined on their aptitude, skills and ability that are relevant to the job. Should an employee become disabled during their
employment, efforts are made to enable them to continue their career where possible, including appropriate re-training. 31
UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA
ANNUAL REPORT 2002
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The company actively supports corporate social responsibility. It has developed and introduced a range of modern employer, community involvement and
product integrity programmes right across the group.
The board has adopted a statement of business principles which is published on the company’s website and which outlines its core values in dealing with its
principal stakeholders. These principles provide a framework within which the various divisions around the group have developed their own codes of
conduct to enable them to prioritise those issues that are of key concern to their specific business.
In each of the group’s market places, the integrity of the product or service offered is of paramount importance. Product performance is regularly measured and
often publicly reported, as in the case of CMP Media’s US publishing statistics. Businesses strive to improve their service to customers by the development and
implementation of customer relationship management tools and measure their impact in this area by the use of customer satisfaction surveys.
The company seeks to maximise shareholder value by insisting on the highest standards of financial management, assessment of risk and control. This is
achieved by means of detailed financial plans and procedures, setting clear performance targets and monitoring progress against them. Acquisitions are
subject to rigorous investment targets which are designed to improve shareholder value and are benchmarked against alternative uses of capital. Financial
reporting procedures are designed to ensure transparency and clarity of financial information.
The company pursues employment practices which are designed to assist its employees in achieving an appropriate work/life balance. Work place
discrimination or harassment is not tolerated and procedures are in place to support these policies.
The company recognises that it has a role to play in supporting the community which is undertaken both by means of cash donations and by encouraging
employees to provide their services as volunteers and facilitating their involvement in their local communities.
As part of the group’s risk mapping process, which is described in more detail on page 28, companies within the group assess the risks attaching to the failure
to implement social, ethical and environmental policies. These risks are considered by the board twice a year as part of its examination of the overall risk
maps.
Due to the nature of its businesses, the group does not have a high environmental impact. Its principal impact arises from energy consumption, which the
company continues to monitor and to set reduction targets where practicable. Overall energy consumption levels are expected to continue to decrease
during 2003 both as a result of targeted reductions and as a consequence of the ongoing rationalisation of the group’s property portfolio. Many of the
group’s business practices tend to support environmental good practice, for example the increasing use of new technology such as the internet to facilitate
data collection within its market research businesses has led to reduced demand for paper resources.
The company continues to review and develop its reporting on relevant CSR issues and will provide periodic updates about these on its website.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors are required by the Companies Act to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the company and the group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.
The directors confirm that in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002 the group has used appropriate accounting policies,
consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, for safeguarding the assets of the company and of the group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The financial statements are also published on the United Business Media website; the maintenance and integrity of the website is the responsibility of the
directors. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and the dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
DONATIONS
In 2002 the group donated £232,000 to charitable organisations (2001: £316,000). The group made no political donations during 2002 (2001: nil). At the
annual general meeting held on 2 May 2002 shareholders approved a resolution allowing the company to make EU political donations and expenditure (as
defined in the Companies Act) totalling in aggregate up to £100,000. This approval was sought as a precautionary measure in view of the broad definition
of this term, and no such expenditure or donations were made during the year. A similar resolution will be proposed at the annual general meeting to be
held on 15 May 2003. 32

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards in the United
Kingdom. With the exception of the matters referred to below, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with prior years.
In preparing the financial statements for the current year, the group has adopted FRS 19 “Deferred Tax” which has resulted in a change of accounting policy
for deferred tax. The implementation of the standard has had no material impact on the results or balance sheet of the group and accordingly, no prior year
adjustment is required.
The group has adopted FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits” in these financial statements. The adoption of this standard represents a change in accounting policy
and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly. Details of the effect of adopting FRS 17 are given in note 25.
CONSOLIDATION
The financial statements include the financial statements of the company and all its subsidiaries, made up to 31 December, or within one week of that date,
together with the group’s share of the results for the year and of the book values of the net assets and attributable goodwill of joint ventures and associates.
The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures and associates acquired or sold during the year are included from or to the effective date of acquisition or
disposal.
TURNOVER
Turnover, which is stated net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, is recognised as follows:
Publishing: advertising revenue is recognised on issue of the publication.
Exhibitions: revenue is recognised when the show has been completed. Deposits received in advance are recorded as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Market research: revenue is recognised on a completed contract basis. Work in progress amounts are recorded in the balance sheet at cost. Syndicated
revenues are recognised on completion and any subsequent sales are recognised as they arise.
News distribution: revenue is recognised on message delivery.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Purchased goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which the directors view as being
a period generally between six and twenty years based on the nature, age and stability of the industry in which the business operates. Where a business is
sold, or where goodwill is considered to have been impaired, the net book value of goodwill or the amount of impaired goodwill, as applicable, is charged
through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal or through operating profit in the year of impairment.
Impairment reviews are carried out at the end of the first full financial year after acquisition and on the occurrence of any event or change in circumstances
indicating that there may have been a decline in the carrying value or change in useful life.
Following the impairment review in 2001, a reappraisal of estimated useful lives adopted for goodwill and intangible assets has been undertaken. As a result,
the estimated useful lives of the goodwill relating to certain businesses have been reduced. The impact of this revision has been to increase the amortisation
charge for the year by £34m.
Other intangible assets comprise certain product rights including licences and related costs, which are amortised over the shorter of their useful lives or the
licence period; and publishing rights and titles and purchased Internet domain names and websites, which are amortised on a straight line basis over their
estimated useful lives, not exceeding two years.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATION
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets except freehold land. Depreciation rates are calculated so that
assets are written down to residual value in equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, which are as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property 10-70 years
Short leasehold property Term of lease
General plant, machinery and equipment 5-20 years
Computer equipment 3 years
Motor vehicles 3-5 years
Software costs are written off as incurred, except for purchases from third parties in respect of major systems. In such cases, the costs are written off over
the expected useful life of the asset, not exceeding five years from the date of implementation of the software.
STOCKS
Stocks and work in progress are valued on the first in first out basis at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises materials, direct labour and
a proportion of attributable production and other overheads.
OPERATING LEASES
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as they arise.
INVESTMENTS
Listed and unlisted investments are stated at the lower of cost and market value or directors’ valuation. Investments in subsidiaries included in the
company’s balance sheet are stated at cost or nominal value of shares issued where merger relief is taken, less any provision for impairment. Investments in
companies where the group both has a participating interest and exercises significant influence over the entity’s financial and operating policies (through
board representation and participation in financial and operating policy decisions) are included as associates under the equity method of accounting. 38
UNITED BUSINESS MEDIA
ANNUAL REPORT 2002
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
INVESTMENTS (continued)
Similarly, investments in companies where the group holds a long-term interest that arises as a result of a contractual arrangement and is jointly controlled
by the group and other venturers are included as joint ventures under the gross equity method of accounting. The figures included in the financial
statements are based on audited accounts, adjusted where necessary by reference to management accounts for the period up to 31 December. Where the
accounting policies of associates and/or joint ventures do not conform in all material respects to those of the group, adjustments are made on consolidation.
DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events
have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions:
•Provision is made for taxable gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets that have been rolled over into
replacement assets, only to the extent that there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on
the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets
and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold;
•Provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to
the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable; and
• Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits
from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period on which timing differences reverse, based on
tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the balance sheet. The
trading results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at an average of the exchange rates ruling for the year. Differences arising on
the retranslation of investments, including goodwill, in foreign subsidiary undertakings and related net foreign currency borrowings, and from the
translation of the results of those undertakings at average rate, are taken to reserves, and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
PENSION COSTS
The group sponsors a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes. The group has adopted FRS17 “Retirement Benefits” in the
financial statements, and this has been treated as a change in accounting policy and resulted in an adjustment of the prior year financial statements as
described in note 25. For the defined contribution schemes, the profit and loss charge represents the contributions payable to the scheme during the
accounting period. The assets of the defined benefit pension schemes are measured at their market value at the balance sheet date and the liabilities of
those schemes are measured using the projected unit method. The discount rate used is the current rate of return on a AA corporate bond of equivalent
term and currency to the liabilities. The extent to which the schemes’ assets exceed/fall short of their liabilities is shown as a surplus/deficit in the balance
sheet to the extent that a surplus is recoverable by the group or that a deficit represents an obligation of the group.
The following is charged to operating profit:
• the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities arising from employee service in the current period
• the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities as a result of benefit improvements over the period during which such improvements vest.
• gains and losses arising on settlements/curtailments
A credit in respect of the expected return on the schemes’ assets and a charge in respect of the increase during the period in the present value of the
schemes’ liabilities because the benefits are one period closer to settlement are included in other finance income. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised
in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The group currently uses several types of financial instruments as part of an overall risk management strategy. It does not enter into financial instruments for
speculative purposes. The accounting treatment adopted depends upon the risk that is being hedged. Interest rate risk associated with net debt is managed
centrally by using fixed rate borrowings and financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. Interest differentials under interest rate swaps, forward rate
agreements, caps and collars are recognised by adjustment of the underlying interest receivable or payable over the term of the agreement and as such are
accrued to the profit and loss account on a time apportioned basis. To mitigate the effect of currency translation risks relating to foreign currency
denominated net assets, the group uses foreign currency borrowings where appropriate to provide an economic hedge. Gains and losses arising on overseas
net assets and the financial instruments used to hedge the associated currency risks are taken to reserves and are reported in the statement of total
recognised gains and losses (see “Foreign currencies” above). Currency net transaction risks on monetary assets and liabilities and forecast trading flows of
the group are hedged in all material respects as they arise, generally using forward foreign exchange contracts. Any gains or losses arising on such
arrangements are deferred and recognised in operating profit or as adjustments to carrying amount when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in
the group’s financial statements upon maturity of the contract. The forward premium or discount for these contracts is not accounted for as interest but as
part of the hedge achieved. If underlying forecast flows do not materialise as envisaged, the hedges are either reversed or swapped forward to a future
financing period. The adjusting hedges are then accounted for through the profit and loss account to match the revised underlying exposure being hedged.
Currency options may be purchased to hedge forecast trading flows. These are accounted for in the same manner as the forward foreign exchange
contracts above except that the premium paid is deferred to the point of exercise or lapse of the option. Further information on the accounting policy for
financial instruments can be found in note 22. 39

appointed as auditors to the group with effect from 2002. The auditors’ remuneration shown above for 2002 represents fees payable to Ernst & Young; the
auditors’ remuneration for 2001 represents fees payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the previous auditors.
Non-audit fees paid to Ernst and Young in the year totalled £0.1m, principally relating to taxation services.
Non-audit fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2001 totalled £4.0m, including £0.3m charged as exceptional items relating to the Group Process Review
and £3.7m in respect of taxation services and support to other corporate activity.
The Audit Committee has established policy guidelines on the nature of non-audit work which may be undertaken by the auditors. These guidelines identify
a number of categories of work where the auditors will not be employed, including financial due diligence assignments on potential acquisitions and
financial systems consultancy. The Audit Committee has also put in place procedures for the pre-approval of any fees payable to the auditors for those non-
audit services which fall within the policy guidelines.
Professional firms are selected to provide advisory services on the basis of their relevant experience and expertise. For major projects, it is the group’s policy
to undertake a competitive tendering process. In certain circumstances, for example for reasons of confidentiality or knowledge of the group’s businesses
and structures, it is appropriate to employ the group’s auditors to provide such services without a competitive tender being undertaken.

(a) The Group Process Review was a programme that aimed to achieve operating efficiencies through re-engineering of systems and processes within the
business. All remaining projects were completed during 2001.
(b) Other restructuring costs in 2002 relate to additional provisions for vacant properties. In 2001 it included vacant property provisions and redundancy
costs which resulted from the restructuring and other cost reduction and business re-engineering programmes in 2001. Restructuring costs in 2001 have
been restated to take account of FRS 17 adjustments for curtailment credits of £4.9m arising from these redundancies.
(c) In accordance with the requirements of FRS 11 “Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill”, the directors have considered the carrying value of the
group’s purchased goodwill, and, in the light of market conditions, made a provision for impairment. In determining the amount of the impairment,
which was calculated on a net realisable value basis, the directors considered a number of factors, including the current and prospective revenues,
earnings and cash flows from the businesses.
(d) During the period, UBM settled an outstanding claim relating to the planned merger with Carlton Communications plc in 2000 and the subsequent sale
of the group’s television business. The exceptional cost of this claim to the group, net of associated receipts amounted to £14.0m, all or which has been
reflected in the cash flow statement.
(e) Loss on sale or closure of businesses in 2001 included the loss on sale or closure of a number of UK online based business to business and business to
consumer activities and included goodwill and investment write downs together with provisions for planned future closures and disposals. Of the loss on
sale or closure, £32.9m related to continuing operations and £18.6m related to discontinued businesses. The analysis by business segment is: £47.0m –

Earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items are presented as the directors consider that this presents a meaningful
measure of the performance of the group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The
group has three categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average
market price of the company’s ordinary shares during the year, those shares which may be issued under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and shares
attributable to convertible debt. No adjustment has been made for the dilutive impact in 2002 as this would decrease reported loss per share. The impact
of dilutive securities in 2002 would be to decrease the loss by £4.1m for convertible debt (2001: £7.6m) and to increase weighted average shares by 0.7m
shares for employee share options (2001: 1.2m) and 43.1m shares for convertible debt (2001: 23.7m).

Significant investments
The unaudited financial statements of Channel 5 Television Group Limited for the year ended 31 December 2002 show aggregate capital and reserves of
£(495.2)m (2001: £(468.0)m) and a loss for the financial year of £(27.2)m (2001: £(89.1)m).
Employee Share Ownership Plan
An Employee Share Ownership Plan (the “United ESOP”) was established by the company on 24 June 1996. MAI already had an Employee Share Ownership
Plan established in 1989 (the “MAIESOP”). The United ESOP has purchased in the open market, or has received from the MAIESOP, or has been granted
options over, United shares which are held on trust for employees participating in the plans listed below. The purchase of shares in the open market is
financed through bonuses sacrificed by senior executives under the terms of the Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan (“SEEPP”) and contributions in
cash by the company to finance the acquisition of the matching element of such bonuses.
Dividends on the shares held by the United ESOP have been waived. The costs of running these schemes have been included in the profit and loss account.
Qualifying Employee Share Trust
In January 1998 a Qualifying Employee Share Trust (“the QUEST”) was established for the purpose of satisfying exercises of options under the MAI Sharesave
Scheme and the United SAYE Share Option Scheme. A new company, United QUEST Trustee Limited, was incorporated for the purposes of administering the
QUEST. On 28 January 1998, the company issued 3,579,947 shares to the QUEST for a total consideration of £25,732,629, equal to 719 pence per share,
the mid-market price at the close of business on 28 January 1998.
On 17 March 2000, the company issued 500,185 shares to the QUEST for a total consideration of £4,321,600 equal to 869 pence per share, the mid-market
price at the close of business on 17 March 2000. On 18 May 2001, the company issued 100,000 shares to the QUEST for a total consideration of £727,000
equal to 727 pence per share, the mid-market price at the close of business on 18 May 2001. On 20 March 2002, the company issued 300,000 shares to
the QUEST for a total consideration of £1,752,000 equal to 584 pence per share, the mid-market price at the close of business on 20 March 2002.

conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised by the board and are subject to internal control procedures. The objective of the
framework is to provide flexibility whilst minimising risk and prohibiting speculative transactions or positions to be taken. Further detail on policies for
managing funding requirements, investment of surplus funds and management of risks can be found with the Financial Review.

Non-equity shares of £0.6m (2001: £12.2m) have been excluded from the above tables as they have no fixed maturity date.
In 2002, the effect of the group’s interest rate swaps was to classify as floating rate in the above table all £77.6m of 2004 fixed rate Private Placements
and £90.1m of the outstanding £147.7m 2004 fixed rate US loan notes. This debt has been swapped into 6 month US dollar LIBOR plus an average of
2.5 per cent to the maturity date of the debt. In addition, the group had interest rate swaps to classify as floating rate in the above table of £108.7m of
the outstanding £113.1m 2009 US loan notes. The loan notes have been swapped into 6 month dollar LIBOR plus an average of 1.89 per cent to the
maturity date of the debt. The counter parties have an option to cancel the swaps every six months (first option on £46.6m is 1 July 2003, first option
on £62.1m is 1 Jan 2004).
Other floating rate financial liabilities comprise of borrowings which bear interest at rates based on LIBOR minus a margin for each relevant currency for
periods between one and six months; and the company’s non-equity shares which pay a dividend equal to 75 per cent of 12 month sterling LIBOR.
The total financial liabilities include £13.3m of other creditors falling due after more than one year (2001: £17.0m), the pensions deficit of £90.9m
(2001: £41.0m) with maturity of greater than five years, £55.3m of vacant property provisions (2001: £37.8m) with an average maturity of 3.7 years and
£0.6m of non-equity shareholding comprising of B shares outstanding (2001: £12.2m).
Sterling financial liabilities, on which no interest is paid, have a maturity of greater than five years (2001 between one and five years). US dollar financial
liabilities, on which no interest is paid, have a weighted average period until maturity of 2.3 years (2001: 3.3 years).

(b)Financial Assets (continued)
The group’s two US dollar senior unsecured loan notes carry interest rates that are significantly in excess of market rates. As stated in the Financial
Review the group has redeemed $75m of these bonds early in order to reduce the group’s net interest exposure. To achieve a higher level of redemption
without making a significant early redemption payment, the group has entered into the following transactions that have a similar economic effect to
redeeming the bonds.
In 2002, the group has purchased US$205m of credit linked notes from a number of counterparties, these notes having similar maturities to the US
dollar loan notes. The notes pay interest at an average rate of LIBOR plus 267 basis points per annum. $120m of these variable flows have then been
swapped into fixed rate flows of between 6.86 per cent and 8.1 per cent per annum as a hedge against the 7.25 per cent and 7.75 per cent per annum
fixed coupon payments on the US dollar loan notes.
In return for paying interest on the credit linked notes at rates in excess of LIBOR the final redemption to be received by the company is determined by
certain circumstances related to the credit risk of the company. These circumstances arise if there has been a “credit event” as defined in the terms of the
note, in which case the counterparties may redeem the notes at less than par value. A credit event arises in the event of any of the following
circumstances:
•a bankruptcy of the company;
• if the group is required by any of its lenders to accelerate repayment of borrowings; 
• if the group fails to make payment under any of its borrowings; 
• if the group restructures any of its borrowings in order to avoid default;
• if any of its borrowings are repudiated, disaffirmed or rejected or subject to any moratorium.
If a credit event should take place, the credit linked note may not necessarily be redeemed for cash. The company may receive its own bonds or debt
obligations with a par value equivalent to the amount of the credit linked notes from the counterparties in settlement of redemption of the note.

The effect of the group’s swaps was to classify £50m of floating rate cash in the above tables as fixed rate at a rate of 5.0 per cent and £75.8m of
floating rate credit linked notes in the above tables to fixed rate at an average of 7.4 per cent.
Non-interest bearing financial assets comprise other fixed asset investments for which there is no maturity.
(c)Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The following tables provide a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the group’s financial assets and financial liabilities
at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001. The fair value of US dollar private placements (included in long-term borrowings) was calculated by
discounting expected future cash flows at risk adjusted interest rates. Market values obtained from third parties have been used to determine the fair
value of interest rate swaps, credit linked notes, forward foreign exchange contracts, the fixed rate convertible bonds and the US dollar senior loan. The
fair value of cash at bank and deposits approximates to their book value due to their short maturity. Listed investments are valued at market value. For all
other financial assets and liabilities the carrying amount has been used.

(d) Hedges
The group’s policy is to hedge interest rate risk using fixed rate borrowings and financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. Net foreign currency
transaction risks are hedged as they arise, generally using forward foreign exchange contracts, whilst foreign currency borrowings are used to provide an
economic hedge against investments in overseas territories. The group’s policy for accounting for hedges can be found in the “Group accounting
policies” section of this report.
The tables below show the extent to which the group has unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the
beginning and end of the year. All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged
transactions or positions.

The group has lease obligations in respect of the continuing costs of vacant property, the quantification of which depends upon the ability to exit the leases
early or sublet the properties, and for dilapidations on certain leasehold properties which are dependent principally on actual reinstatement costs on expiry
of the leases. The provision in respect of these obligations at 31 December 2002 has been determined following external professional advice and will be
utilised over the period of the leases in question, which range from 1 to 16 years.
The increase in the provision during the year is a result of additional reorganisation and restructuring of the group during 2002 and the consequent
reduction in the group’s overall property requirements. 60

Liabilities arising from former financial services activities
A subsidiary of the group was formerly engaged in the selling of personal pensions prior to 1996. As a result of the industry-wide review into pension
misselling by the Personal Investment Authority, the group is exposed to actual and potential future claims by investors in respect of policies found to have
been missold. Although work is now progressing with respect to the identification and review of all pension policies sold, the number and amount of such
claims can not be finally determined until all potential compensation costs have been agreed. The amount of the provisions at 31 December 2002 has been
determined on the basis of independent financial advice.

The return of capital to shareholders undertaken in 2001, took the form of a subdivision and consolidation of the existing United ordinary shares. On
23 April 2001, each of the existing 507,901,885 ordinary shares of 25 pence then in issue were sub-divided into one share of 8 23/44 pence (B Shares) and
one share of 16 21/44 pence and immediately following such sub-division every issued share of 16 21/44 pence was sub-divided into 29 shares of 25/44p.
Every 44 shares of 25/44 pence each resulting from such sub-division were then consolidated into one ordinary share of 25p. The subdivision created a class
of B shares with a total value of approximately £1.25 billion. UK shareholders had the option to sell these shares for 245 pence per share, to receive a single
dividend of 245 pence per share, or to retain the B shares and receive a continuing dividend linked to LIBOR. During the year ended 31 December 2002,
2,934,255 B shares were purchased by the company for consideration of £7.1m. Cumulatively to 31 December 2002, 367,871,303 B shares have been
purchased by the company for consideration of £901.3m. At 31 December 2002, 7,546,387 B shares remain in issue.
The B shares are irredeemable. However, the company has the authority to convert, at its option, all remaining B shares in issue after 23 April 2011, if the
number is less than 125m. The conversion into ordinary shares will be based on the market price of ordinary shares at the time of the conversion.
B Shares
B shareholders are entitled to a non-cumulative preference dividend based on the principal of 245 pence per share. The dividend is the lower of 25 per cent
per annum or 75 per cent of the 12 month LIBOR rate. On winding up, the B shareholders are entitled to 245 pence per share and the relevant proportion
of the dividends outstanding. B shareholders do not have any voting entitlements except in a resolution relating to a winding up of the company or if the
B share dividend has been outstanding for more than six months. B shares are therefore regarded as non-equity shares.
Deferred Shares
Deferred shareholders may receive a dividend only after B share dividends and an ordinary dividend of a minimum of £50.0 per share has been paid.
On winding up, the Deferred shareholders are entitled to receive repayment up to the nominal value if there are sufficient funds available after paying the
B shareholders 245 pence and any proportion of the preference dividend owing to them and paying ordinary shareholders £100,000 per share. Deferred
shareholders do not have voting entitlements. Deferred shares are therefore regarded as non-equity shares.
In accordance with a resolution passed at the annual general meeting held on 2 May 2002, the outstanding 132,484,195 deferred shares were purchased
by the company for an aggregate price of one penny and were cancelled under the provisions of the Companies Act 1985. 62

30. PENSIONS
The group has adopted FRS17 “Retirement Benefits” in these financial statements.
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas. The most recent actuarial valuations were carried out at various
dates between 5 April 2000 and 5 April 2002 and updated to 31 December 2002 by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the present value of scheme liabilities under FRS17 are:

The UK schemes are closed to new members, hence under the projected unit method, the current service cost (expressed as a percentage of salary) will
increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The group is making additional contributions to eliminate MFR deficits in the UK. Contributions are expected to be £10.9m in 2003 made up of £5.4m for
UK plans and £5.5m for US plans.

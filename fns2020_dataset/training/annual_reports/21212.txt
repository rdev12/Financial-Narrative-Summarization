2016 proved to be a turbulent 
year across the globe with 
unexpected changes occurring 
politically, economically and 
socially, and growing evidence 
of regional instability, terrorism 
and military aggression.
Against this background, governments in 
our major markets – primarily the UK, US, 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Australia 
– continue to prioritise national security 
and remain resolute in their commitment 
to defence expenditure. 
In a period of uncertainty, the Company’s 
consistently strong operational performance 
and success in growing our order backlog to 
£42.0bn were both reassuring and welcome. 
In the UK, we secured our long-term 
position on a number of major programmes 
during 2016. Manufacturing of the Royal 
Navy’s Dreadnought submarines at our 
Barrow-in-Furness facilities commenced in 
September. We secured a contract for two 
further Offshore Patrol Vessels and agreed 
heads of terms reflecting the government’s 
intention to build eight Type 26 complex 
warships at our shipyards on the Clyde 
in Scotland from the summer of 2017. 
These important commitments will provide 
the Royal Navy with state-of-the-art capabilities 
and reinforce our reputation as a world leader 
in engineering and technology. Over the next 
three decades, the programmes will secure 
high-quality employment, not only in Barrow 
and on the Clyde, but in the supply chain 
throughout the UK.
The strength of our maritime business was 
complemented in military air by long-term 
support contracts for the UK Typhoon and 
Hawk fleets, growth in production volumes for 
the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the selection 
of our UK and Australian businesses to provide 
avionics and components maintenance and 
support for the growing F-35 global fleet. 
Our US land business continues to perform 
well in the export market and rolled out 
the first prototype vehicles for two major 
land programmes – Armored Multi-Purpose 
Vehicles for the US Army and Amphibious 
Combat Vehicles for the US Marines. 
Our investment in a major new dry dock 
facility at our San Diego shipyard, delivered 
in December, will underpin our continued 
position as a major supplier of ship repair 
and support services for the US Navy.
The market for electronic warfare and 
products from our Electronic Systems 
sector remained buoyant. Our cyber, 
intelligence and security capabilities remain 
in high demand in a very competitive market. 
Our US-based Intelligence & Security business 
secured a number of multi-year contracts and, 
in Applied Intelligence, whilst investment in 
future growth inhibited current profitability, 
another year of double-digit sales growth 
across government and commercial divisions 
was encouraging.
 “Another year of 
solid performance.”

 Annual Report 2016 Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
The management team is aware that, as 
the order book grows, flawless execution 
remains the priority of the day. In meeting this 
objective and delivering customer satisfaction, 
we will continue to respect the growing need 
for high-quality local employment and 
support for national industry, together with 
a keen focus on providing leading capabilities 
at a competitive cost. Our experience in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and India in particular 
has provided the Company with strong and 
proven credentials in this area which we 
believe will be increasingly important in 
securing further orders in the coming years.
Building local capability will require the 
commitment of many of our people in 
supporting the workforce in the region and 
the evidence of our skill in training others is 
visible wherever I visit our teaching centres.
In order to ensure a consistent flow of skilled 
people to meet the demand, we have continued 
to invest in the training of both apprentices 
and graduates. This year, we are training over 
2,000 apprentices in the UK – more than 
ever before.
In December, we celebrated the opening of 
a new £16m Academy for Skills & Knowledge 
adjacent to our military aircraft manufacturing 
facility at Samlesbury as further evidence of 
our commitment to building and sustaining 
the skills pipeline.
In addition, together with other leading 
engineering companies in the UK, we 
contributed to developing a National 
Productivity Improvement Plan with the 
creation of a formal educational productivity 
training programme at Lancaster University 
and sharing best practice with supply 
chain partners.
We believe that, as an international leader in 
engineering, advanced manufacturing and 
technology, we have a responsibility to ensure 
our Company and the nations we serve are 
equipped with the skills and competitive 
strength to succeed in global export markets.
Ensuring we have a continued supply of talent 
is an essential element of long-term business 
planning – as is the need to manage organised 
succession at all levels of the business. In this 
respect, since becoming Chairman, it has been 
necessary to plan for the retirement of Ian 
King who became Chief Executive over eight 
years ago.
In February 2017, we announced that Ian will 
retire from the Company on 30 June 2017, 
after a long and distinguished career of some 
40 years in the defence industry. Ian will retire 
leaving a legacy of disciplined operational 
and financial performance, ethical behaviour, 
a burgeoning order book, a track record of 
delivering shareholder value and a strong 
leadership team. When the time comes later 
this year, he will leave with our thanks and 
best wishes for the future.
The Board also announced that Charles 
Woodburn, Chief Operating Officer, will 
succeed Ian as Chief Executive with effect 
from 1 July 2017. Since joining the Company 
in May 2016, Charles has made an important 
contribution, bringing impeccable engineering 
credentials, broad international experience 
and fresh perspectives to build on our existing 
strengths. In his new role, he will build on 
an enviable inheritance to create an exciting 
future for the Group.
During the course of the year, we aimed 
to build ever stronger relationships with our 
customers, recognising that, in the defence 
sector, we are partners working together 
to protect national interests and security. 
In the US, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
and Australia, engagement with political 
and military leaders has been consistently 
constructive and positive. We continue 
to work closely with the UK government 
and have benefited from their unstinting 
support in our export activities. We have had 
considerable success in our export activities 
and in securing future opportunities – as seen 
most recently in India and Turkey. 
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remains 
an important market for the Group, where 
we work as prime contractor to the UK 
government to fulfil its obligations under 
government-to-government agreements on 
defence and security co-operation. Judicial 
Review proceedings into the process followed 
by the UK government in granting defence 
export licences to the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia are under way, with a judgment 
expected in the near future.
We are aware of the privileged position we 
enjoy in all our markets and recognise our 
responsibility in driving down costs whilst 
maintaining the highest quality standards. 
In parallel with our determination to build 
competitive strength, we have continued 
to focus our people on the importance of 
safety in what we do and the ethics of 
how we do it.
In both areas we have been pleased that our 
record in the year has demonstrated how deeply 
these principles are embedded in the corporate 
culture as the hallmarks of good business 
practice. Performance-driven, but values-led 
remains at the heart of our business model.
In keeping with many organisations, the 
changing dynamics of financial markets 
have impacted our pension fund deficit 
during the year. The mathematical impact 
of reduced bond yields and low interest rates, 
partially offset by strong asset performance, 
has increased the reported total deficit by 
approximately £1.6bn during the year. Whilst 
the position will fluctuate in keeping with 
international financial markets, our large order 
book, long-term programmes and strong 
franchise positions give confidence in our 
long-term ability to fund our pension schemes, 
capital requirements and shareholder returns.
In view of the Group’s good performance and 
future prospects, the Board has recommended 
a final dividend of 12.7p per share for a total 
of 21.3p per share for the full year, an increase 
of 2% compared to 2015. Subject to 
shareholder approval at the May 2017 Annual 
General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 
1 June 2017 to holders of ordinary shares 
registered on 21 April 2017.
We were pleased to welcome Elizabeth Corley 
as a non-executive director on 1 February 
2016. Her appointment has further 
strengthened and deepened the expertise 
and experience of our board of directors.
In summary, we have been pleased to 
deliver another year of solid performance 
with sales
1
 of £19.0bn, underlying earnings 
per share
1
 of 40.3p underpinned by an order 
backlog
1
 of £42.0bn. Our cash generation 
has continued to facilitate growth in our 
dividend to 21.3p whilst supporting our 
commitment to our pension fund and 
capital investment programme.
Looking forward, our efforts will be focused 
on the successful execution of the orders 
we have achieved whilst seeking to harvest 
the international export opportunities which 
lie ahead.
It is against this background that we look 
forward to delivering continued strong 
performance in 2017 and beyond.

 Annual Report 2016 Chief Executive’s 
review
2016 was a good year for 
BAE Systems. The Company 
has performed well despite 
economic and political 
uncertainties, delivering sales 
and order backlog growth. 
Governments in our major 
markets continue to prioritise 
defence and security with 
strong demand for our 
capabilities.
2016 performance
US
Following the two-year Bipartisan Budget 
Act signed in 2015, the defence market 
outlook in the US is improving with 
encouraging signs of a return to growth 
in defence budgets. We are also seeing 
the ramp up of production on a number 
of the Group’s long-term programmes.
Our US electronics business continued 
to perform well, with strong programme 
execution and good order intake enhancing 
positions in the high-technology areas 
of electronic warfare, electro-optics and 
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. 
As a major supplier on the F-35 Lightning II 
combat aircraft programme, including the 
electronic warfare system, we are well 
positioned on the progressive increases in 
production output planned over the coming 
years to meet the requirements of US and 
international customers.
The Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability 
System electronic warfare upgrade for US 
Air Force F-15 aircraft is progressing to its 
engineering and manufacturing development 
phase. The Advanced Precision Kill Weapon 
System (APKWS
™
) laser-guided rocket is 
experiencing growing demand and, in 
October, the US Navy awarded a three-year 
Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract 
for Full-Rate Production.
Performance in the commercial electronics 
business continued to be good and our 
all-electric and hybrid power and propulsion 
business delivered growth.
The Group’s US-based combat vehicles business 
is underpinned by the Armored Multi-Purpose 
Vehicle and M109A7 self-propelled howitzer 
contracts. The business is also experiencing 
US and international demand on amphibious 
programmes.
 “A good year for 
BAE Systems.”

 Annual Report 2016 Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
The US land business delivered good export 
order intake in the period on the back of 
contract awards on Assault Amphibious 
Vehicles to Japan, BvS10 military vehicles to 
Austria, CV90 combat vehicle upgrades for 
Sweden, and M109 and M113 upgrades to 
Brazil, and our weapon systems business was 
awarded contracts for gun systems for the 
Royal Navy Type 26 frigate. The contract for 
M777 howitzers to India under a US Foreign 
Military Sale was signed in January 2017.
FNSS, the Turkish land systems business in 
which BAE Systems holds a 49% interest, 
secured further domestic and international 
orders in the year, and the business holds 
an order book of $1.1bn (£0.9bn).
These long-term contracts, which offer 
opportunities in international markets, 
and our strong franchise in tracked vehicles 
make the land business well placed for a 
return to growth in the medium term.
BAE Systems is a leading supplier of ship 
repair services to the US Navy and continues 
to adjust its workforce and facilities to meet 
evolving demand. Our San Diego operations 
are expected to benefit from enhanced 
Asia-Pacific deployment over the mid-term, 
mitigating the anticipated reduction in activity 
in the East Coast facilities. Additional dry 
dock capacity for the San Diego operations 
became operational in February 2017.
Our US business’s commercial shipbuilding 
contracts have been challenging in the year, 
with further charges taken. Six ships have 
now been accepted and production of the 
remaining two is maturing well with delivery 
and customer acceptance expected in 2017. 
The US business has not contracted for any 
more commercial ship-build.
Whilst market conditions remain highly 
competitive and continue to evolve, our 
US-based Intelligence & Security business 
has performed well, securing good 2016 
order intake including a number of new 
multi-year service contracts.
UK
Our UK-based business continued to perform 
well, benefiting from good programme 
execution and stability in customer 
requirements following the UK Strategic 
Defence and Security Review in 2015.
Whilst the result of the 2016 EU referendum 
in the UK continues to create economic 
uncertainty, good progress has been achieved 
in implementing the Strategic Defence and 
Security Review through long-term contract 
awards and commitments.
In the air domain, Typhoon aircraft deliveries 
for the Royal Air Force and Royal Saudi Air 
Force continued alongside airframe 
sub-assembly deliveries to European partner 
nations. The Oman Typhoon programme is 
on track to commence deliveries in 2017. The 
contract to supply 28 Typhoon aircraft sets for 
the Kuwaiti Air Force is consistent with the 
medium-term production planning assumptions 
announced last year. We have received £1bn 
of order intake on this programme.
Export activity continues to be well supported 
by the UK government and, although there 
can be no certainty as to the timing of orders, 
discussions with current and prospective 
operators of the Typhoon aircraft continue 
to support the Group’s expectations for 
additional Typhoon contract awards.
Typhoon’s capabilities continue to expand, 
with the ongoing integration of the Captor 
E-Scan radar, Storm Shadow, Meteor and 
Brimstone 2 missiles, and development 
towards the Royal Air Force Centurion 
standard. A Typhoon support partnership 
arrangement, expected to be worth at least 
£2.1bn over a ten-year period, was signed 
in July.
UK-based production of rear fuselage 
assemblies for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft 
is increasing at the Group’s advanced 
manufacturing facilities with much of the 
production investment already in place to 
achieve the higher production volumes.
In November, the F-35 Joint Programme 
Office announced that it had chosen the 
UK and Australia as significant repair hubs 
for the maintenance, repair, overhaul and 
upgrade of F-35 Lightning II avionics and 
components. These repair hub assignments 
will support the growing global fleet until 
2025 after which the UK and Australia will 
undertake repairs for the European and 
Pacific fleets, respectively. BAE Systems plays 
a leading role in both the UK and Australia as 
we bring our strong track record of working 
alongside our international customers and 
industry partners to deliver innovative and 
cost-effective sustainment solutions.

We are a key partner in the development, 
manufacture, integration and sustainment 
of F-35 Lightning II, the world’s largest 
defence programme. In 2016, we cemented 
our position as part of the emerging global 
sustainment network to support the aircraft.
In the US, we are the Electronic Warfare, 
Vehicle Management Computer and Active 
Inceptor System provider. In addition, we 
are part of the Integrated Test Force team, 
providing support activities, including fleet 
management, maintenance, repair and 
overhaul, spares, software development 
and support, and training.
In the UK, we will carry out maintenance 
and upgrade services for avionics and 
aircraft components, alongside our partners, 
as a European repair hub. We are also 
delivering engineering, management and 
training facilities in preparation for the 
arrival of the aircraft in the UK.
In Australia, we will be responsible for 
airframe maintenance, repair, overhaul 
and upgrade in the South Pacific for 
F-35 Lightning II aircraft operating in the 
region from 2018. We will also provide 
maintenance, repair, overhaul and upgrade 
services for F-35 avionics and aircraft 
components working alongside our 
industry partners.

 Annual Report 2016 Chief Executive’s review 
continued
A long-term Hawk support contract in the 
UK was announced in the year and support 
was maintained to the Indian Hawk 
programme with the supply of materiel 
and engineering services.
The unmanned air systems activity benefited 
from the announcement by the UK and French 
governments of a new €2bn (£1.7bn) project 
to build unmanned combat air system 
demonstrators following a successful joint 
feasibility study.
In Turkey, following a pre-contract study phase 
between BAE Systems and Turkish Aerospace 
Industries, we have signed a heads of 
agreement to collaborate on the first design 
and development phase of an indigenous 
fifth-generation fighter jet for the Turkish Air 
Force. When on contract, this will have a value 
in excess of £100m.
In the maritime domain, submarine activity is 
increasing with the Astute and Dreadnought 
Class submarines now both in production. 
The first three Astute Class submarines are in 
operational service with the Royal Navy and 
the remaining four boats in build. 
The UK government’s commitment to the 
Dreadnought programme was endorsed 
by Parliament during the year. Funding was 
received for the continued design, initial 
manufacture of the first boat, material 
commitment and facilities investment for 
the major redevelopment of the Barrow site. 
The Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems and 
Rolls-Royce have signed a heads of terms to set 
up a Dreadnought Build Alliance documenting 
the UK government and industry’s commitment 
to the delivery of the Dreadnought Class 
submarine programme, the replacement for 
the Royal Navy’s Vanguard Class submarine 
fleet, and setting out an organisational and 
managerial structure and series of commercial 
principles necessary to deliver it.
The Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carrier 
programme progresses with assembly of the 
second ship well under way. Preparations for 
sea trials on the first of class vessel in 2017 
are maturing and activity to support entry 
into service is expanding.
In preparation for the manufacturing 
phase, an extension to the Type 26 frigate 
demonstration phase contract was secured 
in March and, under a heads of terms signed 
in November, BAE Systems and the Ministry 
of Defence reached agreement on the 
intention to build eight Type 26 ships on the 
Clyde, with a cut-steel date in summer 2017. 
Two additional River Class Offshore Patrol 
Vessels were also contracted for in December. 
Build of the first three Offshore Patrol Vessels 
is progressing well, with sea trials for the first 
ship planned in the second quarter of 2017.
International
In the 50th year of its presence in Saudi 
Arabia, BAE Systems continues to address 
current and potential new requirements as 
part of the long-standing agreements between 
the UK government and the Kingdom. Our 
In-Kingdom Industrial Participation programme 
also continues apace.
An agreement has been reached with the 
Saudi Arabian government for BAE Systems 
to continue to provide support services to 
the Royal Saudi Air Force and Royal Saudi 
Naval Forces under the Saudi British Defence 
Co-operation Programme for a further 
five years.
On the Salam Typhoon programme, the 
remaining four of the contracted 72 aircraft 
will be delivered in 2017. Deliveries have 
commenced under the Hawk aircraft 
contract signed in 2012. The Royal Saudi 
Air Force has achieved high utilisation and 
aircraft availability across its Typhoon, 
Tornado and training aircraft fleets.
In Australia, the business is stable. The 
rationalisation of the Williamstown shipbuilding 
facility and cost-reduction actions taken across 
the wider business in 2015 are complete. 
Long-term sustainment and upgrade contracts 
were received for the Anzac Class frigates and 
F-35 Lightning II aircraft.

BAE Systems has entered into a heads 
of terms with the UK Ministry of Defence 
and Rolls-Royce to develop an alliance 
to deliver the UK’s four new ballistic 
missile-carrying submarines. Such an 
alliance structure would draw on best 
practice between government and 
industry, with the aim of driving 
continuous improvement, efficiencies 
and programme performance.
Following £1.3bn of funding from the 
UK government, we started production 
on the first Dreadnought Class submarine, 
Dreadnought, in September. The 
programme already employs more than 
2,600 people across the Ministry of 
Defence and industry, including 1,800 
at BAE Systems, and to date we have 
worked with more than 100 suppliers, 
with 85% based in the UK.
In India, BAE Systems has a long-standing 
relationship with Hindustan Aeronautics 
Limited (HAL). Delivery of the second batch 
of HAL-built Hawk aircraft was completed in 
the year and an order for a further batch from 
the Indian Air Force is being negotiated.
In November, the US and Indian governments 
signed a Letter of Agreement for the Foreign 
Military Sale of 145 M777 lightweight 
howitzers and, in January 2017, we received 
the $542m (£439m) contract from the US 
government to supply these howitzers to 
the Indian Army. As previously announced, 
Mahindra & Mahindra will be our supplier 
to establish an assembly, integration and 
test facility in India as further support for 
the ‘Make in India’ initiative.
The MBDA joint venture won significant 
order intake on air, maritime and land 
platforms in the year, including a number 
of contracts supporting the UK’s complex 
weapons requirements and significant 
export awards. Building on its already 
large order book, good growth in MBDA 
is expected over the medium term.

Cyber security
Applied Intelligence achieved double-digit 
order intake and sales growth. Ongoing 
investment in engineering capabilities, 
product development and marketing costs, 
all expensed, continues to support the future 
growth profile for the business.
Cyber security is becoming an important part 
of government security and a core element of 
stewardship for commercial enterprises.
Balance sheet and capital allocation
The Group’s balance sheet is managed 
conservatively in line with its policy to retain its 
investment grade credit rating and to ensure 
operating flexibility. Consistent with this 
approach, the Group expects to continue to 
meet its pension obligations, invest in research 
and technology and other organic investment 
opportunities, and plans to pay dividends in 
line with its policy of long-term sustainable 
cover of around two times underlying earnings 
and to make accelerated returns of capital to 
shareholders when the balance sheet allows. 
Investment in value-enhancing acquisitions 
will be considered where market conditions 
are right and where they deliver on the 
Group’s strategy.
Pension schemes
The Group’s share of the pre-tax accounting 
net pension deficit has increased by £1.6bn 
from 31 December 2015 to £6.1bn mainly 
reflecting an increase in liabilities due to a 
1.2 percentage point reduction in the real 
discount rate to −0.5% in the UK, partly 
offset by returns on scheme assets.
The next UK triennial funding reviews will 
commence in April 2017 and, in conjunction 
with the trustees of the schemes and other 
stakeholders, the Group will be looking 
at various options with a focus on the 
longer-term view.
Responsible business 
We continue to build a culture where 
our senior leaders and employees are 
empowered to make the right decisions 
and to know where to go for help. During 
2016, we rolled out further ethics training 
across the Group to support employees.
The safety of our employees, and anybody 
who works on, or visits, our sites, remains 
a key priority. We provide training and tools 
to employees to help them understand the 
importance of a safe workplace. There was 
a 21% reduction in the Recordable Accident 
Rate in 2016, representing an improvement 
against target. In addition, there was a 26% 
reduction in the total number of major injuries 
recorded in the year as we continued to focus 
on reducing risk and embedding safety culture 
to drive improvement.
Attracting and retaining talented employees 
helps us to sustain our competitive edge. 
We encourage our employees to reach their 
full potential within a diverse and inclusive 
work environment. We have programmes in 
place across the business to support strategic 
workforce planning, career development 
and retention, as well as to improve diversity 
and inclusion.
Summary
Our business benefits from a large order 
backlog, with established positions on 
long-term programmes in the US, UK, 
Saudi Arabia and Australia. Our clear and 
well-defined strategy has guided us through 
a period of difficult market conditions. 
As the overall business environment in 
our major markets improves and through 
execution of our strategy, we are well 
placed to maximise opportunities, deal with 
the challenges and continue to generate 
attractive shareholder returns.

Our markets
BAE Systems is the third 
largest global defence 
company.
Supporting our customers
Our strategy focuses on developing our 
core franchises in defence platforms and 
services to support customers in our principal 
markets – the US, UK, Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia and Australia. These are countries 
that are recognised as having a continued 
and sustained commitment to defence and 
security, and where we have established 
long-term customer relationships. We play a 
key role in these markets and are recognised 
as being a significant contributor to their 
defence industrial capabilities. 
We have a strong position in the US through 
our Special Security Agreement and, as the 
largest defence contractor in the UK, we have 
a unique position amongst defence players. 
Our US and UK capabilities provide us with 
the ability to leverage intellectual property 
and capabilities that support our international 
export growth.
As markets and customer requirements 
develop, BAE Systems has evolved its strategy 
recognising the importance of cyber as an 
area that is rapidly becoming a priority for 
governments and commercial organisations 
alike. Cyber is now recognised as a new 
domain in its own right alongside the 
traditional military domains of air, maritime 
and land. Our solutions and services recognise 
that cyber has no borders and requires an 
international capability to support our 
government and commercial customers 
across the globe. 
International growth aspirations 
Following a number of years of defence 
spend contraction, global defence markets 
are beginning to stabilise, with a number of 
nations returning to growth in response to an 
increasingly uncertain security environment.
As the changing future character of 
conflict continues to shape our customers’ 
requirements, we are responding to their 
needs for greater focus on technological 
advancements and greater agility. Our 
international footprint and capabilities provide 
us with the ability to deliver new solutions 
and services across geographical borders and 
across domains, as demonstrated in key 
programmes such as F-35 Lightning II 
sustainment.

 Annual Report 2016 Our markets 
continued
BAE Systems remains a 
top ten defence supplier 
in the US.
We provide products and services that span the 
air, maritime, land and cyber domains through 
our Electronic Systems, Intelligence & Security 
and Platforms & Services (US) businesses.
Whilst budgetary pressures are expected to 
continue in the US, it remains the single largest 
defence market in the world by some margin. 
Operating under a Continuing Resolution 
through the spring of 2017, defence spending 
is expected to stay at levels above the Budget 
Control Act caps through the September 
close of the 2017 fiscal year, with potential 
upside if the new administration is able to 
secure additional Department of Defense 
budget and appropriations legislation to 
support President Trump’s campaign 
promises to build up the US military.
The US-based business has strong, 
long-standing market positions and capabilities 
in electronic warfare systems, advanced 
avionics, precision-guided munitions, 
next-generation IT and intelligence analysis, 
combat vehicles, naval guns, and naval ship 
repair and modernisation services.
In addition to our position on some of the 
premier defence programmes in the US, a 
significant portion of the US-based portfolio 
is focused on Foreign Military Sales and direct 
international sales opportunities to key allied 
nations. These activities and pursuits include 
avionics, engine and flight controls, and cabin 
systems for the commercial aviation market, 
electric drive propulsion systems in the 
international bus transit market and export 
sales, such as those for defence electronics, 
combat and amphibious vehicles and, most 
recently, the M777 lightweight howitzer.
BAE Systems is the largest 
defence company in the 
UK, with strong and enduring 
relationships with the Ministry 
of Defence.
We hold key positions in providing equipment 
and services to the UK armed forces across 
air, maritime, land and cyber. In turn, the UK 
government plays a crucial role in supporting 
our export ambitions, recognising the benefit 
exports can bring to the UK economy.
The 2015 Strategic Defence and Security 
Review set out the UK’s strategic ambitions. 
The subsequent Spending Review in 2015 
outlined a 3.1% real-term increase to the 
defence budget by 2020 as part of the 
commitment to spend 2% of Gross Domestic 
Product on defence. The government has 
taken substantial steps in 2016 towards 
these plans, with the commitment to eight 
Type 26 frigates, a contract awarded for 
two additional Offshore Patrol Vessels and 
parliamentary approval given to maintain 
the Continuous-At-Sea Deterrent with a 
new class of four submarines, named the 
Dreadnought Class.
Commitment has been made to the UK’s 
cyber security capabilities, with the launch 
of the National Cyber Security Strategy 
2016–2021. This sets out the government’s

Saudi Arabia
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
is the third largest accessible 
defence market globally as 
ongoing regional challenges 
continue to drive a strong 
defence agenda. 
Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, launched in 
April, to diversify revenues away from oil, 
identifies the defence industry as an area 
for reform to build Saudi Arabia’s industrial 
capability through direct investments and 
strategic partnerships. 
Through the reorganisation of the Group’s 
portfolio of interests in a number of industrial 
companies, we continue to support the 
Saudi National Objectives, identified in the 
Saudi government’s Vision 2030, of local skills 
and technology development, increasing 
employment, and developing an indigenous 
defence industry.
We remain the prime contractor for the Saudi 
British Defence Co-operation Programme 
and the Salam Typhoon programme between 
the Saudi and UK governments in support 
of defence platforms and training systems 
for the Royal Saudi Air Force and Royal Saudi 
Naval Forces. These programmes commit us 
to support the Saudi National Objectives 
through strong, enduring partnerships 
providing significant collaboration and 
transfer of expertise to Saudi industry and 
the Kingdom’s nationals.
Australia 
BAE Systems remains 
the largest defence 
company in Australia, 
with activities across air, 
maritime, land and cyber.
Continued regional instability in the 
Asia-Pacific region is focusing the Australian 
government on strengthening and modernising 
its armed forces. Re-commitment to meeting 
the defence funding target of 2% by 2020/21 
was outlined in the Australian Defence White 
Paper and Integrated Investment Plan during 
2016. The Defence White Paper also outlined 
the Australian government’s continued 
commitment to shipbuilding and support 
in Australia, a key sector for BAE Systems.
We remain well positioned to support 
government plans through participation in 
key programmes across air, maritime, land 
and cyber domains that currently include 
programmes such as Hawk Lead-In Fighter 
sustainment and Anzac frigate support 
and upgrade.
Other international markets
Outside of our principal 
markets, we have many 
long-standing and well-
established relationships.
We have customers in more than 100 
countries. Our international activities include 
the majority of the Group’s products and 
services portfolio, from combat aircraft to 
armoured vehicles and from electronic 
systems to cyber security.
As growth in international defence spending 
in regions such as Asia and the Middle East 
grows faster than the more mature markets 
of the US and UK, we have built strong local 
relationships working both directly with 
governments and partnering with local industry.
We continue to build on our relationship with 
Oman, with Typhoon and Hawk deliveries due 
to begin in 2017 and, in India, we are building 
on our strong relationship with Hindustan 
Aeronautics Limited and a more recent 
relationship with Mahindra & Mahindra. 
Our footprint is growing in Turkey in the 
tracked and wheeled armoured combat 
vehicles market through our joint venture with 
FNSS. We are also collaborating with Turkish 
Aerospace Industries on the first design and 
development phase of an indigenous fifth- 
generation fighter jet for the Turkish Air Force.
We have a strong presence in Sweden through 
our BAE Systems Hägglunds tracked vehicle 
business and our weapon systems business.
We continue to develop our export business, 
including sales of Assault Amphibious Vehicles 
to the Japanese Ministry of Defence and, in 
Brazil, we are developing our presence as 
supported by a contract for 32 upgraded 
M109A5+ self-propelled howitzers awarded 
in September.
Through our shareholding in MBDA, our 
position in the missiles and missile systems 
market continues to grow in European and 
other international markets.

 Annual Report 2016 Our people
Award-winning training
Our UK apprenticeship programme was awarded 
the new Princess Royal Training Award in 2016 
for excellence in delivering skills for business 
performance. The award recognises that 
apprentices are a key element of our talent 
pipeline and are given exceptional enrichment 
activities. Our support to young unemployed 
people through work experience under The 
Prince’s Trust Movement to Work programme 
was also recognised and has led to many full-time 
roles in our business. The judges also commended 
our leadership in the engineering sector for our 
development of new standards for engineering 
and manufacturing apprenticeships.
Retaining and recruiting 
talented people from 
the widest possible talent 
pool is a key priority.
 
Diversity
Diversity encourages creativity, drives 
innovation and better equips us to solve our 
customers’ complex challenges. We are 
committed to creating an inclusive environment 
with a diverse workforce, which reflects the 
communities we work in. 
We have programmes in place across the 
business to improve diversity and inclusion, 
including unconscious bias training, mentoring 
programmes, increasing female representation 
in senior roles and lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender employee networks. In 2016, our 
Chief Executive established a global council 
on diversity and inclusion to progress strategic 
workforce planning across the business.
In 2017, we will commence gender pay gap 
reporting in accordance with the UK’s 
legislative requirements, including a narrative 
to explain the actions we are taking to address 
gender diversity within our UK workforce.
Development
We want to enable every employee to 
reach their full potential and feel rewarded 
for what they do. We support this through 
our comprehensive career frameworks, 
development programmes and the breadth 
of our operations around the world. 
In some markets, there is a shortage of 
qualified engineering and technology skills. 
We are encouraging more young people 
to consider careers in Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) to fill 
this gap and support our future growth, and 
have a number of initiatives to support the 
promotion of STEM subjects and careers for 
young people in our markets.
Our apprenticeship and graduate programmes 
aim to attract top engineering talent into our 
business. In the UK, we are one of the biggest 
recruiters of apprentices and our training 
programme was rated ‘outstanding’ by the 
Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted). 
During 2016, we recruited 667 apprentices 
and higher-level apprentices, and 289 
graduates in the UK. At 31 December 2016, 
we had over 2,000 apprentices in training 
across our UK business, 6% of the workforce.
Our focus on professional development 
throughout our employees’ careers supports 
their continued personal and professional 
growth, and ensures that we have the 
skills to meet our customers’ current and 
future requirements. 
Reward
We provide our employees with competitive 
reward packages which reflect their individual 
responsibilities and contribution to business 
performance, and we recognise individual and 
team successes. Employees are offered a range 
of benefits, including employee share schemes, 
throughout their careers with the Company.
Engagement
Employee engagement enables our employees 
to contribute to improving business performance 
and helps us to gauge our performance in 
creating an environment in which everyone 
can fulfil their potential.
We keep employees informed about what 
is happening across the business, including 
Company results, major business decisions 
and other matters which affect them, using 
a variety of media, including our intranet and 
e-mail, through podcasts, newsletters and 
leadership blogs, and also through team briefs 
and team meetings where we seek to listen 
to employees’ views and opinions. Employees 
have the opportunity to provide feedback 
through our engagement surveys.
The Group welcomes employees becoming 
shareholders in BAE Systems and offers 
employee share plans to support this.
We seek to maintain constructive relationships 
with our trade unions in the UK and Australia, 
and our labour unions in the US.

Our technology
We have developed some 
of the world’s most innovative 
technologies and continue 
to invest in research and 
development.
Technology
Our customers use our advanced defence 
technology to protect people and national 
security, and keep critical information and 
infrastructure secure. We are constantly 
looking to advance our technology, searching 
for new ways to provide our customers with a 
competitive edge. This can take many forms: 
increased protection, greater precision, 
superior manoeuvrability or speed, enhanced 
awareness of surroundings, superior range 
and firepower or reduced costs and greater 
efficiency – the ability to do more with less. 
Investment
It is vital that we stay ahead of the curve. 
To do this, we embrace disruptive technology 
and we continue to drive innovation and 
invest in research and development both on 
a self-funded basis and in conjunction with 
our customers. Company-funded research 
and development investment is particularly 
prevalent in areas such as defence and 
commercial aerospace electronics, military 
aircraft and cyber security, and early-stage 
research is often further developed with 
customer funding.
Our research and development programmes 
aim to improve the capability and performance 
of our products and services, reduce the cost 
of production, and provide our customers 
with efficiency savings and lower through-life 
costs. In 2016, we spent £1.4bn (2015 £1.3bn) 
on research and development, of which £206m 
(2015 £168m) was funded by the Group.
Protecting our investment in new technologies 
is important and we have a portfolio of 
patents and patent applications covering 
approximately 2,000 inventions internationally. 
Focus
Areas of focus include electronic warfare, 
platform protection, defence and commercial 
aerospace electronics, intelligent unmanned 
systems, augmented reality, cyber security and 
big data analytics. We also look at emergent 
new technologies and, in 2015, agreed to 
acquire a 20% interest in Reaction Engines 
which is working on a radical new aerospace 
engine concept with the potential to 
revolutionise hypersonic flight and the 
economics of space access.
Partnering
Partnerships are essential if we are to 
unlock the full potential of new technologies. 
We work closely with a range of partners, 
including governments, other major defence 
companies, small and medium-sized 
enterprises, and universities, bringing together 
the best brains to drive innovation.
Handheld cognitive electronic 
warfare technology
1
Through a contract with the US Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA), BAE Systems 
has developed a new lightweight handheld tactical 
sensor that soldiers can easily carry and use to 
better understand radio frequency signals for 
enhanced situational awareness. By using cognitive 
processing algorithms, this technology can quickly 
detect and identify multiple interfering signals, 
such as jammers or enemy communication signals, 
across a wide spectrum and in changing and 
challenging environments. During recent field 
tests, the new technology successfully detected 
and identified more than ten signal types across 
a wide bandwidth in the presence of interference. 
We expect to continue to mature this technology 
for eventual deployment within our electronic 
warfare, signals intelligence and tactical 
communications portfolios.

Directors’ report
Financial statements
Income statement
Sales increased by £1.1bn to £19.0bn (2015 £17.9bn), almost all of 
which was due to exchange translation.
Underlying EBITA increased by £222m to £1,905m (2015 £1,683m), 
giving a return on sales of 10.0% (2015 9.4%). There was an exchange 
translation benefit of £96m. Growth on a constant currency basis was 
at 7%.
Revenue increased by £1.0bn to £17.8bn (2015 £16.8bn).
Operating profit increased by £240m to £1,742m (2015 £1,502m), 
giving a return on revenue of 9.8% (2015 8.9%). There was an 
exchange translation benefit of £86m.
Non-recurring items represents an impairment in respect of the 
BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair business sold in January 
2017. Non‑ recurring items in 2015 of £26m included research and 
development expenditure credits relating to 2013 and 2014 (£50m), 
partly offset by a loss on the disposal of the Group’s 75% 
shareholding in the Land Systems South Africa business (£24m).
Amortisation of intangible assets reduced to £87m (2015 £108m) 
due to previously acquired intangible assets now fully amortised.
Impairment of intangible assets in 2015 mainly comprised the 
impairment of goodwill in the US Intelligence & Security business 
reflecting lower business growth assumptions.
Financial expense of equity accounted investments is £28m 
(2015 income £3m). There was a large gain in 2015 on the translation 
of foreign currency assets in Air Astana.
Net finance costs were £591m (2015 £412m). The underlying 
interest charge, excluding pension accounting, and fair value 
and foreign exchange adjustments on financial instruments and 
investments, increased to £245m (2015 £191m) primarily reflecting 
interest on the bonds issued in December 2015, incremental charges 
relating to net present value adjustments on the discounting of 
long‑term liability provisions and adverse exchange translation of 
interest charges on US dollar‑ denominated borrowings. Net interest 
expense on the Group’s pension deficit was lower at £169m (2015 
£192m) mainly reflecting the lower 2015 closing deficit. Fair value 
and foreign exchange adjustments increased to £177m (2015 £29m) 
on adverse exchange translation of US dollar‑ denominated bonds.
Taxation expense, including equity accounted investments, of 
£249m (2015 £171m) reflects the Group’s underlying effective tax 
rate for the year of 21%. The calculation of the underlying effective 
tax rate is shown in note 6 to the Group accounts on page 136. 
The underlying effective tax rate for 2017 is expected to increase 
slightly from 21% to around 22%, with the final rate dependent 
on the geographical mix of profits.
Looking beyond 2017, the effective tax rate will depend principally on 
whether there are any changes in tax legislation in the Group’s most 
significant countries of operation, the geographical mix of profits and 
the resolution of open issues. With the political change in the US, 
proposals to significantly reform the corporate tax system are being 
considered. The Group will actively monitor any developments and 
evaluate their potential impact. The Group does not expect the 
future rate to be materially impacted by the changes to the 
international tax landscape resulting from the package of measures 
developed under the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 
project and the investigations and proposals of the European 
Commission. However, the Group will keep these under review.

Cash flow
Operating business cash flow was £1,004m (2015 £681m), which 
includes cash contributions in respect of pension deficit funding, over 
and above service costs, for the UK and US schemes totalling £253m 
(2015 £274m).
Receipts aggregating to approximately £250m, expected in 2017 on 
the Omani Typhoon programme, Saudi support and MBDA’s Qatar 
contract, were received in 2016.
Major advances received in 2012 on the Omani Typhoon and Hawk 
order, and the Saudi training aircraft contract, were consumed. 
Advances were also utilised in the year on European Typhoon production. 
Costs are being incurred against provisions created in previous years, 
primarily on the US commercial shipbuilding programmes.
Net cash flow from operating activities was £1,229m (2015 £808m).
Taxation payments increased to £187m (2015 £116m) primarily 
reflecting higher payments in the US due to higher US taxable profits 
and timing differences.
Net capital expenditure and financial investment was £450m 
(2015 £284m) largely reflecting lower proceeds from sale of property, 
plant and equipment, and investment property of £45m (2015 £136m). 
Purchases of property, plant and equipment, and investment property 
were £49m higher primarily reflecting investment in manufacturing 
facilities at Electronic Systems.
Dividends received from equity accounted investments of £38m 
(2015 £41m) is primarily receipts from MBDA and FNSS.
Net interest paid was £27m higher at £200m (2015 £173m) primarily 
for interest on the bonds issued in December 2015 and adverse 
exchange translation of interest on US dollar‑ denominated borrowings.
The cash inflow in respect of acquisitions and disposals in 2016 of 
£6m reflects the sale of a 4.1% shareholding in a subsidiary company 
in Saudi Arabia. In 2015, the net cash inflow of £16m included £21m 
received from the sale of the Group’s 75% shareholding in the Land 
Systems South Africa business, less £5m paid for the acquisition of 
Eclipse Electronic Systems, Inc.
Equity dividends paid in 2016 represents the 2015 final (£397m) 
and 2016 interim (£273m) dividends.
Dividends paid to non-controlling interests reduced to £24m 
(2015 £40m). An increased dividend was paid in 2015 by the Group’s 
75%‑ owned South African business prior to disposal.
As a consequence of movements in US dollar and euro exchange 
rates, there was a cash inflow from matured derivative financial 
instruments of £480m (2015 £12m) from rolling hedges on balances 
with the Group’s subsidiaries and equity accounted investments. 
The inflow as a result of hedging cash loaned internally, from the US 
to the UK business, partially offsets the foreign exchange translation 
on the Group’s external US dollar‑ denominated borrowing (see below).
Net cash flow from loans represents repayment of a $350m (£286m) 
3.5% bond at maturity in October. In 2015, BAE Systems issued $1.5bn 
(£971m) of bonds in the US capital market and repaid a $750m (£481m) 
5.2% bond at maturity.
Foreign exchange translation, which primarily arises in respect 
of the Group’s US dollar‑ denominated borrowing, is partially offset 
by the cash inflow from matured derivative financial instruments 
(see above).

 Annual Report 2016 Financial review 
continued
Balance sheet
The £1.2bn increase in intangible assets to £11.3bn (2015 £10.1bn) 
mainly reflects exchange translation.
Property, plant and equipment, and investment property 
increased to £2.0bn (2015 £1.8bn), including £167m of exchange 
translation.
Equity accounted investments and other investments increased 
to £305m (2015 £256m) reflecting the Group’s share of profit for the 
year (£90m) less dividends received (£38m). Exchange translation was 
£52m. The increased share of pension deficit was £66m.
The £1.6bn increase in the Group’s share of the net IAS 19 pension 
deficit mainly reflects an increase in liabilities due to a 1.2 percentage 
point decrease in the real discount rate to −0.5% in the UK, partly 
offset by returns on scheme assets. The major movements in the 
net pension deficit are shown in the bridge chart opposite.
On 1 April 2016, a separate Airbus section of the BAE Systems 
Pension Scheme (Main Scheme) was created, reducing the total net 
IAS 19, Employee Benefits, deficit, with a corresponding reduction 
in the allocation to equity accounted investments.
Details of the Group’s pension schemes are provided in note 20 
to the Group accounts on page 155.
A net deferred tax asset of £1.2bn (2015 £0.9bn) relating to the Group’s 
pension deficit is included within net tax assets and liabilities.
There was a £0.3bn increase in working capital mainly reflecting a 
net reduction in advance contract funding and utilisation of provisions.
The assets and liabilities of the San Francisco ship repair business sold 
in January 2017, both totalling £2m, are classified as held for sale 
at 31 December 2016. The Group no longer expects to complete 
the disposal of Aircraft Accessories and Components Company and, 
accordingly, has ceased classifying it as held for sale (2015 £12m).
The Group’s net debt at 31 December 2016 is £1,542m, a net increase 
of £120m from the net debt position of £1,422m at the start of the 
year. A $350m (£286m) 3.5% bond was repaid at maturity in October. 
There are no further material debt maturities before 2019. The maturity 
of the Group’s borrowings is shown in the chart opposite. 
Cash and cash equivalents of £2,769m (2015 £2,537m) are held 
primarily for the repayment of debt securities, pension deficit funding, 
payment of the 2016 final dividend and management of working capital.
Critical accounting policies
Certain of the Group’s significant accounting policies are considered by 
the directors to be critical because of the level of complexity, judgement 
or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the 
consolidated financial statements:
Revenue and profit recognition
Revenue £17.8bn (year ended 31 December 2016) 
See note 1 to the Group accounts
Carrying value of intangible assets
Intangible assets £11.3bn (at 31 December 2016)

Valuation of retirement benefit obligations
Group’s share of the net 
IAS 19 pension deficit
£6.1bn (at 31 December 2016)

In addition to the critical accounting policies, management exercises 
judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies in respect of 
tax provisions and deferred tax assets.

Capital
Objectives
Maintain the Group’s investment grade credit rating and ensure 
operating flexibility, whilst:
– meeting its pension obligations;
– pursuing organic investment opportunities;
– paying dividends in line with the Group’s policy of long‑term 
sustainable cover of around two times underlying earnings;
– making accelerated returns of capital to shareholders when the 
balance sheet allows and when the return from doing so is in 
excess of the Group’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital; and
– investing in value‑ enhancing acquisitions, where market conditions 
are right and where they deliver on the Group’s strategy.
Policies
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding 
and debt financing, including bank and capital market borrowings.
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the directors 
of an appropriate balance of funding required. Three credit rating 
agencies publish credit ratings for the Group:
Agency Rating Outlook Category
Moody’s Investors Service Baa2 Stable Investment grade
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services BBB Stable Investment grade
Fitch Ratings BBB Stable Investment grade
 P165
 Note 22 to the Group accounts
Dividends
As part of the Group’s capital allocation policy (see above), the Group 
plans to pay dividends in line with its policy of long‑term sustainable 
cover of around two times underlying earnings.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 12.7p per share 
making a total of 21.3p per share for the year, an increase of 2% 
over 2015. At this level, the annual dividend is covered 1.9 times. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 Annual General Meeting, 
the dividend will be paid on 1 June 2017 to holders of ordinary shares 
registered on 21 April 2017. The ex‑ dividend date is 20 April 2017.
At 31 December 2016, the Company had retained earnings of 
£1.9bn (2015 £2.0bn), the non‑ distributable portion of which is 
£354m (2015 £343m) (see page 180). Total external dividends 
relating to 2016 are £676m (2015 £663m), including the interim 
dividend paid during the year of £273m (2015 £266m) and the 
final dividend proposed of approximately £403m (2015 £397m). 
On an annual basis, the Company receives dividends from its 
subsidiaries to increase further its distributable reserves and, 
accordingly, the Company expects to have sufficient distributable 
reserves to support its dividend policy.
The Group’s dividend policy is underpinned by its viability and going 
concern statements (see page 71).

Treasury
The Group’s treasury activities are overseen by the Treasury Review 
Management Committee (TRMC). Two executive directors are 
members of the TRMC, including the Group Finance Director who 
chairs the Committee. The TRMC also has representatives with legal 
and tax expertise. The Group operates a centralised treasury 
department that is accountable to the TRMC for managing treasury 
activities in accordance with the treasury policies approved by 
the Board.
Objectives/policies
Net debt
Maintain a balance between the continuity, flexibility and cost of debt 
funding through the use of borrowings from a range of markets with 
a range of maturities, currencies and interest rates, reflecting the 
Group’s risk profile.
– Material borrowings are arranged by the central treasury department 
and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required.
Interest rates
Manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings 
through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating 
rate debt with derivative instruments, including interest rate and 
cross‑ currency swaps.
– A minimum of 50% and a maximum of 90% of gross debt is 
maintained at fixed interest rates.
Liquidity
Maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
– An undrawn committed Revolving Credit Facility of £2bn contracted 
to December 2018 and £1.9bn contracted from December 2018 to 
December 2020 is available to meet expected general corporate 
funding requirements.
Monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation.
– The Group adopts a conservative approach to the investment of 
its surplus cash. It is deposited with financial institutions with the 
strongest credit ratings for short periods.
Currency
Reduce the Group’s exposure to transactional volatility in earnings and 
cash flows from movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
– All material firm transactional exposures are hedged.
– The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate 
movements on the income statements or balance sheets of foreign 
subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long‑term 
investments.
 P170
 Note 26 to the Group accounts
Tax strategy
The Group’s tax strategy is to:
– ensure compliance with all applicable tax laws and regulations; and
– manage the Group’s tax expense in a way that is consistent with its 
values and its legal obligations in all relevant jurisdictions.
The Group promotes collaborative professional working with tax 
authorities in order to build open, transparent and trusted relationships. 
As part of this, the Group engages in open and early dialogue to 
discuss tax planning, strategy, risks and significant transactions, 
and discloses any significant uncertainties in relation to tax matters. 
Queries and information requests by tax authorities are responded to 
in a timely fashion and the Group ensures that tax authorities are kept 
informed about how issues are progressing. The Group seeks to 
resolve issues in real time and before returns are filed where possible. 
Fair, accurate and timely disclosures are made in tax returns, reports 
and documents that the Group files with, or submits to, tax authorities. 
Where disagreements over tax arise, the Group works proactively 
to seek to resolve all issues by agreement (where possible) and reach 
reasonable solutions. In the UK, the Group is subject to an annual 
risk assessment by HM Revenue & Customs and strives to achieve 
as low a risk rating as can be achieved by a group of BAE Systems’ 
size and complexity.
Whilst the Group aims to maximise the tax efficiency of its business 
transactions, it does not use structures in its tax planning that are 
contrary to the intentions of the relevant legislature. The Group 
interprets relevant tax laws in a reasonable way and ensures that 
transactions are structured in a way that is consistent with a relationship 
of co‑ operative compliance with tax authorities. It also actively 
considers the implications of any planning for the Group’s wider 
corporate reputation.
The Group is open and transparent with regard to decision‑ making, 
governance and tax planning in its business, keeping tax authorities 
informed of who has responsibility, how decisions are reached, how 
the business is structured and where different parts of the business 
are located.
BAE Systems operates internationally and is subject to tax in many 
different jurisdictions. The Group employs professional tax managers 
and takes appropriate advice from reputable professional firms. The 
Group is routinely subject to tax audits and reviews which can take a 
considerable period of time to conclude. Provision is made for known 
issues based on management’s interpretation of country‑ specific 
legislation and the likely outcome of negotiations or litigation. The 
assessment and management of tax risks are regularly reviewed by 
the Audit Committee, as is the Group’s tax strategy.
Arm’s‑ length principles are applied in the pricing of all intra‑ group 
transactions of goods and services in accordance with Organisation for 
Economic Co‑ operation and Development guidelines. Where appropriate, 
the Group engages with governments in relation to proposed 
legislation and tax policy. The Group endorses the statement of tax 
principles issued by the Confederation of British Industry in May 2013 
(www.cbi.org.uk/cbi‑ prod/assets/File/pdf/statement‑ of‑ tax‑ principles.pdf).

Group guidance
For the year ending 31 December 2017 , we expect the Group’s underlying earnings per 
share to be 5% to 10% higher than full-year underlying earnings per share in 2016 of 40.3p.
*
The guidance is based on the measures used to monitor the underlying financial performance of the Group. Reconciliations 
from these measures to the financial performance measures defined in International Financial Reporting Standards for 2016 
are provided in the Financial review on pages 24 to 30.
Segmental guidance
1
 Electronic Systems
– Mid single‑ digit sales growth is expected 
in 2017 driven by a number of electronic 
warfare contracts, with 75% of projected 
sales in the 2016 closing order backlog.
– Margins
1
 are expected to be at the top 
end of a 13% to 15% range.
2
 Cyber & Intelligence
Comprising the US Intelligence & Security 
sector (71% of Cyber & Intelligence sales 
in 2016) and Applied Intelligence:
– Low single‑ digit sales growth is expected 
in 2017, with stable sales in Intelligence 
& Security and double‑ digit growth in 
Applied Intelligence across each of its 
three divisions.
– Margins
1
 are expected to improve to 
within a 6% to 8% range, following the 
high level of product development 
investment in the Applied Intelligence 
business over the last two years.
 4
 Platforms & Services (UK)
– Sales are expected to be 5% lower. On 
Typhoon, European and Saudi deliveries 
are largely complete and this is only partly 
offset by trading on the contracts to Oman 
and Kuwait, along with the increased F‑ 35 
volumes. Almost 95% of this sales guidance 
is within the 2016 closing order backlog.
– Margins
1
 are expected to be at the lower 
end of a 10% to 12% range, having 
absorbed the impact of increased pension 
service costs.
3
 Platforms & Services (US)
– Sales are expected to be stable, with the 
completion of CV90 deliveries to Norway 
being offset by the increasing volumes 
from the US vehicles and munition 
businesses. Of this sales guidance, 75% 
is within the 2016 closing order backlog.
– Another year of margin
1
 improvement, to 
a range of 8% to 9%, is expected in 2017, 
absent further charges on the commercial 
shipbuilding contracts.
6
 HQ
– HQ costs are expected to be similar 
to those in 2016.
– Underlying finance costs are expected to 
be slightly lower, absent the incremental 
net present value charges seen in 2016.
– The underlying effective tax rate for 
2017 is expected to increase slightly 
from 21% to around 22%, with the 
final rate dependent on the geographical 
mix of profits.

In September, we delivered the 
250th electronic warfare suite for 
the F-35 Lightning II combat aircraft 
programme, the world’s largest 
defence programme. The advanced 
technology helps pilots to identify, 
monitor, analyse and respond to 
potential threats.
Driven by growth in our electronic 
warfare programmes, the business is 
making an investment of more than 
$100m (£81m) in our ‘Ramp 2 Rate’ 
initiative to improve our efficiency 
and capacity in defence electronics 
production over the next decade. This 
investment includes the construction 
of an Electronic Warfare Integrated 
Manufacturing Centre, modernised 
with advanced manufacturing 
capabilities in robotics and automation.
Electronic Systems, with 13,800 employees
1
, comprises the 
US and UK‑based electronics activities, including electronic 
warfare systems, electro‑ optical sensors, military and 
commercial digital engine and flight controls, next ‑ generation 
military communications systems and data links, persistent 
surveillance capabilities, and hybrid electric drive systems.

Electronic Combat
BAE Systems has sustained its leadership 
position in the US electronic warfare and 
communications and navigation markets. 
Production is ramping up across a 
number of programmes. Low-Rate Initial 
Production hardware deliveries on the F-35 
Lightning II programme continue with Lot 9 
and 10 deliveries. We have received initial 
funding for Lot 11 with deliveries expected 
to commence in 2018.
The business is under contracts, from 
Boeing and Warner Robins Air Logistics 
Complex, totalling more than $1.0bn (£0.8bn) 
to install the Digital Electronic Warfare System 
on 84 new F-15 aircraft, upgrade 70 existing 
F-15 aircraft, and provide spare units and 
modules for an international customer. The 
programme remains on schedule. 
In 2015, we were selected by Boeing to 
develop and manufacture the next-generation 
digital electronic warfare system for the 
US Air Force’s Eagle Passive Active Warning 
Survivability System programme to upgrade 
up to 400 F-15 aircraft. In 2016, we received 
the engineering and manufacturing 
development contract, worth $146m (£118m), 
as a follow-on to the technology maturation 
and risk reduction phase. The programme 
could be worth more than $1.0bn (£0.8bn) 
over its life. 
In January 2017, BAE Systems was awarded 
a $67m (£54m) modification to exercise the 
option on a previously awarded contract for 
an electronic warfare system for the US Air 
Force Special Operations Command’s fleet 
of C -130J aircraft. The award is currently 
under protest with the Government 
Accountability Office.
Due to the sensitive nature of electronic 
combat systems and technology, many of 
our programmes are classified. As a world 
leader in electronic warfare, communications 
and navigation solutions, the business 
continues to experience growth in these 
increasingly important areas.
Survivability, Targeting & Sensing
Our Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System 
(APKWS
™
) laser-guided rocket is experiencing 
growing demand, with deliveries exceeding 
8,000 units through 2016. In addition to 
expanding its use in the US military, the 
system is generating strong international 
attention, with 16 nations expressing 
interest. In October, the US Navy awarded 
us a three-year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite 
Quantity contract for Full-Rate Production 
Lots 5 to 7 worth up to $600m (£486m) 
that could increase production to 10,000 
units per year.
We continue to perform well on the Terminal 
High-Altitude Area Defence programme, 
delivering over 90 seekers in 2016 following 
the $80m (£65m) contract received for Lots 7 
and 8 during the year.
On the Common Missile Warning System 
programme, the business was awarded a 
$249m (£201m) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite 
Quantity contract modification to fulfil 
increased demand from our customers, the 
US Army and allied nations, extending the 
current five-year contract by two years.
On the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle III 
and Family of Weapon Sights – Individual 
programme, we completed the first round 
of qualification and reliability testing in 
September under a five-year, $434m 
(£351m) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite 
Quantity contract.
On the US Army’s Family of Weapon Sights – 
Crew Served programme, we were awarded 
a seven-year contract with a potential value 
of up to $384m (£311m) in September. The 
sight is designed to allow soldiers to acquire 
and engage targets at extended range.
We continue to leverage our technology and 
engineering capabilities, and the LiteHUD
®
 
head-up display has been selected by critical 
launch customers for integration on multiple 
platforms. 
The next-generation Striker
®
 II helmet-mounted 
display has completed the second phase of 
flight trials to integrate the system’s technology 
with the Typhoon combat aircraft.

Financial statements
Looking forward
In the US, following the two-year 
Bipartisan Budget Act signed in 
2015, there are signs of a return to 
growth in defence budgets, with 
the new administration expected 
to further increase defence and 
security spending.
Electronic Systems is well positioned 
to address current and evolving 
priority programmes from its 
strong franchise positions in 
electronic warfare, electro-optics 
and Intelligence, Surveillance and 
Reconnaissance. Electronic Systems 
has a long-standing programme of 
research and development, and its 
focus remains on maintaining a 
diverse portfolio of defence and 
commercial products and capabilities 
for US and international customers.
The business expects to benefit 
from its franchise positions, 
particularly on the F-35 Lightning II 
and F-15 upgrade programmes, 
and its ability to apply innovative 
technology solutions that meet 
defence customers’ changing 
requirements. In the commercial 
aviation market, Electronic Systems’ 
technology innovations are enabling 
the business to renew long-standing 
customer positions and to compete 
for and win new business.
Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance 
In 2016, Cyber & Intelligence’s Geospatial 
Intelligence – Intelligence, Surveillance and 
Reconnaissance (GEOINT-ISR) business 
transferred to Electronic Systems and was 
merged with the sector’s existing Intelligence, 
Surveillance & Reconnaissance business. 
Since winning the Geospatial Data Services 
Foundational GEOINT Content Management 
programme in 2014, we have been awarded 
orders valued at $170m (£138m) and the 
business is meeting all delivery orders to 
date. The programme assists US intelligence 
community customers with the development 
of advanced geospatial intelligence data 
collection and processing solutions.
We provide signals intelligence capability 
for the US Army and other US Department 
of Defense customers and have received 
incremental funding for additional production 
and a technical refresh of Tactical Signals 
Intelligence Payloads for the US Army’s 
Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft, bringing 
the total contract value to approximately 
$116m (£94m). 
The business is in Full-Rate Production on the 
US Navy’s P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance 
aircraft programme, providing state-of-the-art 
processing capabilities. We delivered 18 mission 
computer and display systems in 2016, and 
received a $60m (£49m) contract for Full-Rate 
Production Lot 4 in December. 
Controls & Avionics
BAE Systems is a major supplier to Boeing 
for flight controls, and cabin and flight deck 
systems. Development of the integrated flight 
control electronics and remote electronic 
units for Boeing’s next-generation 777X 
aircraft is on schedule, with the Critical Design 
Reviews for all system components complete 
and systems integration testing in progress. 
On the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, flight testing 
of our spoiler controls, flight deck systems 
and utilities is progressing well, with the first 
production hardware delivered in November. 
The Bombardier C Series aircraft entered 
service equipped with BAE Systems’ flight 
control electronics. 
FADEC Alliance, a joint venture between 
FADEC International (the Group’s joint venture 
with Safran Electronics & Defense) and 
GE Aviation, is now on contract to provide 
the full authority digital engine controls 
(FADEC) for: the Leap engine on the Airbus 
A320neo, Boeing 737 MAX and Comac 
C919; the Passport 20 engine on the 
Bombardier Global 7000/8000; the GE9x 
engine on the Boeing 777X; and a new 
generation of advanced turboprop engines.
We completed qualification of an active 
control side-stick for the Gulfstream G500/
G600 aircraft, with testing nearing completion 
for the Embraer KC -390. The product will be 
the first civil-certified active control side-stick 
with application across both commercial and 
military markets.
On the F-35 Lightning II programme, the 
business completed Low-Rate Initial Production 
Lot 9 deliveries of 57 production shipsets, plus 
spares, of the vehicle management computer 
and active inceptor system equipment. Both 
systems are now in production for Lot 10 and 
we expect to be under contract for Lot 11 
in 2017.
Power & Propulsion Solutions
In 2016, the business delivered more than 
1,000 hybrid-electric propulsion systems 
to transit agencies around the world and, 
in November, achieved the milestone of 
having 7,000 hybrid-electric propulsion 
systems in service.
Cities including London, Paris, Seattle and  
Boston are using our hybrid and electric 
drive systems to save fuel and prevent 
CO
2 emissions.
We continued to increase our global presence 
with Solaris Bus & Coach in Poland offering 
our hybrid-electric system on its buses 
from September.

– In aggregate, sales were marginally higher at $2.4bn (£1.8bn). The Intelligence & Security 
business saw a 2% increase largely in the area of provision of managed services to the 
intelligence community. Growth in the Applied Intelligence business was at 11%, 
benefiting from increases in the Commercial Solutions and UK Services divisions.
– The return on sales achieved was 5.1% (2015 6.6%). Higher levels of costs expensed 
in the Applied Intelligence business, together with delays in securing software licence 
sales, meant that there was a loss recorded in the business of £19m. In the year, the 
total cost base of the business (labour and overheads) amounted to more than £480m, 
all of which was expensed through the income statement.
– There was an operating loss in the prior year due to the impairment of goodwill in 
the Intelligence & Security business reflecting lower business growth assumptions.
– Cash conversion of underlying EBITA for the year was in excess of 100%, excluding 
pension deficit funding.
– In aggregate, order backlog

 reduced to $3.0bn (£2.4bn). Order backlog in the 
Intelligence & Security business was 5% lower on trading out of certain longer-term 
contracts. In the Applied Intelligence business, order backlog increased by 9% over 
the year driven mainly by UK government services and commercial awards.

– Sales in the year declined by 8% to $3.9bn (£2.9bn). The sales reduction in the naval ship 
repair business was less than expected, with stronger volumes through our Norfolk yard.
– The business has delivered an improved return on sales of 7.3% (2015 6.4%). Whilst 
further charges had to be taken in the year on the commercial shipbuilding programmes, 
these were partly offset by provision releases, primarily on the Radford munitions 
contract. The net impact of these charges and releases was 1.3 percentage points 
on return on sales.
– Cash conversion of underlying EBITA was impacted by the use of provisions on the 
commercial shipbuilding programmes and of customer advances on the CV90 Norway 
contract, along with the investment, now completed, on the new floating dry dock 
facilities in San Diego.
– Order backlog

 was almost unchanged at $5.7bn (£4.6bn). The trading out of the 
five-year Multi-Ship, Multi-Option contracts in the ship repair business and on the CV90 
Norway programme were largely offset by multiple domestic and international land 
vehicle awards along with the gun contract for the UK’s Type 26 frigate. The Indian M777 
lightweight howitzer award for $542m (£439m) was not contracted until January 2017.

US Combat Vehicles
The business continues to hold a number 
of key franchise programmes, including 
the long-standing Bradley Infantry Fighting 
Vehicle, the M109 family of vehicles, the 
M88 Heavy Recovery Vehicle, the Assault 
Amphibious Vehicle and the more recent 
Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, with future 
prospects including the Amphibious Combat 
Vehicle 1.1 programme.
We have rolled out the first of 29 vehicles 
under the engineering and manufacturing 
development phase of the US Army’s Armored 
Multi-Purpose Vehicle programme. The 
potential contract value for the initial phase of 
the programme is $1.2bn (£1.0bn), including 
options for 289 vehicles in Low-Rate Initial 
Production. Anticipated Full-Rate Production 
is expected to approach 3,000 vehicles.
We continue to execute on the $670m 
(£542m) Low-Rate Initial Production phase of 
the M109A7 Paladin self-propelled howitzer 
programme to deliver 66 vehicle sets and 
an additional howitzer. At 31 December, 
34 vehicle sets, together with the additional 
howitzer, had been delivered. The US Army’s 
total acquisition objective through all 
programme phases is for 581 vehicle sets.
The business is executing a $286m (£231m) 
Engineering Change Proposal to address the 
space, weight, power and cooling limitations 
of the Bradley family of vehicles as well as 
preparing the vehicle for communication 
network upgrades. In 2017, the customer’s 
production decision is expected regarding 
the upgrade of approximately 500 vehicles 
over a three-year period from 2019. 
In April, we received a contract valued at 
$110m (£89m) from the US Army to convert 
36 M88A1 recovery vehicles to the M88A2

the first half of 2017 and final down-selection 
to a single manufacturer is expected in 2018. 
Leveraging our expertise in amphibious 
capabilities, we were awarded contracts 
totalling $160m (£129m) for the production 
of 30 new Assault Amphibious Vehicles 
(AAV) and the upgrade of two AAV for the 
Japanese Ministry of Defence. 
In April, we received a contract valued at 
$50m (£40m) to deliver 236 M113 upgrade 
kits and technical support for the Brazilian 
Army, with contract deliveries scheduled to 
complete in 2018. In September, the Brazilian 
government awarded the business a $54m 
(£44m) contract to provide 32 upgraded 
M109A5+ self-propelled howitzers.
Weapon Systems and Munition Operations
BAE Systems remains a leading provider of 
gun systems and precision strike capabilities, 
and continues work with the US Navy on the 
development of the Hyper Velocity Projectile 
and the Electromagnetic Railgun.
In April, we received multiple awards from 
the US Navy, including a $38m (£31m) 
contract modification to provide additional 
missile canisters for the Mk 41 Vertical 
Launching System and a $72m (£58m) 
contract to produce and deliver propulsor 
systems for Block IV Virginia Class submarines.
In August, the US Navy exercised a $50m 
(£40m) contract option to upgrade four 
additional Mk 45 gun systems, bringing the 
total value of the contract to $130m (£105m) 
for ten systems.
In July, we received a £183m contract from the 
UK Ministry of Defence to provide the gun 
system known as the Maritime Indirect Fire 
System for the Royal Navy’s Type 26 frigate. 
Deliveries to the Swedish government of the 
24 Archer artillery systems were completed 
in December. In September, the Swedish 
government announced its intent to purchase 
the additional 24 Archer systems originally 
contracted for Norway. 
In February 2017, we completed the 
acquisition of IAP Research, an engineering 
company focused on the development and 
production of electromagnetic launchers, 
power electronics and advanced materials.
In the complex infrastructure operations 
business, we manage the US Army’s Radford 
and Holston munitions facilities. In the year, 
we were awarded $85m (£69m) in contract 
modifications at Holston for waste water 
management, followed by a $146m (£118m) 
contract in October to construct a nitric 
acid recovery facility to increase capacity 
for producing insensitive munitions. In 
September, we received a $69m (£56m) 
contract for continued production of MK 90 
propellant grain.
In November, the US and Indian governments 
signed a Letter of Agreement for the Foreign 
Military Sale of 145 M777 lightweight 
howitzers and, in January 2017, we received 
the $542m (£439m) contract from the US 
government to supply these howitzers to 
the Indian Army. We have selected Mahindra 
& Mahindra as our supplier to establish an 
assembly, integration and test facility in India 
in support of the Indian Prime Minister’s 
‘Make in India’ initiative.

Looking forward
In the US, following the two-year 
Bipartisan Budget Act signed in 
2015, there are signs of a return to 
growth in defence budgets, with 
the new administration expected 
to further increase defence and 
security spending.
The business is underpinned by 
strong positions on key franchise 
programmes. In the land domain, 
this includes the US Army’s Armored 
Multi-Purpose Vehicle, Bradley and 
Paladin programmes and the CV90 
and BvS10 export programmes from 
our BAE Systems Hägglunds business.
FNSS has grown its order book with 
both domestic and international 
orders secured during 2016.
These long-term contracts, our 
strong franchise in tracked vehicles 
and opportunities in international 
markets, position the land business 
for a return to growth in the 
medium term.
In the maritime domain, the Group 
has a strong position on naval gun 
programmes and US Navy ship repair. 
Additional dry dock ship repair 
capacity has been established in 
San Diego to support the US Navy’s 
re-balance to the Asia-Pacific region.
The business continues to pursue a 
range of domestic and international 
opportunities in combat and 
amphibious vehicles, weapons systems 
and maritime support services.
US Ship Repair and Modernisation
We are a leading provider of ship repair and 
modernisation services. In 2016, we secured 
firm orders across our US shipyards totalling 
approximately $1.1bn (£0.9bn) and the 
business remains well positioned to compete 
for future contracts in the maritime domain. 
We continue to adjust our workforce and 
facilities to meet the evolving demand for 
US Navy ship repair. To support the US Navy’s 
re-balance to the Asia-Pacific region, a new 
dry dock arrived in our San Diego shipyard 
in December and became operational in 
February 2017. The USS New Orleans, an 
amphibious dock landing ship, will be the first 
vessel to be serviced in the dry dock under a 
$37m (£30m) contract received in November. 
In commercial shipbuilding, we continued 
to experience challenges in the year, taking 
a $73m (£54m) charge against ongoing 
contracts. Workforce adjustments continue 
as these contracts near completion. Six ships 
have now been accepted by customers, with 
the remaining two ships expected to complete 
in 2017. 
In January 2017, we completed the sale of 
our BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair 
business enabling us to focus on our larger, 
retained shipyards providing strong capabilities 
and support to our key maritime customers, 
including the US Navy.
BAE Systems Hägglunds
Series production continues on the $865m 
(£700m) contract awarded in 2012 for the 
supply of CV90 Infantry Fighting Vehicles 
to Norway.
In addition to production of CV90 vehicles, 
we have been awarded contracts for 
refurbishment and upgrade. In March, we 
were awarded a contract valued at $182m 
(£147m) to refurbish 262 CV90 vehicles for 
the Swedish Army and, in September and 
October, two contracts from the Danish 
government for sustainment and upgrade 
of its CV90 fleet. In December, the Swedish 
government awarded us a $68m (£55m) 
contract for the integration of Mjölner mortar 
systems on 40 CV90s, and we received a 
contract from the Dutch government for 
testing and verification of Active Protection 
Systems on CV90s.
In June, we were awarded a contract to 
produce 32 BvS10 military vehicles for 
Austria, the fifth nation to acquire the 
all-terrain vehicle.
FNSS
FNSS, our land systems joint venture based 
in Turkey, has continued to perform under 
its $524m (£424m) programme to produce 
259 8x8 wheeled armoured vehicles for the 
Royal Malaysian Army.
Production remains on schedule under a 
contract to upgrade M113 tracked armoured 
personnel carriers for the Royal Saudi Land 
Forces and, in 2016, the business received a 
contract to integrate mortar systems.
In support of a customer contract awarded in 
2015 to supply the PARS Wheeled Armoured 
Vehicle, work has begun to deliver 8x8 and 
6x6 vehicles in a number of configurations.
In June, FNSS was awarded a contract 
worth more than €278m (£237m) to supply 
260 Anti-Tank Vehicles to the Turkish Land 
Forces. The scope of the project includes both 
tracked and wheeled vehicles equipped with 
anti-tank guided missile system turrets. 
In December, FNSS signed an €84m (£72m) 
contract with ASELSAN, a Turkish defence 
electronics company, for amphibious tracked 
armoured vehicles for the Turkish Land Forces.

In the year, 16 Typhoon aircraft were delivered 
from the UK final assembly facility, of which 
11 were delivered to Saudi Arabia. Cumulative 
aircraft deliveries to the UK, Germany, Italy 
and Spain total 232 of the contracted 236 
Tranche 2 aircraft and 33 of the contracted 
88 Tranche 3 aircraft. 
The Oman Typhoon and Hawk aircraft 
programme is on track for commencement 
of deliveries in 2017. 
Orders totalling £1.0bn have been received 
via Eurofighter from our Italian Eurofighter 
partner, Leonardo, for BAE Systems’ share of 
work on the 28 Typhoon aircraft for Kuwait 
covering airframe manufacture, support, 
capability upgrade and Electronically Scanned 
(E-Scan) radar integration work. 
Typhoon’s capabilities continue to be 
enhanced with the ongoing integration 
of the Captor E-Scan radar and the Storm 
Shadow, Meteor and Brimstone 2 missiles 
as part of European capability delivery 
programmes. Development towards the 
Royal Air Force Centurion standard continues, 
which will enable transition of capability from 
Tornado to Typhoon. 
We have continued to support our UK and 
European customers’ Typhoon and Tornado 
aircraft and their operational commitments. 
A ten-year partnership arrangement with 
the Ministry of Defence to support the UK 
Typhoon fleet, expected to be worth at 
least £2.1bn, was signed in July.
On the F-35 Lightning II programme, we 
completed delivery of 55 aft fuselage 
assemblies for the Low-Rate Initial Production 
Lot 9 and 10 contracts. Additional orders 
were received for Lot 10 during the year, 
worth £168m, with full contract award 
expected in 2017 following agreement of 
the front-end contract between Lockheed 
Martin and the US government. The proposal 
for Lot 11 has been submitted to Lockheed 
Martin in advance of negotiations expected 
to complete in 2017. A £118m contract to 
build engineering and training facilities at 
RAF Marham in Norfolk, UK, has been 
secured, with work scheduled to be completed 
in 2018 in readiness for the arrival of the UK’s 
first F-35 Lightning II aircraft. In November, the 
F-35 Joint Programme Office announced that 
it had chosen the UK as a major repair hub for 
the maintenance, repair, overhaul and upgrade 
of F-35 Lightning II avionics and components, 
during the period 2021 to 2025 on a global 
basis and from 2025 onwards for the 
Europe region.
Support continues to be provided to users 
of Hawk trainer aircraft around the world. 
A long-term support contract for the Royal Air 
Force’s UK fleet of Hawk fast jet trainer aircraft 
was announced in the year and we continue 
to deliver against all contractual milestones. 
In 2016, the Indian Navy and Air Force received 
three and ten Hawk aircraft, respectively, 
completing the delivery of all 57 aircraft built 
under licence by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited 
(HAL). Negotiations continue with HAL for the 
supply of 32 aircraft kit sets which will result 
in aircraft built under licence by HAL for the 
Indian Air Force and Indian Navy.
In March, we welcomed the announcement 
by the UK and French governments of a €2bn 
(£1.7bn) programme to build operationally 
representative unmanned combat air system 
demonstrators. This will secure highly-skilled 
engineering jobs and the first phase is 
anticipated to commence in 2018.
The UK technology programme for the air 
sector continues to progress with a successful 
set of demonstrations in 2016 and further 
order intake has been received to develop 
critical systems and capabilities for future 
unmanned systems and other aircraft.
In Turkey, following a pre-contract study phase 
between BAE Systems and Turkish Aerospace 
Industries, we have signed a heads of 
agreement to collaborate on the first design 
and development phase of an indigenous 
fifth-generation fighter jet for the Turkish Air 
Force. When on contract, this will have a value 
in excess of £100m.
Maritime
On the aircraft carrier programme, good 
progress has been made on commissioning 
HMS Queen Elizabeth’s key systems and the 
business is working with the Ministry of 
Defence to prepare the support solution 
in advance of her expected arrival at 
HM Naval Base, Portsmouth, in 2017. 
On HMS Prince of Wales, all of the blocks 
are now assembled, with large volume 
installation activities under way. Sea trials 
on the aircraft carriers are expected to 
complete in 2017 and 2019, respectively. 
In preparation for the manufacturing contract 
for the Type 26 frigate, a £472m extension 
to the demonstration phase contract was 
secured in March, covering detailed design 
activities and enabling us to subcontract for 
key equipment with companies throughout 
the supply chain. The engineering design 
programme continues to progress to enable 
commencement of manufacture of the first 
ship in 2017. The programme currently 
employs more than 1,000 staff. 
Under a heads of terms signed in November, 
BAE Systems and the Ministry of Defence 
reached agreement in principle on the award 
of a contract reflecting the government’s 
intention to build eight Type 26 frigates on 
the Clyde and a further two River Class 
Offshore Patrol Vessels. The Offshore Patrol 
Vessels were contracted in December for 
£287m, including support services for the 
five-ship programme.

In 2016, we successfully demonstrated 
unmanned boat technology and a bespoke 
transportable command and control 
system. A modified Pacific Class 950 Rigid 
Inflatable Boat took part in the Royal Navy’s 
Unmanned Warrior naval exercise. This 
system is capable of speeds up to 47 knots 
and would allow longer duration operations 
than manned boats. The multi-role vessel 
could carry out reconnaissance and remote 
surveillance operations while keeping sailors 
out of harm’s way.
The technology will enable end-to-end 
command and control of unmanned vehicles 
and, together with the unmanned boat 
technology, can track, monitor and intercept 
threats as they happen. This supports 
decision-making and helps to keep Royal 
Navy personnel safe during deployment.

Looking forward
Platforms & Services (UK) has 
an order backlog of long-term 
committed programmes and an 
enduring support business. The 
Strategic Defence and Security 
Review announced in November 
2015 provided clarity, continuity 
and stability for the UK contracted 
business and has been consistently 
implemented through long-term 
contract awards and commitments.
In Military Air & Information, sales 
are underpinned by Typhoon and 
F-35 Lightning II aircraft production 
and in-service support. There are 
opportunities to secure further 
Typhoon export sales building on 
the purchase of 28 aircraft by Kuwait.
In Maritime, sales are underpinned 
by the design and subsequent 
manufacture of the Type 26 frigate 
and long-term contracts on 
Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft 
carriers, River Class Offshore Patrol 
Vessels, and Astute and Dreadnought 
Class submarines. The through-life 
support of existing and new 
platforms, together with their 
associated command and combat 
systems, provides a sustainable 
business in technical services and 
mid-life upgrades.
The Land (UK) business is underpinned 
by the 15-year Munitions Acquisition 
Supply Solution partnering 
agreement with the Ministry of 
Defence secured in 2008 and 
continues to pursue upgrade 
programmes with a focus on the 
Challenger 2 main battle tank.
Progress has been maintained on the 
manufacture of the first three Offshore 
Patrol Vessels, FORTH, MEDWAY and TRENT. 
The programme supports shipbuilding skills 
and provides a bridge for the business 
between the aircraft carrier programme 
and manufacture of the Type 26 frigate. 
Under the Maritime Support Delivery 
Framework contract, in place until March 
2019, we provide services at HM Naval Base, 
Portsmouth, and support to half of the Royal 
Navy’s surface fleet. Achievement of target 
cost remains on track. 
BAE Systems manages the support, 
maintenance and upgrade of the Royal Navy’s 
fleet of Type 45 destroyers.
Progress continues on the £270m Spearfish 
torpedo upgrade demonstration and 
manufacture phases, with the demonstration 
phase currently forecast to complete in 2019.
The first three of seven Astute Class 
submarines are in operational service with 
the Royal Navy, with the reactor core load on 
boat four completed in the second half of the 
year. Further funding of £228m for the sixth 
and seventh boats was received in the year. 
Negotiations for full pricing of the sixth and 
seventh boats have commenced.
The Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems and 
Rolls-Royce have signed a heads of terms to set 
up a Dreadnought Build Alliance documenting 
the UK government and industry’s commitment 
to the delivery of the Dreadnought Class 
submarine programme, the replacement for 
the Royal Navy’s Vanguard Class submarine 
fleet, and setting out an organisational and 
managerial structure and series of commercial 
principles necessary to deliver it.
Functional and spatial design continues to 
advance on the Dreadnought Class submarine. 
During 2016, £1.3bn of funding was received 
for continued design, initial manufacture 
of the first boat, material commitment and 
facilities investment. Preparations for the 
manufacture of Dreadnought include a 
major programme of building works at the 
Barrow site, with contracts in place totalling 
more than £300m. The UK government’s 
commitment to the Dreadnought programme 
was endorsed by Parliament during the year. 
Land (UK)
The business provides ongoing support 
to previously-supplied armoured vehicles 
and bridging systems, with orders of £56m 
received in the year. In the UK, the business 
has been down-selected as one of two 
contenders to deliver the first stage of the 
Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme and, 
in the overseas market, the business secured 
a multi-year contract for support and 
maintenance to the Latvian fleet of Combat 
Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) vehicles 
purchased from the UK Ministry of Defence.
The first 29 of 515 40mm cased-telescopic 
cannons were delivered to the Ministry of 
Defence by CTA International, a 50% joint 
venture between BAE Systems and Nexter.
The business continues to provide UK and 
international customers with a full range of 
light and heavy munitions. We have concluded 
pricing negotiations on our 15-year Munitions 
Acquisition Supply Solution partnering 
agreement with the Ministry of Defence, 
worth £445m.

Operational performance
Saudi Arabia
On the Salam Typhoon programme, 68 of 
the contracted 72 aircraft had been delivered 
at 31 December. Typhoon capability expansion 
is progressing to schedule. 
The Typhoon support contracts are operating 
well, meeting all contractual metrics. 
Through the Saudi British Defence Co-operation 
Programme, the business continues to support 
the operational capabilities of the Royal 
Saudi Air Force and Royal Saudi Naval Forces. 
The contract for Hawk aircraft signed in 
2012 continues on schedule, with 14 aircraft 
delivered and accepted at 31 December. 
Manufacturing for the second batch of 
22 aircraft, awarded in 2015, is progressing 
to schedule. Under this contract, we will 
undertake the final assembly of these aircraft 
in Saudi Arabia.
Under the Royal Saudi Naval Forces’ 
Minehunter mid-life update programme, 
acceptance of the second ship was completed 
in the second half of the year. Work on the 
third and final ship is progressing to plan, 
with acceptance expected in the second 
half of 2017.
Agreement has been reached with the Saudi 
Arabian government for BAE Systems to 
continue to provide support services to the 
Royal Saudi Air Force and Royal Saudi Naval 
Forces under the Saudi British Defence 
Co-operation Programme for a further five 
years, against which we have booked initial 
order intake in 2016. Discussions with the 
UK government and the Saudi Arabian 
customer are under way to define the details 
of this follow-on contract.
Under the planned reorganisation of our 
portfolio of interests in a number of industrial 
companies in Saudi Arabia, Riyadh Wings 
Aviation Academy LLC has acquired a 4.1% 
shareholding in a Group subsidiary, Overhaul 
and Maintenance Company, and is expected 
to acquire a further interest up to a maximum 
of 49%. The reorganisation supports our 
strategy to expand the customer base of 
our In-Kingdom Industrial Participation 
programme, promoting training, development 
and employment opportunities in line with 
Vision 2030. 
The Saudi Arabian In-Kingdom Industrial 
Participation programme continues to make 
progress. During 2016, there has been further 
capability and knowledge transfer on the 
Typhoon platform and planning is well 
advanced for the transfer of other capabilities 
and work into our In-Kingdom partner 
companies. All of these activities are aligned 
with our long-term industrialisation strategy, 
as well as the Saudi Arabian government’s 
National Transformation Plan and Vision 2030.
Australia
The consolidation of operating divisions 
announced in 2015, from three to two, was 
completed during the year.
We have continued to provide in-service 
support to the Navy’s two Landing Helicopter 
Docks under a four-year support contract 
awarded in 2014. Final acceptance of these 
vessels is scheduled in 2017.
The fifth Anzac Class frigate to be modernised 
under the current Anti-Ship Missile Defence 
programme, HMAS Parramatta, has 
completed final sea trials and has been 
accepted into service by the Commonwealth. 
Completion of the upgrade programme is 
expected in 2017.
In April, the Australian government signed 
an agreement for the sustainment and 
upgrade of the Anzac Class frigates under the 
Warship Asset Management Alliance. We are 
a significant participant and the agreement 
underpins our engineering and complex 
project management capabilities. We were 
awarded contracts totalling A$430m (£252m) 
in the year.
In April, the Australian government announced 
that our Type 26 Global Combat Ship had 
been shortlisted as one of three designs for 
its SEA 5000 Future Frigate programme and, 
in August, a contract was signed with the 
Commonwealth to further refine the design 
as part of a competitive evaluation process.
In November, BAE Systems was chosen 
to provide maintenance, repair, overhaul 
and upgrade services to support a range of 
system components on the F-35 Lightning II 
aircraft. Our scope of work involves global 
sustainment services for life support 
components and sustainment services for 
the South Pacific region across avionics and 
digital mission systems and electrical systems 
components. This award follows our 
selection, in 2015, as the Pacific regional 
prime contractor to undertake airframe 
maintenance, repair, overhaul and upgrade.
In May, the Royal Australian Air Force 
celebrated its Hawk aircraft fleet achieving 
the significant milestone of more than 
100,000 flying hours. We support the fleet 
as the systems integrator, including logistics, 
maintenance, repair, overhaul and upgrade. 
From July, our scope of work was expanded 
to include operational maintenance, a 
reflection of this successful long-term 
partnering arrangement.
In 2016, the government announced that 
we were one of two tenderers successfully 
down-selected on the Land 400 Phase 2 
Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle programme.
We are engaged in discussions with the 
Australian government regarding the forward 
delivery schedule for the delayed JP 2008 
Phase 3F programme for enhanced satellite 
communications services to the Australian 
Defence Force.

We provide support to the Royal Australian 
Air Force’s (RAAF) Hawk fleet at its bases 
in Williamtown and Pearce. Working 
alongside the RAAF, we ensure that the 
aircraft are available for training when 
required and have continued to deliver 
significant savings. Since 2013, we have 
achieved all contract key performance 
indicators for deep maintenance of the fleet. 
In 2016, we expanded our long-standing 
relationship with the RAAF to include 
operational maintenance and secured 
an A$200m (£117m) contract, extending 
our support to 2020, and ensuring that 
Australia’s combat pilots continue to 
receive the best training possible.

Looking forward
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 
following agreement of the budget 
for the next five years of the Saudi 
British Defence Co-operation 
Programme, we expect to sustain 
our long-term presence through 
delivering current programmes, 
further industrialisation and 
developing new business in support 
of the Saudi military forces. We are 
focused on our ongoing commitment 
to support the national objectives of 
local skills and technology, increasing 
employment and developing an 
indigenous defence industry, and will 
structure our business and portfolio 
of interests in Saudi Arabia to meet 
this long-term strategy.
In Australia, the business is now 
structured around long-term 
sustainment and upgrade activities 
and we are progressing further 
opportunities with the Australian 
government to provide leading 
defence build and support capabilities. 
MBDA has a strong order book 
that underpins future growth built 
on the effective partnerships it 
has established with its domestic 
customers and recent export success. 
The business will look to further this 
domestic and export strategy in the 
air, maritime and land domains.
Oman
The Oman Typhoon and Hawk aircraft 
programme, being undertaken by Platforms 
& Services (UK), is on track for commencement 
of aircraft deliveries in 2017. Separately, we 
continue to fulfil our legacy industrial 
participation obligations in Oman through 
delivery of an agreed training and knowledge 
transfer programme.
MBDA
In 2015, the German government announced 
its intention to acquire a ground-based air 
defence system based upon the Medium 
Extended Air Defence System missile defence 
system being developed by MBDA in 
partnership with Lockheed Martin. MBDA 
has now submitted its proposal for the 
development of this system. 
In a significant development for the Aster 
surface-to-air missile family, France and Italy 
have jointly launched development of the 
Aster 30 Block 1 NT (New Technologies) missile 
which will provide enhanced capabilities 
against the ballistic missile threat. 
MBDA is responsible for the delivery of 
the majority of the UK’s complex weapons 
requirements. During the year, a number 
of contracts have been awarded to MBDA, 
including a contract to supply Advanced 
Short-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (ASRAAM) for 
F-35 Lightning II aircraft, a development phase 
contract for SPEAR 3 (a multi-purpose stand-off 
strike weapon for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft), 
and a demonstration and manufacture contract 
for the supply of the Sea Ceptor air defence 
weapon system for the Type 26 frigate.
The UK Ministry of Defence awarded 
MBDA a contract for additional Common 
Anti-air Modular Missiles to support its land 
requirements.
The Meteor Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air 
Missile achieved its most significant milestone 
to date during the Farnborough International 
Airshow in 2016 when it was officially 
declared in operational service on Swedish 
Air Force Gripen JAS 39 combat jets. 
Two significant contracts were signed 
with Qatar, including the supply of Aster/
VL Mica air defence systems and the Exocet 
MM40 Block 3 anti-ship missile for the 
Naval surface fleet, as well as a Missile 
Coastal Defence System.
MBDA has secured an aircraft weapons 
package contract from India and continues 
to pursue weapons package orders as part 
of export contracts for Typhoon and other 
aircraft platforms.

 Annual Report 2016 Corporate 
responsibility
Corporate responsibility is a key enabler for our business, 
supporting sustainable long-term performance by 
managing non-financial risks that can impact reputation 
and shareholder value.
Introduction
Our corporate responsibility programmes 
focus on:
– developing an inclusive, diverse 
workplace to drive innovation and 
performance (see page 22);
– instilling responsible behaviour to be 
a trusted partner (see page 55);
– supporting customer confidence in our 
business by continuously improving 
standards of safety for employees and those 
using our products (see page 56); and
– proactively managing the environmental 
impacts of our facilities and products 
to improve efficiencies and cost savings 
(see page 57).
We set global corporate responsibility priorities, 
which are enacted at a local level. These are 
incorporated into objectives and programmes 
for diversity and inclusion, business conduct, 
safety, and the environment.
Corporate responsibility in action
Continuously improving  
standards of safety
External recognition 
for health and safety 
performance
Naval Ships, part of our UK Maritime 
business, was awarded a Five Star 
Award in Occupational Health and 
Safety following a British Safety 
Council audit in December.
The audit involved an in-depth 
examination of our entire health and 
safety management systems and 
associated arrangements, focusing 
on key aspects of our approach to 
managing occupational health and 
safety. Naval Ships exceeded in four 
out of five of the best practice 
indicators, achieving 94%, which 
is rated as excellent and equates to 
the maximum five star award.
As a Five Star organisation, Naval 
Ships will be eligible to apply for the 
2017 Sword of Honour award, which 
recognises the best of the best in 
health and safety management.

Trust and integrity
We aim to be recognised as a leader in 
business conduct. This helps us to earn 
and maintain stakeholder trust and sustain 
business success.
We continue to build a culture where our 
senior leaders and employees are empowered 
to make the right decisions and to know 
where to go for help. Our Code of Conduct 
sets out clear expectations on ethical conduct 
and we offer training and support to help 
people understand the right thing to do. 
During 2016, we rolled out face-to-face ethics 
training that covered dilemmas based on real 
issues that employees have faced across the 
business. Employees also received additional 
training related to their specific role.
Our Ethics Officers are appointed across 
our business and provide face-to-face advice 
and support on how to understand policies, 
resolve issues and report concerns.
Employees also have access to our 24-hour 
Ethics Helpline to ask for support or report 
concerns anonymously. There were 1,121
1
 
calls to the Ethics Helpline in 2016, broadly 
consistent with the number of calls in 2015, 
and our anonymity rate compares favourably 
with peer companies. Almost half of the 
ethics contacts received are requests for 
guidance and advice. We encourage 
employees to contact us as early as possible 
when a potential incident can still be 
prevented by timely advice.
All enquiries reported to Ethics Officers 
and via the Ethics Helpline were reviewed 
and reported either to the Ethics Review 
Committee or, in BAE Systems, Inc., to 
the Ethics Review Oversight Committee.
Our governance framework sets out the 
way we do business and covers the products 
we make and export, and our relationships 
with business partners, including advisers 
and suppliers. 
Our Responsible Trading Principles, 
Product Trading Policy and Pursuit of 
Export Opportunities Policy help employees 
to make informed decisions about the 
business opportunities we pursue and require 
evaluation and approval of trading risks. 
Our policies and procedures require that all 
advisers are approved via our due diligence 
process and authorised by an external panel. 
Advisers with whom businesses have an 
ongoing relationship go through this process 
every two years. 
We depend on suppliers to support our 
business and provide innovative and 
cost-effective products. Our relationships 
with suppliers are often long term due to 
the length of our product lifecycles, so we 
aim to build relationships with suppliers who 
share our values and who embrace standards 
of ethical behaviour consistent with our own. 
Our Procurement Policy specifically addresses 
ethical standards in our supply chain. We set 
our expectations for suppliers within our 
contracts and Supplier Principles – Guidance 
for Responsible Business, including standards 
on ethical conduct, health and safety, 
environment, and human rights.
We remain committed to respecting the 
human rights of our employees in the 
workplace and encourage our suppliers 
and business partners to adopt the same 
or similarly high standards of ethical 
behaviour. During 2016, we undertook 
work to understand our human rights 
impacts and this will continue into 2017. 
We have also responded to the UK Modern 
Slavery Act. Our statement can be found 
on baesystems.com.
We continue to work with peers across the 
defence industry to improve ethical standards. 
During 2016, we continued to participate in 
the International Forum on Business Ethical 
Conduct’s Council and worked with the 
Institute of Business Ethics to set up a UK 
Defence Ethics Network.
2017 priorities
We will continue to build a culture 
of responsible behaviour by engaging 
employees in annual ethics training 
and supporting them in making the 
right decisions. We will also be 
reviewing and refreshing our Code 
of Conduct for launch in 2018.

 Annual Report 2016 Health and safety
The safety of our employees, and those 
who work on, or visit, our sites, remains a 
priority for the Company. Our safety culture 
and our customers demand extremely high 
standards for all aspects of health and safety. 
Many of our employees operate heavy 
equipment, work at height or do physically-
demanding work in high-risk environments 
and confined spaces. 
We aim to mitigate or manage safety risks 
by finding new ways to enhance safety 
standards, increase awareness and continually 
drive a strong safety culture. Managers across 
our businesses are supported by teams of 
health and safety specialists who provide 
expert advice, training and tools to put our 
safety policies into practice. 
We use the Recordable Accident Rate to 
measure workplace injuries. This metric, 
along with the number of major injuries, is 
used to determine an element of executive 
bonus (see page 87). There was a 21% 
reduction in the Recordable Accident Rate in 
2016, representing an improvement against 
target. In addition, there was a 26% reduction 
in the total number of major injuries recorded 
in the year as we continued to focus on 
reducing risk and embedding safety culture 
to drive improvement.
We want our employees to be healthy at work 
which depends on good health at home too. 
We operate wellbeing programmes to address 
this, which may include health risk assessments 
and campaigns to encourage employees to 
take responsibility for their health, including 
addressing risk factors for health problems 
such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. 
Our Employee Assistance Programme is a 
confidential service available to employees 
and includes support and advice on 
personal matters.
2017 priorities
We will continue to: drive towards a 
world-class level of safety performance; 
focus on the management and reduction of 
safety risk; and drive a strong safety culture 
through communication, awareness and 
visible leadership. We will target a 10% 
reduction in the Recordable Accident Rate.

the ‘R U OK?’ suicide prevention campaign. 
This year, we held a series of ‘R U OK?’

Resource efficiency
We are committed to minimising the 
environmental impact of our operations. 
Resource efficiency is an important measure 
of business effectiveness at BAE Systems and 
is embedded within our Environment Policy. 
As a major manufacturer, our operations 
have an impact on the environment – from 
the energy and resources we use to the 
waste that we generate. Minimising this 
impact shrinks our environmental footprint 
and reduces our operating costs. 
Each of our businesses sets annual targets 
to use resources as efficiently as possible 
with a focus on energy, water and waste.
We are improving energy efficiency and 
de-carbonising our energy supply to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. The nature of 
our business, with large-scale projects and 
fluctuations in orders, makes it challenging 
to set a global emissions reduction goal. 
We set energy targets at business level 
that contribute to an overall reduction. 
The majority of our greenhouse gas emissions 
come from the energy we use across our 
facilities. The Group’s total greenhouse gas 
emissions decreased by 4% in the 12 months 
to 31 October 2016.
We use our engineering expertise to improve 
resource efficiency and make our products 
more sustainable. We work to reduce 
environmental impacts at every stage of 
their lifecycle – from concept, design and 
manufacture through to use and disposal.
2017 priorities
We will continue to drive improvements 
in the management of materials and 
resources across all businesses.
Community investment

Methodology
The greenhouse gas emissions data is reported in line with the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard ‘Operational Control’ approach, and emission factors 
for fuels and electricity are taken from the UK government’s 
Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), 
published at www.ukconversionfactorscarbonsmart.co.uk/
The CO 2 e associated with carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous 
oxide is reported. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride 
are estimated to be immaterial to total emissions and are, 
therefore, not reported.
The principal record of the Group’s worldwide facilities is its 
legal department’s Global Property Database.
Greenhouse gas emissions are primarily calculated from 
energy consumption records reported via the Group’s global 
environmental database. Where actual usage data is not available 
for facilities and residences within the Global Property Database, 
an estimated consumption is used based on the type of building.
Greenhouse gas emissions related to business travel include air 
travel data for the majority of the global business and rail data 
for business units operating in the UK and US. These data are 
taken from travel suppliers’ procurement records.
Emissions from joint ventures and pension scheme properties 
not occupied by the Group are not included. Where a business 
or facility is acquired during a reporting year, it will be included 
in our reporting in the next full reporting year after the change.
The Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol ‘market-based’ method have been 
calculated as 638,772 tonnes CO 2 e. Supplier-specific emission 
factors have been sought for our most significant operating 
regions, but were either deemed of insufficient quality to use 
at present or were unavailable. Therefore, in line with the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance, this figure has been 
calculated using residual-mix emission factors where available 
for our UK and US operations. In our other significant operating 
regions, residual-mix emission factors are either unavailable or 
within the margin of error of the standard grid average emission 
factor and, therefore, the latter has been used.

 Annual Report 2016 How we 
manage risk
Effective management of risks 
and opportunities is essential 
to the delivery of the Group’s 
strategic objectives and the 
creation of sustainable 
shareholder value.
Board
The Board has overall responsibility for 
determining the nature and extent of the risk 
it is willing to take, and ensuring that risks are 
managed effectively across the Group.
Risk is a regular agenda item at Board meetings 
and the Board reviews risk as part of its annual 
strategy review process. This provides the 
Board with an appreciation of the key risks 
within the business and oversight of how 
they are being managed.
The Board delegates oversight of certain risk 
management activities to the Audit and 
Corporate Responsibility committees as follows:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee monitors the Group’s 
key risks identified by the risk assessment 
processes and reports its findings to the Board 
twice a year. It is also responsible for reviewing 
in detail the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control policies, and 
procedures for the identification, assessment 
and reporting of risk.
Corporate Responsibility Committee
The Corporate Responsibility Committee 
monitors the Group’s performance in managing 
the Group’s significant non-financial risks, 
including those arising in respect of business 
conduct, health and safety, and the 
environment. The Committee reports its 
findings to the Board on a regular basis.
Approach
The Group’s Risk Management Policy is 
set out in the Operational Framework, the 
Group’s detailed governance framework.
The Group’s approach to risk management 
is aimed at the early identification of key risks, 
mitigating the effect of those risks before 
they occur and dealing with them effectively 
if they crystallise.
The Group is committed to the protection 
of its assets, which include human resources, 
intellectual and physical property, and 
financial resources, through an effective risk 
management process, underpinned where 
appropriate by insurance.
Reporting within the Group is structured so 
that key issues are escalated through the 
management team and ultimately to the 
Board where appropriate. The underlying 
principles of the Group’s risk management 
processes are that risks are monitored 
continuously, associated action plans reviewed, 
appropriate contingencies provisioned and 
this information reported through established 
management control procedures.
The Board has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of risk 
management and internal control processes, 
including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems, in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The Company has developed a system 
of internal controls that was in place throughout 
2016 and to the date of this report.
As with any system of internal control, the 
policies and processes that are mandated in 
the Operational Framework are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Financial and non-financial risks
Financial risks expose the Group to potential 
costs which are quantifiable on the basis 
that their probability and impact can be 
understood adequately and related to the 
financial statements.
Non-financial risks cannot be assessed readily 
in financial terms and, therefore, cannot be 
reflected reliably in the financial statements.
Process
Businesses
The responsibility for risk identification, 
analysis, evaluation and mitigation rests 
with the line management of the businesses. 
They are also responsible for reporting and 
monitoring key risks in accordance with 
established processes under the Group’s 
Operational Framework.
The Group’s risk management process is set out 
in the Risk Management Policy, a mandated 
policy under the Operational Framework, and, 
in respect of projects, in the Lifecycle 
Management Framework, a core business 
process under the Operational Framework. 
Further guidance is provided by a Risk 
Management Maturity self-assessment tool.
Identified risks are documented in risk 
registers showing: the risks that have been 
identified; characteristics of the risk; the basis 
for determining mitigation strategy; and 
what reviews and monitoring are necessary. 
Each risk is allocated an owner who has 
authority and responsibility for assessing 
and managing it.
Project risks are reported and monitored in 
Group-mandated format Contract Review 
Packs, which are reviewed by management 
at monthly Contract Reviews. The financial 
performance of projects is reported and 
monitored using Contract Status Reports, 
which form part of the Contract Review Pack. 
These include programme margin metrics, 
which are reviewed regularly by the Executive 
Committee and Board. Project margin is 
recognised after making suitable allowances 
for technical and other risks related to 
performance milestones yet to be achieved.
In addition, every six months, the businesses 
complete an Operational Assurance Statement 
(OAS), which is a mandated policy under the 
Operational Framework. The OAS is in two 
parts: a self-assessment of compliance with 
the Operational Framework; and a report 
showing the key financial and non-financial 
risks for the relevant business. Together with 
reviews undertaken by Internal Audit and 
the work of the external auditors, the OAS 
forms the Group’s process for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the system of internal controls.
Executive Committee
The key financial and non-financial risks 
identified by the businesses from the risk 
assessment processes are collated and reviewed 
by the Executive Committee to identify those 
issues where the cumulative risk, or possible 
reputational impacts, could be significant.
Management responsibility for the management 
of the Group’s most significant non-financial 
risks is determined by the Executive Committee. 
The OAS and non-financial risk registers are 
reviewed regularly by the Executive Committee 
to monitor the status and progression of 
mitigation plans, and these key risks are 
reported to the Board on a regular basis.
Principal risks
The Board has carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity. Such risks have been identified 
as principal based on the likelihood of 
occurrence and the potential impact on the 
Group, and have been identified through the 
application of the policies and processes 
outlined above. These risks, together with 
details of how they are being mitigated and 
managed, are detailed on pages 60 to 63. 
As a result of its assessment of the Group’s 
principal risks, the Board has determined 
that the principal risks are consistent with 
the 2015 Annual Report.

 Annual Report 2016 Principal 
risks
Risks are identified based on the likelihood of occurrence 
and the potential impact on the Group. The Group’s principal 
risks are identified below, together with a description of how 
we mitigate those risks.
1. Defence spending
The Group is dependent on defence spending.
Description
In 2016, 91% of the Group’s sales were 
defence-related.
Defence spending by governments can 
fluctuate depending on political considerations, 
budgetary constraints, specific threats and 
movements in the international oil price.
There have been constraints on government 
expenditure in a number of the Group’s 
principal markets, in particular in the US and 
UK. The results of the 2016 elections in the 
US and EU referendum in the UK have led to 
a period of uncertainty.
Impact
Lower defence spending by the 
Group’s major customers could 
have a material adverse effect 
on the Group’s future results 
and financial condition.
Mitigation
The business is geographically spread across US, UK and 
international defence markets:
– In the US, following the two-year Bipartisan Budget 
Act signed in 2015, the defence market outlook is 
improving with encouraging signs of a return to 
growth in defence budgets. 
– In the UK, the Spending Review in 2015 outlined a 3.1% 
real-term increase to the defence budget by 2020 as part 
of the commitment to spend 2% of Gross Domestic 
Product on defence.
– In Saudi Arabia, regional tensions continue to dictate that 
defence remains a high priority.
The diverse product and services portfolio is marketed 
across a range of defence markets. BAE Systems benefits 
from a large order backlog, with established positions 
on long-term programmes in the US, UK, Saudi Arabia 
and Australia.
BAE Systems has a growing portfolio of commercial 
businesses, including commercial avionics and the 
commercial areas of the Applied Intelligence business. 
Sales in commercial markets represented 9% of the 
Group’s sales in 2016.
2. Government customers
The Group’s largest customers are governments.
Description
The Group has long-standing relationships 
and security arrangements with a number of 
its government customers, including its three 
largest customers, the governments of the 
US, UK and Saudi Arabia, and their agencies. 
It is important that these relationships and 
arrangements are maintained.
In the defence and security industries, 
governments can typically modify contracts 
for their convenience or terminate them at 
short notice. Long-term US government 
contracts, for example, are funded annually 
and are subject to cancellation if funding 
appropriations for subsequent periods are 
not made. Governments also from time to 
time review their terms of trade and underlying 
policies and seek to impose such new terms 
and policies when entering into new contracts.
The Group’s performance on its contracts 
with some government customers is subject 
to financial audits and other reviews which 
can result in adjustments to prices and costs.
Impact
Deterioration in the Group’s 
principal government relationships 
resulting in the failure to obtain 
contracts or expected funding 
appropriations, adverse changes 
in the terms of its arrangements 
with those customers or their 
agencies, or the termination 
of contracts could have a 
material adverse effect on the 
Group’s future results and 
financial condition.
Mitigation
Government customers have sophisticated procurement 
and security organisations with which the Group can have 
long-standing relationships with well-established and 
understood terms of business.
In the event of a customer terminating a contract for 
convenience, the Group would typically be paid for work 
done and commitments made at the time of termination.

3. International markets
The Group operates in international markets.
Description
BAE Systems is an international company 
conducting business in a number of regions, 
including the US and the Middle East.
The risks of operating in some countries include: 
political changes impacting the business 
environment; economic downturns, political 
instability and civil disturbances; changes in 
government regulations and administrative 
policies; the imposition of restraints on the 
movement of capital; the introduction of 
burdensome taxes or tariffs; and the inability to 
obtain or maintain the necessary export licences.
The Group is exposed to volatility arising 
from movements in currency exchange rates, 
particularly in respect of the US dollar, euro, 
Saudi riyal and Australian dollar. There has 
been volatility in currency exchange rates in 
the period since the announcement of the 
results of the 2016 elections in the US and 
EU referendum in the UK.
Judicial Review proceedings into the process 
followed by the UK government in granting 
defence export licences to the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia are under way. A judgment is 
expected in the near future, which may impact 
the granting of export licences for the sale of 
arms to the Kingdom. The conclusion of the 
proceedings is awaited.
Impact
The occurrence of any such events 
could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s future results 
and financial condition.
Mitigation
The Group has a balanced portfolio of businesses across 
a number of markets internationally. The Group benefits 
from a large order backlog, with established positions 
on long-term programmes in the US, UK, Saudi Arabia 
and Australia.
The Group’s policy is to hedge all material firm transactional 
currency exchange rate exposures.
The Group’s contracts are often long-term in nature and, 
consequently, it may be able to mitigate these risks over the 
terms of those contracts.
Political risk insurance is held in respect of export contracts 
not structured on a government-to-government basis.
BAE Systems has a well-established legal and regulatory 
compliance structure aimed at ensuring adherence to 
regulatory requirements and identifying restrictions that 
could adversely impact the Group’s activities, including 
export control requirements.
4. Competition in international markets
The Group’s business is subject to significant competition in international markets.
Description
The Group’s business plan depends upon its 
ability to win and contract for high-quality new 
programmes, an increasing number of which 
are expected to be in markets outside the US 
and UK.
The Group is dependent upon US and UK 
government support in relation to a number 
of its business opportunities in export markets.
Impact
The Group’s business and future 
results may be adversely impacted 
if it is unable to compete 
adequately and obtain new 
business in the markets in which 
it operates.
Mitigation
The Group has an international, multi-market presence, 
a balanced portfolio of businesses, leading capabilities 
and a track record of delivery on its commitments to 
its customers.
The Group continues to invest in research and 
development, and to reduce its cost base and improve 
efficiencies, to remain competitive.
In the UK, export contracts can be structured on a 
government-to-government basis and government support 
can also involve military training, ministerial support for 
promotional activities and financial support through UK 
Export Finance. In the US, most of the Group’s defence 
export sales are delivered through the Foreign Military Sales 
process, under which the importing government contracts 
with the US government.

 Annual Report 2016 Principal risks

5. Laws and regulations
The Group is subject to risk from a failure to comply with laws and regulations.
Description
The Group operates in a highly-regulated 
environment across many jurisdictions and 
is subject, without limitation, to regulations 
relating to import-export controls, money 
laundering, false accounting, anti-bribery and 
anti-boycott provisions. It is important that the 
Group maintains a culture in which it focuses 
on embedding responsible business behaviours 
and that all employees act in accordance with 
the requirements of the Group’s policies, 
including the Code of Conduct, at all times. 
Export restrictions could become more 
stringent and political factors or changing 
international circumstances could result in 
the Group being unable to obtain or maintain 
necessary export licences.
Impact
Failure by the Group, or its sales 
representatives, marketing advisers 
or others acting on its behalf, to 
comply with these regulations 
could result in fines and penalties 
and/or the suspension or debarment 
of the Group from government 
contracts or the suspension of the 
Group’s export privileges, which 
could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group.
Reduced access to export markets 
could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s future results 
and financial condition.
Mitigation
BAE Systems has a well-established legal and regulatory 
compliance structure aimed at ensuring adherence to 
regulatory requirements and identifying restrictions that 
could adversely impact the Group’s activities.
Internal and external market risk assessments form an 
important element of ongoing corporate development 
and training processes.
A uniform global policy and process for the appointment 
of advisers engaged in business development is in effect.
The special compliance officer, appointed pursuant to 
commitments concerning ongoing regulatory compliance 
made in the course of the 2011 settlement with the US 
Department of State, concluded his monitorship in May 2014 
and, at the invitation of BAE Systems, agreed to remain in a 
limited capacity for a limited further period of time.
6. Contract risk and execution
The Group has many contracts, including a small number of large contracts and fixed-price contracts.
Description
In 2016, 49% of the Group’s sales were 
generated by its 15 largest programmes. 
At 31 December 2016, the Group had five 
programmes with order backlog in excess 
of £1bn.
A significant portion of the Group’s revenue 
is derived from fixed-price contracts. Actual 
costs may exceed the projected costs on 
which the fixed prices are agreed and, since 
these contracts can extend over many years, 
it can be difficult to predict the ultimate 
outturn costs.
It is important that the Group maintains a 
culture in which it delivers on its projects 
within tight tolerances of quality, time and 
cost performance in a reliable, predictable 
and repeatable manner.
Impact
The inability of the Group to 
deliver on its contractual 
commitments, the loss, expiration, 
suspension, cancellation or 
termination of any one of its large 
contracts or its failure to anticipate 
technical problems or estimate 
accurately and control costs on 
fixed-price contracts could have 
a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s future results and 
financial condition.
Mitigation
Contract-related risks and uncertainties are managed under 
the Group’s mandated Lifecycle Management process.
A new leadership development programme for project 
directors is being deployed across the Group, covering the 
leadership competencies required to manage complex 
projects containing significant levels of risk and uncertainty.
A significant proportion of the Group’s largest contracts are 
with the UK Ministry of Defence. In the UK, development 
programmes are normally contracted with appropriate 
levels of risk being initially held by the customer and 
contract structures are used to mitigate risk on production 
programmes, including where the customer and contractor 
share cost savings and overruns against target prices.
The Group has a well-balanced spread of programmes and 
significant order backlog which provides forward visibility.
The Group has limited exposure to fixed-price design and 
development activity which is in general more risk intensive 
than fixed-price production activity.
Robust bid preparation and approvals processes are well 
established throughout the Group, with decisions required 
to be taken at the appropriate level in line with clear 
delegations of authority.
7. Contract cash profiles
The Group is dependent on the award timing and cash profile of its contracts.
Description
The Group’s profits and cash flows are 
dependent, to a significant extent, on the 
timing of, or failure to receive, award of 
defence contracts and the profile of cash 
receipts on its contracts.
Impact
Amounts receivable under the 
Group’s defence contracts can be 
substantial and, therefore, the timing 
of, or failure to receive, awards and 
associated cash advances and 
milestone payments could materially 
affect the Group’s profits and cash 
flows for the periods affected, 
thereby reducing cash available to 
meet the Group’s cash allocation 
priorities, potentially resulting in the 
need to arrange external funding 
and impacting its investment grade 
credit rating.
Mitigation
The Group’s balance sheet continues to be managed 
conservatively in line with its policy to retain an investment 
grade credit rating and to ensure operating flexibility.
The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity 
requirements to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet 
its operational needs and maintain adequate headroom.

8. Pension funding
The Group has an aggregate funding deficit in its defined benefit pension schemes.
Description
In aggregate, there is an actuarial deficit 
between the value of the projected liabilities 
of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes and the assets they hold.
The deficits may be adversely affected by 
changes in a number of factors, including 
investment returns, long-term interest rate and 
price inflation expectations, and anticipated 
members’ longevity. There has been volatility 
in US and UK bond yields, in particular in the 
period since the announcement of the results 
of the 2016 elections in the US and EU 
referendum in the UK. The reduction in 
discount rates in 2016 has increased the Group’s 
share of the accounting net pension deficit.
Impact
Increases in pension scheme 
deficits may require the Group 
to increase the amount of cash 
contributions payable to these 
schemes, thereby reducing cash 
available to meet the Group’s 
other cash allocation priorities.
Mitigation
In the UK, new employees have been offered membership 
of defined contribution rather than defined benefit 
schemes since April 2012 and, in the US, employees have 
not accrued salary-related benefits in defined benefit 
schemes since January 2013.
 In 2014, deficit recovery plans, the longest of which runs 
until 2026, were agreed with the trustees of the Group’s 
UK pension schemes following triennial funding valuations. 
The next UK triennial funding valuations will commence 
in April 2017 and, in conjunction with the trustees of the 
schemes and other stakeholders, the Group will be looking 
at various options with a focus on the longer-term view.
9. Information technology security
The Group could be negatively impacted by information technology security threats.
Description
The security threats faced by the Group 
include threats to its information technology 
infrastructure, unlawful attempts to gain access 
to its proprietary or classified information and 
the potential for business disruptions associated 
with information technology failures.
Impact
Failure to combat these risks 
effectively could negatively impact 
the Group’s reputation among its 
customers and the public, cause 
disruption to its business operations, 
and could result in a negative 
impact on the Group’s future 
results and financial condition.
Mitigation
The Group has a broad range of measures in place, 
including appropriate tools and techniques, to monitor 
and mitigate this risk.
10. People
The Group’s strategy is dependent on its ability to recruit and retain people with appropriate talent and skills.
Description
Delivery of the Group’s strategy and business 
plan is dependent on its ability to compete to 
recruit and retain people with appropriate 
talent and skills, including those with 
innovative technological capabilities.
The Group’s business plan is targeting an 
increasing level of business in international 
export markets outside the US and UK. It is 
important that the Group recruits and retains 
management with the necessary international 
skills and experience in the relevant jurisdictions.
Impact
The loss of key employees or 
inability to attract the appropriate 
people on a timely basis could 
adversely impact its ability to 
deliver its strategy, meet the 
business plan and, accordingly, 
have a negative impact on the 
Group’s future results and 
financial condition.
Mitigation
The Group recognises that its employees are key to 
delivering its strategy and business plan, and focuses on 
developing the existing workforce and hiring talented 
people to meet current and future requirements.
The Group has well-established graduate recruitment and 
apprenticeship programmes and, in order to maximise the 
contribution that its workforce can make to the performance 
of the business, has an effective through-career capability 
development programme.
In order to seek to maximise its talent pool, the Group is 
committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment

 Annual Report 2016 Chairman’s  
governance letter
Dear Shareholders,
During the course of the year, the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) published its report 
on Corporate Culture and the Role of Boards. 
The report contained key observations 
about the value of culture in driving the 
right behaviours in the boardroom and at 
all levels in the company. We were pleased 
to see that the report included a case study 
on BAE Systems, illustrating the work we had 
undertaken over a number of years to foster 
high levels of personal trust between trade 
unions and the Company’s senior leadership. 
As part of this year’s Board evaluation, we 
have asked Board members to reflect on the 
questions asked in the FRC’s report concerning 
corporate culture and provide their thoughts 
on what they see within BAE Systems. In 2017, 
we will be using the output from this to guide 
the Board in its further consideration of this 
important governance matter.
We welcomed the FRC’s report and the 
principles of stakeholder engagement, 
directors’ duties and the importance of 
corporate integrity and responsible 
behaviour that it outlined.
Towards the end of 2016, there was another 
important governance publication, with the 
UK government publishing a wide-ranging 
Green Paper on Corporate Governance 
Reform. Both documents quote in full the 
basic duty of a company director as detailed 
in Section 172 of the Companies Act.
In summary, the duty is to promote the 
success of the company and, in doing so, 
have regard to, amongst other matters, the 
long-term consequences of any decisions, the 
interests of employees and other stakeholders, 
and the desirability of maintaining high 
standards of business conduct. As required 
by the Companies Act, this Annual Report 
informs shareholders how the directors have 
performed this duty.

Directors’ report
Financial statements
In particular, you will find on page 66 an 
outline of our governance structure, including 
how the Board sets the values, behavioural 
expectations, policies and processes that 
guide all that we do in BAE Systems – and 
also how the Board maintains oversight over 
performance and compliance with these 
delegated requirements. As our Chief 
Executive tells all employees, “It’s not just 
about what we do, but how we do it.”.
Achieving high standards of corporate 
governance is an intrinsic part of the Board’s 
agenda and, to that end, we completed a 
wide-ranging externally-facilitated evaluation 
of Board performance during the year. 
The review reported very favourably on 
Board member attitude, engagement and 
contribution, and on the processes, practices 
and principles employed by the Company. 
A summary of the areas for development 
agreed by the Board is shown above. 
We have recently completed the internal 
performance evaluation for 2017, which 
will focus on the areas recommended for 
improvement in 2016 and, as mentioned 
above, any actions necessary in response 
to the FRC’s report on culture.
In parallel with an independent appraisal of 
Board performance, from time to time we 
commission an independent survey of our 
shareholders’ views and perceptions of the 
performance of the Company. This document 
is shared with all Board members as a 
supplement to the updates provided by 
senior executive Board members. In addition, 
as Chairman, I consult with our large 
shareholders to ensure they have a full 
understanding of our strategy and I and 
the Board have received direct feedback on 
their views on the Company, its performance 
and governance.
My contact is supplemented by independent 
meetings held by the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee with specific 
reference to our pay policy and reward 
structures. Of course, as required by the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, shareholders 
have access to the Senior Independent 
Director if there are concerns that cannot 
be resolved through the normal Chairman 
or Chief Executive channels.
As a Board, we are committed to the highest 
standards of behaviour, transparency and 
open discussion, together with diversity of 
opinion, experience, background and gender.
By adopting this approach, and regular 
engagement and involvement with all our 
stakeholders, the Board believes that it is 
best placed to align its policies and practices 
in keeping with the required governance 
standards of the day.
The following report details how the Board 
has applied the UK Corporate Governance 
Code principles in the conduct of our business 
during the year.
Sir Roger Carr Chairman

 Annual Report 2016 Strategic report

Financial statements
Operational Framework
The Board has put in place a detailed governance framework, the Operational 
Framework. It sets out how we do business across BAE Systems and encapsulates 
our values, policies and processes, together with clear levels of delegated 
responsibility aimed at ensuring that all of our employees and businesses act 
in a clear, accountable and consistent manner. 
Core business processes
These core business processes are mandated by the Operational Framework and designed to ensure consistent planning, reporting 
and review of business performance across all businesses:
How we work
The processes and policies in the Operational Framework set out the principles of good governance which, together with our 
culture, guide our work and behaviour in support of the strategy set in our Group strategic framework (see page 16). Here we 
set out the values that we ask all our employees to demonstrate in their day-to-day work, wherever they are in the world. We also 
confirm our commitment to Total Performance which defines how we achieve success based on Customer Focus, Programme 
Execution, Financial Performance and Responsible Behaviour.
Organisation
From the Board downwards, we set out how we are organised and the responsibilities of the Board, the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive, the Executive Committee, our Functional Councils (such as Engineering, Human Resources and Procurement) and 
the senior executives charged with running our businesses.
Governance
The UK Corporate Governance Code’s (the Code) principles are embedded in the Operational Framework and its policies and 
processes underpin all the disclosures made by the Board pursuant to Code provisions.
How we conduct our business is fundamental to the success of BAE Systems. The Operational Framework sets out our approach 
and the standards to which we adhere. It includes the following:
Code of Conduct
Sets the standards to which we all work.
Responsible Trading Principles
We do not compromise on the way 
we do business and here we mandate 
a principles-based approach to our 
business activity.
Internal controls
These are the controls that apply to all 
our businesses and provide assurance 
regarding:
– the reliability and integrity of information;
– compliance with policies, processes, laws, 
regulations and contracts;
– the safeguarding of assets and protection 
against fraud; and 
– the economical and efficient use of 
resources.
Operational Assurance Statement (OAS)
This key governance process requires that 
a return is completed every six months by 
each operational and functional business 
head, reporting their formal view against 
such matters as compliance with law and 
regulation, ethical business conduct, 
financial controls, risk management, 
compliance with business planning 
processes, health and safety, conflicts of 
interest, delegated authorities, appointment 
of advisers and product safety. There is a 
separate OAS process for our joint ventures. 
Our Internal Audit function owns the OAS 
process. It is managed independently from 
management functions with the Internal 
Audit Director being responsible to the 
Audit Committee and reporting directly 
to the Chief Executive.
Risk framework
This is how we identify, analyse, evaluate 
and mitigate risk (see page 58).
Workplace and operational 
environment
This covers how we expect our people 
to be managed and the obligations placed 
on us all concerning avoiding conflicts of 
interest, anti-bribery, and managing the 
security of our people, information and 
other assets.
Delegated authorities
As part of a robust system of internal 
controls, the Board has delegated certain 
authorities to executive management. 
Delegation is subject to financial limits and 
other restrictions, above which matters 
must be referred to the Board.
IBP
(Integrated Business Planning)
Approved by the Board annually, 
creates a consistent approach 
to strategic planning, aligning 
resources with the delivery of 
forecast financial performance 
and strategic objectives.
LCM
(Lifecycle Management Policy)
How we plan and manage the 
execution of all projects above a 
certain minimum level, providing 
decision gate reviews at key 
stages from initial opportunity 
to final closure.
M&A
(Mergers & Acquisitions Policy)
A structured approach to 
mergers, acquisitions and 
disposals.
TPL
(T otal Performance Leadership)
A set of people-related 
activities that help to identify, 
select, manage and reward 
leaders, and facilitates 
succession planning.

 Annual Report 2016 Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
Governance disclosures
UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code) Compliance
The Company was compliant with the 
provisions of the Code throughout 2016 
and the Board has applied its principles in 
its governance structure and operations. 
The following statements are made in 
compliance with the Code.
Risk management and internal 
control statement
The Board is responsible for the Company’s 
risk management and internal control systems. 
It has delegated responsibility for reviewing in 
detail the effectiveness of these systems to the 
Audit Committee, which reports to the Board 
on its findings so that all directors can take a 
view on the matter. 
An overview of the processes used to identify, 
evaluate and manage the principal risks can be 
found on pages 58 and 59. These processes 
are an integral part of our governance 
framework, the Operational Framework, 
details of which can be found on page 67. 
The Operational Framework mandates the 
Operational Assurance Statement process, 
which is owned by the Company’s Internal 
Audit function and is one of the principal 
processes used by the Board in monitoring the 
effectiveness of control systems.
The risk management and internal control 
systems detailed in the Operational Framework 
were in place throughout the year and the 
Board, having reviewed their effectiveness, 
believes they accord with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting.
Viability statement
As required by the provisions of the Code, the 
Board has undertaken an assessment of the 
future prospects of the Company taking into 
account the Company’s current position and 
principal risks. This assessment was informed 
by the following business processes: 
Risk management process
The Company has developed a structured 
approach to the management of risk 
(see above) and the principal risks identified 
are considered as part of the Board’s annual 
review of the Integrated Business Plan. 
Integrated Business Plan (IBP) 
The IBP represents a common process with 
standard outputs and requirements that 
produces an integrated strategic and business 
plan for the Group and also for each of its 
businesses over the following five years. 
The use of a five-year period provides a 
robust planning tool against which long-term 
decisions can be made concerning, amongst 
other things, strategic priorities, funding 
requirements (including commitments to 
Group pension schemes), returns made to 
shareholders, capital expenditure and resource 
planning. Longer-term strategic inputs also 
form part of the IBP process and, where 
activity is required to meet such long-term 
priorities, this is provided for in the plan. 
The detailed plan is reviewed each year 
by the Board as part of its strategy review 
process. Once approved by the Board, the 
IBP provides the basis for setting all detailed 
financial budgets and strategic actions across 
the businesses, and is subsequently used 
by the Board to monitor performance. 
Liquidity analysis
The Board regularly reviews an analysis based 
on the financial output from the IBP, looking 
at the forecast working capital requirements, 
cash flow, and committed borrowing and 
other funding facilities available to the 
Company over the five-year period covered 
by the IBP. This analysis includes ‘stress testing’ 
of the Company’s liquidity under severe, but 
plausible, scenarios as developed from the IBP, 
including the impact of changes to the terms 
of trade it enjoys with different customers 
and its funding commitments to Group 
pension schemes. 
In undertaking its review of the IBP in 2016, 
the Board considered the prospects of the 
Company over the five-year period covered 
by the process. On the basis of this and other 
matters considered and reviewed by the Board 
during the year, the Board has reasonable 
expectations that the Company will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the following five years. 
It is recognised that such future assessments 
are subject to a level of uncertainty that 
increases with time and, therefore, future 
outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted 
with certainty. Also, this assessment was made 
recognising the principal risks that could have 
an impact on the future performance of the 
Company (see pages 60 to 63).
Going concern statement
Accounting standards require that directors 
satisfy themselves that it is reasonable for 
them to conclude whether it is appropriate 
to prepare financial statements on a going 
concern basis and the Code requires that, if 
appropriate, this report includes a statement 
to that effect. Following review, the directors 
have concluded that it is appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis for these 
financial statements and have not identified 
any material uncertainties concerning the 
Company’s ability to do so in the 12-month 
period from the date of approving them. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Directors
In compliance with the Code, all directors are 
subject to annual election by shareholders. 
The Chairman has confirmed that, based on 
the formal performance evaluations undertaken 
in 2016 and 2017, all remain committed to 
the role and the individual performance of 
all directors continues to be effective. Also, 
in compliance with the Code, the Company 
ensures that non-executive directors have 
sufficient time to fulfil their obligations. This 
is assessed when a director is appointed and 
also in the event of there being a material 
change to an individual’s circumstances. 
During the year, Ian Tyler was appointed 
chairman of AWE Management Limited, a 
non-listed company, which was in addition 
to his chairmanship appointments with Cairn 
Energy and Bovis Homes Group. In 2016, 
the Chairman led an assessment of Mr Tyler’s 
other time commitments and agreed that 
they would not impact his ability to fulfil his 
commitments to the Company, but it was 
agreed that this should be reviewed on an 
annual basis. This review was undertaken and 
it was confirmed that his other commitments 
were not having an impact on his ability to 
fulfil his commitments to the Company. His 
other commitments have reduced recently as 
a result of him stepping down from the board 
of Mediclinic International plc.
Elizabeth Corley and Charles Woodburn, who 
joined the Board during the year, completed 
structured induction programmes.
The Company considers that all of the 
non-executive directors identified on page 69 
of this report are independent in accordance 
with Code provisions.

 Annual Report 2016 Audit Committee  
report
Dear Shareholders,
The section on the Audit Committee’s year 
on page 75 provides an overview of the 
work that we have undertaken in the last 
12 months and I would like to focus here 
on specific aspects.
The work performed by the Company’s 
auditor is of fundamental importance to 
the Audit Committee and the wider Board, 
to management and, of course, to you as 
shareholders to whom the Independent 
Auditor’s report on pages 117 to 120 is 
specifically addressed.
As planned, the Audit Committee has 
embarked on a process that will result in 
new auditors being appointed in 2018. 
One major aspect of re-tendering any 
external audit appointment is dealing with 
the potential loss of experience and expertise 
of the incumbent auditor and the inevitable 
learning curve faced by the incoming auditor. 
Continuity and consistency of audit quality 
is important and, as a Committee, we have 
been mindful of the need to allow for a 
shadow audit period encompassing both 
the 2017 half-year and full-year audits as 
part of the auditor appointment process. 
Audit rotation regulations going forward 
will require large companies to re-tender 
their external audit service no less 
frequently than every ten years. 
The timeline for our audit re-tender process 
is shown below. As previously reported, 
KPMG LLP and their predecessors have been 
in place as the Company’s auditors since 
1981 without re-tender and, given the length 
of their current incumbency, have not been 
invited to tender, but are committed to 
ensuring a smooth transition. Our KPMG 
audit engagement partner, Ian Starkey, 
has been in this role since 2013 and the 
end of his five-year tenure, when he would 
otherwise rotate off our audit, will coincide 
with the appointment of a new audit firm.
The tender is being competed by highly 
capable and experienced international audit 
firms with strong track records and technical 
expertise. In coming to the shortlist, we 
concluded that the complexity of the Group 
and the scale of its international business 
require an incoming auditor to have the 
global reach and experience of one of the 
larger firms. Whilst there are no contractual 
obligations that would restrict the selection 
of an incoming auditor, increased regulatory 
restrictions on non-audit services work that 
can be undertaken by an incumbent auditor 
mean that both outgoing and incoming 
auditors have to be unencumbered by the 
provision to the audited entity of certain types 
of non-audit services and this, too, has been 
taken into account in the selection procedure. 
The Committee agreed the Request for 
Proposal documentation sent to the selected 
firms and the Committee members have each 
met with the lead partners of the tendering 
firms. The process is on track and the 
Committee intends to be in a position to make 
our recommendation to the Board on a new 
auditor in May 2017 for the 2018 audit. The 
recommendation will then be put before 
shareholders at the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM).

 Annual Report 2016 Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
Audit independence 
As mentioned above, audit independence 
is coming under increasing focus and we 
have reviewed in detail the confirmation 
and information received from KPMG on 
the arrangements that they have in place 
to safeguard auditor independence and 
objectivity, including specific safeguards in 
place where they are providing permissible 
non-audit services to the Group. 
Non-audit services policy
The Committee has a formal policy 
governing the engagement of the auditors 
to provide non-audit services which we 
review on an annual basis. The policy 
prohibits certain activities from being 
undertaken by the auditors and also places 
restrictions on the employment of former 
employees of the auditors.
Recognising that the auditors are best 
placed to undertake certain work of a 
non-audit nature, the policy permits the 
provision of Audit-Related Services and 
Permitted Non-Audit Services up to limits 
that are pre-approved by the Committee, 
with specific approvals required beyond 
such limits by the Committee.
As part of the 2016 review, we made 
revisions to the policy in order to ensure 
compliance with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s revised regulations on ethical 
standards for auditors and EU regulations 
adopted by the UK which apply prohibitions 
to a range of engagements that could result 
in an auditor facing a conflict of interest. 
As a result, certain services formerly provided 
by KPMG, primarily tax services and investor 
information services, are no longer being 
provided by them with effect from 1 January 
2017. A copy of the revised policy is available 
on the Company’s website, baesystems.com. 
Details of fees payable to the auditors are 
set out on page 132. In 2016, non-audit fees 
represented 19% of the audit fee. The principal 
non-audit services provided by the auditors 
related to tax compliance services, the interim 
review and investor information services. 
Financial statements
The Committee reviews all significant issues 
concerning the financial statements. The 
principal matters we considered concerning 
the 2016 financial statements were:
Recognition of revenue, profit 
and provisioning
We reviewed key estimates and judgements 
prior to publication of the financial statements. 
Our review included the key estimates and 
assumptions applied in determining the 
financial status of the more significant 
programmes, including Typhoon, UK aircraft 
carrier programme, Astute Class submarine 
programme, Saudi British Defence Co-operation 
Programme, losses on US commercial 
shipbuilding contracts, customer payments on 
export orders and JP 2008 Phase 3F programme 
for enhanced satellite communications services 
to the Australian Defence Force. 
Pensions
Recognising the scale of the Group’s pension 
obligation, we reviewed the key assumptions 
supporting the valuation of the retirement 
benefit obligation. This included a comparison 
of the discount and inflation rates used against 
externally-derived data. We reviewed the 
methodology used to allocate a proportion 
of the retirement benefit obligation to equity 
accounted investments and concluded that 
this was appropriate with reference to 
agreements between the Company and those 
companies. We also considered the adequacy 
of disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of 
the deficit to changes in these key 
assumptions (see page 163).
Goodwill
We considered the level of goodwill held 
on the Group’s balance sheet in respect 
of a number of past major transactions 
and whether, given the future prospects 
of these businesses, the value of goodwill 
held on the balance sheet remains appropriate. 
The methodology for impairment testing 
used by the Group is set out in note 8 to the 
Group accounts on page 139. No goodwill 
impairments were identified as a result of 
this review.
External audit
Both the Committee and management – 
and indeed our current auditors – have been 
conscious of the importance of not letting 
the audit re-tender distract us from 
business-as-usual in the audit environment. 
Our discussions with KPMG have focused on 
audit scope and maintaining audit quality, as 
well as ensuring that we have an experienced, 
quality team in place following some recent 
rotations off our account. 
In line with our usual practice, we have 
undertaken a review of the effectiveness 
of the external audit and the output of the 
review following the 2016 year-end audit 
enabled us to recommend to the Board 
that it seek shareholder approval for the 
re-appointment of KPMG LLP at the 2017 
AGM. For the remaining year of KPMG’s 
audit tenure – the financial year ending 
31 December 2017 – the focus will be on 
a smooth transition to the new incumbent 
without compromising audit quality. 
How the effectiveness of the external 
audit process was assessed
Who we survey:
– Executive directors
– Operating group/sector and line 
of business management
– Internal Audit Director
– Other senior executives, including 
key finance roles
Areas we cover:
– Understanding of the Group’s risks
– Audit plan
– Robustness of audit processes
– Objectivity
– Quality of communications
– Ability to provide a seamless service

 Annual Report 2016 Audit Committee report 
continued
Taxation
Whilst tax policy is ultimately a matter for 
the Board’s determination, we reviewed the 
Group’s tax strategy as set out on page 30. 
Twice during the year, we reviewed the 
Group’s tax charge, tax provisions and the 
basis of recoverability of the deferred tax 
asset relating to the Group’s pension deficit. 
During the year, the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) reviewed the tax disclosures in 
the Company’s 2015 Annual Report as part 
of the FRC’s thematic review of tax reporting 
announced in December 2015. The tax 
disclosures of 32 other FTSE 350 companies 
were also reviewed. There were no major 
financial reporting changes arising from this 
review and the enquiries are closed
1
.
Alternative Performance Measures
We reviewed disclosures to ensure that 
guidance issued by the European Securities 
and Markets Authority and the FRC was 
taken into account in the Annual Report.
Going concern and viability statements
The Committee agreed the parameters 
of, and reviewed the supporting report for, 
the going concern statement (see page 71) 
and the statement on the Board’s assessment 
of the prospects of the Company (the viability 
statement on page 71) on the five-year period 
used in the Integrated Business Plan.
How we ensure that the Group’s 
financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable
The process is: 
– comprehensive guidance issued to all 
the contributors at operational level;
– a verification process dealing with the 
factual content of the reports;
– comprehensive reviews undertaken 
at different levels in the Group that 
aim to ensure consistency and overall 
balance; and
– comprehensive review by the directors 
and the Executive Committee.
Internal control and risk
The Board has delegated to the Committee 
responsibility for reviewing in detail the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal control system. 
The Committee’s review of the effectiveness 
of internal controls has encompassed a review 
of the reports relating to the six-monthly 
Operational Assurance Statements (OAS), 
which are submitted by each business or 
function as a mandated policy under the 
Group-wide Operational Framework, and 
controls reports and reports from both 
internal and external auditors. 
A key focus for the Committee is the 
controls environment surrounding the 
Company’s Lifecycle Management (LCM) 
process, the bedrock of our programme 
execution and management. LCM is integral 
to the successful execution of the Group’s 
projects and programmes, and of particular 
importance in the early identification of 
programme risk and the determination of 
profit recognition or provisioning which, you 
will see from above, tend to be areas where 
we are required to exercise judgement. We 
have discussed the outputs of general financial 
and LCM controls testing, and any required 
improvement actions, with management, 
and internal and external audit, with a view 
to ensuring the ongoing robustness of 
programme execution and risk mitigation. 
We have reviewed the ongoing effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management processes 
as part of our wider review of internal 
controls. The Group’s principal risks are set 
out on pages 60 to 63.
Internal audit
Internal Audit plays an integral role in the 
Company’s governance structure and provides 
regular reports to the Committee, including 
the outputs of the twice-yearly OAS process 
and the tracking of remedial action in the case 
of any control failures. 
The annual Internal Audit programme is 
agreed jointly by the Audit and Corporate 
Responsibility committees to ensure that 
the overarching programme covers not only 
financial risk, but also the assessment of 
the effectiveness of key areas of ethical and 
reputational risk. The assurance programme 
covers a broad range of audits covering areas 
such as mandated governance, OAS outputs, 
risk register findings, change programmes, 
and areas relating to responsible behaviour and 
non-financial risk, as well as accommodating 
ad hoc Internal Audit requests. 
During the year under review, and separate 
from the normal regular sessions we hold 
with the Internal Audit Director without 
management present, we held a separate 
session with him which, together with output 
from the annual evaluation of the function, 
is helping us to shape the Internal Audit 
programme to leverage the use of this vital 
resource for valued-added assurance. 
After discussion of the 2016 evaluation 
output with the Internal Audit Director, 
the Committee concluded that the Internal 
Audit function remains effective. We currently 
intend to undertake an external assessment 
of the function in 2017.
How the Committee assesses the 
effectiveness of Internal Audit
Who we survey:
– Group-wide heads of Audit Review Boards
– Other business leaders
– External auditors
Areas for requested feedback include:
– Role of Internal Audit and independence
– Audit planning, processes and execution
– People resources and skilling
– Reporting
Nick Rose
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Competition and Markets Authority Audit Order
The Committee has complied with the provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority 
Audit Order in respect of committee responsibilities and audit re-tending disclosures.
1. In choosing to refer to the FRC’s review, the Company 
is asked by the FRC to make clear that the FRC’s role is 
not to verify the accuracy of the Company’s report and 
accounts or other information provided to the FRC, but 
to consider compliance with reporting requirements. 
The FRC accepts no liability for reliance on its letters on 
this matter by any third party, including but not limited 
to, investors and shareholders.

 Annual Report 2016 Corporate Responsibility  
Committee report
Ian T yler 
Chairman of the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee
Members
Ian Tyler (Chairman)
Harriet Green
Chris Grigg
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee report. The aim of the report is 
to provide you with a view of the key activities 
undertaken by the Committee during the year, 
our areas of focus and what we plan to do 
in 2017.
At the beginning of 2016, the Committee 
agreed a business plan which set out our 
main areas of focus. This allowed us to 
schedule sufficient time to carry out deep-dive 
reviews in these areas. An important factor in 
the success of these reviews is ensuring that 
we meet with the right people from within 
the Company and hear directly from them 
about what we are doing. From them we 
can understand more about the practical 
implications of implementing our policies. 
This is particularly important as we operate 
across a number of countries and cultures 
and this can have an impact on the roll-out 
and embedding of Company-wide policies.
This year we have carried out detailed 
reviews on the following: safety; ethical 
behaviour; product safety; and diversity 
and inclusion. I will discuss each of these 
topics through this report.
Safety
Safety is one of our principal areas of focus 
and will remain so even though we are 
making steps towards achieving world-class 
performance in some of our businesses. The 
Committee has worked with management 
to develop an understanding of what 
world-class safety performance looks like 
and has agreed an approach to how all our 
businesses can challenge themselves to 
improve in this area. This includes the targets 
that are set for achievement at a Group level 
and the timeframe over which these are to 
be achieved. It is important that targets are 
realistic, but also drive continual improvement 
in the most effective way. The Committee 
is particularly interested in how best practice 
is shared, how change is implemented and 
embedded, and how we record information 
on safety and learn from it. 
In 2015, we saw a reduction in the overall 
incident rate but, unfortunately, there was also 
an increase in major injuries. The Committee, 
therefore, reviewed the major individual injury 
incidents in depth to understand whether 
there were lessons learned that could be 
shared across the Company. In support of 
the safety agenda, the Committee also 
looked at how the performance objectives 
could be used to drive actions and behaviours 
to support a reduction in the significant risks 
at our sites – this being key to achieving 
long-term sustainable improvement.
Safety is one of the performance measures 
within the Annual Incentive Plan, which 
applies to the executive directors and also 
to all senior executives across the Company. 
At the end of 2016, the Committee reviewed 
safety performance at Group level and that of 
our principal businesses, and recommended 
the level of achievement to be recognised in 
the incentive plan.
In September, the Committee carried out 
a deep dive into the safety culture in our 
businesses in Saudi Arabia and Australia. 
We are an international business and we 
operate in many different countries, each 
of which has individual challenges when 
it comes to embedding our safety culture. 
In Saudi Arabia and Australia, we operate 
sites across a broad geographical area. 
This can present a challenge for the local 
management team to communicate 
effectively a consistent message on safety 
and to ensure that we are sharing best 
practice. Despite these challenges, the 
Committee was pleased to hear about 
the progress that was being made.
Ethical behaviour
This year, the Committee carried out a review 
of the processes in place to help ensure that 
the Company only takes on business that is 
consistent with its standards of integrity. 
This is governed by our Product Trading Policy 
– a principles-based approach to evaluating 
business opportunities requiring any 
responsible trading risks to be identified as 
part of a structured decision-making process. 
The Committee carried out a deep dive into 
the way in which our Applied Intelligence 
business has augmented its business-winning 
processes to incorporate the requirements of 
this policy and how it has tailored the process 
to its particular business model. In particular, 
we considered the escalation steps that would 
be used if a decision needed to be referred 
upwards, ultimately to the Board. 
The Committee also reviewed the governance 
procedures for our overseas markets. The 
Company has a network of regional business 
development offices that act as the first port 
of call for any business unit seeking to do 
business in that region or country, and it is 
important that we have a consistent and 
robust approach to how we do business 
in all parts of the world. The Committee 
spent time discussing the management of 
overseas offices with our head of business 
development and chief legal counsel who 
support this function.
Product safety
Each year, the Committee reviews the Product 
Safety Policy. The integrity of our supply chain 
is crucial to our ability to provide high-quality 
products and services to our customers. We 
must, therefore, seek assurance at each stage 
of a product’s lifecycle to ensure that our 
quality and ethical standards are being met.

Corporate responsibility in action
Developing first-hand understanding 
of corporate responsibility
Site visit to 
Samlesbury 
and Warton
 More online
 baesystems.com
In 2016, the Committee took the opportunity 
to visit two of the key UK manufacturing 
sites, Warton and Samlesbury, Lancashire. 
Each year, we schedule a full-day visit as it 
gives an opportunity for the Committee to 
develop a first-hand understanding of the 
corporate responsibility successes and 
challenges across the business. This continues 
to be a valuable addition to the calendar 
as it allows us to meet with management 
and employees from different areas of the 
business. The focus of this visit was on 
corporate culture and how the diversity 
and inclusion agenda is being progressed 
by the Military Air & Information business. 
We visited the newly-opened Academy 
for Skills & Knowledge at Samlesbury and 
discussed with the management team 
the recruitment approaches and training 
paths for apprentices. During the year, 
the Committee has also reviewed the 
Product Safety Policy and the visit afforded 
us the opportunity to discuss how this is 
implemented practically and the questions 
that need to be asked when making 
product safety decisions.
Diversity and inclusion
Last year, I reported that we were reviewing 
how the Company planned to create a more 
diverse and inclusive workforce. The nurturing 
of our talent pipeline continues to be a key 
driver towards the long-term goal of bringing 
greater diversity into our senior management 
and executive teams. This is a long-term process 
which starts with the choices made by school- 
leavers and, therefore, general changes in the 
industry as a whole will take time to filter 
organically into the Company demographic. 
The Company is looking at what action it can 
take to support and drive the pace of this 
change. As a Committee, we considered the 
overall objective at Group level and what action 
can be taken to support this. During 2017, we 
plan to spend more time looking at the way 
this is approached at business unit level.
The agenda for the upcoming year will be 
developed to support the Committee in its 
understanding of the corporate responsibility 
challenges facing the business.
As you can see opposite, in 2016, we visited 
two of our UK military aircraft sites. Such visits 
are a great way for members of the Board to 
get out of the boardroom and engage directly 
with employees. We will be doing more of this 
in 2017.

Dear Shareholders,
During the past 24 months, the Committee 
completed a thorough examination of both 
Board composition and senior management 
succession needs. This review was to ensure 
compliance with the highest governance 
standards and to identify and secure the mix 
and skills of the team that was appropriate 
to both current and future requirements.
In reviewing the senior Board membership it 
was acknowledged that the Chief Executive, 
Ian King, may wish to retire in 2017 after 
serving eight years in the role, but that 
all other executive Board positions were 
unlikely to change for the foreseeable future.
A thorough appraisal was conducted of 
candidates that were considered to have 
the mix of talent, experience, skills and 
forward career longevity suitable to take 
the Chief Executive role. In the light of this 
research, Charles Woodburn was recruited 
as Chief Operating Officer with a view that, 
after a period of industry assimilation and 
management responsibility, he would prove 
to be an appropriate successor.
I am pleased to report that, following the 
Committee’s nomination, the Board has 
agreed to appoint Charles to succeed Ian 
King as Chief Executive when he retires 
on 30 June 2017.
In addition to the formal Committee meetings, the Chairman met informally with non-executive directors on a number of occasions during the 
year to discuss Nominations Committee-related matters.
In considering the non-executive roles on 
the Board, it was established that following 
the successful recruitment of Elizabeth Corley, 
the Board structure met the requirements of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, having 
1 1 members, of which one was an independent 
chairman, four executive and six non-executives 
(60% independent for the purposes of the 
Code) made up of three females (27%) and 
two of non-British origin (18%).
The skill set of the Board was identified as 
having large-scale industrial and commercial 
international management experience 
covering the areas of finance, engineering 
and government relationships.
The relatively small size of the Board is 
considered to work well, but on occasion 
places committee membership under pressure. 
Against this background and in the light of 
the skill set analysis, it is our intention to make 
a further two non-executive appointments 
over the next 18 months. Our ambition is to 
identify and appoint one male and one female 
non-executive, ideally with international 
contracting and/or cyber technology 
experience. These appointments will both 
strengthen the existing Board membership 
and prepare for the inevitable departure of 
Board members when they complete their 
third term in 2019.
In addition to Board membership, the 
Nominations Committee has continued 
to consider the development of the senior 
executive team. To ensure Board members 
have adequate exposure to succession plans, 
the formal Board site visits are supplemented 
by more intimate breakfasts and dinners to 
facilitate greater contact between Nominations 
Committee members and high-potential 
executive management. In 2016, these events 
proved to be both popular and valuable for 
directors and managers. 
On a more formal basis, we continue to 
invite members of the Executive Committee 
to occupy a boardroom empty seat in order 
that they may gain useful exposure to the 
workings of a board.
Finally, in keeping with the Hampton Alexander 
report, it is our plan to improve further our 
gender balance in senior executive roles, 
strengthen the wider diversity of our talent 
pipeline and target 33% of Board positions 
to be held by women by 2020. By adopting 
this holistic approach of understanding and 
building the talent within the Company, whilst 
occasionally benchmarking and recruiting 
from outside the organisation, the Board and 
Nominations Committee consider they are 
discharging their responsibilities enthusiastically, 
professionally and appropriately.

Remuneration Committee

Paula Rosput Reynolds (Chairman)

Dear Shareholders,
Over the last year, there has been an 
elevated interest by shareholders and the UK 
government regarding executive remuneration. 
Concerns have been raised about the 
effectiveness of the incentives embedded 
in remuneration schemes, the alignment 
of remuneration with shareholder interests 
and business outcomes, and the quantum 
of rewards afforded to top-level executives. 
While listed companies have often sought 
to standardise their plans, there is a growing 
recognition that one size does not fit all. 
It is with this backdrop in mind that the 
Remuneration Committee (the Committee) 
has considered both the administration of 
our current reward framework and the 
refreshment of our remuneration policy 
(the Policy), the latter of which will be 
subject to a shareholder resolution at the 
2017 Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
We believe that we’ve made substantial 
progress in recent years to build a more 
direct alignment between the Company’s 
strategy and the creation of shareholder value. 
At this same time, we have sought to reduce 
the complexity of our long-term incentive 
arrangements. But this effort is always a work 
in progress; as business circumstances change, 
so must we adapt our policies. 
2017 is, in many ways, a crossroads year 
for BAE Systems. We remain subject to 
rapidly-changing political, economic, defence 
and security conditions around the world. 
Such circumstances require that we redouble 
our efforts to be responsive to the environment 
and to innovate for the long-run health of 
our business. As already announced, Ian King 
will retire and Charles Woodburn has been 
appointed as Chief Executive effective 1 July 
2017. Additionally, given the demographics of 
our workforce, we anticipate that there will be 
a number of other senior-level retirements and 
individuals appointed to replace them over the 
next three to five years. Under the guidance of 
our Chairman, Sir Roger Carr, the Board has 
undertaken a programme which will not only 
assure a smooth transition of leadership but 
also inspire our employees to embrace change. 
Thus, given the external environment of 
heightened sensitivity on remuneration, 
potential senior leadership changes and the 
exigencies of our business, the Committee 
has had much to consider over the last 
number of months. This letter elaborates 
on the Committee’s thinking and reflects the 
extensive input we have received from major 
shareholders. We provide substantial detail in 
this letter so that all shareholders can equally 
consider the various concerns and trade-offs 
that the Committee has considered in 
proposing changes to the policy. 
Nevertheless, the Committee’s overarching 
goal remains the same – to ensure that we are 
providing the proper incentives for sustainable 
high performance by our executive team, to 
do so with transparency for our stakeholders, 
and to assure alignment between business 
results and rewards conferred.
Context to the Committee’s decisions
The Committee is concerned with the full 
spectrum of executive employment matters: 
recruiting, promoting and retaining the best 
top-level leaders, setting the incentives under 
which these leaders operate, and monitoring 
the results they produce and the manner in 
which they produce them. Our overall 
remuneration framework has a number of 
specific objectives. It is designed to motivate 
our key talent to achieve the Company’s 
strategic objectives, to deliver on customer 
commitments, to lead and inspire employees, 
and to drive value for our shareholders. It is 
also designed to be competitive in the 
various markets in which we operate and 
compete for talent. 
There are multiple considerations in the 
design of the overall framework. First, is 
the balance of short-term and long-term 
incentives. Second, is the interplay between 
Group and business segment results and 
individual accomplishments, as well as the 
level of reward afforded to employees in the 
wider Group. Third, is to distinguish between 
the precise numerical results and the character 
of the results themselves, including the manner 
in which they are achieved. Fourth, is the 
balance between absolute shareholder value 
creation and the Group’s performance relative 
to peers. 
Our short-term programme metrics are tied 
to Group performance, business segment 
performance and individual goals, including 
the leadership behaviours that underpin 
BAE Systems’ Total Performance culture. 
Our long-term incentive programme measures 
absolute performance of the Group and 
performance relative to peers. Our framework 
is intended to foster accountability for 
sustaining and growing the Group in a 
responsible manner.
In addition to developing the overall 
remuneration policy and framework, the 
Committee assesses the level of challenge 
within our Annual and Long-Term Incentive 
Plan targets. Annually, in November, the full 
Board reviews and adopts the Integrated 
Business Plan. Thereafter, the Committee 
reviews the specific business targets/metrics 
for the one and three-year periods and 
examines the underlying assumptions, 
including the degree of ‘stretch’ contained 
within them. After setting one and three-year 
targets, the Committee periodically reviews 
progress towards the attainment of the 
objectives. After the close of each year, the 
Committee undertakes a thorough review 
of annual and three-year performance. 
Separately, the Committee regularly considers 
the overall construct of the remuneration 
package to ensure that potential pay 
outcomes are appropriate and reasonable 
against different performance scenarios.

Rationale for the 2017 remuneration 
policy requiring approval at 2017 AGM
Earlier this year, the Committee conducted 
an extensive review of the effectiveness of 
our approved 2014 remuneration policy to 
determine whether it contained sufficient 
flexibility in our future arrangements. The 
Committee concluded that, overall, the 
current reward framework is broadly working 
and recognised that shareholders have 
consistently demonstrated a high level of 
support for the Committee’s application of 
the policy. In terms of overall design principles, 
our review confirmed that the current design 
construct of base salary, Annual Incentive 
and LTIs remains appropriate. Importantly, 
we propose no changes to the overall quantum 
of LTI expected value for executive directors. 
The Committee has spent considerable 
time examining the various alternative 
constructs being advocated by shareholders 
and government. Many of these constructs 
are already featured in our plans, such as 
the use of restricted shares in lieu of 
performance-based shares or options; longer 
mandatory holding periods for shares; and 
higher levels of minimum shareholdings by 
executives. The following revisions to our 
policy are proposed taking account of 
shareholder recommendations. In addition, 
recognising public interest in pay differentials, 
we are disclosing the pay ratio of our current 
Chief Executive to that of the average 
employee of the Group.
Maintain quantum
As a demonstration of the Committee’s 
commitment to continued restraint, there will 
be no change to Annual Incentive opportunity 
levels or LTI expected value levels.
As shareholders will recognise, there is an 
important distinction between the face (or 
‘headline’) award values and the expected 
value of the different LTI vehicles which takes 
into account the performance conditions on 
Performance Shares and Share Options, and 
the inherent share price growth requirement 
to deliver value as summarised in the 
following table:
LTI 
headline 
award
(% of salary)
LTI 
expected 
value
(% of salary)
Chief Executive 550 185
Chief Operating Officer 530 175
Group Finance Director 515 167.5
President and 
Chief Executive Officer 
of BAE Systems, Inc.
 
 
732
 
 
299
We believe reliance on headline values in 
judging the appropriateness of remuneration 
plans is misplaced since it does not account for 
the challenging performance conditions and 
the share price appreciation needed to create 
realised value.
Adjust LTI metrics to align with 
strategic objectives
A key conclusion of the review found that, 
whilst the LTI structure is broadly working, 
better alignment is possible between LTI 
vesting outcomes and Group performance 
and shareholder experience. The Committee 
has previously recognised the need for better 
alignment and, in 2016, the Committee 
added a second TSR measure that benchmarks 
BAE Systems’ performance, not just to its peer 
group, but to the broader group of FTSE 100 
companies. This change was intended to align 
realisation of equity by executive directors 
with the value created for the UK shareholder 
base, whose preferences for income differ 
from the US shareholder base of BAE Systems’ 
global defence peers. 
Notwithstanding the improvement in 
alignment that we anticipate will be fostered 
by this FTSE component to the TSR, the 
Committee believes TSR may be a more 
volatile indicator when used by itself as 
a means for vesting shares. Prospectively, 
the Committee proposes to introduce EPS 
alongside TSR as a performance condition 
applicable to Share Options granted to 
the executive directors, with an equal 
50% weighting on EPS and 50% on TSR 
(as currently applies to Performance Shares). 
Business performance and incentive outcomes in 2016
This resulted in the following incentive outcomes:
– 2016 annual bonus payouts for the executive directors ranged from 82.3% to 92.8% 
of maximum; and
– Performance Share Plan and Share Option awards granted to executive directors 
in March 2014 will lapse in 2017 as the performance conditions were not met.

 Annual Report 2016 Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
Our rationale for this enhancement is to 
recognise the strategic importance of 
achieving consistent absolute growth in 
our markets, not just relative performance. 
In summary, the Committee continues to 
support the use of TSR so that there remains 
an external benchmark of the Group’s 
performance to both defence and FTSE peers. 
At the same time, the Committee believes that 
including three-year earnings targets keeps 
our executives focused on achieving absolute 
growth over each planning period.
Application of reasonable discretion
The Committee is mindful of the shareholder 
requirement for the Committee, and ultimately 
the Board, to exercise judgement when 
determining remuneration awards. In addition 
to the TSR and EPS primary performance tests, 
the Committee confirms and recognises its 
obligation to judge the overall reasonableness 
of the rewards received relative to the overall 
business actions and results achieved. When 
determining the final performance condition 
outcome under the LTIP, the Committee may 
exercise discretion over the number of 
Performance Shares and/or Share Options 
vesting in the light of other important factors 
in the business (reasonable discretion). Such 
factors may include specific financial and/or 
operating conditions as well as judgements 
regarding the overall health and sustainability 
of the Group. Whilst the exercise of such 
discretion may result in vesting of awards going 
upwards, the Committee fully appreciates the 
importance to shareholders of this being used 
in a balanced way, with clear demonstration of 
willingness to apply downward adjustments 
before seeking to increase the potential 
vesting outcome at a future point in time.
Modify the mix of LTI awards for the 
US executive director
Following an extensive review, which included 
data provided by an independent third-party 
adviser with expertise in the US defence 
sector, and in consultation with the board 
of BAE Systems, Inc., the Committee has 
identified that the current LTI construct and 
realisable pay opportunity for our US executive 
director is significantly out of line relative to 
US peer companies. Differences in typical 
US market practice, such as the award of 
share options not being subject to a further 
performance hurdle, mean that the actual 
reward received by our US executive director 
lags that of US peers by approximately 20%. 
This is an unsustainable position and may in 
time affect our ability to recruit and retain 
top-tier talent for this critical position.
To address this issue, and without increasing 
the overall expected value of the LTI, we are 
proposing to simplify the current construct 
of the US executive director’s package by 
eliminating the use of Share Options and 
structuring the design of the LTI with an equal 
weighting in expected value in Performance 
Shares and Restricted Shares as follows:
Expected value (% of salary)
Current Proposed
Performance Shares 121 149
Share Options 78 –
Restricted Shares 100 150
Total 299 299
At the same time, we intend to increase 
the Minimum Shareholding Requirement 
applicable to the US executive director from 
350% to 425% of salary, consistent with 
the higher grant of Restricted Shares and 
in keeping with US market practice.
The limits applicable to awards of Restricted 
Shares contained within the current policy 
will be revised accordingly, with the maximum 
limit on awards being raised from 100% to 
150% and with no more than 50% of the 
overall LTI expected value being delivered 
in Restricted Shares. 
Increase period from grant to final release 
The Committee proposes to increase the 
period from grant to final release to five years 
in respect of Performance Shares and Share 
Options. This will be structured as a three-year 
performance period with a further two-year 
holding period on both Performance Shares 
and Share Options and is applicable to our 
UK executive directors. 
Recognising that extending the vesting/holding 
period beyond three years would significantly 
reduce the competitiveness of the LTI offering 
in the US, the Committee intends to retain 
the current LTI vesting/release profiles for the 
US executive director as follows:
– Performance Shares: three-year performance 
period with phased release of one-third at 
the end of years 3, 4 and 5.
– Restricted Shares: three-year vesting period 
with an additional two-year clawback period.

Concluding comments
On behalf of my colleagues on the Committee, 
and indeed the entire Board, we appreciate 
the input we have received from shareholders 
and representatives of institutional investors. 
These conversations and comments have been 
influential in refreshing our policy. Striking the 
right balance between standardised plans and 
bespoke solutions is a challenging exercise.
The Committee believes that the recommended 
changes will ensure that our arrangements 
are reasonable relative to the complexity and 
challenge of the Group’s business, are globally 
competitive, and remain aligned to the 
Company’s strategic goals and to the interests 
of our shareholders.

This section details the remuneration of the executive 
and non-executive directors (including the Chairman) 
during the financial year ended 31 December 2016 and 
will be proposed for an advisory vote by shareholders 
at the 2017 Annual General Meeting (AGM). It has 
been prepared on the basis prescribed in the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013.
Directors’ remuneration in the year ending 31 December 2017
For the purposes of the Companies Act 2006, the current Directors’ remuneration 
policy (the Policy) at the date of this report took legal effect on 1 January 2015. 
The Policy has been operating in practice since the date of its approval on 7 May 
2014 at the 2014 AGM. The remuneration for 2017 will be implemented as follows:
– The salaries of the current Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer are not 
being increased for 2017 and remain at £982,300 and £750,000, respectively.
– The salary of the Group Finance Director is being increased by 2.5% to 
£585,275 with effect from 1 January 2017.
– The salary of the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. 
is being increased by 3.0% to $1,023,000 with effect from 1 January 2017. 
– Annual and Long-Term Incentive opportunity levels remain in line with 2014 
approved Policy.
– The performance measures and weightings for 2017 for the Annual Incentive 
and Long-Term Incentives are set out on pages 101 and 103, respectively.
– The Committee is of the view that bonus targets for the Annual Incentive are 
commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the Company to 
disclose them in advance. The targets will be disclosed retrospectively after 
the end of the relevant financial year. 
– The fee for the Chairman has been reviewed and is being increased from 
1 February 2017 to £700,000 per annum. This fee will not be reviewed for 
a three-year term.
On 22 February 2017, the Company announced that Ian King would be retiring as 
Chief Executive on 30 June 2017 (see page 91 for related arrangements) and that 
Charles Woodburn, Chief Operating Officer, would be appointed as Chief Executive 
with effect from 1 July 2017. On becoming Chief Executive, Charles Woodburn’s 
base salary will increase to £875,000 per annum. All other provisions of his 
remuneration package will be as set out in the Company’s current remuneration 
policy in respect of the Chief Executive role.
The following decisions have been taken by the Non-Executive Directors’ Fees 
Committee (the composition of which is detailed on page 98):
– The fee structure for non-executive directors has been reviewed and is being 
increased for the first time since 2012 with effect from 1 April 2017 as follows:
– Basic fee to be increased from £75,000 to £80,000 per annum.
– Senior Independent Director’s fee to be increased from £20,000 to £25,000 
per annum.
– Remuneration Committee Chairman’s fee to be increased from £20,000 
to £25,000 per annum.
– Corporate Responsibility Committee Chairman’s fee to be increased from 
£20,000 to £25,000 per annum.
– Audit Committee Chairman’s fee to remain unchanged at £25,000 per annum.
– Travel allowance of £4,500 per meeting, payable on each occasion that 
a scheduled Board meeting necessitates air travel of more than five hours 
(one way), subject to a maximum of six travel allowances per year, to 
remain unchanged.
– No further review of non-executive fees to be undertaken until 1 April 2020.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s current remuneration 
policy approved at the 2014 AGM is 
available on the Company’s website:

The Company’s proposed remuneration 
policy for approval at the 2017 AGM is 
detailed on pages 99 to 111.

* Appointed to the Board on 9 May 2016.
The above table has been subject to audit.
1.  The benefits received by Ian King include the provision of a car allowance and the private use of a chauffeur-driven car 
(2016 £47k; 2015 £47k). The benefits received by Charles Woodburn include the provision of a car allowance and the private 
use of a chauffeur-driven car (2016 £17k; 2015 n/a). The benefits received by Peter Lynas include the provision of a car 
allowance and the private use of a chauffeur-driven car (2016 £19k; 2015 £17k). In addition, Peter Lynas received a second 
residence allowance of £15k (2015 £22k) on the basis disclosed in previous years. Jerry DeMuro’s benefits include private use 
of a chauffeur-driven car and parking (2016 £4k; 2015 £4k); medical and dental benefits (2016 £12k; 2015 £11k); insured life 
and disability benefits (2016 £8k; 2015 £7k); and the private use of a company aircraft (2016 £1k; 2015 £1k).
2.  Further detail on bonus payments is provided on page 87. One-third of the net bonus paid to Ian King, Charles Woodburn, 
Peter Lynas and Jerry DeMuro will be deferred compulsorily into BAE Systems shares for a three-year period, without 
additional performance conditions.
3.  This column relates to the estimated or actual value of Long-Term Incentive Plans for which the performance period ended 
in the relevant financial year. The 2014 PSP
EPS
 award (for which the performance period ended on 31 December 2016) did 
not meet the Earnings per Share (EPS) performance condition and will lapse. The 2014 PSP
TSR
 and ExSOP
2012
 awards (for which 
the performance periods also ended on 31 December 2016) did not meet their TSR performance condition and will lapse.

4.  The figures for Ian King and Peter Lynas in this column reflect defined benefit arrangements and have been calculated in line with 
the method set out in Section 229 of the Finance Act 2004 using a capitalisation factor of 20 to assess the increase in the value of 
the pension promise over the year, net of inflation. Therefore, these figures are sensitive to salary increases and Consumer Prices 
Index (CPI) inflation as follows:
– Salary increase: Pensionable salary is averaged over three years. The differential between the 2016 and prior year figures for 
Ian King reflects his first salary increase in 2016 since 2012.
– CPI inflation: In a year with high CPI inflation, the increase in the value of the pension promise would be lower than in a year 
with lower CPI inflation. For the 2016 figures, the reference CPI inflation has been floored at 0%.
  The figures for Charles Woodburn relate to a salary supplement in lieu of Company pension contributions.
  The figures for Jerry DeMuro include company contributions paid into his Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement.
5.  This column includes (i) the value of Free Share awards under the UK all-employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP) of £530 for Ian King, 
Peter Lynas and half this amount for Charles Woodburn, and Matching Shares under voluntary investment in the SIP for Ian King 
and Charles Woodburn; (ii) for Charles Woodburn, the cash payment of £1,620,000 to recognise forfeited compensation from 
his previous employer, as set out in note 6 below; and (iii) for Jerry DeMuro, the value of the 2016 grant of Restricted Shares. 
This award formed part of Jerry DeMuro’s 2016 LTIP allocation but is required to be reported under ‘Other’ as it has no 
performance conditions attached; his prior year figure relates to a similar Restricted Shares award in 2015.
6.  As previously reported, Charles Woodburn was appointed as Chief Operating Officer on 9 May 2016 and joined the Board as 
an executive director on the same date. His salary on appointment was £750,000, with a maximum bonus opportunity of 200% 
of salary, of which one-third will be deferred in shares for a period of three years. He also receives LTIP awards at the following 
levels: Performance Share award of 230% of salary and Share Option award of 300% of salary as described on pages 102 and 
103. In addition, he received the following awards to take into account the fair value of the awards being forfeited which 
significantly extend the vesting/holding period of the incentives being given up: 
(i)  cash payment of £1,620,000 in respect of incentives earned and payable within six months, of which 50% of this net amount 
must be used to purchase BAE Systems shares within 120 days following payment. Due to BAE Systems being in a closed period 
from 1 January until the announcement of the Company’s results on 23 February, the Remuneration Committee agreed to 
extend the period in which Charles is required to buy the shares to the end of February 2017. These shares must continue to 
be held in accordance with BAE Systems’ Minimum Shareholding Requirement (which has been set at 200% in respect of his 
appointment); and
(ii)  a one-off grant of Performance Shares equal to 266% of salary, subject to the same performance conditions applicable to 
awards made under the LTIP as set out on page 92 with vesting in equal tranches of one-third in 2019, one-third in 2020 and 
the final third in 2021.
 His pension arrangements are set out on page 91. 
7.  Jerry DeMuro is paid in US dollars with the disclosed figures above being converted into sterling at the required exchange rate. 
The 2016 salary figure reflects his 2.5% salary increase and the exchange rate fluctuations experienced in 2016.
Note: On 22 February 2017, the Company announced that Ian King would be retiring as Chief Executive on 30 June 2017 and that 
Charles Woodburn, Chief Operating Officer, would be appointed as Chief Executive with effect from 1 July 2017. See page 91 for 
related details.

The above table has been subject to audit.
1. Adjusted to be on a like-for-like basis with the targets.
2. Performance against the safety element of the bonus was determined by the Corporate Responsibility Committee taking account of the level of significant risk reduction and 
improvement in safety culture, as well as targeted improvements against key safety indicators including an improvement in recordable accidents. The US business demonstrated stretch 
performance against each of these factors, resulting in a maximum award against this element of the bonus in the case of the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc.
3. Achievement of key strategic objectives is determined by the Remuneration Committee based on performance against a combination of base and premier objectives relating 
to the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives and demonstration of leadership behaviours. The assessment of the key strategic objectives for each director is as follows:
 –  Chief Executive Ian King was, among other things, tasked with goals relating to growing the order book, facilitating major programme awards and preparing the organisation 
for leadership succession. With the exception of obtaining certain export awards within 2016, he substantially met the goals as agreed.
 –  Chief Operating Officer Charles Woodburn successfully completed his induction into the Group, assumed full operating responsibility for certain businesses and worked 
collaboratively with Ian King and the Board on a robust succession plan that has led to an agreed timetable for his transition to the role of Chief Executive.
 –  Group Finance Director Peter Lynas delivered robust financial statements and results as well as achieving objectives relating to the Group’s pension schemes and investor relations. 
He continues to work on reducing the extent of certain outstanding legacy financial issues against which provisions are held and have been reduced progressively.
 –  President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. Jerry DeMuro successfully managed the underlying cost base of the US business, thereby improving future competitiveness, 
as well as achieving contract wins. He also met objectives concerning the strategic development of BAE Systems, Inc. and developing domestic and international portfolio positions. 
The majority of the US businesses met or exceeded plan, leading to BAE Systems, Inc. meeting stretch targets overall.

1. The Chief Executive’s remuneration is calculated on the same basis as the single figure of remuneration table.
2. Average employee remuneration is based on staff costs calculated on the same basis as note 3 to the Group accounts, excluding social security costs 
and US healthcare costs.
The Committee is mindful of the relationship between Chief Executive remuneration and remuneration of the wider 
BAE Systems employee population. Therefore, in line with our commitment to transparency, the table above provides 
the ratio of remuneration of the Chief Executive to the average employee of the Group for the past three years. As can 
be seen, the ratio has typically been around 50:1, with the ratio being higher in 2014 as a result of the partial vesting 
of Long-Term Incentive awards in that year. The ratio could range from around 20:1 to 100:1 depending on the level of 
performance against the measures which drive the Annual and Long-Term Incentive Plans.

1. Ian King and Peter Lynas have accrued defined benefit pensions which are reduced if they are taken before normal retirement age. In addition, 
a longevity adjustment factor is applied to their pension accrued after 5 April 2006 to mitigate against life expectancy changes. Their figures allow 
for the current factors in force, whereas in practice the factors are updated annually and those in force at retirement will be applied.
2. The defined benefit figure includes both funded and unfunded arrangements for Ian King and Peter Lynas.
3. Peter Lynas’ accrued benefit will be restated next year to allow for the impact of his divorce, once finalised. However, the added pension value 
received in 2016 will be unaffected.
4. Accrued benefit for Ian King and Peter Lynas is annual pension payable on retirement. Accrued benefit for Jerry DeMuro is the total value of his 
Section 401(k) account, including both employee and company contributions as well as investment returns. Accrued benefit for Charles Woodburn 
is the total value of his defined contribution account, including employee contributions and investment returns.
The above table has been subject to audit.
Ian King and Peter Lynas are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme (ExPS) and the BAE Systems 2000 
Pension Plan (2000 Plan) which together provide a pension for executive directors payable at 62 of 1/30th of three-year 
average final salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members’ contributions (currently 8%). Benefits 
paid prior to age 62 will be subject to actuarial reduction.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target benefit for executive directors payable from normal 
retirement age of 1/30th of Final Pensionable Pay (FPP) for each year of ExPS pensionable service (subject to a maximum 
of two-thirds of FPP). FPP is defined as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 months prior to leaving service in 
respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service from 6 April 2006. The 
ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benefit equal to four times base salary at date of death, and a spouse’s 
death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal retirement age. Spouses’ pensions 
are also payable upon death in retirement and death after leaving the Company’s employment with a deferred pension. 
Once in payment, pensions are increased annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum increase of 
5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year in respect of service from 6 April 2006. Ian King 
and Peter Lynas joined the ExPS in 1999.

Financial statements
The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 1/50th of Final Pensionable Earnings (FPE) for each year of pensionable service, 
payable from a normal retirement age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings. FPE under 
the 2000 Plan is the best consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving, 
less an offset for State pensions. The Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 
2006/07 Plan Year to 20% of base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007/08 Plan Year and thereafter. However, 
there is a guarantee that the FPE figure for benefits in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the 
FPE figure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the benefit of contributions paid on past bonuses. 
Ian King and Peter Lynas have 33 years and 6 months and 31 years and 2 months service, respectively, in the 2000 Plan.
The review of pension policies carried out in 2010 by the Committee concluded that the pension benefits should 
continue to be based on the Company’s registered pension schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the 
Company will continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise so as to mitigate the impact of further 
reductions to the Lifetime Allowance and the impact of the reduced Annual Allowance. Ian King and Peter Lynas were 
given the choice to remain in the current arrangement and pay the increased tax or to take an unfunded promise; they 
both elected for the latter. The Committee has decided that in cases where the Company is to pay an unfunded promise, 
executives will be given the choice to commute some or all of the benefit for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension. 
Where an unfunded pension is taken, ten years after retirement, the executive will be given a further opportunity to 
commute the residual value of the unfunded pension for a lump sum.
Therefore, Ian King’s and Peter Lynas’ individual total pensions are the sum of their 2000 Plan benefits plus the top-up 
from the ExPS, most of which is provided through the unfunded promise referred to above.
Jerry DeMuro participates in a Section 401(k) defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which 
the company will match his contributions up to a maximum contribution of 6% of salary, up to US regulatory limits 
(2016 $15,900; 2017 $16,200). In 2016, the company paid contributions of $14,867 into this arrangement. 
Charles Woodburn participates in the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme Defined Contribution Retirement Plan 
(EPS DCRP), which is a defined contribution arrangement for senior executives. Charles Woodburn contributes the 
maximum £10,000 per annum into the EPS DCRP arrangement as permitted by the Annual Allowance limit and a 19% 
salary supplement is paid in lieu of the Company contributions.
 
Executive director changes
As announced by the Company on 22 February 2017, the following arrangements will apply in relation to Ian King when he retires as a director 
and ceases employment on 30 June 2017. The arrangements are strictly in accordance with the Company’s remuneration policy, approved by 
shareholders at the AGM on 7 May 2014, and the rules of the Company’s 2000 Pension Plan and Executive Pension Scheme outlined in the 
2015 Annual Report.
(a)  Ian King’s retirement will constitute early retirement with Company consent for share plan and pension purposes and, accordingly:
 (i)  he will be entitled to an immediate pension. Under the rules of the 2000 Pension Plan and Executive Pension Scheme, a pension 
of 1/30th of three-year final average salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members’ contributions (currently 8%) 
is payable at 62 years of age. Benefits paid prior to age 62 are subject to actuarial reduction, currently a reduction of 4% to annual 
benefits for each year that retirement takes place prior to age 62, with proportionate reductions applied in respect of part years. 
Mr. King will be 61 at the date of his retirement and his pension payments will be reduced accordingly;
 (ii)  unvested share awards and options under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan will vest at the normal vesting date, subject to 
testing of the relevant performance conditions at the end of the normal performance period. Share awards will be reduced pro rata 
on the basis of complete months from the grant date to 30 June 2017. Any share options that vest will remain exercisable for a period 
of six months from the vesting date;
 (iii) unvested deferred bonus awards will be preserved and will vest at the normal vesting dates; and
 (iv)  vested share options awarded in 2012 under the Executive Share Option Plan will remain available to exercise in the six-month period 
from 1 July 2017. The award will lapse if not exercised during this period.
(b)  He will continue to be covered by the Company’s Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy and his current director’s indemnification 
arrangements will remain in force;
(c)  He will continue to be bound by those provisions of his service agreement which continue to apply following cessation of employment, 
including post-termination restrictive covenants and confidentiality provisions;
(d)  He will be eligible for an Annual Incentive payment for 2017, determined by the Remuneration Committee, based on an assessment of 
individual and Company performance. Any bonus will be pro-rated for his six months of service during 2017 and will be paid at the normal 
date following the end of the 2017 financial year. One-third of the net bonus will be compulsorily deferred into shares in the normal way;
(e) No award will be granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2017;
(f) No termination payment will be payable; and
(g)  Taxable benefits comprising the provision of a car allowance and the private use of a chauffeur-driven car will cease from 30 June 2017.
On becoming Chief Executive, Charles Woodburn’s base salary will increase to £875,000 per annum. All other provisions of his remuneration 
package will be as set out in the Company’s remuneration policy in respect of the Chief Executive role.

2. The 2016 award of Performance Shares made to Charles Woodburn comprises two elements as reported in the 2015 Annual remuneration report, 
these being: (i) his annual grant of Performance Shares equal to 230% of salary; and (ii) a one-off grant of Performance Shares equal to 266% of 
salary as part of the Company’s arrangements to buy out certain bonus and long-term incentives previously awarded by Charles Woodburn’s former 
employer and forfeited as a consequence of joining BAE Systems. The Share Option figure represents his annual grant, also as previously reported in 
the 2015 Annual remuneration report.
Key: LTIP – Long-Term Incentive Plan. PS – Performance Shares. SO – Share Options. RS – Restricted Shares.
Note: Performance Shares and Restricted Shares – Shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting. Performance Shares are intended to be free share 
awards and are structured as a nil cost option to give the participant more flexibility as to the timing of the benefit. For the US executive director, awards 
of Performance Shares are classified as contingent awards (rather than share options) and are deliverable on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of 
grant, subject to attainment of the performance condition.

Description of share plans and summary of performance conditions
PSP/LTIP Performance Shares
Shares under award vest after satisfaction of the three-year performance condition. Shares under award attract dividends 
prior to vesting. Awards that vest are exercisable in three equal tranches between the third and seventh anniversary of 
vesting (being capable of exercise on a phased basis from the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of grant). For US 
participants, the awards are automatically delivered at the end of years three, four and five, subject to the performance 
condition being achieved. Since 2015, shares have been awarded under the LTIP (a single umbrella plan) that was 
approved at the 2014 AGM as detailed on page 101 and are termed ‘Performance Shares’.
Awards made to the UK executive directors since 2008, and to date to the current US executive director, have been 
weighted 50% on the PSP

 performance condition and 50% on the PSP

at 3% average growth per annum, 50% vesting at 5% average growth per annum and 100% vesting at 7% average 
growth per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these parameters. Awards will not vest unless the Board 
is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance. In taking 
such a view, the Committee may consider (but not exclusively) the following financial metrics: net cash/debt; order book; 
risk; and project performance.

made from 2016, 50% of the TSR measure on the current peer comparator group of 13 other international defence 
companies and 50% on a TSR percentile ranking against the companies in the FTSE 100 index. Under both the 
sectoral and FTSE 100 comparator groups, no shares vest if the Company’s TSR is below the top 50% of TSRs 
achieved by the comparator group, with 25% vesting at median, 100% vesting if it is in the top quintile and vesting 
on a straight-line basis between these two parameters; and

For awards made up to and including 2015, the proportion of the award capable of exercise is determined by the

100% vesting if it is in the top quintile and vesting on a straight-line basis between these two parameters.
RSP/LTIP Restricted Shares
The RSP is not subject to a performance condition as it is designed to address retention issues principally in the US. 
The shares are subject only to the condition that the participant remains employed by the Group at the end of the 
vesting date (three years after the award date). Shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting. Since 2015, 
shares have been awarded under the single umbrella plan that was approved at the 2014 AGM as detailed on 
page 101 and are termed ‘Restricted Shares’. Awards made from 2015 are subject to a further two-year clawback 
period after the initial three-year vesting period.
Statement of directors’ shareholdings and share interests
Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)
Executive directors are compulsorily required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal to a 
set percentage of base salary. An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or options 
exercised through the executive share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive schemes by retaining 50% of the net 
value (i.e. the value after deduction of exercise costs and tax) of shares acquired under these schemes. Once the Initial 
Value is achieved, a Subsequent Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum of 25% of the net 
value must be retained on each exercise or acquisition. Shares owned beneficially by the director and his/her spouse 
count towards the MSR. The MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a director. Any case of 
non-compliance would be dealt with by the Committee. 
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value: 
Initial Value Subsequent Value
Ian King 150% 300%
Charles Woodburn 100% 200%
Peter Lynas 100% 200%
Jerry DeMuro 175% 350%
Ian King and Peter Lynas were both in excess of their ‘Subsequent Value’ MSR at 31 December 2016. Jerry DeMuro 
joined the Board in 2014 and his personal holding of shares in the Company at 31 December 2016 stood at 53%. The 
higher MSR values applicable to Jerry DeMuro recognise the higher LTI opportunity and broader US market practice. 
Charles Woodburn joined the Board in May 2016 and his personal shareholding in the Company at 31 December 2016 
stood at 21%.
There are no shareholding requirements for the Chairman or the non-executive directors.

Awards under the PSP and Performance Shares granted under the LTIP are classified as share awards with performance 
for the US executive director and as share options with performance for the UK executive directors.
Since 31 December 2016, Ian King has acquired an additional 65 shares under the Partnership and Matching shares 
elements of the Share Incentive Plan and Charles Woodburn has acquired an additional 73 shares under the Partnership 
and Matching shares elements of the Share Incentive Plan so that their beneficial shareholdings at the date of this report 
stood at 1,862,886 and 26,727, respectively.
There have been no changes in the interests of the remaining directors in the shares of BAE Systems plc between 
31 December 2016 and the date of this report.
Since the date of this report, Ian King has exercised an option over the 256,279 shares shown as vested but unexercised 
in the table above; the resulting shares were disposed of thus his beneficial shareholding as at 23 February 2017 remained 
at 1,862,886. In addition, Charles Woodburn has acquired a further 46,569 shares taking his beneficial shareholding as 
at 24 February 2017 to 73,296 shares; this acquisition completed the purchase of shares required to be made from the

Directors’ remuneration policy
for approval at the 2017 Annual General Meeting
This Directors’ remuneration policy (the Policy) will take legal effect from the conclusion of the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM. 
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) considers remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains aligned 
with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the market. However, in the absence of exceptional or 
unexpected circumstances which may necessitate a change to the Policy, there is currently no intention to revise the 
Policy more frequently than every three years. We use target performance to estimate the total potential reward and 
benchmark it against reward packages paid by BAE Systems’ competitors.
The Policy is to set base salary with reference to the relevant market-competitive level. Actual total direct reward reflects 
the performance of the individual and the Company as a whole. The aim is to deliver an overall remuneration package for 
executive directors which provides an appropriate balance between short-term and long-term reward and between fixed 
and variable reward as described in the table below.
Whilst our Long-Term Incentive Plan provides the Committee with discretion in respect of vesting outcomes that affect the 
actual level of reward payable to individuals, as explained on page 102, such discretion would only be used in exceptional 
circumstances and, if exercised, disclosed at the latest in the report on implementation of the Policy (i.e. the Annual 
remuneration report) for the year in question.
Changes compared to the policy approved at the 2014 AGM
The Policy contains no components which were not in the remuneration policy approved at the 2014 AGM. However, 
the material changes from the policy approved in 2014 are summarised below with the supporting rationale provided 
in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s letter on pages 79 to 81:
Salary
– Clarity on cap on salary increases.
Annual incentive
– Introduction of separate maximum for Chief Operating Officer.
– Introduction of limits for new executive director role.
– Incorporation of malus and clawback mechanisms.
Long-Term Incentives (LTI)
– Introduction of reasonableness discretion.
– Introduction of separate maximum for Chief Operating Officer.
– Introduction of limits for new executive director role.
– Clarity on flexibility to vary weightings of different award types and the associated impact on opportunity 
levels subject to the parameters set out.
– Incorporation of malus and clawback mechanisms.
– Introduction of two-year holding period for shares acquired on vesting of awards to non-US directors.
– Introduction of Earnings per Share (EPS) alongside Total Shareholder Return (TSR) on share options with 
equal weighting.
– Removal of Share Options for US executive director and redistribution into Performance Shares and Restricted 
Shares to maintain current Expected Value.
– Increase in Minimum Shareholding Requirement for US executive director.
Pension
– Participation in executive defined contribution retirement plan (or cash equivalent) introduced as default pension 
vehicle for new directors.
– Inclusion of salary supplement as vehicle to offset impact of Lifetime Allowance and/or Annual Allowance.
Non-executive directors’ fees
– Introduction of maximum for Chairman’s fees and benefits.

 Annual Report 2016 Directors’ remuneration policy 
continued
Executive directors’ policy table 
Base salary
Purpose and link to strategy
Recognise market value of role and individual’s skills, experience and performance to ensure the business can attract 
and retain talent.
Operation
Salaries are reviewed annually. Business and individual performance, skills, the scope of the role and the individual’s time in the role are 
taken into account when setting and assessing salaries, as is market data for similar roles in the relevant market comparator group.
The comparator group for UK executive directors is comprised of selected companies from the FTSE 100 and is constructed to position 
BAE Systems around the median in terms of market capitalisation. For the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc., 
the comparator group is drawn from companies in the US aerospace and defence sectors, together with similar organisations in the 
general industry sector where BAE Systems, Inc. is positioned at the median of the comparator group by reference to revenue size.
Maximum opportunity
When considering salary increases for the executive directors in their current roles, the Committee considers the general level of 
salary increase across the Group and in the relevant external market.
Actual increases for the executive directors in their current roles will generally not exceed the average percentage increase for 
employees as a whole, taking account of the level of movement within the relevant UK/US comparator group.
As a maximum, in exceptional circumstances (such as a material increase in job size or complexity while performing the same role, 
or a recently appointed executive director where the salary is positioned low against the market), the increase will not exceed 10% 
in any single year for executive directors performing the same role. If an individual’s role changes then a salary increase above 10% 
may be awarded in any single year to position their salary appropriately in accordance with the base salary principles described under 
‘Operation’ above. As a matter of policy, no new executive director role will have a salary greater than the Chief Executive at that time.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
None.
Annual incentive
Purpose and link to strategy
Drive and reward annual performance of individuals and teams on both financial and non-financial metrics, including 
leadership behaviours in order to deliver sustainable growth in shareholder value. 
Compulsory deferral into shares increases alignment with shareholder interests.
Operation
The annual incentive is driven off in-year financial performance, corporate responsibility and other non-financial objectives 
measured at the Group and individual level. 
One-third of the total annual incentive amount is subject to compulsory deferral for three years in BAE Systems shares without 
any matching.
A malus mechanism may be applied to any bonus, and a clawback mechanism may be applied to the deferred bonus shares until 
up to the end of the three-year deferral period, in respect of 2015 or subsequent years where:
– the Company is entitled to terminate employment for cause or the participant has engaged in misconduct (including breach 
of policy) which gives rise to other disciplinary sanction;
– the results of the Company and/or relevant business or businesses for any period have been restated or subsequently appear 
materially inaccurate or misleading; and/or
– any Group company or business unit has made a material financial loss.
Cash dividends are payable to the participants on the shares during this three-year deferral period.

Maximum opportunity
Chief Executive and the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc.: 225% of salary
Chief Operating Officer: 200% of salary
Group Finance Director: 160% of salary
Where a new executive director role is established, the maximum opportunity will not exceed that of the Chief Operating Officer 
role as set out above.
The pay-out for maximum performance is double the payout for on-target performance. The pay-out for target performance is half 
of the respective maximum percentages above. The pay-out for achieving a threshold performance is 40% of the payout for on-target 
performance (i.e. 20% of maximum), with no pay-out for achieving less than this. Pay-out for performance between targets is calculated 
on a straight-line basis.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
Performance is assessed on an annual basis, using a combination of the Group’s main performance indicators for the year and other 
objectives designed to support the Group’s strategy. Metrics, which will include financial and non-financial metrics as well as the 
achievement of personal objectives, will be determined and weighted each year according to business priorities. 75-80% will relate 
to financial metrics.
Metrics and weightings to be determined annually. Proposed metrics and weightings applicable in 2017:
Group EPS – 40%
Group cash – 25%
Order intake – 15%
Safety – 5%
Personal objectives designed to support the Group’s strategy – 15%
See notes 4 and 5 on page 106 regarding the selection and weighting of performance metrics.
Notwithstanding performance against the applicable metrics, all bonus payments are at the discretion of the Committee, which will 
be based on an assessment of the individual’s personal contribution to business performance over the relevant year and leadership 
behaviours demonstrated in making that contribution, relative to others.
Long-Term Incentives (LTI)
Operation
Long-term incentives will operate under the BAE Systems Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.
The size of awards granted is based on a percentage of salary, which is divided by the share price to determine the number of 
shares subject to the award.
Dividend equivalents in respect of vested shares may be paid at the time of vesting (or exercise, in the case of options) and are 
not taken into account when determining individual limits.
A malus and clawback mechanism may be applied, until two years after vesting, or if sooner, the fifth anniversary of grant, or 
the occurrence of certain corporate events, to all awards granted on or after 25 March 2015 where:
– the Company is entitled to terminate employment for cause or the participant has engaged in misconduct (including breach 
of policy) which gives rise to other disciplinary sanction;
– the results of the Company and/or relevant business or businesses for any period have been restated or subsequently appear 
materially inaccurate or misleading;
– any Group company or business unit has made a material financial loss; and/or
– the measurement of any performance condition does not reflect the actual performance of the Company over the 
performance period.
The Committee will establish the targets for each measure at the start of each performance period based on Group projections 
and market expectations for the business. The performance conditions for previous awards are described in the Annual 
remuneration report.
Awards and performance conditions can be adjusted to take account of variations of share capital and other transactions or events.
On a change of control or similar transaction, awards generally will vest to the extent performance conditions are then satisfied 
(if applicable) and then be pro-rated to reflect the acceleration of vesting unless the Committee decides otherwise. Alternatively, 
awards may be exchanged for equivalent awards over shares in the acquiring company.
The share plan rules may be amended from time-to-time by the Committee in certain circumstances including minor changes 
for administrative, tax or other regulatory purposes.
Subject to this Policy, performance conditions of awards already granted may be amended in accordance with their terms or if 
anything happens which causes the Committee reasonably to consider it appropriate to do so.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
See notes 4 and 5 on page 106 regarding the selection and weighting of performance metrics.

 Annual Report 2016 Directors’ remuneration policy 
continued
Executive directors’ policy table continued
Long-Term Incentives (LTI) continued
Maximum opportunity
Over the lifetime of this Policy, the Committee will have discretion to vary the weighting of different types of awards within the 
framework set out below, but the overall LTI Expected Value (EV) will remain the same (assuming the LTI EV is calculated as 50% 
of face value for Performance Shares, 20% of face value for Share Options and 100% of face value for Restricted Shares):
– UK executive directors’ awards will consist of a mix of Performance Shares and Share Options (with Share Options comprising 
no more than 50% of overall LTI EV).
– US executive directors’ awards will consist of a mix of Performance Shares and Restricted Shares (with Restricted Shares comprising 
no more than 50% of overall LTI EV).
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
See below in relation to Performance Shares and Share Options. 
In addition to the primary performance tests set out below, the Committee confirms and recognises its obligation to judge the 
overall reasonableness of the rewards received relative to the overall business actions and results achieved. When determining the 
final performance condition outcome under Performance Share and Share Option awards, the Committee will have discretion over 
the number of awards vesting in light of other important factors in the business (reasonable discretion). The discretion may result in 
vesting of awards going upwards (subject to maximum 100% vesting of awards) as well as downwards. Any factors will be properly 
considered as they arise and any discretion to the calculated results will be applied in a highly disciplined manner and the rationale 
and impact will be reported transparently. The use of reasonableness discretion would apply to LTI awards granted to executive 
directors after the commencement of this Policy.
See notes 4 and 5 on page 106.
Long-Term Incentives – Performance Shares
Purpose and link to strategy
Drive and reward delivery of sustained long-term EPS and TSR performance aligned to the interests of shareholders.
Operation
For non-US executive directors, awards, typically in the form of nil-cost options, will vest subject to performance and service conditions 
on the fifth anniversary of grant. These will be exercisable between the fifth and tenth anniversary of grant or such shorter period as 
may be specified by the Committee.
For US executive directors, awards are delivered as conditional share awards (RSUs). To maintain the competitiveness of the LTI offering 
in the US, awards will vest automatically on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of grant, subject to performance conditions.
Policy maximum opportunity
Award levels applicable to UK executive directors for normal annual grants (assuming the current LTI EV weightings in Performance 
Shares and Share Options) are as follows:
Chief Executive: 250% of salary
Chief Operating Officer: 230% of salary
Group Finance Director: 215% of salary
Award levels applicable to US executive directors for normal annual grants (assuming the current LTI EV weightings in Performance 
Shares and Restricted Shares) are as follows:
President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc.: 298% of salary
Note the percentages above could be exceeded if the LTI EV weightings were to be varied (see above).
Where a new executive director role is established, the maximum opportunity will not exceed that of the Chief Operating Officer 
role as set out above.

Long-Term Incentives – Performance Shares continued
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
Metrics and weightings will be as follows (subject to the Committee’s ability to adjust as set out below):
– 50% of award based on TSR relative to one or more appropriate comparator groups over the three-year performance period as 
selected by the Committee at the time of grant:
– Vesting of each comparator group is determined as: nil vesting if TSR ranked below median in the peer group; 25% vesting if 
TSR ranked at the median; 100% vesting if TSR ranked in the upper quintile; pro-rata vesting for performance between median 
and upper quintile.
– If more than one comparator group is used, vesting of the TSR portion of the award will be determined by the average of the 
vesting outcomes from each comparator group.
– Award subject to a secondary financial measure as set out on page 93.
– 50% of award based on average annual EPS growth over the three financial years starting with that in which the award is granted, 
with 25% vesting for threshold performance, 50% vesting for target performance and 100% vesting for stretch performance. 
Pro-rata vesting for intermediate performance.
The metrics and weightings applicable in 2017 are as follows:
– 50% of award based on TSR relative to the following two comparator groups over the three-year performance period:
– At least ten other international defence companies selected by the Committee at the time of grant.
– All companies in the FTSE 100 index.
– 50% of award based on average annual EPS growth over the three financial years starting with that in which the award is granted, 
with threshold performance requirement as average annual EPS growth of 3%, target performance requirement as average annual 
EPS growth of 5% and stretch performance requirement as average annual EPS growth of 7%.
Note that awards granted to executive directors from the date of the 2017 AGM would be subject to application of reasonableness 
discretion in light of other important factors in the business as described earlier.
The Committee can adjust the weighting of the EPS and TSR conditions and, if considered appropriate, the Committee may introduce 
an alternate performance condition aligned to the Company’s strategy.
See notes 4 and 5 on page 106.
Long-Term Incentives – Share Options
Purpose and link to strategy
Drive and reward delivery of sustained long-term EPS and TSR performance and sustained improvement in the Company’s 
share price.
Operation
Share Options have an exercise price set at market value at grant.
For non-US executive directors, awards vest subject to performance and service conditions on the fifth anniversary of grant and will 
be exercisable between the fifth and tenth anniversary of grant.
US executive directors are not eligible.
Policy maximum opportunity
Award levels applicable to UK executive directors for normal annual grants (assuming the current LTI EV weightings in Performance 
Shares and Share Options) are as follows:
Chief Executive: 300% of salary
Chief Operating Officer: 300% of salary
Group Finance Director: 300% of salary
Note the percentages above could be exceeded if the LTI EV weightings were to be varied (see page 102).
Where a new executive director role is established, the maximum opportunity will not exceed that of the Chief Operating Officer 
role as set out above.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
For Share Option awards made to the executive directors, exercise is subject to the TSR and EPS performance conditions (subject to any 
adjustment described above) and application of reasonableness discretion as set out above.
Note that for Share Option awards granted to the executive directors prior to the 2017 AGM, exercise is subject to the TSR performance 
conditions as set out in our policy approved at the 2014 AGM.

Operation
The shares are subject only to the condition that the participant remains employed by the Group on the vesting date (three years

Award levels applicable to US executive directors for normal annual grants (assuming the current LTI EV weightings in Performance 
Shares and Restricted Shares) are as follows:
President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc.: 150% of salary
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
None.
See notes 4 and 5 on page 106.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy
Provide employment benefits which ensure that the overall package is market competitive when these elements are 
taken into account.
Operation
Benefits include provision of a company car (or cash equivalent), life assurance and ill-health benefit cover which are provided directly 
or through membership of the Company’s pension schemes. The main benefits in the UK include a car allowance (currently £16,000 
per annum), private use of a chauffeur-driven car and annual medical screening, plus life assurance and ill-health benefit cover provided 
through membership of the Company’s pension schemes.
Opportunity for UK executive directors to participate in the Share Incentive Plan, a tax approved all-employee plan.
In the US, benefits include a cash allowance for car and parking (currently $20,900 per annum) and private use of a chauffeur-driven 
car, medical and dental benefits, and insured life and disability benefits.
Additional benefits, such as relocation assistance, may also be provided in certain circumstances if considered reasonable and 
appropriate by the Committee. Relocation assistance comprises reimbursement for direct items of expenditure, such as legal, 
estate agency, removals and temporary accommodation.
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover is also provided for all executive directors.
Maximum opportunity
Benefits are set at a level which the Committee considers to be appropriate against comparable roles in companies of similar size 
in the relevant market.
Benefits are as reported and itemised within the single total figure shown as part of the Annual remuneration report on page 85. 
The maximum cost of such benefits will reflect the associated market-competitive cost of provision. Relocation assistance is based 
on actual costs incurred which are linked to the size and value of the property, plus a maximum relocation allowance of £2,500.
Participation limits for the Share Incentive Plan are those set by the UK tax authorities from time-to-time.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
None.

Pension
Purpose and link to strategy
Provide competitive post-retirement benefits or cash allowance equivalent.
Operation
The current Chief Executive and Group Finance Director as at 22 February 2017 are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension 
Scheme and members of an underlying employee pension plan, which together provide a target benefit for executive directors 
payable at normal retirement age (62) of 1/30th of final pensionable earnings (FPE) for each year of service up to a maximum of 
two-thirds of FPE. Member contributions are currently 8% of salary. Further detail is provided on page 90 as part of the Annual 
remuneration report.
The current Chief Operating Officer as at 22 February 2017 is a member of the defined contribution section of the BAE Systems 
Executive Pension Scheme (EPS DCRP). In line with our policy, Company contributions are 19% of salary and member contributions 
are 6% of salary. Where the Annual Allowance (AA) is breached, as is the case with the Chief Operating Officer, he will pay member 
contributions up to the AA limit and the Company contributions will be paid as a salary supplement.
For any new externally-appointed UK executive directors, or internally appointed UK executive directors who are not members of 
a BAE Systems defined benefit scheme, membership of the BAE Systems EPS DCRP is offered with contribution requirements set 
as a percentage of base salary dependent on grading. Individuals may elect to receive some or all of their Company contributions as 
a cash allowance. For any internally-appointed UK executive directors who are already members of a BAE Systems defined benefit 
scheme, the Company may offer to maintain their membership in that pension arrangement (with the contribution rates appropriate 
to that arrangement), or the choice of membership of the BAE Systems EPS DCRP as set out above.
Where UK executive directors’ pension entitlement or accrual is restricted to the Lifetime Allowance (LTA) and/or the AA, the 
Company may offer an unfunded pension promise or salary supplement to offset the impact of these restrictions.
The current President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. as at 22 February 2017 participates in a Section 401(k) 
defined contribution arrangement in which the company matches his contributions up to a maximum of 6% of salary, subject 
to US regulatory limits.
Any new externally-appointed US executive directors, or internally-appointed US executive directors who are not members of a pension 
plan, would be offered membership of the US Section 401(k) defined contribution plan. For any internally-appointed US executive 
directors who are members of the 2006 Plan and Non-Qualified Plan, these plans provide a cash sum at retirement equal to the sum 
of the annual accruals, currently set at $1,000 from the 2006 Plan and $500 from the Non-Qualified Plan. The Company may offer 
to maintain membership of the 2006 Plan and Non-Qualified Plan, in addition to membership of the US Section 401(k) defined 
contribution plan.
Maximum opportunity
The BAE Systems EPS DCRP provides a maximum Company contribution of 19% (in addition to employee contribution of 6%) 
of base salary.
Under the existing executive defined benefit scheme, a maximum of two-thirds of FPE is accrued at 1/30th for each year of service.
Where UK executive directors’ pension entitlement or accrual is restricted to the LTA and/or the AA, the Company may offer an 
unfunded pension promise or salary supplement to offset the impact of these restrictions.
The US Section 401(k) defined contribution plan provides 100% company matching contributions up to a maximum of 6% of base 
salary, subject to US statutory limits.
For US executive directors who are members of the 2006 Plan and Non-Qualified Plan, these plans provide a cash sum at retirement 
equal to the sum of the annual accruals, currently set at $1,000 from the 2006 Plan and $500 from the Non-Qualified Plan.

 Annual Report 2016 Directors’ remuneration policy

Notes to the executive directors’ policy table 
Remuneration policy for other employees
1.  The Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, 
level of experience, performance and market data for similar roles in other companies.
2.  All leaders may participate in an annual bonus scheme with similar metrics to those used for the executive directors. Other employees 
may participate in performance-based incentive plans which vary by organisational level and with relevant metrics for the particular 
area of the business.
3.  LTI grants may be made to the most senior managers in the business (approximately 400 individuals globally). The nature of the 
awards depends on the individual’s location, roles and responsibilities, in particular:
– performance conditions and targets for performance share grants made to UK and Rest of World participants are made 
in line with those applying to executive directors; 
– for US participants below Executive Committee level, performance share grants are normally subject to BAE Systems, Inc. 
operating cash flow and EPS performance conditions and targets; 
– Performance Shares applicable to participants below executive director level vest on the third anniversary subject to performance 
conditions and are exercisable (or released in the case of US participants) in equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary 
of grant; 
– Share Options are granted to participants below executive director level; there are no performance conditions attached and they 
vest and are exercisable after three years; and
– Restricted Share grants are currently made to the most senior managers in the US businesses reflecting competitive market practice 
and vest after three years.
Performance measures and targets
4.  The Committee selected the performance conditions because these are central to the Company’s overall strategy and are the 
key metrics used by the executive directors to oversee the operation of the business. Any non-financial performance targets are 
determined by the Committee in consultation with the Corporate Responsibility Committee.
5.  The performance conditions and targets are determined annually by the Committee (within the parameters set out above), taking 
account of the Group’s strategic objectives, the internal business plan and budgets, as well as external market expectations and 
general economic conditions. The Committee is of the view that the performance targets for the annual bonus are commercially 
sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them before the start of the financial year. 
The targets will be disclosed retrospectively after the end of the relevant financial year.
Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)
6.  The Committee has agreed a policy whereby the executive directors are required to establish and maintain a minimum personal 
shareholding equal to a set percentage of base salary. An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or 
options exercised through the executive share option schemes and other LTI schemes by retaining 50% of the net value (i.e. the value 
after deduction of exercise costs and tax) of shares acquired under these schemes. Once the Initial Value is achieved, a Subsequent 
Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum of 25% of the net value must be retained on each exercise or 
acquisition. The Committee has discretion to increase the Initial Value and/or Subsequent Value (see below). Shares owned beneficially 
by the director and his/her spouse count towards the MSR. The MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a director. 
Any case of non-compliance would be dealt with by the Committee.
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value applicable from 2018: 
Initial Value Subsequent Value
Chief Executive 150% 300%
Chief Operating Officer 100% 200%
Group Finance Director 100% 200%
President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. 212.5% 425%

Non-executive directors’ (NEDs) policy table 
Fees
Purpose and link to strategy
To attract NEDs who have a broad range of experience and skills to provide independent judgement on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct.
Operation
NEDs’ fees are set by the Non-Executive Directors’ Fees Committee.
NEDs receive a basic fee with an additional fee for those who are chairmen of committees and/or undertake the role of Senior 
Independent Director.
NEDs also receive a travel allowance per meeting on each occasion that a scheduled Board meeting necessitates air travel of more 
than five hours (one way) to the meeting location, subject to a maximum of six travel allowances per year. 
Fees are typically reviewed annually, taking into account time commitment requirements and responsibility of the individual roles, 
and after reviewing practice in other comparable companies. 
The Chairman’s fees are set by the Remuneration Committee on a three-year basis and not normally subject to review during 
that period.
Maximum opportunity
Actual fee levels are disclosed in the Annual remuneration report for the relevant financial year.
The current Chairman’s fee has been set at £700,000 from 1 February 2017 and is fixed at this level for three years.
The aggregate cost of fees and benefits paid to NEDs (including the Chairman) will not exceed an annual limit of £2.5m and the cost 
of fees and benefits paid to the Chairman will not exceed £1.25m annually.
Performance metrics used, weighting and time period applicable
None.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy
Reimbursement for reasonable and documented expenses incurred in the performance of duties.
Operation
NEDs are not eligible to participate in any pension benefits provided by the Company, nor do they participate in any performance-
related incentives.
The Chairman is provided with a chauffeur-driven car. This may be used for non-Company business, but the cost of the benefit 
of such usage shall be paid by the Chairman. 
Reimbursement of travel and subsistence costs (including payment of the associated tax cost) incurred by the director or his/her 
spouse whilst undertaking duties on behalf of the Company that may be assessed as a benefit for tax purposes. Directors’ and 
Officers’ insurance cover is also provided for all directors.
Maximum opportunity
See the aggregate limit under ‘Fees’ above.
Prior commitments 
For the duration of this Policy, the Company will honour any commitments made in respect of executive director and non-executive 
director remuneration and benefits before the date on which either: (i) the Directors’ remuneration policy becomes effective; or (ii) an 
individual becomes a director, even where such commitments are not consistent with the policy set out in this report or prevailing at 
the time any such commitment is fulfilled. This includes (without limitation) all existing share awards as detailed on page 102 of the 
2013 Annual Report under the PSP, SMP, RSP, ExSOP and ExSOP
2012
 that remain outstanding, Peter Lynas’ second residence allowance 
as detailed on page 93 of the 2013 Annual Report, and any commitments entered into (such as grants of share awards) consistent with 
a previously approved Directors’ remuneration policy that was applicable at the relevant time.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The recruitment policy provides an appropriate framework within which to attract individuals of the required calibre to lead a company 
of BAE Systems’ size, scale and complexity. The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration package for any appointment 
to an executive director position, either from within or outside BAE Systems. 
Operation
The Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors, including overall total remuneration, the type of 
remuneration being offered and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited, and will operate in order to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders without paying more than is necessary to secure the 
individual of the required calibre.
The fees and benefits applicable to the appointment of any new non-executive directors will be in accordance with the policy table 
on page 108.
Opportunity
The Committee seeks to align the remuneration package offered with the policy set out in the executive directors’ policy table above 
recognising that participation under the policy above varies by geography. 
– For UK and other non-US executive director appointments, participation in annual incentive plans will not exceed 225% of annual 
salary and long-term awards under this Policy will not exceed 550% of annual salary. 
– For US executive director appointments, participation in annual incentive plans will not exceed 225% of annual salary and long-term 
awards under this Policy will not exceed 500% of annual salary.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to ‘buy-out’ existing equity or, in exceptional circumstances, other 
elements of remuneration forfeited on leaving the previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors 
including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash or shares) and the 
time over which they would have vested. Buy-out awards would be capped to be no higher, on recruitment, than the fair value of 
those forfeited. Full details will be disclosed in the next Annual remuneration report following recruitment which will include details 
of the need to grant a buy-out award.
Fixed elements (base salary, retirement and other benefits)
The salary level will be set in accordance with the principles for setting base salary described in the executive directors’ policy 
table above.
The executive director shall be eligible to participate in applicable BAE Systems’ employee benefit plans, including coverage under 
applicable executive and employee pension and benefit programmes in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans, as 
may be amended by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time.
In the case of promotion of an existing Group employee to an executive directorship on the Board, commitments made before such 
promotion will continue to be honoured whether or not they are consistent with the remainder of this Policy.
Annual Incentive Plan
The appointed executive director will be eligible to earn a discretionary annual bonus in accordance with the annual incentive 
framework as described in the executive directors’ policy table above.
The level of opportunity will be consistent with the policy disclosed in the executive directors’ policy table in this report and subject 
to the maximums referred to therein and under ‘Opportunity’ above.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The executive director will be eligible for equity awards in such amounts as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion, 
subject to this Policy and the rules of the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The level of opportunity will be consistent with the policy set out in the executive directors’ policy table above and subject to the 
maximums referred to therein and under ‘Opportunity’ above.
Other
For internal and external appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses in 
accordance with the provisions described under the Benefits section of the policy table on page 104.

2.  Jerry DeMuro’s contract of employment automatically renews for one-year periods from 31 December each year, unless one party gives at least 
90 days’ notice of non-renewal.
Notice period
The Committee’s policy is that the service contracts of executive directors will not exceed 12 months. In exceptional circumstances, in 
relation to newly recruiting an executive director operating in a US environment, the notice period may be extended to a maximum of 
24 months and structured such that it reduces to no more than 12 months by no later than the end of the first complete year of service.
Change of control
No executive director has provisions in his service contract that relate to a change of control of the Company.
Chairman
The Chairman’s appointment is documented in a letter of appointment and he is required to devote no fewer than two days a week 
to his duties as Chairman. His appointment as Chairman (which commenced on 1 February 2014) will automatically terminate if he 
ceases to be a director of the Company. The Chairman’s appointment was reviewed by the Nominations Committee prior to the end 
of his initial three-year term and has been extended until February 2020, unless it is terminated earlier in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association or by the Company or the Chairman giving not less than six months’ notice.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but do have letters of appointment detailing the basis of their appointment. 
The dates of their original appointment are shown below:
Name Date of appointment Expiry of current term
Elizabeth Corley 01.02.2016 31.01.2019
Harriet Green 01.11.2010 31.10.2019
Chris Grigg 01.07.2013 30.06.2019
Paula Rosput Reynolds 01.04.2011 31.03.2020
Nick Rose 08.02.2010 07.02.2019
Ian Tyler 08.05.2013 07.05.2019
The non-executive directors are normally appointed for an initial three-year term that, subject to review, may be extended subsequently 
for further such terms. Any third term of three years is subject to rigorous review, taking into account the need progressively to refresh 
the Board. Non-executive directors do not have periods of notice.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors are subject to annual election or re-election at the Company’s AGM.
Policy on payment for loss of office
Operation
The policy on payment for loss of office provides a clear set of principles that govern the payments that will be made for loss of office, 
and take account of the need to ensure a smooth transition for leadership roles during times of change. The policy that will apply for 
a specific executive director’s payments for loss of office will be the policy that was in place at the point when the payments for loss 
of office were agreed for the executive director in question.
Any termination payment made in connection with the departure of an executive director will be subject to approval by the 
Committee, having regard to the terms of the service contract or other legal obligations and the specific circumstances surrounding 
the termination, including whether the scenario aligns to an example under the approved leaver criteria, performance, service and 
health or other circumstances that may be relevant. 
In addition to payments described below, the Committee may pay such amounts as are necessary to settle or compromise any claim 
or by way of damages, where the Committee views it as in the best interests of the Company to do so. In the event of the termination 
of an executive director’s contract, it is the Committee’s policy to seek to limit any payment to not more than one year’s base salary.

Notice and pay in lieu of notice
Executive directors’ contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from either party or termination by way of payment of base 
salary in lieu of notice, at the Company’s discretion. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross 
misconduct. Any new executive director contracts since 2016 (including the Chief Operating Officer) concerning payment in lieu of 
notice provisions allow for the Committee to exercise discretion to apply phased payments and mitigation on that executive director 
securing alternative employment.
Jerry DeMuro’s contract of employment automatically renews for one-year periods from 31 December each year, unless one party 
gives at least 90 days’ notice of non-renewal. If the employment is (a) terminated by the Company (other than for cause as defined 
in the contract) or (b) he resigned for a ‘Good Reason’ (as defined in his contract), he is entitled to a termination payment equal to 
(i) one year’s base salary and (ii) a bonus payable at target level pro-rated for service for the relevant financial year. He will also be 
entitled to a continuation of medical benefits for 18 months (or a cash payment in lieu).
Other than notice payments, the Company has no obligation to make any termination payments when the Chairman’s appointment 
terminates. Non-executive directors do not have periods of notice and the Company has no obligation to make any termination 
payments when their appointment terminates, other than to pay fees in accordance with the appointment letters.
Retirement benefits
As governed by the rules of the relevant pension plan. No enhancement for leavers will be made.
Annual Incentive Plan
Where an executive director’s employment is terminated after the end of a performance year but before the payment is made, the 
executive director will remain eligible for an annual incentive award for that performance year subject to an assessment based on 
performance achieved over the period. No award will be made in the event of gross misconduct. 
The Committee may, as set out below, exercise its discretion to allow an annual incentive payment for the year of cessation as part 
of the termination package for executive directors. Where it does so, the exercise of the discretion and reason why the Committee 
considered such action appropriate will be disclosed. 
Where an executive director leaves during the relevant performance year by reason of death, ill-health, disability, retirement, a transfer 
of business or redundancy, the Committee may use its discretion to determine that an executive director will remain entitled to receive 
a bonus (subject to an assessment based on performance over the performance year and pro-rated for time) in respect of the financial 
year in which the individual ceased employment. One third of the bonus will be subject to compulsory deferral as set out previously, 
unless the Committee decides otherwise.
The Committee’s policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
The treatment set out above does not apply to the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc.
Long-Term Incentive Plans
The treatment of outstanding share awards in the event that an executive director leaves is governed by the relevant share plan rules.
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, where an executive director leaves the Group by reason of ill-health, injury, disability, retirement 
with the agreement of the Company, sale of a business or employing company, redundancy or leaving in such circumstances as the 
Committee determines (each an ‘approved leaver’), unvested awards and options generally continue and vest on the normal vesting 
date (or, in the case of Performance Shares held by US executive directors, the first normal vesting date or, if later, cessation), unless 
the Committee determines that the awards should vest on cessation. Any performance conditions will be applied at the time of vesting.
On vesting, the number of shares under award will, unless the Committee decides otherwise, be reduced pro-rata to reflect the 
period in which the executive director was in employment as a proportion of the relevant vesting period (or in the case of Performance 
Shares held by US executive directors or Performance Shares granted prior to the 2017 AGM, as a proportion of the initial three-year 
vesting period).
In the event of death, awards generally vest at the time of death subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time. 
Awards are then pro-rated as set out above.
Where an executive director’s employment is terminated for any other reason, his unvested awards and options will lapse. Options 
normally remain exercisable for six months after cessation (or vesting, if later) and 12 months after death. 
If the Committee exercises its discretion to treat a director as an approved leaver as permissible under the leaver provisions of the share 
plan rules, the exercise of the discretion and reason why the Committee considered such action appropriate will be disclosed.
Where an executive director’s employment is terminated or an executive director is under notice of termination for any reason at the 
date of award of any Long-Term Incentive awards, no Long-Term Incentive awards will be made.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee does not consult directly with employees as part of the process for reviewing executive pay. When considering 
salary increases for the executive directors, the Committee considers the general level of salary increase across the Group and 
in the external market.
Stakeholder considerations
The Committee conducts an annual programme of consultation with major shareholders in order to seek their input to the 
development of remuneration policy or plans.

person and entitled to vote shall have one 
vote, and every proxy entitled to vote shall 
have one vote (unless the proxy is appointed 
by more than one member in which case the 
proxy has one vote for and one vote against 
if the proxy has been instructed by one or 
more members to vote for the resolution and 
by one or more members to vote against the 
resolution; or if the proxy has been instructed 
by one or more shareholders to vote either 
for or against a resolution and by one or more 
of those shareholders to use his discretion 
how to vote). On a poll, every member present 
in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall

ordinary shares are entitled, after repayment 
of the £1 Special Share, to participate in such 
a return. There are no redemption rights in 
relation to the ordinary shares.
Rights and obligations of the Special Share
The Special Share is held on behalf of the 
Secretary of State for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy (the ‘Special Shareholder’). 
Certain provisions of the Company’s Articles

The holder of the Special Share is entitled to 
attend a general meeting, but the Special 
Share carries no right to vote or any other 
rights at any such meeting, other than to 
speak in relation to any business in respect of 
the Special Share. Subject to the relevant 
statutory provisions and the Company’s 
Articles of Association, on a return of capital 
on a winding-up, the holder of the Special 
Share shall be entitled to repayment of the 
£1 capital paid up on the Special Share in

Special Share at par or convert the Special 
Share into one ordinary share at any time.

such an interest;

as a holder of any shares unless they have

or persons; (ii) such evidence (if any) as 
the directors may require of the authority 
of the signatory of the declaration; and

to the matters referred to in the declaration 
as the directors consider appropriate;
– the directors may, in their absolute 
discretion, refuse to register any transfer 
of shares which are not fully paid up 
(but not so as to prevent dealings in listed 
shares from taking place);
– the directors may also refuse to register any 
instrument of transfer of shares unless the 
instrument of transfer is in respect of only 
one class of share and it is lodged at the 
place where the register of members is kept, 
accompanied by a relevant certificate or 
such other evidence as the directors may 
reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer;
– the directors may refuse to register an 
allotment or transfer of shares in favour 
of more than four persons jointly;

the Company with certain information

of shares and/or voting rights.

 Annual Report 2016 Statutory and other information

Appointment and replacement of directors
Subject to certain nationality requirements 
mentioned below, the Company may by 
ordinary resolution appoint any person to 
be a director.
The directors also have the power to make 
appointments to the Board at any time. 
Any individual so appointed will hold office 
until the next AGM and shall then be eligible 
for re-election.
The majority of directors holding office must 
be British. Otherwise, the directors who are 
not British shall vacate office in such order 
that those who have been in office for the 
shortest period since their appointment shall 
vacate their office first, unless all of the 
directors otherwise agree among themselves. 
Any director who holds the office of either 
Chairman (in an executive capacity) or Chief 
Executive shall also be British.
The Company must have not less than six 
directors holding office at all times. If the 
number is reduced to below six, then such 
number of persons shall be appointed as 
directors as soon as is reasonably practicable 
to reinstate the number of directors to six. 
The Company may by ordinary resolution 
from time to time vary the minimum number 
of directors.
At each AGM of the Company, any director 
who was elected or last re-elected at or 
before the AGM held in the third calendar 
year before the then current calendar year 
must retire by rotation and such further 
directors must retire by rotation so that in 
total one-third of the directors retire by 
rotation each year. A retiring director is 
eligible for re-election. It is the Board’s 
intention that all directors will stand for 
election or re-election in 2017 in compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Amendment of the Company’s Articles 
of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may 
only be amended by a special resolution at a 
general meeting of shareholders. Where class 
rights are varied, such amendments must be 
approved by the members of each class of 
shares separately.
In addition, certain provisions of the Articles 
of Association cannot be amended without 
the consent of the Special Shareholder. These 
provisions include the requirement that no 
foreign person, or foreign persons acting in 
concert, can have more than a 15% voting 
interest in the Company, the requirement that 
the majority of the directors are British, and 
the requirement that the Chief Executive and 
any executive Chairman are British.
Powers of the directors
The directors are responsible for the 
management of the business of the Company 
and may exercise all powers of the Company 
subject to applicable legislation and 
regulation, and the Articles of Association.
At the 2016 AGM, the directors were given 
the power to buy back a maximum number 
of 316,716,098 ordinary shares at a minimum 
price of 2.5p each. The maximum price was 
the higher of (i) an amount equal to 105% of 
the average of the middle market quotations 
of the Company’s ordinary shares as derived 
from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official 
List for the five business days immediately 
preceding the day on which such ordinary 
shares are contracted to be purchased, 
and (ii) the higher of the price of the last 
independent trade and the highest current 
independent bid on the London Stock 
Exchange as stipulated in Article 5(1) of the 
Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation or, 
from 3 July 2016, Commission-adopted 
Regulatory Technical Standards pursuant to 
article 5(6) of the Market Abuse Regulation. 
This power will expire at the earlier of the 
conclusion of the 2017 AGM or 30 June 2017. 
A special resolution will be proposed at the 
2017 AGM to renew the Company’s authority 
to acquire its own shares.
At the 2016 AGM, the directors were given 
the power to issue new shares up to a nominal 
amount of £26,390,369. This power will 
expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the 
2017 AGM or 30 June 2017. Accordingly, a 
resolution will be proposed at the 2017 AGM 
to renew the Company’s authority to issue 
further new shares. At the 2016 AGM, the 
directors were also given the power to issue 
new issue shares up to a further nominal 
amount of £26,390,369 in connection with 
an offer by way of a rights issue. This authority 
too will expire on the earlier of the conclusion 
of the 2017 AGM or 30 June 2017, and a 
resolution will be proposed at the 2017 AGM 
to renew this additional authority.
Conflicts of interest
As permitted under the Companies Act 2006, 
the Company’s Articles of Association contain 
provisions which enable the Board to authorise 
conflicts or potential conflicts that individual 
directors may have.
To avoid potential conflicts of interest the 
Board requires the Nominations Committee 
to check that any individuals it nominates for 
appointment to the Board are free of potential 
conflicts. In addition, the Board’s procedures 
and the induction programme for new 
directors emphasise a director’s personal 
responsibility for complying with the duties 
relating to conflicts of interest. The procedure 
adopted by the Board for the authorisation 
of conflicts reminds directors of the need to 
consider their duties as directors and not grant 
an authorisation unless they believe, in good 
faith, that this would be likely to promote the 
success of the Company. As required by law, 
the potentially conflicted director cannot vote 
on an authorisation resolution or be counted 
in the quorum. Any authorisation granted may 
be terminated at any time and the director is 
informed of the obligation to inform the 
Company without delay should there be any 
material change in the nature of the conflict 
or potential conflict so authorised.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has entered into deeds of 
indemnity with all its current directors and 
those persons who were directors for any 
part of 2016 which are qualifying indemnity 
provisions for the purpose of the Companies 
Act 2006.
The directors of BAE Systems Pension Funds 
Trustees Limited, BAE Systems 2000 Pension 
Plan Trustees Limited, BAE Systems Executive 
Pension Scheme Trustees Limited and Alvis 
Pension Scheme Trustees Limited benefit from 
indemnities in the governing documentation 
of the BAE Systems Pension Scheme, the 
BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan, the 
BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme and 
the Alvis Pension Scheme, respectively, which 
are qualifying indemnity provisions for the 
purpose of the Companies Act 2006.
All such indemnity provisions are in force as 
at the date of this Directors’ report.

provisions entitling the counterparties to 
exercise termination, alteration or other similar 
rights in the event of a change of control of 
the Company:

– The Company has entered into a Restated 
and Amended Shareholders Agreement 
with European Aeronautic Defence and 
Space Company EADS N.V. (EADS) and 
Finmeccanica S.p.A. (Finmeccanica) relating 
to MBDA S.A.S. dated 18 December 2001 
(as amended). In the event that control of 
the Company passes to certain specified 
third-party acquirors, the agreement allows 
EADS and Finmeccanica to exercise an 
option to terminate certain executive 
management level nomination and voting 
rights, and certain shareholder information 
rights of the Company in relation to the 
MBDA joint venture. Following the exercise 
of this option, the Company would have 
the right to require the other shareholders 
to purchase its interest in MBDA at fair 
market value.
The Company and EADS have agreed 
that if Finmeccanica acquires a controlling 
interest in the Company, EADS will increase 
its shareholding in MBDA to 50% by 
purchasing the appropriate number of 
shares in MBDA at fair market value.
– The Company, BAE Systems, Inc., 
BAE Systems (Holdings) Limited and 
BAE Systems Holdings Inc. entered into 
a Special Security Agreement dated 
23 October 2015 with the US Department 
of Defense regarding the management 
of BAE Systems, Inc. in order to comply 
with the US government’s national security 
requirements. In the event of a change 
of control of the Company, the Agreement 
may be terminated or altered by the US 
Department of Defense.
– In July 2009, BVT Surface Fleet Limited 
(now BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited) 
and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) 
entered into a definitive Terms of Business 
Agreement (ToBA) which sets out a 15-year 
partnering arrangement, including lead roles 
for the BVT business on defined surface 
shipbuilding and support programmes. 
Where the MoD considers that a proposed 
change of control of BAE Systems Surface 
Ships Limited would be contrary to the 
defence, national security or national 
interest of the UK, then the change of 
control shall not proceed until agreement 
with the MoD is established. In the event 
that there is a change of control of 
BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited 
notwithstanding the objection of the MoD 
on such grounds, the MoD shall be entitled 
to terminate the ToBA immediately without 
compensation or termination charges.
On 30 September 2014, BAE Systems 
Surface Ships Limited and the MoD entered 
into an agreement which sets out terms for 
the progressive suspension, amendment and 
termination of the ToBA through the entering 
into of other contracts, such as the Maritime 
Support Delivery Framework (MSDF) 
agreement (see below) which triggered the 
deletion of elements of the ToBA relating to 
surface ship support. The current scope of 
the ToBA has, therefore, been reduced to 
focus on surface shipbuilding and the MoD 
retains its right to terminate the ToBA if 
there is a change of control notwithstanding 
the objection of the MoD.
– The MSDF agreement between BAE Systems 
Surface Ships Limited and the MoD became 
effective on 1 October 2014 and establishes 
a framework until March 2019 for the 
provision of surface ship support work 
and services relating to HM Naval Base 
Portsmouth. Where the MoD considers 
that a proposed change of control of 
BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited would 
be contrary to the defence, national security 
or national interest of the UK, then the 
change of control shall not proceed until 
agreement with the MoD is established. 
If there is a change of control without 
notice or notwithstanding the objection 
of the MoD, the MoD shall be entitled 
to terminate the MSDF.
– In August 2008, BAE Systems Land 
Systems (Munitions & Ordnance) Limited 
(now BAE Systems Global Combat Systems 
Munitions Limited) and the MoD entered 
into a 15-year partnering agreement for 
the provision of ammunition to UK Forces 
(the Munitions Acquisition Supply Solution 
(MASS) partnering agreement). Where 
the MoD considers that a proposed change 
of control of BAE Systems Global Combat 
Systems Munitions Limited would be 
contrary to the defence, national security 
or national interest of the UK, then the 
change of control shall not proceed until 
agreement with the MoD is established. 
In the event that there is a change of control 
of BAE Systems Global Combat Systems 
Munitions Limited, notwithstanding the 
objection of the MoD on such grounds, 
the MoD may, having followed the dispute 
resolution process, terminate the MASS 
agreement for default.
– In November 2012, BAE Systems Marine 
Limited entered into a contract with the 
MoD for the design, construction, testing 
and commissioning of Boat 4 of the Astute 
Class programme. In November 2015, 
BAE Systems Marine Limited entered into 
a contract with the MoD for the design, 
construction, testing and commissioning 
of Boat 5 of the Astute Class programme. 
Where the MoD considers that a proposed 
change of control of BAE Systems Marine 
Limited would be contrary to the defence, 
national security or national interest of the 
UK, then the change of control shall not 
proceed until agreement is established with 
the MoD. In the event that there is a change 
of control of BAE Systems Marine Limited, 
notwithstanding the objection of the MoD 
on such grounds, the MoD shall be entitled 
to terminate the agreements immediately.
– In December 2011, BAE Systems Marine 
Limited entered into a contract with the 
MoD for the design of the Dreadnought 
submarines. Where the MoD considers that 
a change of control of BAE Systems Marine 
Limited would be contrary to the defence, 
national interest or national security of the 
UK, then the change of control shall not take 
place until agreement is reached with the 
MoD on how to proceed. In the event that 
there is a change of control notwithstanding 
the objection of the MoD on such grounds, 
the MoD shall be entitled to terminate the 
contract with immediate effect.
– In September 2016, BAE Systems Marine 
Limited entered into a contract with the 
MoD for the first phase of manufacture 
of Boat 1 of the Dreadnought Class 
programme. The MoD is entitled to 
terminate the contract in the event of a 
change of control of BAE Systems Marine 
Limited, provided that the MoD must act 
reasonably in exercising this right.
In addition, the Company’s share plans 
contain provisions as a result of which options 
and awards may vest and become exercisable 
on a change of control of the Company in 
accordance with the rules of the plans.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and 
financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, and the Group and parent 
company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under 
that law they are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law, and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with UK accounting standards 
and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice), including Financial 
Reporting Standard (FRS) 101, Reduced 
Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent 
company, and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
– for the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU;
– for the parent company financial 
statements, state whether applicable UK 
accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the parent company 
financial statements; and
– prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions, and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the parent company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group, 
and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the 
directors are also responsible for preparing 
a strategic report, directors’ report, directors’ 
remuneration report and corporate 
governance statement that comply with 
that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of disclosure of information 
to auditors
The directors who held office at the date 
of approval of this Directors’ report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and each 
director has taken all the steps that he/she 
ought to have taken to make himself/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

Responsibility statement of the 
directors in respect of the Annual 
Report and financial statements
Each of the directors listed below confirms 
that to the best of their knowledge:
– the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company, 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
– the Strategic report and Directors’ report, 
taken together, include a fair review of 
the development and performance of the 
business, and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
In addition, each of the directors considers 
that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable, and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model 
and strategy.

Financial statements
Independent Auditor’s report
to the members of BAE Systems plc only
Opinions and conclusions arising 
from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial 
statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of 
BAE Systems for the year ended 31 December 
2016 set out on pages 122 to 186.
In our opinion: 
– the financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2016 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
– the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union; 
– the parent company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance 
with UK accounting standards, including 
FRS 101, Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
– the financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on 
the financial statements, the risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, in decreasing order of audit 
significance, were as follows:
Recognition of revenues and profits 
on long-term contracts
Refer to page 73 (Audit Committee report) and pages 
128 to 131 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)
Revenue on long-term contracts: 
£11,659m (2015 £11,139m)
Risk versus 2015: 
 
Audit risk
A significant proportion of the Group’s 
revenues and profits are derived from 
long-term contracts.
These contracts include complex technical 
and commercial requirements and often 
specify performance milestones to be achieved 
throughout the contract period, which can 
last many years. At each balance sheet date, 
estimates and assumptions involving a high 
degree of judgement and estimation 
uncertainty are required in order to:
– assess the proportion of revenues to 
recognise in line with milestones achieved 
and contract completion;
– forecast the outturn, and cumulative 
to date, profit margin on each contract, 
incorporating appropriate allowances for 
technical and commercial risks related to 
performance milestones yet to be achieved, 
particularly in the case of fixed-price 
contracts; and
– appropriately identify, value and provide 
for loss-making contracts.
The directors have a detailed framework, 
called Lifecycle Management (LCM), in place 
to manage the commercial, technical and 
financial aspects of long-term contracts. 
The LCM framework includes the regular 
preparation of a Contract Status Report (CSR), 
which includes key financial and forecast 
information for the relevant contract.
The risk of material misstatement is that 
the accounting for the Group’s significant 
contracts does not accurately reflect the 
progress made and status of the relevant 
contract at the reporting date.
The contracts requiring the highest degree 
of judgement that occupied a significant 
proportion of the audit effort included:
– Astute Class submarines;
– Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers;
– Saudi British Defence Co-operation 
Programme;
– Typhoon aircraft contracts (European, 
Saudi and Omani);
– JP 2008; and
– US commercial shipbuilding contracts.
Procedures to address these audit risks 
included those listed below
We critically assessed the adequacy of the 
design and tested the effective operation 
of key controls within the LCM framework 
and supporting contract-related balances, 
including:
– transactional controls that underpin the 
production of long-term contract-related 
balances, including cost information on 
contracts, such as the purchase-to-pay 
cycle and payroll controls;
– programme-level controls, such as periodic 
peer reviews performed by experienced 
individuals independent to the contract 
to challenge assumptions made and 
judgements taken at pre-determined 
stages of the contract lifecycle; and
– higher-level controls, such as monthly 
contract review meetings and quarterly 
business unit review meetings. 
For significant contracts (including those 
listed in our audit risk description), determined 
on the basis of the current and future 
technical or commercial complexity, financial 
significance and any forecast to be in 
significant loss-making positions, we also:
– obtained an understanding of the 
performance and status of the contract 
through discussion with contract project 
teams, Group and business unit directors, 
as well as through attendance at project 
teams’ contract review meetings;
– challenged the Group’s positions through 
the examination of externally available 
evidence, such as customer correspondence 
and, in the case of one significant 
programme, met the customer directly 
to further corroborate the status of 
contracts and recoverability of debtors;
– assessed the consistency of information 
presented in the year-end CSRs with the 
underlying ledgers, as well as other financial 
information received and knowledge gained 
through the above procedures; and
– used our cumulative knowledge of contract 
issues to challenge the appropriateness 
of the contract positions reflected in the 
financial statements at the year end. This 
included testing that revenue was recognised 
in the correct period around the year-end 
date, the assessment of profit margin traded 
on contracts based on milestones achieved 
and allowances made for risks, as well as 
any central overlays to positions reported 
by subsidiaries.

 Annual Report 2016 Independent Auditor’s report

Net retirement benefit obligations
Refer to page 73 (Audit Committee report) and pages 
155 to 163 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)
Group’s share of net IAS 19 deficit: 
£6,054m (2015 £4,501m)
Risk versus 2015: 
Audit risk
The Group’s share of the pension schemes’ 
net deficit was £6,054m (2015 £4,501m) 
after allocating £516m (2015 £1,053m) to 
equity accounted investments. 
The determination of the pension scheme 
liabilities is dependent on market conditions 
and the setting of key assumptions, such 
as discount rate, inflation forecasts and 
life expectancy. 
There is a considerable amount of judgement 
required in setting these assumptions and, 
given the size of the schemes, small changes 
in assumptions and estimates used can have 
a significant impact on the Group’s share of 
the retirement benefit obligations.
Further assumptions are made in the 
determination of the Group’s share of assets 
and liabilities of the multi-employer schemes 
in which it participates, principally in relation 
to changes in the methodology in allocation 
of the share to MBDA. As of 1 April 2016, 
the BAE Systems Pension Scheme, the 
largest scheme for which BAE Systems is 
a participating employer, representing 54% 
of the total retirement benefit obligation as 
at 31 December 2015, underwent a legal 
separation which removed Airbus as a 
participating employer. Consequently, the 
risk associated with the allocation of the 
multi-employer schemes has reduced.
Procedures to address these audit risks 
included those listed below
In respect of the valuation of the obligations: 
We assessed the independence and 
competence of the Group’s external actuaries. 
With the assistance of our own actuarial 
specialists, we assessed the key assumptions 
used in the Group’s retirement benefit 
obligations valuation, including the discount 
rate, inflation and life expectancy assumptions 
against externally-derived data. In order to 
assess the reasonableness of these assumptions, 
we performed a benchmarking exercise 
against comparator companies’ assumptions.
In respect of the multi-employer allocations: 
We considered whether the methodology 
used to allocate a proportion of the Group’s 
retirement benefit obligations to the other 
participating employers was appropriate. 
We examined agreements between the 
Group and the other participating employers 
to assess the allocation.
In respect of the disclosures: We considered 
the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of the key assumptions, including 
the sensitivity of the deficit to changes in 
these assumptions.
Valuation of goodwill
Refer to page 73 (Audit Committee report) and pages 
139 to 141 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)
Goodwill: £10,902m (2015 £9,840m)
Risk versus 2015:  
Audit risk
The Group holds a significant amount of 
goodwill relating to UK and overseas 
(principally US) acquisitions from the past 
15 years. The estimated recoverable amounts 
are subjective due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting and discounting future 
cash flows and in estimating recoverable 
amounts of fair value less costs to sell. 
The uncertainty over future US defence 
spending as a whole has reduced slightly in 
the last year, where we have seen the forecast 
increase in the defence bill. However, the 
allocation of the budget between BAE Systems 
and competitors remains uncertain. This places 
continued importance on the US business to 
secure export contracts. Both of these factors 
contribute to the risk that the goodwill 
allocated to the Group’s US Cash-Generating 
Units (CGUs) will not be recoverable, although 
we consider this risk to have reduced.
Most of the remaining goodwill is allocated 
to CGUs based in the UK. Whilst there is still 
inherent risk in forecasting future cash flows 
for these businesses, many of them contain 
sizeable order backlogs, much of which is with 
government customers, giving some certainty 
to support the forecasts. We consider the 
valuation risks around those CGUs to be lower.
The Applied Intelligence CGU operates in 
a highly competitive and more fragmented 
market where significant investment is required 
for growth and where future business pipeline 
is much shorter than in most other business 
units in the Group. As such, we consider the 
uncertainty in forecasting cash flows higher 
and the valuation of this CGU to have a 
higher risk. 
The Group’s annual goodwill impairment 
testing is based on the five-year Integrated 
Business Plan (IBP) forecasts. We focus audit 
effort and procedures on how the directors 
exercised judgement in the preparation of the 
IBP due to the inherent uncertainty involved 
in forecasting cash flows and determining 
discount rates, which are the basis of the 
assessment of goodwill recoverability. 
The Group’s 2016 testing did not identify 
any impairment charges (2015 £75m 
impairment charge against the US 
Intelligence & Security CGU).
Given the uncertainty associated with 
the valuation of the recoverable amounts, 
transparent disclosures and clarity of 
sensitivities to key assumptions are critical 
to help inform readers how the directors 
have made their assessment.
Procedures to address these audit risks 
included those listed below
In respect of the assessment of CGUs: 
We challenged the directors’ assessment 
of CGUs with reference to the requirements 
of accounting standards and considered the 
operating and management structure 
changes, during the year, in our understanding 
of the business. We also critically assessed 
whether the allocation of goodwill to those 
CGUs was done on a consistent and 
reasonable basis.
In respect of cash flows: We considered the 
Group’s procedures used to develop the 
forecasts and the principles and integrity of the 
Group’s discounted cash flow model compared 
to the requirements within IAS 36, Impairment 
of Assets. To challenge the reasonableness of 
those cash flows, we: assessed the historical 
accuracy of the Group’s forecasting, in 
particular the ability to reliably forecast cash 
flows in the fifth year of the model (which 
underpins the terminal value); and considered 
the forecasts with reference to publicly 
available information, such as projections 
of future defence expenditure. 
In respect of the discount rate: We compared 
the Group’s assumptions to externally-derived 
data (for example, bond yields and inflation 
statistics) where appropriate. We conducted 
our own assessments to challenge other key 
inputs, such as projected economic growth, 
gearing and CGU-specific factors that 
contribute to forecasting risk. Our own 
valuation specialists assisted us in assessing 
the overall discount rate used.

 Annual Report 2016 Strategic report
Directors’ report
Financial statements
In respect of CGU recoverable amounts: In 
one instance, we compared the recoverable 
amount of a CGU with transaction multiples 
available for similar companies. 
As an additional sense check to challenge the 
recoverable value of goodwill as a whole, we 
compared the sum of discounted cash flows 
with the Group’s market capitalisation.
In respect of sensitivity of the goodwill 
valuation to the key assumptions: We have run 
scenario-specific models including changes to 
the discount rate and forecast cash flows as 
well as break-even analyses to stress-test the 
valuations of CGUs’ recoverable amounts.
In respect of the disclosures: We assessed 
whether the Group’s disclosures about the 
sensitivities to changes in key assumptions 
reflected the risks inherent in the valuation 
of goodwill as well as our knowledge of 
the business.
Tax accruals
Refer to page 74 (Audit Committee report) and pages 123 
and 135 to 137 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)
Tax accruals: £365m (2015 £353m)
Risk versus 2015:  
Audit risk
Accruals for tax contingencies require the 
directors to make judgements and estimates 
in relation to tax risks. This is one of the key 
judgement areas that our audit is concentrated 
on due to the Group operating in a number of 
tax jurisdictions, the complexities of local and 
international tax legislation, and the number of 
years which some matters can take to resolve.
The tax matters are at various stages, from the 
first identification of risks to discussions with 
tax authorities and through to tax tribunal or 
court proceedings. The risk to the financial 
statements is that the eventual resolution of 
a matter with tax authorities is at an amount 
materially different from the estimated accrual.
Procedures to address these audit risks 
included those listed below
Together with our own UK and international 
tax specialists, we assessed all large or 
unusual items affecting the effective tax rate 
and challenged whether or not any current 
year items would indicate a requirement for 
further accruals.
In considering the judgements to recognise tax 
accruals, our own international and local tax 
specialists assisted us in assessing the Group’s 
tax positions and the likelihood of future 
cash outflows. This included the assessment 
of its correspondence with the relevant tax 
authorities and government bodies, the 
Group’s external tax advisers and third parties. 
We also used our knowledge and experience 
of the application of the international and 
local legislation by the relevant authorities 
and courts in order to challenge the positions 
taken by the directors. In support of these 
discussions, we separately met with certain 
external tax advisers of the Group.
We analysed and challenged the assumptions 
used to estimate the tax accruals and tested 
the accuracy of calculations. 
We have also considered the adequacy of 
the Group’s tax disclosures, including the 
requirements for disclosure of any 
contingent liabilities.
Deferred tax assets on UK retirement 
benefit obligation
Refer to page 74 (Audit Committee report) and pages 123 
and 150 to 152 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)
Deferred tax asset: £1,212m (2015 £908m)
Risk versus 2015: New risk 
Audit risk
The directors are required to estimate the 
value of deferred tax assets and to record 
those assets to the extent their recovery is 
probable. This requires a significant element 
of judgement.
The majority of the deferred tax asset balance 
is in relation to the Group’s retirement benefit 
obligations. As a result of the increase in the 
valuation of the Group’s share of the net 
retirement benefit obligations, the Group’s 
related deferred tax asset has also increased. 
Compared with last year, the period required 
for the Group to recover the full amount of 
deferred tax has consequently increased, and 
more judgement is required to estimate how 
much of this balance is recoverable. For this 
reason, we have determined that the audit 
risk has increased.
The risk to the financial statements is that the 
amount of deferred tax assets recognised is 
materially different from the amount that will 
be recovered.
Procedures to address these audit risks 
included those listed below
We assessed and challenged the directors 
on their judgement, in particular as to why 
it is deemed probable that the deferred tax 
assets recognised will be recovered, including 
the following considerations: 
– the appropriateness and reliability of 
forecasts used by the directors to estimate 
the recovery period; 
– the consistency of this judgement with other 
assumptions and estimates made by the 
directors used to test impairment of assets, 
including goodwill; and
– the timeframe of the pension deficit 
recovery plan.
In particular, we considered the current 
and recent taxation position of the Group’s 
UK entities (the largest element of the 
pension deficit funding falls in the UK) 
and the trading prospects of those entities 
represented in forecasts, secured orders 
and other secured programmes.
3. Our application of materiality and 
an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at £55m 
(2015 £55m), determined with reference to 
a benchmark of Group profit before taxation 
from continuing operations (normalised to 
remove the effects of goodwill impairments), 
of which it represents 4.8% (2015 4.7%).
We reported to the Audit Committee 
any corrected or uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding £2.75m (2015 
£2.75m) and those relating wholly to 
balance sheet classification exceeding 
£13.75m (2015 £32m) in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Eleven (2015 11) of the Group’s 41 (2015 41) 
reporting components were audited for 
Group reporting purposes and a further 
14 (2015 11) were subject to specified 
risk-focused procedures. The latter were not 
individually financially significant enough to 
require an audit for Group reporting purposes, 
but did present specific individual risks that 
needed to be addressed.

2. In the UK, US and Saudi Arabia.
Based solely on the work required to be 
undertaken in the course of the audit of the 
financial statements and from reading the 
Strategic report and the Directors’ report:
– we have not identified material 
misstatements in those reports; and 
– in our opinion, those reports have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
5. We have nothing to report on the 
disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during 
our audit, we have nothing material to add or 
draw attention to in relation to: 
– the directors’ risk management, internal 
control and viability assessment on page 
71 concerning the principal risks, their 
management and, based on that, the 
directors’ assessment and expectations 
of the Group continuing in operation over 
the five years to 2021; or
– the disclosures in the preparation section of 
the financial statements concerning the use 
of the going concern basis of accounting. 
6. We have nothing to report in respect 
of the matters on which we are required 
to report by exception 
Under International Standards of Auditing 
(UK and Ireland), we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired 
during our audit, we have identified other 
information in the Annual Report that 
contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, 
a material misstatement of fact, or that is 
otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
– we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired during 
our audit and the directors’ statement that 
they consider that the Annual Report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or
– the Audit Committee report does not 
appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
For the remaining components, we performed 
analysis at an aggregated level to re-examine 
our assessment that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatements within these.
The Group audit team instructed component 
auditors as to the significant areas to be 
covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported 
back. The Group audit team approved the 
component materiality levels, which ranged 
from £4m to £37m (2015 £3m to £33m), 
having regard to the mix of size and risk 
profile of the Group across the components. 
The work on 20 of the 25 (2015 20 of the 
22) in-scope components was performed 
by component auditors and the remainder 
by the Group audit team.
The Group audit team hosted planning 
meetings in the spring and autumn attended 
by the most significant component teams 
from the UK, US and Saudi Arabia. In addition, 
the Group audit team visited component 
teams in the UK, US, Sweden, Saudi Arabia 
and Australia to assess the audit risk and 
strategy, discuss and calibrate the results 
of controls testing, and discuss preliminary 
findings of audit procedures. Video and 
telephone conference meetings were also held 
with these component auditors and any others 
that were not physically visited. At these visits 
and meetings, the findings reported to the 
Group audit team were discussed in more 
detail, and any further work required by 
the Group audit team was then performed 
by the component auditor.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion:
– the part of the Annual remuneration 
report required to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
– the information given in the Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report for 
the financial year is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
– adequate accounting records have not been 
kept by the parent company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
– the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Annual remuneration 
report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
– certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
– we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review: 
– the directors’ statements, set out on 
page 71, in relation to going concern 
and longer-term viability; and 
– the part of the Director’s report section 
relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the 11 provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
above responsibilities. 
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on page 
116, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. A description of the scope of an 
audit of financial statements is provided on 
the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This 
report is made solely to the Company’s 
members as a body and is subject to important 
explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, 
which are incorporated into this report as if 
set out in full and should be read to provide 
an understanding of the purpose of this 
report, the work we have undertaken and 
the basis of our opinions.

Preparation
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of BAE Systems plc have been prepared on a going concern basis, as discussed in the Directors’ report 
on page 71, and in accordance with EU-endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and, unless stated otherwise, rounded to the nearest million. They have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and other relevant 
financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date, with the resulting exchange differences 
recognised in the income statement.
Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in the relevant notes. These 
policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The directors believe that the consolidated financial 
statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimates, and provide a true and fair view of the Group’s financial performance and position.
Critical accounting policies
Certain of the Group’s significant accounting policies are considered by the directors to be critical because of the level of complexity, judgement 
or estimation involved in their application and their impact on the consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies are listed 
below and explained in more detail in the relevant notes to the Group accounts: 
Critical accounting policy Description Notes
Revenue and profit recognition
– The recognition of revenue and profit 
on long-term contracts.
The majority of long-term contracts are accounted for under IAS 11, Construction 
Contracts. Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised when performance 
milestones have been completed. Profit is recognised progressively as risks have been 
mitigated or retired.
The ultimate profitability of long-term contracts is estimated based on estimates of 
revenue and costs, including allowances for technical and other risks, which are reliant 
on the knowledge and experience of the Group’s project managers, engineers, and 
finance and commercial professionals. Material changes in these estimates could affect 
the profitability of individual contracts.
Revenue and cost estimates are reviewed and updated at least quarterly, and more 
frequently as determined by events or circumstances.
1
Carrying value of intangible assets
– The valuation of acquired intangible 
assets; and
Acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are valued in line with internationally 
used models, which require the use of estimates that may differ from actual outcomes. 
These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives. Future results are impacted 
by the amortisation periods adopted and, potentially, any differences between 
estimated and actual circumstances related to individual intangible assets.

– the determination of assumptions 
underpinning goodwill impairment  
testing.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill 
is allocated to Cash-Generating Units on a consistent basis. The impairment review 
calculations require the use of estimates of the future profitability and cash-generating 
ability of the acquired businesses based on the Group’s five-year Integrated Business 
Plan and the pre-tax discount rate used in discounting these projected cash flows.
Valuation of retirement benefit obligations
– The determination of assumptions 
underpinning the valuation of retirement 
benefit obligations for defined benefit 
pension schemes; and
Pension scheme accounting valuations are prepared by independent actuaries. 
For each of the actuarial assumptions used to measure the Group’s pension scheme 
liabilities, there is a range of possible values and management estimates the point 
within that range that most appropriately reflects the Group’s circumstances. Small 
changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the size of the deficit.
20
– the determination of the share of the 
pension deficit allocated to the Group’s 
equity accounted investments.
The Group operates a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension schemes 
and allocates a share of the surpluses and deficits in those schemes to the equity 
accounted investments that participate in them.
On 1 April 2016, a separate Airbus section of the BAE Systems Pension Scheme 
(Main Scheme) was created, reducing the total IAS 19, Employee Benefits, deficit, 
with a corresponding reduction in the allocation to equity accounted investments.
The deficit allocation methodology for the remaining employers of the Main Scheme 
and for all other schemes is based on the relative payroll contributions of active 
members, which is consistent with prior years. Whilst this methodology is intended 
to reflect a reasonable estimate of the share of the deficit, it may not accurately reflect 
the obligations of the participating employers.

Preparation continued
Other significant accounting policy judgements
In addition to the critical accounting policies, management exercises judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies in respect of the 
following principal items:
Tax provisions
Management exercises judgement to determine the amount of tax provisions. Provision is made for known issues based on management’s 
interpretation of country-specific legislation and the likely outcome of negotiations or litigation. The Group’s approach is to consider each 
uncertain tax position separately. Where management considers it is probable (defined as more likely than not) that there will be a future outflow 
of funds to a tax authority, a provision is recognised. The position is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Provisions are measured using management’s 
best estimate of the most likely amount, being the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes. The Group discloses any significant 
uncertainties in relation to tax matters to the relevant tax authority. The resolution of tax positions taken by the Group can take a considerable 
period of time to conclude and, in some cases, it is difficult to predict the outcome. The directors believe that adequate provision is made for 
each known tax risk.
Included within the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2016 are current tax liabilities of £311m (2015 £315m), which comprise a 
provision of £365m (2015 £353m) and other tax creditors of £51m (2015 £35m), offset by a debtor of £105m (2015 £73m) in respect of research 
and development expenditure credits. The provision of £365m (2015 £353m) is in respect of known tax issues, of which £325m (2015 £287m) 
relates to non-UK jurisdictions. Whilst there is inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of any resolution of tax positions, the Group does not 
consider that there is a significant risk of material change in 2017.
Deferred tax assets
Included within the net deferred tax asset of £1,241m at 31 December 2016 is £1,212m in respect of the deficits in the Group’s pension/retirement 
schemes (see note 14). It is management’s judgement that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profits to recover the net deferred tax asset 
recognised. This judgement requires the use of estimates of future taxable profits based on the Group’s Integrated Business Plan.
Changes in accounting policies
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, issued in July 2014 with an effective date of 1 January 2018, was EU endorsed in November 2016. It is not expected 
to have a material impact on the Group.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued in May 2014 with an effective date of 1 January 2018, was EU endorsed in October 
2016. The standard requires the identification of performance obligations in contracts with customers and allocation of the total contractual value 
to each of the performance obligations identified. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied either at a point in time or 
over time. The standard will replace IAS 11, Construction Contracts, and IAS 18, Revenue.
An initial impact assessment has been undertaken which involved the review of all contract types across the Group. The assessment indicates that 
revenue on the Group’s long-term contracts currently being recognised based on the completion of separately identifiable phases (milestones) will 
cumulatively be recognised earlier under IFRS 15, which reflects the continual transfer of the benefits of the Group’s performance to the customer. 
It is expected that profit will continue to be recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated and retired and, accordingly, it is not expected 
that there will be a material impact on the timing of profit recognition. There is no impact on the timing of cash receipts, which are determined 
by the terms and conditions of contracts with the customers. The assessment has not indicated any significant changes will be required to the 
Group’s revenue recognition policy in respect of revenue from the sale of goods not under long-term contract, services or licences.
IFRS 16, Leases, issued in January 2016 with an effective date of 1 January 2019, is not yet EU endorsed. Currently, leases classified as operating 
leases are not recognised on the balance sheet. The impact of this standard will be to recognise a lease liability and corresponding asset on the 
Group’s balance sheet in respect of the majority of leases currently classified as operating leases.
Consolidation
The financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities, and include its share of its joint ventures’ 
results accounted for under the equity method. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has the rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. 
The results of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements.
Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method where the Consolidated income statement includes the Group’s share of their profits 
and losses, and the Consolidated balance sheet includes its share of their net assets within equity accounted investments. 
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. The income statements of such entities are translated at average rates of exchange during the year. All resulting exchange differences are 
recognised directly in a separate component of equity. 
Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRS (1 January 2004) are presented in equity, but not as a separate component. 
When a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in equity since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income 
statement as part of the profit or loss on sale.

 Annual Report 2016 1. Segmental analysis
Revenue and profit recognition
Revenue represents income derived from the provision of goods and services by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Long-term contracts
The majority of the Group’s long-term contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 11, Construction Contracts. Revenue is recognised 
when the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange for its performance, which is when a separately identifiable phase 
(milestone) of a contract or development has been completed.
Profit is calculated by reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making suitable allowances for technical 
and other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved. No profit is recognised until the outcome of a contract can be reliably 
estimated. Profit is recognised progressively as risks have been mitigated or retired. 
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Goods sold and services rendered
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, rebates and other similar allowances. 
Revenue from the sale of goods not under long-term contract is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement 
with the goods, and the amount of revenue and costs can be measured reliably. Profit is recognised at the time of sale.
Revenue from the provision of services not under long-term contract is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of 
completion of the contract at the reporting date. The stage of completion is measured on the basis of direct expenses incurred as a percentage 
of total expenses to be incurred for material contracts and labour hours delivered as a percentage of total labour hours to be delivered for 
time contracts.
Revenue from the sale of software licences is recognised on delivery to the customer when the Group has no remaining obligations to 
perform and collection of the consideration is considered probable. In circumstances where the Group has future obligations to perform 
as part of a software licence and related services contract, revenue is recognised over the contract term.
Revenue and profits on intercompany trading are determined on an arm’s-length basis.
Research and development
The Group undertakes research and development activities either on its own behalf or on behalf of customers. 
Where the research and development activity is performed on behalf of customers, the revenue arising is recognised in the income statement 
in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy on long-term contracts.
Reporting segments
The Group has six reporting segments, which align with the Group’s strategic direction, determined with reference to the products and services 
they provide, and the markets in which they operate: 
–  Electronic Systems comprises the US and UK-based electronics activities, including electronic warfare systems, electro-optical sensors, military 
and commercial digital engine and flight controls, next-generation military communications systems and data links, persistent surveillance 
capabilities, and hybrid electric drive systems; 
–  Cyber & Intelligence comprises the US-based Intelligence & Security business and UK-headquartered Applied Intelligence business, and covers 
the Group’s cyber security, secure government, and commercial and financial security activities;
–  Platforms & Services (US) has operations in the US, UK and Sweden. It produces combat vehicles, weapons and munitions, and delivers 
services and sustainment activities, including ship repair and the management of government-owned munitions facilities;
– Platforms & Services (UK) comprises the Group’s UK-based air, maritime, land and shared services activities;
–  Platforms & Services (International) comprises the Group’s businesses in Saudi Arabia, Australia and Oman, together with its 37.5% interest 
in the pan-European MBDA joint venture; and
– HQ comprises the Group’s head office activities, together with a 49% interest in Air Astana. 
The Board (the chief operating decision maker as defined by IFRS 8, Operating Segments) monitors the results of these reporting segments 
to assess performance and make decisions about the allocation of resources. Segmental performance is evaluated based on Key Performance 
Indicators – sales (see page 129) and underlying EBITA (see page 130). Finance costs and taxation expense are managed on a Group basis.

Key Performance Indicator – Underlying EBITA
Definition Profit for the year before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, finance costs and taxation expense (EBITA) excluding 
non-recurring items.
Non-recurring items are defined as items that are relevant to an understanding of the Group’s performance with reference to their materiality 
and nature:
– Loss on business transactions: Non-recurring items in 2016 represents an impairment of £12m against the carrying value of the 
BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair business sold in January 2017. A loss on the disposal of the Group’s 75% holding in BAE Systems 
Land Systems South Africa (Pty) Limited of £24m was included in non-recurring items in 2015.
– Research and development expenditure credits relating to prior years: In 2013, UK legislation changed so that UK government 
credits for research and development spend are now accounted for as part of operating profit rather than as part of taxation expense. 
This treatment was optional for the first three years. During 2015, the Group exercised that option, effective from 2013, and reflected 
the change in the 2015 accounts. Credits relating to 2013 and 2014, totalling £50m, were included in non-recurring items in 2015.
Purpose Provides a measure of operating profitability that is comparable over time.

6. Taxation expense
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences:
–  on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss;
–  related to investments in subsidiaries and equity accounted investments to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and
–  arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

1. 2016 comprises a number of separate items, individually less than £20m, in relation to which either resolution was reached in the year or new information enabled the 
Group to re-assess the related tax provisions. 2015 included credits totalling £134m in respect of the adjustment of certain UK and overseas tax provisions in the light 
of clarification and rulings received.
2. In 2013, UK legislation changed so that UK government credits for research and development spend are now accounted for as part of operating profit rather than as part 
of taxation expense. This treatment was optional for the first three years. During 2015, the Group exercised that option, effective from 2013, and reflected the change in 
the 2015 accounts. The adjustment reversed this treatment to show an underlying effective tax rate that was comparable with the prior year. The £77m excluded from profit 
before taxation comprised £50m included in non-recurring items relating to 2013 and 2014 (see note 1) and £27m included in underlying EBITA relating to 2015, of which 
£12m related to the Group’s share of equity accounted investments. The £68m adjustment included £45m relating to the £50m included in non-recurring items.

8. Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost or valuation, less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Cost or valuation
Goodwill
Under the acquisition method for business combinations, goodwill is the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, less the 
net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is 
included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying value of equity accounted 
investments. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Programme and customer-related
Intangible assets recognised by the Group include those relating to ongoing programmes within businesses acquired, mainly in respect 
of customer relationships and order backlog.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets include:
–  Computer software licences acquired for use within the Group are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred 
to acquire and bring to use the specific software;
–  Software development costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled 
by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. 
Group-funded expenditure associated with enhancing or maintaining computer software programs for sale is recognised as an expense 
as incurred;
–  Research and development expenditure funded by the Group on development activities applied to a plan or design for the production of 
new or substantially improved products is capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset if certain conditions are met. The expenditure 
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and related overheads; and 
– Patents, trademarks and licences.
Amortisation
Goodwill is not amortised. Amortisation on intangible assets, excluding goodwill, is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. 
For programme-related intangibles, amortisation is set on a programme-by-programme basis over the life of the individual programme. 
Amortisation for customer-related intangibles is also set on an individual basis.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Programme and customer-related up to 15 years
Other intangible assets:
Computer software licences acquired 2 to 5 years
Software development costs 2 to 5 years
Research and development expenditure up to 10 years
Patents, trademarks and licences up to 20 years
Other intangibles up to 10 years
The Group has no indefinite-life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments
The carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets (excluding goodwill), property, plant and equipment, investment property and equity 
accounted investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment as required by 
IAS 36, Impairment of Assets. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets 
that are not yet available for use, impairment testing is performed annually.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its Cash-Generating Unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash 
flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash-Generating Unit to which the asset belongs. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. An impairment loss in respect of other intangible assets, property, plant and 
equipment, investment property and equity accounted investments is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised or if there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

1. Includes intangible assets with nil net book value no longer used by the Group. 
Impairment testing
The recoverable amount of the Group’s goodwill is based on value in use estimated using risk-adjusted future cash flow projections from the 
five-year Integrated Business Plan (IBP) and a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with growth rate assumptions 
in the range 0% to 2% applied. The IBP process includes the use of historical experience, available government spending data and the Group’s 
order backlog. Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.01% (2015 7.47%) (adjusted for 
risks specific to the market in which the Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) operates), have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted 
cash flows.

The remaining goodwill balance of £2.5bn (2015 £2.4bn) is allocated across multiple CGUs, including £0.6bn (2015 £0.6bn) in the Applied 
Intelligence CGU, with no individual CGU exceeding 10% of the Group’s total goodwill balance. The majority of the projected cash flows within 
these CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of primarily UK government spending on defence, aerospace and security, and the Group’s ability 
to capture a broadly consistent market share. In the case of Applied Intelligence, the future cash flow projections are based on the expectation of 
growth in cyber and intelligence, in the UK and overseas government markets, together with increasing demand for products and services in 
commercial markets.

9. Property, plant and equipment
Cost
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of self-constructed 
assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. The cost of demonstration assets 
is written off as incurred. The reimbursement of the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment by a customer is presented as deferred 
income and recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent with the depreciation of the asset over its estimated useful life. 
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight-line basis, to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment over their estimated 
useful lives to any estimated residual value, using the following rates:
Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter
Plant and machinery:
Computing equipment and motor vehicles 4 to 5 years
Other equipment 10 to 20 years, or the project life if shorter
For certain items of plant and equipment in the Group’s US businesses, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent with cost 
reimbursement profiles under US government contracts. Typically, this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would otherwise arise 
on a straight-line basis.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there 
is any indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 8.

11. Equity accounted investments
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. 
Carrying value
The carrying value of an equity accounted investment comprises the Group’s share of net assets and purchased goodwill, and is assessed for 
impairment as a single asset. The carrying amounts of the Group’s equity accounted investments are reviewed at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment in accordance with the policy shown in note 8.

Joint venture Principal activities Shareholding
Principally  
operates in

The Group’s 49% shareholding in Air Astana was previously classified as a principal equity accounted investment. The Group no longer considers 
Air Astana to be a principal equity accounted investment based on its share of Air Astana’s revenue and profit, and its carrying value.
The following tables summarise the financial information of the Group’s principal equity accounted investments included in their own financial

12. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less provision for bad debts. A provision for bad debt is established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial 
difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments 
are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. Receivables with a short-term duration are not discounted.
A loss on provision for bad debt is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment loss was recognised.
Amounts due from customers for contract work includes long-term contract balances and amounts due from contract customers, less 
attributable progress payments.
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost less provision for any anticipated losses. Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when 
it becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues. Such provisions are recorded as write downs of 
long-term contract balances for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and the remainder is included as amounts due 
to long-term contract customers within trade and other payables. Losses are determined on the basis of estimated results on completion of 
contracts and are updated regularly.
Progress payments are amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments in advance of 
delivery and are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract. Any unexpended balance in 
respect of progress payments is held in trade and other payables as customer stage payments or, if the amounts are subject to advance 
payment guarantees unrelated to Group performance, as cash received on customers’ account.
Amounts due from contract customers represent unbilled income and are stated at cost, plus attributable profit.

13. Other financial assets and liabilities
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The international nature of the Group’s business means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates. In order to protect itself against 
currency fluctuations, the Group’s policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures. 
The Group uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and 
deposits by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon. 
The Group uses foreign exchange derivative instruments to manage the Group’s exposure to currency fluctuations on its borrowings and 
deposits with the Group’s subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency exposures and those interest 
rate exposures where hedge accounting can be achieved. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, such instruments are stated at fair value 
at the balance sheet date. The fair values are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
Fair value through profit or loss
Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement for 
the period. 
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of cash flows relating to a highly probable forecast transaction (income or 
expense), the effective portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented 
in the hedging reserve in equity. Amounts recognised in equity are reclassified from reserves into the cost of the underlying transaction and 
recognised in the income statement when the underlying transaction affects profit or loss. The ineffective portion of any change in the fair 
value of the instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately. 
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability 
attributable to the hedged risk, and gains and losses on the derivative instrument, are recognised in the income statement for the period.

Cash flow hedges
The hedged, highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are predominantly expected to occur at various stages 
during the next 12 months. The majority of those extending beyond 12 months are expected to have been transacted within five years of 
the balance sheet date.
Amounts credited to the hedging reserve in respect of cash flow hedges were £87m (2015 £25m charge), including £74m (2015 £54m) 
on reclassification to profit and loss and £13m (2015 £79m charge) on contracts held at 31 December 2016. 
Fair value hedges
The loss arising in the income statement on fair value hedging instruments was £3m (2015 gain £3m). The gain arising in the income statement 
on the fair value of the underlying hedged items was £1m (2015 loss £2m). The ineffective portion recognised as a loss in the income statement 
arising from fair value hedges was £2m (2015 gain £1m). 
Debt-related derivative financial instruments
The debt-related derivative financial instruments represent the fair value of cross-currency and interest rate derivatives relating to the US$500m 
7.5% bond, repayable 2027, and the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024, respectively (see note 18). These derivatives have been entered into 
specifically to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risk.

A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
The most significant recognised deferred tax assets relate to the deficits on the Group’s pension/retirement schemes (see below). This is because 
retirement benefit costs are deducted in determining accounting profit as service is provided by employees, but deducted in determining 
taxable profit either when contributions are paid to the pension/retirement schemes or when retirement benefits are paid. In reviewing the 
probability that taxable profits will be available in the future against which such contributions/payments can be deducted, account has been 
taken of the deficit recovery plans agreed with the trustees of the relevant schemes, which run until 2026.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities, but they intend to settle current tax 
liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

These assets have not been recognised as the incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be accurately predicted 
at this time. 
The Group has not recognised any deferred tax liability on temporary differences totalling £274m (2015 £243m) relating to potentially taxable 
unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments because any withholding tax due on the remittance of those 
earnings is expected to be insignificant.
Future changes in tax rates
The UK current tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015 and will reduce to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and 
to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. This will reduce future UK current tax charges accordingly.
Both recognised and unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2016 have been calculated at a blended rate of 18%, which 
is the same rate used as at 31 December 2015.

20. Retirement benefits
Pension schemes
Defined contribution
Obligations for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
Defined benefit
The cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income statement in the period in 
which those benefits are earned by the employees. Remeasurements, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service costs resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment 
are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
The retirement benefit surpluses and obligations recognised in the Group’s balance sheet represent the fair value of scheme assets, less 
the present value of the defined benefit obligations calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions as set out on page 158. The bid 
values of scheme assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised. 
The present values of scheme liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are, therefore, inherently uncertain.
IAS 19, Employee Benefits, limits the measurement of a defined benefit surplus to the lower of the surplus in the defined benefit scheme and 
the asset ceiling. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the scheme or reductions 
in future contributions to the scheme. IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their 
Interaction, issued in 2007, provides an interpretation of the requirements of IAS 19, clarifying that a refund is available if the entity has an 
unconditional right to a refund in certain circumstances. The Group has applied IFRIC 14 and has determined that there is no limit on the 
recognition of the surpluses in its defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2016.
Certain of the Group’s equity accounted investments participate in the Group’s defined benefit schemes and, as these are multi-employer 
schemes, the Group has allocated a share of the IAS 19 pension surpluses and deficits to its equity accounted investments.
On 1 April 2016, a separate Airbus section of the BAE Systems Pension Scheme (Main Scheme) was created, reducing the total net IAS 19 deficit, 
with a corresponding reduction in the allocation to equity accounted investments. There was no settlement gain or loss upon sectionalisation 
of the Main Scheme.
The deficit allocation methodology for the remaining employers of the Main Scheme and for all other schemes is based on the relative payroll 
contributions of active members, which is consistent with prior years. Whilst this methodology is intended to reflect a reasonable estimate of the 
share of the deficit, it may not accurately reflect the obligations of the participating employers.
In the event that an employer who participates in the Group’s pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as a 
participating employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations. The Group considers the 
likelihood of this event arising as remote. However, following the creation of an Airbus section of the Main Scheme, the Group’s obligation 
in respect of Airbus has been removed in respect of the Main Scheme.
The Group’s share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity 
accounted investments.
Pension schemes
Background
BAE Systems plc operates pension schemes for the Group’s qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries. The principal schemes in the 
UK and US are funded defined benefit schemes, and the assets are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The two largest funded defined 
benefit schemes are the Main Scheme and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan (2000 Plan) which, in aggregate, represent 69% (2015 71%) of 
the total IAS 19 defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2016. The schemes in other countries are primarily defined contribution schemes. 
At 31 December 2016, the weighted average durations of the UK and US defined benefit pension obligations were 19 years (2015 18 years) and 
12 years (2015 12 years), respectively.
The split of the defined benefit pension liability on a funding basis between active, deferred and pensioner members for the Main Scheme, 2000 
Plan and US schemes in aggregate is set out below:

Regulatory framework
The funded UK schemes are registered and subject to the statutory scheme specific-funding requirements outlined in UK legislation, including 
the payment of levies to the Pension Protection Fund as set out in the Pension Act 2004. These schemes were established under trust and the 
responsibility for their governance lies jointly with the trustees and the Group.
The funded US schemes are tax-qualified pension schemes regulated by the Pension Protection Act 2006 and insured by the Pension Benefit 
Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) up to certain limits. These schemes were established under and are governed by the US Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act 1974 and the BAE Systems Administrative Committee is a named fiduciary with the authority to manage their operation. 
Benefits
The UK defined benefit schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a set level of pension payable for life based on members’ final 
salaries. The benefits attract inflation-related increases both in deferment and payment. All UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new 
entrants, with benefits for new employees being provided through a defined contribution scheme. The Normal Retirement Age for active 
members of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan is 65. Specific benefits applicable to members differ between schemes. Further details on the 
benefits provided by each scheme are provided on the BAE Systems Pensions website: baesystemspensions.com.
The US defined benefit schemes ceased to be final salary schemes in January 2013. The benefits accrued based on the final salaries of members 
at that point will become payable on retirement. The Normal Retirement Age for the largest scheme in the US is 65. 
Funding 
The majority of the UK and US defined benefit pension schemes are funded by the Group’s subsidiaries and equity accounted investments. 
The individual pension schemes’ funding requirements are based on actuarial measurement frameworks set out in their funding policies. 
For funding valuation purposes, pension scheme assets are included at market value, whilst the liabilities are determined based on prudent 
assumptions set by the trustees following consultation with scheme actuaries.
The separate actuarial valuations for funding purposes include assumptions which differ from the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 accounting 
purposes shown on page 158. The latest valuations of the Main Scheme and 2000 Plan were performed as at 31 March 2014 and showed a 
funding deficit of £2.6bn. The total net funding deficit in respect of all of the UK schemes was £2.7bn. Deficit recovery plans agreed with the 
trustees of the relevant schemes run until 2026.
The next UK triennial funding valuations, as at 31 March 2017, will commence in April 2017 and, in conjunction with the trustees of the schemes 
and other stakeholders, the Group will be looking at various options with a focus on the longer-term view. The results of future triennial valuations 
and associated funding requirements will be impacted by the future performance of investment markets, and interest and inflation rates.
The total Group contributions made to the defined benefit schemes in the year ended 31 December 2016 were £411m (2015 £438m) excluding 
those amounts allocated to equity accounted investments of £50m (2015 £98m). Equity accounted investments make regular contributions to the 
schemes in which they participate in line with the schedule of contributions and are allocated a share of deficit funding contributions.
In 2017, the Group expects to make contributions at a similar level to the recurring contributions and deficit funding as made in 2016.
The Group incurred a charge of £163m (2015 £140m) in relation to defined contribution schemes for employees.

Risk management
The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks, including market (investment) risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and 
longevity risk. 
Risk Mitigation
Market (investment) risk
Asset returns may not move in line with the 
liabilities and may be subject to volatility.
The investment portfolios are highly diversified, investing in a wide range of assets, in order to 
provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security could have a materially 
adverse impact on the total portfolio. To reduce volatility, certain assets are held in a matching 
portfolio, which largely consists of index-linked bonds, gilts and swaps, designed to mirror 
movements in corresponding liabilities.
Some 47% (2015 49%) of the Group’s pension scheme assets are held in equities and pooled 
investment vehicles due to the higher expected level of return over the long term.
Some of the Group’s pension schemes use derivative financial instruments as part of their 
investment strategy to manage the level of market risk. In August 2013, the Main Scheme 
implemented a long-dated equity option strategy protecting £1.4bn of assets against a 
significant fall in equity markets.
Interest rate risk
Liabilities are sensitive to movements in interest 
rates, with lower interest rates leading to an 
increase in the valuation of liabilities.
In addition to investing in bonds as part of the matching portfolio, some of the UK schemes 
invest in interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in interest rates. The swaps 
are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk. The Group is hedged against 
approximately 35% of interest rate risk.
Inflation risk 
Liabilities are sensitive to movements in inflation, 
with higher inflation leading to an increase in 
the valuation of liabilities.
In addition to investing in index-linked bonds as part of the matching portfolio, the principal 
UK schemes invest in long-term inflation swaps to reduce the exposure to movements in 
inflation. The swaps are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk. The Group is 
hedged against approximately 40% of inflation risk.
Effective 1 May 2014, the Main Scheme implemented a pension increase exchange to allow 
retired members to elect for a higher current pension in exchange for foregoing certain rights 
to future pension increases. 
Longevity risk
Liabilities are sensitive to life expectancy, with 
increases in life expectancies leading to an 
increase in the valuation of liabilities. 
Longevity adjustment factors are used in the majority of the UK pension schemes in 
order to adjust the pension benefits payable so as to share the cost of people living longer 
with employees. 
In February 2013, with the agreement of the Company, the trustees of the 2000 Plan entered 
into an arrangement with Legal & General to insure against longevity risk for the current 
pensioner population, covering £2.7bn of pension scheme liabilities. In December 2013, similar 
arrangements were entered into, with Legal & General, by the trustees of the Royal Ordnance 
Pension Scheme and Shipbuilding Industries Pension Scheme, covering £0.9bn and £0.8bn of 
pension scheme liabilities, respectively. These arrangements reduce the funding volatility relating 
to increasing life expectancy.

Life expectancy of a female currently aged 45 (years) 91 – 92 91 – 92 91 – 92 89 89 89
Discount rate
The discount rate assumptions are derived through discounting the projected benefit payments of the principal schemes using a third-party AA 
corporate bond yield curve to produce a single equivalent discount rate for the UK and US territories. This inherently captures the maturity profile 
of the expected benefit payments. Further information on the duration of the schemes is detailed on page 155. 
Inflation
In the UK, the inflation assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term 
government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information. In the US, inflation assumptions are not significant 
as the Group’s US pension schemes are not indexed with inflation.
Rate of increase in salaries
The rate of increase in salaries for the UK schemes is assumed to be Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation of 3.2% (2015 RPI inflation of 3.2%), plus 
a promotional scale. From 1 January 2013, employees in the US schemes no longer accrue salary-related benefits.
Rate of increase in deferred pensions
The rate of increase in deferred pensions for the UK schemes is based on Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation of 2.2% (2015 CPI inflation of 
2.3%), with the exception of the 2000 Plan, which is based on RPI inflation of 3.2% (2015 RPI inflation of 3.2%). For all UK schemes, the rate of 
increase in deferred pensions is subject to inflation caps. 
Rate of increase in pensions in payment
The rate of increase in pensions in payment differs between UK schemes. Different tranches of the schemes increase at rates based on either RPI 
or CPI inflation, and some are subject to an inflation cap. With the exception of two smaller schemes, the rate of increase in pensions in payment 
is based on RPI inflation.
Life expectancy
For its UK pension schemes, the Group has used the Self-Administered Pension Schemes S2 mortality tables based on year of birth (as published 
by the Institute of Actuaries) for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual 
mortality experience of scheme members. In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2015 
tables (published by the Institute of Actuaries) have been used, with an assumed long-term rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1.25% 
(2015 1.25%), for both pensioner and non-pensioner members. 
In October 2015, the Society of Actuaries in the US released updated mortality assumptions reflecting the results of its comprehensive mortality 
study. For the majority of the US schemes, the mortality tables used at 31 December 2016 are a blend of the fully generational RP-2014 Aggregate 
table and the RP-2014 White Collar table, both projected using Scale MP-2016. IRS approval of the mortality tables is expected in 2017, following 
which the tables are expected to be adopted for funding valuation purposes.

retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the US. The latest 
valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance schemes in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent 
actuaries as at 1 January 2016. These valuations were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 2016. The method of accounting 
for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
Principal actuarial assumptions
The assumption for long-term healthcare cost increases is 4.8% (2015 4.8%) based on the assumptions that the increases are 6.5% in 2016 
reducing to 4.5% by 2024 and 4.5% each year thereafter for pre-retirement, and 5.5% in 2016 reducing to 4.5% by 2024 and 4.5% each year 
thereafter for post-retirement.
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit schemes in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined benefit 
schemes in accordance with IAS 19.

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity information has been derived using scenario analysis from the actuarial assumptions as at 31 December 2016 and keeping all other 
assumptions as set out on page 158. 
Financial assumptions
Changes in the following financial assumptions would have the following effect on the defined benefit pension obligation before allocation to 
equity accounted investments:
(Increase)/decrease 
in pension obligation 
£bn
Discount rate:
0.1 percentage point increase 0.6
0.1 percentage point decrease (0.6)
Inflation: 
0.1 percentage point increase (0.5)
0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5
The sensitivity analysis does not allow for the impact of the Group’s risk management activities in respect of interest rate and inflation risk (see 
page 157) on the valuation of the scheme assets. Across all of its pension schemes, the Group is hedged against approximately 35% and 40% 
of interest rate and inflation risk, respectively, measured relative to the funding liabilities. The Group’s US schemes are not indexed with inflation. 
The table below shows the estimated impact of changes in the following financial assumptions allowing for the impact of the Group’s risk 
management activities in respect of interest rate and inflation risk swaps, together with the impact on the matched asset portfolio. It does 
not reflect any natural matching that occurs in the wider asset portfolio:
(Increase)/decrease 
in pension obligation 
£bn
(Increase)/decrease 
in scheme assets 
£bn
Discount rate:
0.1 percentage point increase 0.6 (0.2)
0.1 percentage point decrease (0.6) 0.2
Inflation: 
0.1 percentage point increase (0.5) 0.2
0.1 percentage point decrease 0.5 (0.2)
The sensitivity of the valuation of the liabilities to changes in the inflation assumption presented above assumes that a 0.1 percentage point 
change to expectations of future inflation results in a 0.1 percentage point change to all inflation-related assumptions (rate of increase in salaries, 
rate of increase in deferred pensions and rate of increase in pensions in payment) used to value the liabilities. However, upper and lower limits 
exist on the majority of inflation-related benefits such that a change in expectations of future inflation may not have the same impact on the 
inflation-related benefits, and hence will result in a smaller change to the valuation of the liabilities. Accordingly, extrapolation of the above results 
beyond the specific sensitivity figures shown may not be appropriate. To illustrate this, the (increase)/decrease in the defined benefit pension 
obligation resulting from larger changes in the inflation assumption would be as follows:
(Increase)/decrease 
in pension obligation 
£bn
Inflation:
0.5 percentage point increase (1.8)
0.5 percentage point decrease 1.6
1.0 percentage point increase (3.5)
1.0 percentage point decrease 3.0
Demographic assumptions
Changes in the life expectancy assumption, including the benefit of longevity swap arrangements (see longevity risk on page 157), would have 
the following effect on the total net IAS 19 deficit: 
(Increase)/decrease 
in net deficit 
£bn
Life expectancy: 
One-year increase (1.1)
One-year decrease 1.1

21. Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. If the 
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
Warranties and after-sales service
Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based on 
an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience. A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and 
services are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Reorganisations
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has 
either commenced or has been publicly announced. The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans 
and based on previous experience as well as other known factors. Future operating costs are not provided for.
Legal, contractual and environmental
The Group holds provisions for expected legal, contractual and environmental costs that it expects to incur over an extended period. 
Management exercises judgement to determine the amount of these provisions. Provision is made for known issues based on past experience 
of similar items and other known factors. Each provision is considered separately and the amount provided reflects the best estimate of the 
most likely amount, being the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes.

1. There are no individual provision releases in excess of £10m.
Warranties and after-sales service 
Warranty and after-sales service costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery. Whilst actual events could result in potentially 
significant differences to the quantum, but not the timing, of the outflows in relation to the provisions, management has reflected current 
knowledge in assessing the provision levels. 
Reorganisations 
Reorganisation costs are generally incurred within one to three years. There is limited volatility around the timing and amount of the ultimate 
outflows related to these provisions. 
Legal, contractual and environmental 
Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the amount of the outflows could differ significantly from the amount provided.
Other 
There are no individually significant provisions included within other provisions.

Special Share
One Special Share of £1 in the Company is held on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (the Special 
Shareholder). Certain provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder. 
These provisions include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have more than a 15% voting interest 
in the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, and the requirement that the Chief Executive and any executive 
Chairman are British citizens. The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by the directors and approved by the 
Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into one 
ordinary voting share. The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the Company’s 
shareholders, but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.
Share buyback
In 2015, 1,450,000 ordinary shares of 2.5p were repurchased under the three-year buyback programme announced in February 2013 and such 
repurchased shares were cancelled. 
Treasury shares
As at 31 December 2016, 291,449,361 (2015 301,808,103) ordinary shares of 2.5p each with an aggregate nominal value of £7,286,234 
(2015 £7,545,203) were held in treasury. During 2016, 10,358,742 (2015 14,018,511) treasury shares were used to satisfy awards and options 
under the Share Incentive Plan, International Share Incentive Plan, Performance Share Plan, Restricted Share Plan and Executive Share Option Plan. 
Own shares held
Own shares held, including treasury shares and shares held by BAE Systems Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) Trust, are recognised as a deduction 
from retained earnings. 
BAE Systems ESOP Trust 
The Group has an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire Company shares, using funds loaned by the Group, to meet 
commitments to Group employees. Dividend waivers were in operation for shares within the ESOP Trust, other than those owned beneficially by 
the participants, for the dividends paid in June and November 2016. 
At 31 December 2016, the ESOP held 1,327,731 (2015 897,873) ordinary shares of 2.5p each, with a market value of £8m (2015 £4m). The shares 
held by the ESOP are recorded at cost and deducted from retained earnings until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees. 
A dividend waiver was also in operation for the dividends paid in June and November 2016 over shares within the Company’s Share Incentive Plan 
Trust other than those shares owned beneficially by the participants.
Equity dividends
Equity dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared. The interim dividend is recognised 
when it has been approved by the Board and the final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by the shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting.

Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose on the acquisition of the Marconi Electronic Systems (MES) business by British Aerospace in 1999 to form BAE Systems, 
and represents the amount by which the fair value of the shares issued by British Aerospace as consideration exceeded their nominal value. 
Statutory reserve
Under Section 4 of the British Aerospace Act 1980, this reserve may only be applied in paying up unissued shares of the Company to be allotted 
to members of the Company as fully paid bonus shares.
Revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve relates to the revaluation at fair value of the net assets of the BVT joint venture previously held as an equity accounted 
investment on the acquisition of the remaining 45% interest in 2009.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve represents the cumulative nominal value of the Company’s ordinary shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled. 
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related 
to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred. 
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
Capital
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, including bank and capital market borrowings.
At 31 December 2016, the Group’s capital was £3,454m (2015 £3,064m), which comprises total equity of £3,464m (2015 £3,002m), excluding 
amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges of £10m (2015 liability £62m). Net debt was £1,542m (2015 £1,422m).
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the directors of an appropriate balance of funding required. The Group’s policy is 
to maintain an investment grade credit rating and ensure operating flexibility, whilst: 
– meeting its pension obligations;
– pursuing organic investment opportunities; 
– paying dividends in line with the Group’s policy of long-term sustainable cover of around two times underlying earnings (see note 7);
– making accelerated returns of capital to shareholders when the balance sheet allows and when the return from doing so is in excess 
of the Group’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital; and
– investing in value-enhancing acquisitions, where market conditions are right and where they deliver on the Group’s strategy.

25. Fair value measurement
Fair value of financial instruments
Certain of the Group’s financial instruments are held at fair value.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of financial instruments held at fair value have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, 
and the valuation methodologies listed below:
– the fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the 
appropriate balance sheet rates; 
– the fair values of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows 
and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates; and 
– the fair values of loans and overdrafts have been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate 
market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December. 
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at 31 December may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would 
expect to realise in the current market environment.
Fair value hierarchy
The fair value measurement hierarchy is as follows:
– Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
– Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
– Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

1. Represents US deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities.
2. US$500m of the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024, has been converted to a floating rate bond by utilising interest rate swaps. These derivatives have been designated 
as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate risk on the bond, and gains and losses on the derivatives are recognised in the income statement. The bond 
has been included in financial instruments not measured at fair value because its carrying value has only been adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate risk on a portion 
of the bond.
All of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as level 2 using the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers 
between levels during the year. 
Financial assets and liabilities in the Group’s Consolidated balance sheet are either held at fair value or their carrying value approximates to fair 
value, with the exception of loans, most of which are held at amortised cost.

26. Financial risk management
Interest rate risk
The Group’s objective is to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt 
relative to floating rate debt with derivative instruments, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps. 
The Group’s interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% (2015 50%) and a maximum of 90% (2015 90%) of gross debt is 
maintained at fixed interest rates. At 31 December 2016, the Group had 81% (2015 83%) of fixed rate debt and 19% (2015 17%) of floating 
rate debt based on a gross debt of £4.3bn, including debt-related derivative financial assets (2015 £4.0bn).
Based on contracted maturities and/or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below: 
Less than  
one year

Between one  
and two years 
£m
More than  
two years 
£m
Cash and cash equivalents 2,769 – –
Loans and overdrafts (811) (811) –
The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable 
on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars. At the end of 2016, the Group had a total of $1.0bn (2015 $1.0bn) of this type of swap 
outstanding with a weighted average duration of 2.6 years (2015 3.6 years). In respect of the fixed rate debt, the weighted average period in 
respect of which interest is fixed was 11.6 years (2015 11.5 years).
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 4.1% (2015 3.5%) on US dollars. 
The cost of the fixed rate debt was 4.8% (2015 4.9%). 
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed/floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost 
to the Group by £8m (2015 £7m). 
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Group’s working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods 
based at floating interest rates. A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits 
would vary the interest receivable by £14m (2015 £7m).

Borrowing facilities
The Group’s objective is to maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities. 
At 31 December 2016, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) of £2bn (2015 £2bn). The RCF is contracted until 2018 at 
£2bn and from 2018 to 2020 at £1.9bn. The RCF was undrawn throughout the year. The RCF also acts as a back stop to Commercial Paper 
issued by the Group. At 31 December 2016, the Group had no Commercial Paper in issue (2015 £nil).
Cash management
Cash flow forecasting is performed by the businesses on a monthly basis. The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity requirements 
to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet operational needs and maintain adequate headroom. 
Surplus cash held by the businesses over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Group’s centralised 
treasury department. Surplus cash is invested in instant-access current accounts, short-term deposits and money market funds, choosing 
instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide adequate headroom as determined by cash forecasts. 
The Group’s objective is to monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation. The Group adopts a conservative approach 
to the investment of its surplus cash which is deposited with financial institutions with the strongest credit ratings for short periods. The cash 
and cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2016 of £2,769m (2015 £2,537m) was invested with 33 (2015 35) financial institutions. A credit 
limit is allocated to each institution taking account of its market capitalisation, credit rating and credit default swap price. 
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid, such as 
short-term deposits. The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to counterparty credit risk through this process. 
Currency risk
The Group’s objective is to reduce its exposure to transactional volatility in earnings and cash flows from movements in foreign currency 
exchange rates, mainly the US dollar, euro, Saudi riyal and Australian dollar.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions. All material 
firm transactional exposures are hedged and the Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting to these transactions.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of 
foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments. The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the 
income statements or balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
The estimated impact on foreign exchange gains and losses in net finance costs of a ten cent movement in the closing US dollar exchange rate 
on the retranslation of US dollar-denominated bonds held by BAE Systems plc is approximately £59m (2015 £58m).
Credit risk 
The Group has material receivables due from the UK, US and Saudi Arabian governments where credit risk is not considered an issue. For the 
remaining trade receivables, a provision for bad debts has been calculated taking into account individual assessments based on past credit history 
and prior knowledge of debtor insolvency or other credit risk, and no one counterparty constitutes more than 11% of the balance (2015 12%).

BEWARE OF SHARE FRAUD
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams.
They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment.
While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
Victims of share fraud lose an average of £20,000 to these scams, with as much as £200m being lost in the UK each year.
How to avoid share fraud 
1. Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to 
contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
6. Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact 
details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
2. Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person 
and firm contacting you and then end the call.
7. Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at 
scamsmart.fca.org.uk/warninglist
3. Check the Financial Services Register from fca.org.uk to 
see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by 
the FCA.
8. Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm 
you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
4. Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details.
9. Think seriously about getting independent financial and 
professional advice before you hand over any money.
5. Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want 
to call it back.
10. Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
Report a scam 
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768, or the share fraud reporting 
form at fca.org.uk/scams, where you can also find out more about investment scams.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at actionfraud.police.uk

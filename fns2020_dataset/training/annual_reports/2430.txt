Chairman’s Statement
The financial year to 31 December 2007 saw 
significant progress for the Group in its ambition 
to consolidate its position as an innovative 
and credible alternative to the large incumbent 
market research agencies.
Global spend on research was approximately 
$25bn in 2007. The research market has 
been growing consistently over the last decade 
and has seen explosive growth in on‑line 
methodologies, in which BrainJuicer is a leading 
exponent. A large percentage of the total 
market spend is from around 250 multinational 
consumer goods and service companies. They 
are very large, highly professional and at times 
extremely demanding, buyers of market research. 
With the possibility of a forthcoming recession, 
it is also worth stating that their research 
spend tends to be relatively stable through 
the economic cycle. These companies 
represent the Group’s core target market.
The Board believes the Group has a compelling 
service proposition, yet it is not complacent. 
We are therefore very pleased with the larger 
foothold the Group has forged within many 
of its clients. This has led to another year 
of strong, year‑on‑year organic growth in 
turnover, and with higher profits and margins, 
another year of validating the Group’s very 
attractive business model.
BrainJuicer is an energetic and ambitious 
organisation and is also growing in maturity 
and geographic reach, with offices in the UK, 
Holland and the US. It has long term ambitions 
and is carefully putting in place the structures 
and centralised infrastructure necessary to 
become a leading global market research agency.
I joined the business in September 2007 
and find the Group’s innovative approach 
and the attractive high growth market backdrop, 
a compelling proposition for our clients and 
investors alike. The Group is well positioned with 
its experienced team, growing shareholder 
base, and top clients, to capitalise on the 
very significant potential at its disposal.

Chief Executive’s Statement
2007, our first full year as a public company, 
has gone very much to plan. The business 
has grown substantially; we have strengthened 
the team, expanded geographically, continued 
to innovate and won industry recognition.
The Group has had another year of strong 
financial performance. Turnover increased 
by 42% to £6,566,000 (2006: £4,608,000). 
Operating profit rose 77% to £844,000 
(2006: £477,000 before listing expenses), 
and profit after taxation rose 127% to £660,000 
(2006: £291,000 before listing expenses).
The Group’s primary objective, put simply, 
is to develop into a top 10 global provider of 
market research, building on the foundations 
successfully laid over the last eight years. 
Whilst we recognise that our aspirations 
are ambitious and long term, we believe 
the key requisites for success are in place.
We have developed powerful new research 
techniques which address the innovation 
challenges of multinational consumer facing 
companies (the largest buyers of research in 
the world). We focus on the difficult, strategic 
and high value early stage of our clients’ 
innovation funnel.
We have built a team of highly experienced 
researchers, operating from offices in the UK, 
Holland and the US, using our sophisticated 
technology platform. All of our research is 
conducted on‑line, and can be undertaken 
across the world. To date we have undertaken 
research in 54 countries, and 34 languages. 
Our technology enables the Group to deliver 
innovative insightful research within shorter 
time spans and at lower cost than traditional 
off‑line techniques. It also provides us with 
a profitable and scalable business model.
Over the last financial year, we have continued 
to make significant progress on all fronts.
CliENTS
We are delighted with the manner in which 
our existing client relationships have continued 
to deepen, and with the new business we are 
winning against the large incumbent agencies. 
We have delivered research to 15 of the top 
100 global companies over the 2007 financial 
year and have been working with six of them 
for at least the last three financial years. 
We have a global mandate with one of these 
companies, where we have been commissioned 
on an on‑going and global basis to test all 
their consumer insights. This mandate was 
won in 2006 and is proving as significant 
as anticipated.
BRaiNJuiCER laBS
BrainJuicer Labs, our R&D unit, consisting 
of a number of internal and external research 
professionals, has continued to develop 
innovative new research techniques. We were 
particularly pleased to win ESOMAR’s 
“Best Methodology Award” for FaceTrace
TM
, 
a technique designed to measure emotional 
engagement. ESOMAR is one of the leading 
market research bodies in the world. Having 
previously won ESOMAR’s “Best Methodology 
Award” in 2005 for our Predictive Markets 
concept screening work, we believe we are the 
only agency to have won this award twice in 
the last 20 years. These awards demonstrate 
the growing credibility of our research 
methods in the industry, and the success of 
our innovation program. FaceTrace
TM
 is now 
being used within a number of our products.
BOaRD Of DiRECTORS
At the time of the Group’s floatation on AIM 
in December 2006, the Board recognised the 
need to separate the roles of Chairman and 
Chief Executive in order to further strengthen 
its governance and comply with best practice. 
We were therefore very pleased to welcome 
Ken Ford to the Board as Non‑executive 
Chairman. Ken was formerly Chief Executive 
and then Deputy Chairman of Teather & 
Greenwood, the investment bank, and brings 
a wealth of experience in corporate finance 
and a strong understanding of shareholder 
value, strategic planning and corporate 
transactions. Our Board of Directors now 
comprises three experienced non‑executive 
Directors, and two Executive Directors: myself 
and the Chief Financial Officer. The business 
is run by our management team consisting 
of three country managers as well as our 
Chief Financial Officer and myself.
TEaM
The team is continuing to grow steadily, 
building experienced account management 
teams in each of our geographic locations and 
capable technical and corporate functions in 
the UK. I am very grateful to them all, for their 
hard work, dedication and loyalty.

Business and financial Review
THE BuSiNESS
BrainJuicer is a full service market research 
agency, competing with the large traditional 
providers who currently dominate the market. 
Its distinctive, yet proven research approach 
is enabled by proprietary software technology 
which enables the Group to quickly and efficiently 
deliver predictive quantitative data together with 
insightful and directive qualitative diagnostics.
The Group serves its clients through account 
management teams comprising experienced 
market research professionals located in the 
UK, Holland and the US, who are supported 
by a tightly controlled centralised corporate 
and technical infrastructure.
OBJECTivES
The Group’s three key operational objectives are:
I  to deepen its client relationships by continuing 
to exceed expectations in each and every 
project it undertakes;
I  to continue to invent new creative, added 
value on‑line research techniques; and
I  to continue to improve the sophistication of 
its technology and the quality and efficiency 
of its internal processes.
We believe this will lead to significant revenue 
growth particularly from our existing client base, 
an increase in average project size, and 
increased capacity from our operations, which 
together will result in highly profitable growth 
on an ongoing basis.
We are also looking to expand our geographic 
footprint, in a client‑led low risk manner.
PERfORMaNCE
Revenue grew in the year to 31 December 2007 
in each of our business units: UK (38%), Holland 
(63%) and US (14%), giving 42% growth overall. 
Gross margin remained steady at 74% 
(74% in 2006).
We served 115 clients, most of which are 
household names, and 15 are amongst the 
largest 100 companies in the world. Repeat 
business continues to be high. Our top twenty 
clients delivered 76% or our revenue. 87% of 
our top 20 accounts grew, 8% were new, and 
5% declined (compared to 2006).
Average headcount increased from 38 in 2006 
to 45 in 2007, with almost all of our headcount 
growth in account management. Our key 
productivity and efficiency metric, gross 
margin per hour grew by 13%, to £194 per 
hour (2006: £171 per hour). Revenue per 
headcount has also grown from £122,000 
to £146,000.
Administrative costs (excluding listing expenses) 
grew by 36% to £3,995,000 significantly below 
the growth in revenue.
Operating profit grew by 77% to £844,000 
(2006: £477,000 before listing costs), and profit 
after tax by 127% to £660,000 (2006: £291,000, 
before listing costs). Adjusted diluted earnings 
per share increased from 2.8p to 5.0p.
Our effective tax rate in FY2007 was 26% 
compared to 35% for FY2006 (before 
disallowable listing expenses). This is below 
the standard rate of 30% in the UK principally 
due to the recognition of US tax losses 
(previously unrecognised) and an effective 
tax rate of 25.5% applied to profits generated 
by our Dutch subsidiary.
The Group generated cash from operations 
of £1,173,000 (£167,000 outflow in 2006), 
invested £413,000 in software technology, 
and repaid £108,000 of financial liabilities 
(accrued preference dividends on Unilever 
Venture’s preference shares, prior to their 
conversion to ordinary shares). Cash balances 
increased by £642,000 to £1,875,000 
at the year‑end, with no borrowings.
The Group has £669,000 in non‑current 
assets, comprising £119,000 in computer 
hardware, fixtures and fittings, £328,000 in 
software technology and £222,000 in deferred 
tax assets, £202,000 of which relates to tax 
deductions available when option holders 
exercise their options. 07

PERfORMaNCE CONTiNuED
Trade and other receivables have grown from 
£1,612,000 to £2,630,000, but debtor days have 
remained steady at 86 days (2006: 82 days). 
Trade and other payables increased from 
£944,000 in 2006 to £2,092,000. This increase 
was primarily due to an increase in deferred 
income from £80,000 to £551,000, and employee 
bonuses from £234,000 to £412,000.
This is the second year for which the Group 
has prepared its accounts under International 
Financial Reporting Standards. It is perhaps 
worth highlighting the Group’s policy with regard 
to revenue recognition. Revenue is recognised 
only after the final written debrief has been 
delivered to the client, except on the rare occasion 
that a large project straddles a financial period 
end, and that project can be sub‑divided into 
separate discrete deliverables; in such 
circumstances revenue is recognised 
on delivery of each separate deliverable.
RiSkS
The business’s principal risks are:
I  lOSS Of a SigNifiCaNT CliENT
  This is perhaps the single biggest risk that 
concerns the Board. We therefore go to 
considerable lengths to monitor our service 
quality. Client feedback is sought on a 
project‑by‑project basis from a member 
of staff not connected with the project itself. 
Over the last financial year, this independent 
feedback has consistently revealed high 
levels of client satisfaction.
I  lOSS Of kEy PERSONNEl
  Whilst the loss of a senior member of the 
team would have a negative impact on 
the business, the Board does not view 
the business as being overly dependent 
on any one individual. The fast‑paced, high 
growth environment, in which we operate, 
is demanding on our people, and we are 
therefore at risk of staff turnover. However, 
the work environment is stimulating, and 
we attempt to ensure that our remuneration 
levels encourage loyalty. We offer a 
combination of competitive basic salaries, 
attractive performance‑related bonuses, 
a comprehensive package of benefits 
(commensurate with those found in larger 
corporates), and a broad‑based employee 
stock option plan.
I  MaTERial a DvERSE EvENT l EaDiNg 
TO a SigNifiCaNT l OSS Of PROPERTy , 
SOf TWaRE, OR DaTa, OR aN aDvERSE 
lEgal ClaiM
  Whilst it is not possible to ensure that 
all eventualities are covered, we have 
endeavoured to protect the business in a 
sensible manner through a combination of:
 I  comprehensive professional 
indemnity insurance;
 I  frequent and multiple back‑ups 
and archiving of data on all servers; and
 I  sufficient focus on legal protections, 
for example, through our terms 
and conditions.
I  RECESSiON
  Like every business, we are watching 
carefully for the signs of a possible 
recession and its potential impact on the 
spending patterns of our clients. Whilst it 
is not possible to be completely insulated 
from the effects of any recession, our 
multinational consumer goods and services 
client base have previously weathered 
recessions and maintained spending better 
than most. The Group still has a very small 
share of its addressable market, so the 
potential for growth in market share 
significantly outweighs possible declines 
in the overall market. There is even an 
argument that client cost cutting pressure 
would benefit the on‑line sector of market 
research and particularly those companies 
in this sector able to offer a credible 
alternative to the large agencies.
Whilst there is no room for complacency, 
the Board views the business as having 
an enviable combination of high growth 
and relatively low risk. 
PROSPECTS
In conclusion, our business model is proving 
robust. Our client relationships, technology 
platform, innovative research products and 
experienced team, are providing the highly 
profitable growth we had anticipated. Perhaps 
more importantly, we believe the Group’s 
positioning would be difficult to replicate, 
and that our growth, therefore, is sustainable 
over the foreseeable future.

intRoDuCtion
The Board of BrainJuicer Group PLC is committed to high standards of corporate governance, which it considers a prerequisite to support the 
growth and ambitions of the Group. Whilst it is not a requirement for companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) to comply with 
all the provisions in the Combined Code, the Board takes the Code seriously. The Group also places particular importance on the guidelines issued 
by the Quoted Companies Alliance for AIM Companies. 
There are areas where the Group is not in compliance with the Combined Code but the Directors believe that full compliance is not practicable for 
a company of BrainJuicer’s size and at its stage of development. This report sets out the procedures and systems currently in place at BrainJuicer 
and explains why the Board considers them effective. The Board has committed to reviewing compliance with the Code regularly.
the boaRD
The Board comprises two Executive Directors and three Non‑executive Directors. Their biographical details are presented on page 10.
The Board meets formally on a monthly basis and each of the Directors attended all twelve meetings during the year, apart from Ken Ford who 
attended all meetings subsequent to his appointment as Non‑executive Chairman on 1 September 2007. The Board discharges its responsibilities 
through both monthly management team meetings which are attended by the Executive Directors and the three country managers and regular 
informal meetings as would be expected in a Group of BrainJuicer’s size.
Ken Ford is Chairman of the Group and John Kearon its Chief Executive Officer. John is also the founder of BrainJuicer and a significant 
shareholder. His role centres on formulating the Group’s strategy and driving its commercial development. The Board’s three Non‑executive 
Directors act as a sounding Board and challenge the Executive Directors both at monthly Board meetings and on a regular and informal basis. 
Matters referred to the Board are considered by the Board as a whole and no one individual has unrestricted powers of decision. There are 
procedures and controls, including a schedule of matters that require the Board’s specific approval. This schedule includes:
I approval of the Group’s strategy, long term objectives and business plan;
I approval of the extension of the Group’s activities into new territories;
I approval of significant capital expenditure beyond that budgeted;
I changes relating to the Group’s capital structure, including debt raising, reduction of capital, share issues and buy backs;
I ensuring that the Group has effective reporting and internal control systems and an adequate risk assessment procedure;
I nominations for Board and Committee appointments; and
I consideration of key senior management appointments.
Where Directors have concerns which cannot be resolved in connection with the running of the Group or a proposed action, their concerns would 
be recorded in the Board minutes. This course of action has not been required to date.
The Directors can obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s own expense in performance of their duties as Directors.
The Company indemnifies Directors for claims made against them in relation to their duties, with the exception of any losses incurred as a result 
of their willful negligence.
Each year at the Annual General Meeting, one‑third of Directors are required to retire by rotation, provided all Directors are subject to re‑election 
at intervals of no more than three years. This year, John Kearon is scheduled to retire by rotation and has confirmed his willingness to be put 
forward for re‑election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 21 May 2008.
non‑exeCutive DiReCtoRS
The Non‑executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management. The guidance in the Combined Code indicates that 
the Non‑executive Directors’ independence might be impaired as Mark Muth represents a significant shareholder, Unilever Holdings Limited, and 
Simon Godfrey was formerly a part‑time employee and participates in the Group’s share option scheme. However, the Board consider both Mark 
and Simon to be independently minded. Moreover, neither Mark nor Simon have a material economic interest in BrainJuicer given each of their 
net wealth.
The terms and conditions of the Non‑executive Directors’ appointments are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
RemuneRation Committee
The membership and a summary of the terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found on page 16.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007
auDit Committee
The Audit Committee, comprising Mark Muth (Chairman), Simon Godfrey and Ken Ford, the three Non‑executive Directors, was established 
on 17 November 2006.
The Board considers that Mark Muth has recent and relevant financial experience. He has built a career in banking and venture capitalism 
and is a member of the Board of several small, entrepreneurial companies. If required, the Committee is entitled to request independent advice 
at the Company’s expense in order for it to effectively discharge its responsibilities.
The Committee’s main role and responsibilities are to:
I monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Group;
I review the Group’s internal financial controls and risk management systems;
I  make recommendations to the Board, for it to put to the shareholders for their approval in relation to the appointment of the external auditor 
and to approve the remuneration and terms of reference of the external auditor;
I discussion of the nature, extent and timing of the external auditor’s procedures and discussion of external auditor’s findings;
I review and monitor the external auditor’s independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process;
I develop and implement policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non‑audit services;
I report to the Board, identifying any matters in respect of which it considers that action or improvement is required; and
I  ensure a formal channel is available for employees and other stakeholders to express any complaints in respect of financial accounting 
and reporting.
The Committee is scheduled to meet twice in each financial year and at other times if necessary.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function, which the Board considers appropriate for a Group of BrainJuicer’s size. The Audit 
Committee will review risk assessments and the need for an internal audit function on a periodic basis.
inteRnal ContRol PRoCeDuReS
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of these systems. 
These systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide reasonable, 
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the Group’s internal controls are described below:
I a clearly defined organisational structure with appropriate delegation of authority;
I  the approval by the Board of a one year budget, including monthly income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements. The budget 
is prepared in conjunction with Country Managers and Client Directors to ensure targets are feasible;
I  the business plan is updated on a periodic basis to take into account the most recent forecasts. On a monthly basis, actual results 
are compared to the budget and to the latest forecast and presented to the Board on a timely basis;
I regular reviews by the Board and by the Senior Management team of key performance indicators;
I  a limited number of Directors and Senior Executives are able to sign cheques and authorise payments. Payments are not permitted without 
an approved invoice;
I reconciliations of key balance sheet accounts are performed and independently reviewed by the finance team; and
I a disaster recovery plan and back‑up system is documented and in place.
The Board in conjunction with the Audit Committee keeps under review the Group’s internal control system on a periodic basis. The Board acknowledges 
that there is room to improve procedures and intends to ensure risk assessment procedures and responses are continuously improved.
CommuniCationS with ShaReholDeRS
The Board recognises the importance of regular and effective communication with shareholders. The primary forms of communication are:
I the annual and interim statutory financial reports and associated investor and analyst presentations and reports;
I announcements relating to trading or business updates released to the London Stock Exchange; and
I  the Annual General Meeting provides shareholders with an opportunity to meet the Board of Directors and to ask questions relating 
to the business.
going ConCeRn
After making enquiries, at the time of approving the financial statements the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 16
BrainJuicer Group PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
RemuneRation Committee
The Group has established a Remuneration Committee, comprising the three Non‑executive Directors, Ken Ford, Simon Godfrey and Mark Muth.
The Committee’s main role and responsibilities are as follows:
I  to review, and determine on behalf of the Board, the specific remuneration and incentive packages for each of the Company’s Executive Directors;
I to review, and approve on behalf of the Board, the remuneration and benefits of senior management;
I  to review, and make recommendations to the Board in respect of, the design of remuneration structures and levels of pay and other incentives 
for employees of the Group, including share option awards and any adjustments to the terms of share ownership and share option schemes; and
I to be responsible for reporting to the Group’s shareholders in relation to remuneration policies applicable to the Group’s Executive Directors.
The Committee may invite the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer to attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee. 
The Chief Executive Officer is consulted on proposals relating to the remuneration of the Chief Finance Officer and of other Senior Executives 
of the Group. The Chief Executive Officer is not involved in setting his own remuneration.
The Committee may use remuneration consultants to advise it in setting remuneration structures and policies. The Committee is exclusively 
responsible for appointing such consultants and for setting their terms of reference.
The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed and approved by the Board. These are available for inspection at the Group’s registered office.
RemuneRation PoliCy
The Group’s policy on remuneration is to provide a package of benefits, including salary, performance‑related bonuses and share options, which 
reward success and individual contributions to the Group’s overall performance appropriately, while avoiding paying more than is necessary for this 
purpose. The Group’s Articles of Association do not permit Directors’ Remuneration to exceed £750,000 per annum in aggregate. In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee takes into account remuneration packages of comparable companies when making recommendations to the Board.
Performance‑related elements of remuneration are designed to align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders and accordingly 
are set as a significant proportion of total remuneration.
StoCk oPtionS
The Group considers that active participation in a share option plan is an effective means of incentivising and retaining high quality people. 
Directors and employees are eligible to participate in the scheme. Further details of the option plan and outstanding options as at 31 December 2007 
are given in note 10 to the financial statements.
SeRviCe agReementS
The Executive Directors entered into service agreements with BrainJuicer Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company on 22 January 2003. 
The agreements include restrictive covenants which apply during employment and for a period of twelve months after termination. 
John’s agreement can be terminated on six month’s notice in writing by either the Company or by John. James’ agreement can be terminated 
on twelve months notice in writing by the Company and six months’ notice by James.
non‑exeCutive DiReCtoRS
Mark Muth and Simon Godfrey were appointed Non‑executive Directors on 5 October 2006 and entered into letters of appointment with 
the Company on 30 November 2006. Ken Ford was appointed Non‑executive Chairman on 1 September 2007 and entered into a letter of 
appointment with the Company on 3 March 2008. The remuneration of the Non‑executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors.
Mark, Simon and Ken’s appointments can be terminated on six months’ notice in writing by either the Company or by the Non‑executive Director. 
However, the Company has entered into an agreement not to exercise its right to terminate Mark’s appointment while for so long as Unilever UK Holdings 
remains the registered holder of not less than 10% of the issued share capital of the Company.

No Director exercised rights to share options during the year.
An option will normally vest as to one‑third on 1 January following the date of grant and a further third on the next 1 January and the remaining third 
on the following 1 January so that the option will be fully vested from the second anniversary of 1 January following the date of grant. It is then exercisable 
until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price at grant date is equal to the Company’s share price at the date of grant.
Each Director has agreed, subject to certain restrictions, not to dispose of his shares for twelve months from the date of admission of the Company’s 
shares on AIM (5 December 2006), and for an additional six months without the consent of the Company’s broker (Landsbanki Securities (UK) Limited – 
formerly Teather & Greenwood); such consent can only be withheld on orderly market grounds.

BrainJuicer Group PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and have chosen 
to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
I select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
I make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
I  state that the Group financial statements comply with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and that the parent company financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice); and
I  prepare the Group financial statements and those of the parent company on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
In so far as the Directors are aware:
I there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
I  the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors’ are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

baSiS oF auDit oPinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.

the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

In our opinion:
I  the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s

I  the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
I the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

The Group has prepared its Annual Report in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted in the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a high degree of judgement or complexity, 
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling (“GBP”) because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
3 PRinCiPal aCCounting PoliCieS
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
interpretatiOn early adOpted by the grOup
IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’, was early adopted in 2007. IFRIC 11 provides guidance on whether share‑based 
transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over a parent’s shares) should be accounted for as equity 
settled or cash settled share‑based payment transactions in the stand‑alone accounts of the parent and Group companies. This interpretation 
does not have any impact on the Group’s financial statements.
StandardS, amendmentS and interpretatiOnS in iSSue but nOt yet effeCtive
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods, but the Group has not adopted them early:
iaS 1, (r evised 2007) “presentation of financial Statements” (effective from 1 January 2009)
The revised standard will result in changes to the presentation of the Group’s financial statements as the format currently adopted for the Statement of 
Changes in Equity will no longer be permitted. Instead, the Group will present a Statement of Comprehensive Income combining the existing Income 
Statement with other income and expenses currently presented as part of the Statement of Changes in Equity. In addition, the Group will present 
a separate Statement of Changes in Equity showing owner changes in equity.
iaS 23, (amendment), “borrowing costs” (effective from 1 January 2009)
The amendment to this standard is still subject to endorsement by the European Union. It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) 
as part of the cost of that asset. The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed. The Group will apply IAS 23 
(Amended) from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the European Union but is currently not applicable to the Group as there are no 
qualifying assets.
ifrS 3, (r evised 2008) “business Combinations” (effective from 1 July 2009)
The revised standard will apply to any future business combinations that the Group may undertake once it is in force. The Group has no plans to 
adopt the revised standard in advance of its mandatory implementation date and it is not possible to quantify the effect of the standard on future 
business combinations until and unless those combinations take place.
ifrS 8, “Operating segments” (effective from 1 January 2009)
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 and requires segment information to be presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. 
The adoption of this standard is unlikely to have a significant impact upon the accounts as the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision‑maker is consistent with that presented in these accounts.
ifriC 12, “Service concession arrangements” (effective from 1 January 2008)
This interpretation is not relevant to the Group’s operations as the Group does not provide public sector services.
ifriC 13, “Customer loyalty programmes” (effective from 1 July 2008)
This interpretation is not relevant to the Group’s operations as the Group does not operate customer loyalty incentive programmes.
IFRIC 14, “IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction” (effective from 1 January 2008)
The Group has no defined benefit pension arrangements and so this standard is not relevant to the preparation of the Group’s accounts.

baSiS Of COnSOlidatiOn
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all entities controlled by it after inter‑company 
transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies have been eliminated. Control is achieved where the 
Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of a Group undertaking so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities. 
Undertakings’ results are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
prOperty , plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is 
provided to write off the cost of all property, plant and equipment to its residual value on a straight‑line basis over its expected useful economic 
lives, which are as follows:
Leasehold improvements   five years or over the period of the lease, if shorter
Furniture, fittings and equipment  five years
Computer hardware   two to three years
intangible aSSetS
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised at the cost of acquisition. These costs are amortised on a straight‑line basis over their 
estimated useful economic life of four years.
Costs incurred in the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic 
benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Costs include professional fees and incremental employee costs 
required to bring the software into working condition. Non‑incremental costs are expensed under the relevant income statement heading.
Furthermore, internally‑generated software is recognised as an intangible asset if and only if the Group can demonstrate all of the following conditions:
(a) the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
(b) its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
(c) its ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
(d)  how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the Group can demonstrate the existence 
of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset;
(e) the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and
(f)  its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Internally‑generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight‑line basis over their useful economic lives. Where no internally‑generated 
intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Once completed and available for use in the business, internally developed software is amortised on a straight‑line basis over its useful economic 
life of four years.
CaSh and CaSh equivalentS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and bank deposits available on demand.
inventOrieS – wOrk in prOgreSS
Work in progress comprises directly attributable costs on incomplete market research projects and is held in the balance sheet at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value.
inCOme taxeS
Current income tax liabilities comprise those obligations to fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting period, that are unpaid at 
the balance sheet date. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods to which they relate, based on 
the taxable profit for the year. All changes to current tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, 
except where they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with their respective tax bases. In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward 
as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the underlying 
deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without 
discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity. 26

Operating leaSe agreementS
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged 
to the income statement net of any incentives received from the lessor on a straight‑line basis over the period of the lease.
revenue reCOgnitiOn
Revenue is recognised only after the final written debrief has been delivered to the client, except on the rare occasion that a large project straddles 
a financial period end, and that project can be subdivided into separate discrete deliverables; in such circumstances revenue is recognised on delivery 
of each separate deliverable.
empl Oyee benefitS
All accumulating employee‑compensated absences that are unused at the balance sheet date are recognised as a liability.
Share‑baSed payment tranSaCtiOnS
The Group issues equity‑settled share‑based compensation to certain employees (including Directors). Equity‑settled share‑based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity‑settled share‑based payment is expensed on a 
straight‑line basis over the vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in equity, based upon the Group’s estimate of the shares that will 
eventually vest. These estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of options expected to vest differs from previous 
estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised 
in prior periods.
Fair value is measured by an external valuer using the Black‑Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non‑transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
fOreign CurrenCieS
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the subsidiary operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling (‘GBP’), 
which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year‑end exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.
The results and financial position of all Group companies that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated 
into the presentation currency as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date;
(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to shareholders’ equity. 
When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement 
as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Segment repOrting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment 
(geographical segment).
finanCial inStrumentS
financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: loans and receivables, at fair value through profit or loss, and available‑for‑sale. 
However, at present, only the first of these categories is relevant for the Group. The classification is determined by management at initial 
recognition, being dependent upon the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Loans and receivables are non‑derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents 
in the balance sheet.

financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at cost using the effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt instrument, those financial 
instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs and gains or losses 
relating to financial liabilities are included in the income statement. Finance costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate of return 
on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then this is classed as an equity 
instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.
t rade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recorded at fair value, but subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
t rade payables
Trade payables are initially recorded at fair value, but subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. 
Intangible assets not available for use are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use.
Share Capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share premium 
Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses of the share issue.
Other reServe
The other reserve represents equity‑settled share‑based employee remuneration until such share options are exercised and deferred tax taken 
directly to equity in respect of such options.
merger reServe
The merger reserve represents the difference between the parent company’s cost of investment and a subsidiary’s share capital and share 
premium where a transaction qualifies as a common control transaction. Common control transactions are accounted for using merger accounting 
rather than as business combinations.
fOreign CurrenCy tranSlatiOn reServe 
The foreign currency translation reserve represents the differences arising from translation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.
SignifiCant aCCOunting eStimateS and JudgmentS
Share options
Share options are granted on a discretionary basis and vest evenly over a three year period. The fair value of options granted is determined using 
the Black‑Scholes valuation model, which requires a number of estimates and assumptions. The significant inputs into the model are share price at 
grant date, exercise price, expected option life, expected volatility and the risk free rate. Volatility is measured at the standard deviation of expected 
share prices returns based on statistical analysis of competitors’ share prices.
t rade receivables
Trade receivables are stated net of any impairment. Impairment is based on the Group’s best estimate of the likelihood of recovery on a specific basis.
deferred tax
A deferred tax asset is recognised where the Group considers it probable that a tax credit will be received in the future. This specifically applies 
to tax losses and to outstanding vested share options at the balance sheet date. The Group estimates what proportion of those outstanding share 
options are likely to be exercised and a related tax credit received in the future. The asset recognised is also dependent on the year‑end share price. 28

7 FinanCial RiSk management
The Group’s activities expose it to some financial risks. The Group monitors these risks but does not consider it necessary to use any derivative 
financial instruments to hedge these risks.
Credit riSk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis, arising from credit exposures to outstanding receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Management regularly monitor receivables reports on a Group basis. Since the vast majority of the Group’s clients are large blue‑chip 
organisations, the Group has not yet suffered any bad debts.
market riSk – fOreign ex Change riSk The Group operates in the United States and in the Netherlands and is exposed to currency movements impacting future commercial transactions 
and net investments in those countries.
Management believe that both foreign currency transaction and translation risk are not material to the financial performance of the Group. 
Management monitors foreign exchange gains and losses on a monthly basis and reviews the foreign exchange policy regularly.
At 31 December 2007, with all other variables held constant, the effect of a change in currency rates against Sterling would be as follows:

liquidity riSk The Group forecasts cashflows as part of its business planning procedures and monitors progress against forecasts on a monthly basis. 
Cash is not invested on a long term basis in order to prudently manage liquidity risk.
Capital riSk management
The Group has no borrowings and does not at present pay dividends. The Directors believe that this low risk capital structure is appropriate given 
the early stage, high growth nature of the business.

Share OptiOnS
The Group issues share options to Directors and to employees under an HM Revenue and Customs approved Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) 
scheme. Employees resident overseas are eligible to participate in the scheme but their options do not qualify as HM Revenue and Customs approved. 
The grant price for share options is equal to the average quoted market price of the Company shares on the date of grant. Options vest evenly over 
a period of one to three years following grant date. If share options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options 
expire. Share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows:

The weighted average share price at date of exercise of options exercised during the year was 117.2 pence (2006: 72.0 pence). The weighted 
average fair value of options granted in the year was £48.5 pence (2006: £18.8 pence).
The total charge for the year relating to employee share‑based payment plans was £54,000 (2006: £22,000), all of which related to equity‑settled 
share‑based payment transactions.

Significant inputs into the model include a weighted average share price of 162.5 pence (2006: 24.3 pence) at the grant date, the exercise 
prices shown above, weighted average volatility of 35.0% (2006: 66.3%), dividend yield of Nil (2006: Nil), an expected option life of three years 
(2006: 3.21 years) and an annual risk‑free interest rate of 5.5% (2006: 4.3%).
The expected volatility inputs to the model were calculated using historic daily share prices of companies operating in similar industry sectors 
to the Group. The period from date of grant to date of exercise was used in determining volatility for each tranche of options.
In January 2007 290,529 share options were granted to Directors and employees with an exercise price set at the market price on the date of grant 
(162.5 pence per share).

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential Ordinary Shares. For share options, a calculation is made in order to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at 
fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights 
attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated in this way is compared with the number of shares that would have been 
issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

noteS
1.  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 the Company specifies that only those shareholders registered 
in the register of members of the Company at 6:00 p.m. on 19 May 2008 shall be entitled to attend and vote at this Annual General Meeting 
or at any adjournment of the meeting in respect of such number of shares registered in their name at such time. Changes to entries on the register 
of remembers after 6:00 p.m. on 19 May 2008 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. 
2.  If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in note 1 above, you are entitled to appoint another person as your proxy to exercise 
all or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at this Annual General Meeting or at any adjournment of the meeting. Such a member may 
appoint more than one proxy in relation to this Annual General Meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to 
a different share or shares by that member. You may only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy 
form. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending and 
voting in person at this Annual General Meeting or at any adjournment of the meeting. 
3.  A form of proxy is provided with this notice and instructions for use are shown on the form. To be effective, the completed form of proxy must 
be deposited to Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU by no later than forty‑eight hours before the 
start of the meeting or at any adjournment of the meeting together with, if appropriate, the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under 
which it is signed or a notarially certified copy or office copy of such power of authority. 
4.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for this Annual 
General Meeting by using the procedures described in the CREST manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, 
and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), 
who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. Please note the following: 
 (a)  in order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy 
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (“EUI”) specifications and must contain 
the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the 
appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted 
so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. 
For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
applications host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST . 
After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. 
 (b)  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input 
of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal 
member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) 
take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. 
In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred in particular 
to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
 (c)  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
5.  Copies of the service agreements of the Executive Directors and the letters of appointment of the Non‑executive Directors will be available 
for inspection during the normal business hours from the date of dispatch of this notice until the date of the meeting (Saturdays, Sundays and 
public holidays excepted) at the registered office of the Company and will also be made available for inspection at the place of the Annual 
General Meeting from 15 minutes prior to and during the Annual General Meeting. advisers

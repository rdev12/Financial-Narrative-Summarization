Chairman’s statement
2013 has been a seminal year for 
Countrywide: the housing market 
recovery is underway, increasing 
business activity across the Group; 
the successful IPO in March and 
subsequent debt repayment; and 
£50.4 million has been invested in 
strategic acquisitions, strengthening 
our services and geographical 
footprint. I am therefore delighted 
to report a positive set of results 
for 2013. Total income increased by 
11% to £584.8 million and EBITDA 
increased by 37% to £86.6 million, 
which is reflected in adjusted 
earnings per share of 24.4 pence. 
On the basis of these results, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 6.0 pence 
(net) per share, giving a total 2013 dividend of 
8.0 pence (net) per share. Subject to approval 
at the AGM, to be held on 30 April 2014, 
the dividend will be paid on 7 May 2014 to 
shareholders on the register at 28 March 2014.
Capital structure
After an absence of six years, Countrywide was 
re-listed on the London Stock Exchange raising 
£220 million in new share capital. At the same 
time we secured a new £100 million banking 
facility with a syndicate of six banks. These 
funds were used to redeem the £250 million of 
10% fixed interest debt in May. No shares were 
sold at IPO by directors or our three sponsors, 
who retained their interests in the shares post 
floatation. Subsequently, Apollo and Alchemy 
divested their holdings in full. Oaktree sold 
9.3% of their 36.9% holding and remain as the 
largest single investor with a 27.6% holding, 
with management holding 4.3%, and the 
remaining 68.1% of shares being freely traded 
and held largely by an encouragingly broad 
range of long term institutional investors.
Net debt (excluding finance leases) at the year 
end was £37.7 million (2012: £203.2 million) 
and the Group had a further £25.0 million 
in undrawn facilities. 
In February 2014 we increased our banking 
facilities by £50 million and at the same time 
reduced the margin we pay. The additional 
funds will be used to invest in further strategic 
opportunities when appropriate.
Board update
As the Company moved towards IPO, Robert 
Davies, Sandra Turner and Neville Richardson 
were appointed as the initial independent 
non-executive directors. Cathy Turner 
and I were appointed shortly after the IPO 
to complement the Board composition and 
to achieve Code compliance. Unforeseen 
circumstances led to the early resignations 
of Robert Davies and Neville Richardson 
and the Board will be looking to make further 
appointments in the first half of 2014 to fill the 
vacancies this created. Following the disposal 
by Apollo-Affiliated Fund of part of their 
respective shareholdings in the Company, their 
aggregate shareholdings were reduced and to 
reflect the reduced size of their shareholding, 
Sanjay Patel, the director of the Company 
appointed by them stepped down with 
immediate effect in August 2013. In addition, 
CEO Grenville Turner has indicated his desire 
to step down as CEO during the course of 2014. 
A search for his successor, both from within 
and outside the Company, has therefore been 
initiated. Given his extensive and unparalleled 
experience in the sector, the Board has asked 
him to take over as non-executive Chairman 
and Grenville has agreed to do so once a new 
CEO is in place. I will then become Deputy 
Chairman and Senior Independent Director. 
The decision to appoint Grenville as Chairman 
has been discussed with a number of the 
Company’s major shareholders, as was the 
Board’s desire to maintain the continuity and 
success of the senior management team that 
has overseen Countrywide’s successful return 
to the public markets. The Board is continuing 
to make progress in appointing two new 
independent directors to return to full code 
compliance and further announcements will  
be made in due course.
Markets
As we noted in our January 2014 Trading 
Update, the recovery of the housing market 
is still at an early stage. The key to a lasting 
recovery is assisting first time buyers and 
the general housing market outside of 
London and the South East. We remain 
supportive of the Government’s policies 
to achieve this and are wary of London 
centric market commentators’ views that 
the whole UK housing market is overheated. 
As we comment elsewhere in this report, 
Help to Buy seems to be addressing the 
Delivering results, developing 
innovative products, and capitalising 
on our unique proposition INTRODUCTION

Government’s intended audience. 
Nevertheless there remains a significant 
imbalance between supply and demand 
for housing stock in the South East and 
Government and Local Authority policies 
will remain important in helping to bring 
these forces into a better sense of balance.
Outlook
The positive market trends which 
began in 2013 have continued into 2014. 
In January 2014, total income for the Group 
of £50.1 million was the highest ever level 
recorded for the month of January, and 
furthermore profitability was at the highest 
level since January 2007. With more lenders 
now supporting Help to Buy, macro-economic 
indicators forecasting growth in the UK 
economy and consumer confidence indices 
improving, we fully expect the UK housing 
recovery to continue and anticipate that 
we can deliver the highest ever levels of 
Group profitability in 2014.
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank everyone across the Group for their 
commitment and passion during a year that, 
whilst being undoubtedly challenging, marks 
a major step in the transformation of the Group.

An encouraging  
performance
I am proud to say that 2013 
has been a momentous year, in 
which we successfully returned to 
the public market and delivered strong 
financial results driven by our core 
business and augmented by value 
creating acquisitions. 
In addition, the early stages of the market 
recovery evident in 2013 have also provided 
the platform for growth across our business. 
The recovery will also generate increased 
competition with new entrants to the market, 
but our management team remain focused 
on delivering optimal results and innovating to 
continue to ensure the business is dynamic 
and productive.
Over the past six years, the management 
team has worked together through a sustained 
period of difficulty in the property market, 
to transform Countrywide into a leaner and 
more efficient organisation with a greater 
proportion of sustainable revenue. The 
successful completion of the IPO in March 
was testament to the fact that investors 
recognised this transformation. Post IPO, 
the significantly reduced capital gearing 
provides a solid basis for further investment 
in strategic opportunities.
Government backed initiatives announced in 
Q1 2013 have supported the recovery in the 
housing market. The Help to Buy and Funding 
for Lending schemes have incentivised lenders 
to increase the availability of higher loan to 
value mortgages. These initiatives have 
contributed to the increase in the number of 
first time buyers and new build purchasers 
who are both seen as key drivers of the 
housing market recovery. 
Building a business in a rising market can 
often be as difficult as managing through 
a recession. Maintaining cost control discipline 
has to remain a focus as we seek to capitalise 
on volume growth. While we removed a 
significant amount of cost over the past six 
years, some of those costs have returned, 
for example commissions, but we recognise 
that headcount, together with marketing 
expenditure, will need to increase if we are to 
maintain service levels and protect and develop 
market share in a sustainably rising market.
We remain focused on executing our 
strategy for market leadership and profitable 
growth across each of our divisions, creating 
opportunities to provide more complementary 
service offerings across all target markets. This 
will be underpinned by continued investment in 
those areas that support scalable and efficient 
delivery of service to customers.
Having dealt with several years of professional 
indemnity claims and significant exceptional 
charges to the income statement, we are 
confident that we have passed the worst. As we 
anticipated, the number of claims received 
in 2013 fell significantly and average losses 
were in line with expectation. Therefore, 
barring any unexpected change in trends, 
we believe that amounts previously provided 
are sufficient to meet our liabilities.
Customers 
Our customers are at the heart of the services 
we provide and our focus on them ensures our 
products and services both meet and exceed 
their expectations. I am delighted to announce 
that we have retained key commercial contracts 
and entered into two significant corporate 
relationships. Additionally, for the fifth year in a 
row our customers have voted for us to win the 
coveted Gold prize for Best Large Chain – 
National Category, at the Estate & Letting Agent 
Awards (ESTAs). The ESTAs recognise and 
reward high standards of customer service 
and are unique in being the only awards in the 
industry to be based purely on the votes 
of vendors and buyers. Our own customer 
feedback surveys confirm that nine out of 
ten Hamptons International customers would 
use us again and nine out of ten of our 
conveyancing customers would recommend 
us to family and friends. However, we must 
not nor would we be complacent about 
our success. We are reinforcing this focus 
on  customer service being at the heart 
of our operations through our internal 
‘Hearts & Minds’ programme for Estate 
Agency employees. This programme 
is a peer to peer initiative and the themes 
for the programme include language, 
positive first responses and massive 
action for massive results.
Chief executive’s review
Employees
The dedication and hard work demonstrated 
by our employees is key to the success of 
Countrywide. Developing the current teams 
and future employees is central to our strategy 
for market leadership and profitable growth 
across each of our divisions. I am pleased to 
report that we have around 200 graduates, 
apprentices and trainees throughout our Estate 
Agency, Lettings, Surveying and Conveyancing 
divisions. As CEO I am always keen to hear how 
our employees feel about Countrywide. With 
that in mind we engaged an independent 
consultancy to run our first confidential 
employee engagement survey. The results 
have been analysed and my executive team 
will be focused on addressing the key themes 
from the feedback. 
IT transformation
We are now two thirds of the way through our 
IT transformation with a significant investment 
programme in new hardware and systems. 
We are working with our strategic partner, CGI, 
to complete the transformation and roll out in 
2014 giving the Group a robust infrastructure 
to recognise benefits from 2015 onwards.

Flats in Leeds. In addition, the acquisition of 
Lambert Smith Hampton (LSH) gives us a 
significant foothold in the commercial property 
market, driving more opportunities to our teams 
operating our core Land & New Homes, and 
Residential Development & Investment 
businesses as well as extending our 
relationship with key corporate partners. 
We are committed to a targeted acquisition 
programme and already in 2014 we have 
invested £15.1 million in 6 businesses, including 
Tucker Gardner Residential, Curtis and Bains 
and Preston Bennett Holdings. 
We are pleased to announce that we have 
also spent £7 million acquiring our first rental 
property investment. In comparison to other 
countries, investment by financial institutions in 
UK residential property has been relatively 
limited. With market conditions improving and 
the UK Government encouraging investment in 
residential property, that situation is changing. 
As the market leader in UK residential property 
services, we believe Countrywide is uniquely 
placed to play a major role in the growth of this 
developing sector through providing access to 
unparalleled market insight and a service 
platform to operate at scale across the UK. 
We are currently exploring options to partner 
with institutional investors or a fund manager 
to establish a large residential property 
investment vehicle with a target size of 
£1 billion invested over the next five years. 
We have committed £20 million of our own 
capital to the project to acquire a seed 
portfolio and a future pipeline of suitable, 
privately rented, residential assets.
Award winning performance
We have had another year of award winning 
performances with the Group and divisions 
winning 20 awards this year, which makes 
152 awards won since 2008. These fantastic 
achievements are testimony to the hard work 
and dedication of all our employees.

Our markets in depth
2013: A year  
of rebalancing
Volumes of house sales have risen 
an estimated 13% during 2013 across 
the UK to reach the highest level 
since late 2007. Rising sales have 
been matched by rising prices across 
some areas of the country with the 
Land Registry reporting prices in 
England up by 4.4%, while in London 
prices rose 11.2%. However, excluding 
London, average prices rose just 
1.9% across the rest of England, 
well below the rate of inflation. 
During the recent recession the London 
housing market suffered less than the rest 
of the UK. In London house prices are rising 
quickly and are now 15.7% higher than in 
December 2007, being the only region to 
recover to 2007 levels. However, London only 
accounts for 12-13% of market transactions 
and house prices across the rest of the UK are 
still below levels reached in 2007. In areas 
of the Midlands and the North a substantial 
proportion of properties bought between 
six and eight years ago are still worth less 
than buyers paid. House price growth is 
spreading from the South East increasing 
the equity of homeowners in parts of the 
Midlands, and reducing significantly the 
number of households in negative equity. 
Where households have seen their financial 
circumstances improve over the year and find 
themselves recently out of negative equity, 
rising house prices alongside the mortgage 
repayments will have provided a deposit for 
those households looking to move. Larger 
towns and cities outside London, where 
house prices fell furthest after 2007, saw 
transaction levels grow particularly quickly 
during 2013. In Leicester, Cardiff, Liverpool 
and Manchester, transactions grew at rates 
above the UK average.
2013 can be summarised as a year of 
rebalancing in the housing market. Between 
2008 and 2012 transaction levels in London 
and the South East rebounded more strongly 
than those in the North. Transaction volumes 
in a number of Central and West London 
Boroughs are back at 70-80% of pre-crash 
levels. 2013 was the year that the rest of the 
UK began to catch up. While transaction 
levels have grown across the whole country, 
the Midlands, North and Scotland saw the 
fastest growth. In many cases this has been 
driven by households finding themselves 
financially in a position to move for the 
first time in five or six years. 
There is a risk that the recovery in the 
UK housing market is weakened as 
London-centric commentators raise the 
fear of a house price bubble stimulating a 
change of policy by the Bank of England or 
Government. The UK housing market is a key 
driver of the UK economy. House purchases 
are often the trigger for consumer purchases 
(white goods, furniture, DIY, etc.) therefore we 
need to retain a balanced perspective on the 
housing market in order that a steady and 
broad recovery is sustained through 2014 
and beyond.
While national transaction volumes 
increased by 13%, exchanges through our 
core Estate Agency branches grew by 8%. 
Excluding the impact of a significant drop in 
the repossessions market, our underlying 
volumes rose by 12% which compares to 
the market growth in houses valued below 
£250,000 (our core market) of 9%. 
Exchanges in our London & Premier 
division grew by 15%, comparing favourable 
with increased transactions in London as 
reported by the Land Registry.
As consumer confidence returns, financial 
institutions are lending more money and 
offering increasingly competitive products. 
Mortgage lending increased in 2013 both 
for new house purchase (+20.0%) and 
remortgages (+15.5%.) 2013 saw a substantial 
increase in mortgage lending to existing 
homeowners, but it has been the growth in 
lending to first-time buyers which has been 
particularly notable. Lending to first-time 
buyers increased by 40% to reach the 
highest level since Q4 2007. Comparatively, 
lending to existing homeowners rose by 19%.
While the Bank of England base rate has 
remained at 0.5%, throughout 2013 the 
expectation of a rate rise in 2014 or 2015 
has begun to grow. 2013 also saw a record 
number of borrowers opt for a fixed rate 
mortgage. 95% of all mortgages in 2013 
brokered through Countrywide plc were 
on fixed rate basis. This compared to 87% in 
2012, while prior to 2007 fixed rate products 
accounted for a steady 75-80% of the market.

Changes in house prices 2013 Changes in house prices since 2007
Transaction growth 2013 Transactions as percentage of 2007 Peak
With unemployment edging towards 7%, 
the threshold at which the Bank of England 
initially said it would consider raising interest 
rates, borrowers are increasingly judging the 
premium they pay for security against a rate 
rise to be good value.
The ‘Help to Buy’ mortgage guarantee has 
received lots of attention and ill-informed 
speculation that it is driving the house price 
boom. However, putting the scheme in 
perspective, Q3 2013 volumes only 
accounted for 2.2% of mortgage approvals. 
Furthermore, the volume of applicants in 
London was only 5.5% of all ‘Help To Buy’ 
mortgages. Nevertheless the scheme is 
supporting consumer confidence and 
assisting first-time buyers and house 
purchasers in lower value areas.
Even though housing market transactions 
are increasing, demand for rental property 
remains strong, particularly across the North 
of England where rentals and rents grew 
most in 2013. Outer areas of London proved 
to be the exception to the rule in the South 
with average rents rising 3.4% in line with 
increases seen across Scotland and 
Northern England. 2013 also saw wages and 
rents grow at the closest rate for four years. 
Average rents grew 2.0% across the UK while 
full time earnings rose 1.9%. Across parts of 
the South East, South West and Midlands 
wages increased twice as quickly as rents. 
With job creation beginning to take hold 
outside London and the South East, demand 
in the rental market in 2013 has been driven 
by those finding new employment. In the last 
twelve months the number of people in 
employment grew 1.1% across London and 
the South East. However, this was surpassed 
by growth of 1.8% across the North. Growth 
in rents has been a product of an improving

KPIs Highlights
The Estate Agency division is the UK’s largest by market share, 
with 804 branches operating nationwide from Penzance to 
Stirling. As well as estate agency services, it plays a key role 
in driving revenue of the other Countrywide divisions.
Operating review
The Estate Agency division saw a 56% 
increase in EBITDA to £16.1 million. This 
was achieved from a higher income figure 
of £193 million and a cost base largely 
unchanged from the previous year. 
2013 saw an upturn in market volumes with 
Estate Agency increasing house exchanges 
by 8% compared to 2012. Market conditions 
improved gradually throughout the year, 
helped by improving economic/consumer 
sentiment, better credit markets, and 
Government initiatives supporting the 
UK housing market including ‘Help To Buy’.
Relative growth was stronger in the South of 
the UK, although we saw performance improve 
across all of our main regions. Availability 
and competition for new housing stock was 
the key challenge in the year, with the ratio 
of sales agreed to new listings at the highest 
level for some time, averaging 80%. 
Of particular significance in 2013 was an 
improved performance on cross sales to 
other divisions. The biggest improvements 
came in introducing vendors and purchasers 
to the Conveyancing and Surveying divisions. 
Penetration rates on conveyancing increased 
by over 8 percentage points in the year. 
Significant operational change was achieved 
in 2013. In October we completed the process 
of transferring all branch administration 
support to our new National Sales Support 
Centre in Cheadle, Greater Manchester. 
This has delivered quality and process 
improvements as well as realising significant 
ongoing cost savings compared to our 
previous model of branch-based and 
regionally-based administration. The Centre 
is also focused on projects that will improve 
service levels for our customers such 
as overflow call handing, out of hours 
operation and complaints handling.
The year was relatively subdued with regards 
to new branch openings and acquisitions. 
We continued with our Yorkshire expansion 
programme, opening new Bridgfords and 
Blundells branches in West and South 
Yorkshire respectively, and in contrast to 
recent years there were few branch closures.
Market challenges
As market conditions improve they also 
bring challenges for the Estate Agency 
division; competition for scarce listings 
is fierce and there is pressure on fees, 
while an increasing number of new 
entrants add further competitive pressure.
Asset management
The year was a testing one for our Asset 
Management business with an estimated 15% 
decline in the UK repossession market volumes 
versus 2013. This is the fourth consecutive year 
of decline in a market where Countrywide has 
traditionally held a strong market share, thereby 
having a disproportionate impact on overall 
market share.

Focus on: Land & New Homes
Building more new homes is a key long term priority for the UK 
Government. A number of Government initiatives have been introduced 
with the aim of increasing access to new homes. Countrywide identified 
the opportunity in the Land & New Homes (L&NH) market in 201 1, 
taking steps to invest significantly in the L&NH business since that time.
Land & New Homes
Through strategic investment and positive 
market sentiment, our Land & New Homes 
business enjoyed significant revenue growth 
in 2013, up 18% in the year. While this was 
helped in part by the ‘Help to Buy’ scheme, 
much of the impact of this Government 
scheme has been seen in increased 
reservation numbers but has not yet 
translated into house sales. 
The Land & New Homes business topped 
an impressive year by winning the Sunday 
Times New Homes agency of the year 
award for the second successive year.
Overseas investors
2013 saw a record year of activity within 
London & Premier (L&P) in terms of overseas 
investment into the UK. Channelled through 
Hamptons’ Hong Kong subsidiary, 170 sales 
of London properties were made to overseas 
investors in addition to high levels of interest 
from overseas buyers through the L&P branch 
network. Hamptons’ Hong Kong subsidiary 
not only delivered impressive leads and sales 
to the UK agency business, but generated 
significant revenues from sales of Malaysian 
properties to Hong Kong buyers.
Equally important to the division’s international 
strategy is the Hamptons International 
website which, by mid-2014, will boast over 
100,000 international properties on any 
UK property website. Key associations have 
been made with estate agents in Spain, Italy, 
France and the US served by over 5,000 
buyer and seller leads from the L&P UK 
agency network in 2013.

Building more homes is one of the urgent 
issues facing the UK Government. This 
was highlighted by the launch of the ‘Help 
To Buy’ Equity Loans scheme in 2013, and 
other commendable initiatives such as 
the relaxation of Planning Laws and the 
Build to Rent fund. 
2013 was the second year of a significant 
investment programme in this important 
area, with our L&NH business adding 
21 new employees in the year and delivering 
a 34% increase in house exchanges. 
L&NH integrates with other Countrywide 
divisions and employs specialist teams 
within Conveyancing and Financial Services. 
The service capability was further enhanced

Segmental review
London  
& Premier
The London & Premier division is the foremost UK estate 
agency business in the over £500,000 residential market by 
market share and provides a compelling service proposition 
through a multi-brand strategy.
 126 branches  
in the UK
Formation of London & Premier
This new division for Countrywide, consisting 
of 126 offices, was created by bringing 
together the brands that operate in the 
upper price segments of the UK housing 
market. These brands comprise: 
Y 
Hamptons International
Y 
John D Wood & Co.
Y 
Faron Sutaria
Y 
UK Sotheby’s International Realty
Y 
Hetheringtons
Y 
Alan de Maid
These brands are geographically centred 
around London and the South of the UK 
and operate in their own distinct market 
segments, ensuring we are present 
throughout the whole upper middle and 
top end of the market where appropriate. 
Hamptons International is the largest of 
these brands with over 70 offices covering 
the desired markets spreading from Bristol 
in the West, across the South and London 
and north to Oxfordshire.
Operating review
Assisted by strategic investment and improving 
market conditions, the division achieved 
record levels of income and profitability. 
The L&P market remains relatively strong 
in comparison to the broader UK residential 
market, benefitting from improving financial 
markets, overseas investment and a lower 
reliance on credit to drive transaction levels.
Several new offices were opened in 2013 
including Sevenoaks, Amersham, South 
Woodford and Canary Wharf. All are developing 
in line with their business plans. In addition, 
offices opened in recent years such as Ealing, 
Battersea, Balham, Southfields and Canford 
Cliffs, are making a growing contribution. 
The formation of L&P as a new division 
allows us to share best practice among the 
brands and extract synergies by leveraging 
our infrastructure in areas such as IT, HR, 
marketing and finance. For example, our 
London Contact Centre, which provides 
support to Hamptons International in driving 
activity levels and handling overflow calls, 
has been expanded to include Faron Sutaria 
and further growth is planned in 2014 
allowing more branches to benefit.
As we enter 2014 there continues to be a 
positive sentiment within the L&P markets 
and the division will continue to identify new 
office openings organically and selected 
acquisitions that are accretive.

Focus on:  
The London & 
Premier market
During 2013 London & 
Premier listed nearly 10% of 
all properties valued at over 
£0.5 million, selling twice 
the number of houses than 
its nearest competitor.
The L&P market differs from the UK 
mainstream housing market, not least 
because of its sensitivity to overseas 
investment demand. Buyers in this 
market are also less likely to be 
constrained by credit availability. 
London’s reputation as a safe haven 
during the recession encouraged 
investment, but investors are now more 
wary about capital growth in the near 
term. London’s prime markets are still 
considered safe assets, but as the global 
recovery gathers pace and yields on 
other assets improve, investors will 
consider other options. In addition, 
uncertainty about taxation policy for 
higher value property – stamp duty 
thresholds, mansion tax and changes 
to capital gains tax – will add to caution. 
The severe lack of supply in this sector 
and London’s position as a safe haven 
and a prime global city will support price 
growth, but it is likely to be more modest 
than elsewhere in the capital.
Sales 
The L&P market has been characterised by 
strong levels of demand but a lack of supply, 
especially in Central London. New instructions 
have been difficult to win with the market 
suffering from a lack of available properties 
to sell and frustrated purchasers unable to 
find a property to move to. Due to these 
supply constraints, prime Central London 
has seen record property prices achieved 
over the course of the last year. 
The lack of property has had the knock on 
effect of high levels of activity and greatest 
growth in the surrounding areas such as 
London Zone 2, as people move from Central 
London, trading a similar priced property for 
a much larger home. This ripple effect has 
continued into the locations outside London, 
benefitting Hamptons International, Alan de 
Maid and Hetheringtons, assisted by more 
favourable credit markets. Across L&P, sales 
activity levels were at record breaking levels 
with the conversion of instructions into 
exchanges at the highest level recorded.
Lettings 
Hamptons’ lettings in London remains strong, 
although there was a slow down in the outer 
London and country offices. Correct pricing, 
superior specification and presentation has 
been the key to attracting the best tenants 
this year. Value for money has been vitally 
important as tenants happily move if they 
can find a more reasonably priced home, 
potentially leaving landlords with an 
empty property. 
We expect rental pricing growth across the 
UK to remain subdued as the sales market 
recovers and a number of tenants become 
homeowners. This will be most keenly felt 
in the regions where renting has become 
expensive compared to owning. 
Overall we have grown the number of 
managed units by 7% in 2013 and have 
seen a growth in our market share. 
Residential Development 
and Investment
The Residential Development and Investment 
business of Hamptons International had a 
busy and successful year in terms of new 
instructions and pitched for new business 
and expanding the client network across 
all of our regions. 
In Hong Kong, the Hamptons International’s 
Asia sales team had a very good year with 
over 1 18 units sold across three developments 
in the last two months of 2013 alone.
The rising prices should encourage 
more sellers into the market, adding 
liquidity, but a lack of supply will 
underpin house prices, particularly 
in London and the South.

Lettings
2013 was a year of continued growth for the Lettings business 
with key focus on customer service, development of the New 
Starts programme and supporting the organic growth with 
targeted, value adding acquisitions.
43,783 properties  
let in 2013
Summary
The lettings market remained favourable 
and, as there has been limited new supply 
of property, this has led to gradually increasing 
rents supported by continued demand 
from tenants.
Over the year the number of potential tenants 
registering with us grew to over 384,000 
and this helped us increase the number 
of properties that we let to 43,783.
Working with other parts of the Group in 
a co-ordinated way has delivered referrals 
of potential clients that helps retain clients 
within the Group as their property needs 
change over time.
Supporting growth
We recognise that growth places a number 
of challenges on the business and have 
addressed these to ensure that we can 
continue to deliver future growth.
Employee training and development
We have introduced an industry leading, online, 
interactive employee training and development 
system that has delivered a significant increase 
in the training available to employees across 
the business. Supported by a dedicated 
training team, this structured curriculum, 
focused on specific employee roles, ensures 
that employees have the right skills and 
practical knowledge to meet customer 
expectations. This investment supports 
career development plans which are being 
developed for all employees.
Systems development
We continue to develop our integrated 
IT platform to ensure that it meets both current 
and future needs, including the expansion 
of the business. Development of online services 
for our clients resulted in the launch of an 
improved Client Portal which will be developed 
further during 2014, enabling a far higher 
level of client interaction and self-service. 
Mobile applications for our employees to help 
them are being developed.
Branch network
Our network provides the first point of contact 
for customers and landlords. Lettings agents 
are often incorporated within estate agency 
branches, but form a separate, dedicated 
team. This ensures that there is a clear focus 
on driving the Lettings business. All employees 
are comprehensively trained to ensure they 
can meet client expectations.
Support service
Provides support to our branch network 
and clients directly through client accounting 
and legal services. This team ensures that 
we have the best processes and legal support 
for our business and our clients through the 
production of all legal documents such as 
tenancy agreements and through rigorous 
tenant referencing.

Focus on: Lettings’ operational model
The division focuses its customer facing teams on servicing customer needs 
and letting properties support is provided by dedicated teams 
of professionals.
Property management team
Our property management team provides 
support to customers and tenants in relation 
to repair and condition issues throughout 
the tenancy and the handover at the start 
and end of the tenancy. They provide a key 
point of contact for both customers and 
tenants and service quality is key to 
customer satisfaction.
Acquisitions and New Starts
We continue to look at expansion through 
acquisitions and seek to find businesses that 
are complementary to our existing network 
which can be readily integrated to ensure that 
service levels are maintained and potential 
synergies delivered.
We have a dedicated team who ensure 
that our acquisitions are carefully selected, 
vetted and integrated along with the relevant 
operational managers within the business. 
During the year we reviewed a large number 
of potential deals and completed 
28 acquisitions across the country, 
at a cost of £18.2 million.
The majority of deals are small single 
branch businesses which are readily 
incorporated into the business and adopt 
the trading name of the most appropriate 
Group business. We have, however, acquired 
a number of more substantial businesses 
where retention of the existing trading name 
generates more value for the Group such as 
Russells Lettings in Cambridge and Fitz-Gibbon 
Lettings in South West London. During 2013, 
acquired businesses contributed £5.3 million 
to income and £1.8 million to EBITDA.
As businesses are integrated they benefit 
from the systems, services and scale 
economies that we can deliver whilst still 
retaining the things their customers value. 
Our core business model often means that 
new revenue streams, for example, insurance 
sales and cross referrals, can be delivered.
Our New Start programme that delivered 
organic growth through the opening of 
Lettings’ businesses within the Group’s 
existing estate agency offices is now 
providing a positive contribution to the 
business in line with the original plan. 
The programme was delivered in four 
phases and, as expected, some offices 
develop faster than others and we continue 
to review the development of each branch. 
The programme currently has 169 offices 
as some have been combined with acquired 
businesses or other branches. The New Starts 
branches generated income of £16.4 million 
(2012: £9.4 million) and EBITDA of £1.4 million 
(2012: loss £2.7 million).
We continue to open selective new offices 
and, including a new office in Liverpool city 
centre branded as Entwistle Green, we 
opened seven offices in 2013.

Financial  
Services
The Financial Services division is the third largest 
mortgage distributor in the UK, with just below 
 10% share of the intermediary mortgage market.
Operating review
Following a challenging 2012, market 
conditions in 2013 have been more 
encouraging with signs that the UK 
economic recovery is gathering pace 
and many lenders focused on delivering 
an increased lending target in the latter 
part of the year. Initiatives such as the 
‘Help to Buy’ and the ‘Funding For Lending’ 
schemes have contributed to the feeling 
of optimism, making it easier for borrowers 
to access mortgages and lowering the 
cost of lending for banks.
In the face of these positive market trends, 
the Financial Services division has delivered 
a strong profit performance in 2013 with 
EBITDA 25% up on 2012, due mainly to a 
4% reduction in operating costs, principally 
employee related. Total income remained 
flat on last year, due to market mix factors 
and recruitment challenges, both of which 
are explored in further detail below.
Market ‘mix’: 
A large element of the market growth has 
been seen in new homes, remortgages 
and buy to let, and has not yet translated 
into significant growth in mortgages for 
second-hand house transactions 
where the Countrywide core business 
has a larger market share.
Recruitment:
During the second half of the year, there 
has been significant investment in retaining 
and growing the sales force as the market 
gained momentum. Total mortgage 
consultant headcount closed the year at 
621, an increase from 575 at the end of 
June 2013. We expect this to continue in 
H1 2014. Due to training and mortgage lead 
times, new recruits take up to six months to 
become revenue generating, hence it was 
pleasing to see a slight recovery in market 
share in Q4 2013 as the impact of this 
investment started to pay dividends.
Outlook
The housing market appears to have turned 
a corner, with transactions and prices both 
rising. This momentum impacts positively 
on the Financial Services division where 
the closing mortgage pipeline is 15% 
higher than last year, average loan value is 
7% higher than last year and significantly 
mortgage advances completed within the 
Group in 2013 totalled £8.3 billion, a 20% 
increase from 2012.

Highlights
A leading provider of residential valuations, surveys 
and panel management services in the UK with over 
330 employed RICS qualified surveyors covering 
most of the UK.
Operating review 
Surveying Services continued its impressive 
year-on-year EBITDA growth (20%) whilst 
also making significant investments in key 
areas including £0.5 million in a major 
trainee programme which will be critical for 
continued growth in future years. Excluding 
these training costs, underlying EBITDA 
would be £12.3 million (26% year-on-year 
growth). Total income grew by 9% against 
the prior year; this increase was driven by 
both average fee growth (5%) and growth 
of the instructions completed (8%). A buoyant 
market, including the resurgence of the 
remortgage market in H1 2013, improving 
surveyor fee levels across the industry, 
careful management of surveyor workflow 
by the National Operations Centre and 
the continued dedication of the surveyor 
workforce were key features of this success. 
2013 saw the industry face well publicised 
challenges around declining service levels 
with the growth in lending volumes 
highlighting capacity shortages in certain 
areas of the country, principally in the 
South East. In the immediate term we 
focused our efforts on expanding capacity 
where possible both through recruitment 
and relocating surveyors on an interim basis. 
The brisk pace of market recovery in 2013 
led us to accelerate and expand our trainee 
programme so that we would be able to 
increase our own in-house capacity by 25% 
by H2 2014. This programme and continued 
expansion of our consultant network allowed 
us to overcome capacity limitations, which 
will continue to challenge the industry 
and increase in a recovering market. 
At the start of the year, we completed the 
transition to our new workflow system for 
all surveyors in England and Wales with our 
Scottish business, Harvey Donaldson & Gibson, 
following in Q4. This important investment 
has enabled us to move forward on a leading 
industry platform. The expertise within the 
business and the timing of the transition 
ensured this major change had no impact on 
operational efficiency for us or our client base. 
We continue to focus heavily on risk 
management with several projects completing 
during the year delivering enhancements to 
risk control and business sustainability. Whilst 
we continue to incur costs on valuation claims 
relating to surveys undertaken in prior years, 
these are broadly in line with the provision 
made at the end of 2012 and volume trends 
are declining. Our customers and employees 
are at the heart of what we do and the key 
addition of a director of field operations, 
Paul Wareham, to the Board in June has 
ensured these key focus areas have been 
strengthened further. We were delighted 
to announce the three year extension of 
the Nationwide Building Society contract, 
as well as extending other key contracts for 
an additional two years. With all three of our 
biggest contracts now having over two years 
to run, and the continued removal of low fee, 
non-core, or higher risk lenders from our 
client base, this means we move into 2014 
with a healthy customer portfolio.

Conveyancing 
Services
Conveyancing Services is strategically 
positioned to service a returning market.
Conveyancing Services achieved an EBITDA 
growth of 5% through an increase in Group 
referred business, replacing a decline in 
third party volumes. Responding to the 
increasing volumes of Group generated 
work, we have launched our own in-house 
training academy to boost conveyancer 
numbers in a recovering market.
Operating review
The Conveyancing Services division 
generates revenue from the provision of 
panel management services for third 
parties and Countrywide referred work 
and also by completing transactional legal 
work through its own in-house regulated 
conveyancing business. 
Income decreased by 1% year-on-year which 
was due to lower third party contract panel 
management volumes. This is the full year 
effect reflecting changes made to the HSBC 
panel management contract mid-2012. The 
reduction in third party generated income 
was broadly offset by an increase in Group 
generated income, following a 15% 
improvement in the instruction volumes 
from the Countrywide Group network 
leading to an 11% increase in completion 
volumes, the majority of this uplift being 
completed via our panel firm partners. 
2013 saw a sluggish start to the year 
with a relatively subdued Q1 before much 
improved activity developed from Q2 2013 
onwards. The timing of this instruction 
uplift coupled with a market elongation 
of pipelines during Q3 and Q4 has meant 
that much of this volume improvement is 
still within our live pipelines going into 
2014. Our closing pipeline of live work 
was 17% up at the year end. 
Capacity secured
As the market has shown signs of 
steady recovery during 2013, we have 
put in place several measures to secure 
conveyancing capacity required to service 
a recovering market both through our 
in-house conveyancing operation and 
also through our panel firm partners. 
In 2013 we were delighted to launch our 
in-house trainee lawyer programme, initially 
for employees wishing to further their 
career within property law, and have further 
expanded to create our training academy 
for both internal and external candidates. 
To date a total of 20 new trainee lawyers 
have been employed with further plans to 
recruit and run additional training cohorts 
in both our Manchester, Cardiff and 
recently acquired Bridgend centres.
In terms of our legal panel, we have expanded 
to 20 firms over the course of 2013, all of 
whom are aligned with our own passionate 
views on providing the best service to 
our customers.

Hampton
Lambert Smith Hampton has made a successful 
start as a member of the Countrywide Group 
with financial performance ahead of plan
The Lambert Smith Hampton group 
(LSH) joined the Countrywide Group on 
1 October 2013. LSH is one of the largest 
commercial property consultancies in the 
UK and Ireland with 26 offices and over 
800 employees. Working with investors, 
developers and occupiers in both the 
public and private sector, we advise 
on all aspects of commercial property 
transactions and management.
Market commentary
Activity in the commercial property 
market is improving, with the investment 
market leading the way. Total UK investment 
volumes increased by 50% in 2013 in 
comparison with 2012 and the annual total 
of £45 billion was the highest the market 
has seen since 2007. In the occupier 
markets, the improvement in the regions 
has been less dramatic but take-up is 
strengthening. The industrial market has 
also shown an improvement with occupier 
take-up increasing by 24%. We expect 
current trends in both the regional office 
and industrial markets to continue in to 
2014, both of which are areas of particular 
strength for LSH.
Growth plans
Countrywide plans to invest further 
in LSH to grow the business in our core 
markets. We are committed to becoming 
a key player in the commercial property 
market and to grow our market share. 
The market is still fragmented and, even as 
a scale commercial business, we currently 
have less than a 3% market share, providing 
an opportunity for further market penetration. 
The stronger links between the residential 
and commercial activities will also strengthen 
our businesses going forward. As the 
economy continues to recover, we are seeing 
increased development activity across 
the UK. Combining the resources and 
skills of the strongest regional commercial 
property advisor with the UK’s largest 
integrated property services business will 
provide clients with market-leading advice 
at every stage of the development lifecycle.
Financial performance
LSH’s total income for the final quarter of 
2013, as part of the Countrywide Group, was 
£16.6 million and EBITDA was £2.3 million. 
Both these amounts were in excess of the 
forecasts for the quarter made at the time of 
the acquisition.

Lambert Smith Hampton is one of

Ireland and lets, sells or acquires 
around 20 million sq ft of industrial 
and distribution space every year.
Our highly-respected annual Industrial 
and Logistics Market Report provides a 
detailed analysis of all of the main issues 
affecting the industrial market across the 
UK. The report contains a comprehensive 
statistical review of the sector’s recent 
performance and identifies key trends 
for the year ahead.
The 2014 Report reveals that the 
industrial and logistics market staged 
a strong recovery in 2013, with take-up 
of space increasing by 24% from its 
2012 low, and prime and secondary 
rents growing in most locations. 
We also note that the lack of new build, 
which stretches back to 2007, has left 
the market starved of high quality premises 
and is likely to lead to the return of 
speculative development.

Group financial review
2013 saw a strong financial 
performance across the Group 
with income up 11% to £584.8 
million and EBITDA increased by 
37% to £86.6 million. This resulted 
in an improvement in the Group 
EBITDA margin from 12% in 2012 
to 15% in 2013.
All of our divisions reported improvements 
in both profitability and EBITDA margin helped 
by the improving levels of UK residential 
property transactions. As anticipated, our 
central costs increased by £3.5 million due to: 
additional costs relating to the IT transformation 
(£1.0 million), plc related costs including the 
non-executive directors (£0.5 million), together 
with £1.0 million of other costs relating to 
restructuring charges and acquisition costs. 
The balance of the increase is primarily 
employee costs.
Depreciation and amortisation
Flowing through from EBITDA, our depreciation 
and amortisation charge has been split to 
indicate the depreciation and amortisation 
that relates to assets purchased for use in 
the business and amortisation arising on 
those intangible assets that have been 
recognised as a result of business 
combinations. The underlying depreciation 
and amortisation charge increased by 
£2.4 million, the principal drivers of which were 
increases of £1.3 million and £0.7 million for 
computer software and hardware respectively 
as a result of the strategic investment to replace 
our infrastructure through the seven year 
partnership with CGI announced last year. 
Amortisation of intangible assets recognised 
through business combinations has increased 
by £0.4 million as a result of the incremental 
rate of growth in acquisitions during the year. 
Whilst we expected amortisation charges to 
increase due to our acquisition strategy, it 
should be noted that £6.6 million of the annual 
charge relates to intangible assets recognised 
in 2007 and this will end in 2017.
Share-based payments
Now that the Group is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange we have granted share options 
to selected employees and also launched 
the first Share Incentive Plan (SIP) aimed 
at all employees with 18 months service.
Immediately following the capital 
reorganisation in March 2013, we granted 
7.2 million options to employees who 
were former equity holders of Countrywide 
Holdings, Ltd under the IPO Plan. These 
are nil cost options which will vest based 
on adjusted Group EBITDA for 2014. 80% 
of these options will vest in March 2015 
and the balance in March 2016. The charge 
to the income statement in 2013 was 
£6.9 million and related employers’ 
national insurance £1.7 million.
Additionally, we launched a three year Long 
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) to senior managers 
in September 2013. These are nil cost options 
which will vest subject to certain performance 
criteria. The charge for the four months was 
£407,000 plus employers’ national insurance 
of £66,000. Due to the SIP only being in place 
for three months of the year, and with a three 
year vesting period, the charge was nominal. 
This charge will build over time to around 
£0.8 million in 2016. 
Exceptional items
We have reported a net exceptional cost of 
£7.6 million, which comprises non-recurring 
costs of £4.7 million in respect of the IPO, 
£4.5 million of finance costs relating to the 
redemption of our bonds and £0.9 million 
of acquisition costs offset by £2.5 million of 
deferred income in respect of our contract 
with Zoopla. This exceptional income will 
continue to recur for the next two years.
We are optimising 
financial opportunities 
in a recovering market.
With underlying financial momentum 
across all divisions, there has been 
strong conversion of incremental 
revenue to profit STRATEGIC REPORT

Throughout the year we have closely monitored 
the progress of our professional indemnity 
claims and can confirm that trends of claims 
received and losses incurred are in line with 
our expectations. As anticipated, we have 
experienced a significant drop in the number 
of new claims reported as time limitations apply 
and consequently no exceptional costs have 
been reported in respect of claims and litigation 
in the current year. Whilst development of 
claims may be unpredictable, and therefore 
timescales for settlement may vary, we would 
hope to clear a significant proportion of 
claims and progress to cash settlement 
within the next two years.
Finance charges
With the proceeds from the IPO and 
£75 million drawn from our finance facilities, 
we repaid the £250 million 10% fixed interest 
debt. Consequently our finance costs have 
reduced by £9.7 million, despite the £4.5 million 
exceptional costs referred to above. While 
finance costs amounted to £18.8 million, 
£15.3 million will not recur as we are paying 
a substantially lower margin.
Finance income earned reflects an average rate 
of 1.2% earned on our free cash balances over 
the year. Rates eased towards the end of 2013 
and we are anticipating lower returns in 2014.
Taxation 
Our total tax charge for 2013 of £3.8 million 
represents an effective tax rate of 10%. 
The reduction in the corporation tax rate 
to 21% has resulted in a deferred tax credit 
of £2.2 million and additionally we have 
recognised a £1.9 million credit as historic 
claims have been settled with HM Revenue 
& Customs (HMRC). The underlying tax rate 
for our business was 20.7%, lower than the 
corporation tax rate owing to the tax free 
nature of the exceptional deferred income 
credit relating to the Zoopla contract. The 
underlying tax rate going forwards will reduce 
in line with the decreasing corporation tax 
rate which will also reduce our net deferred 
tax liabilities by £1.5 million.

predominantly in the UK. All businesses are 
UK tax registered apart from small operations 
in Hong Kong, Italy and Ireland. We act to 
ensure that we have a transparent and 
constructive relationship with HMRC 
and enjoy a low risk rating. 
We conduct our tax compliance with a 
generally risk averse approach to all tax 
obligations whilst endeavouring to maintain 
shareholder value. Tax planning is done with 
full disclosure to HMRC when necessary and 
being mindful of reputational risk to the 
Group. Transactions will not be undertaken 
unless they have a business purpose or 
commercial rationale.
While our contribution from corporation 
tax was still low, largely due to the high 
interest charge on the bonds, our businesses 
generate considerable tax revenue for the 
Government in the UK. For the year ended 
31 December 2013, we will pay corporation 
tax of £7.5 million on profits for the year, we 
collected employment taxes of £113 million 
and VAT of £75 million, of which the Group 
has incurred £30.0 million and £1.6 million 
respectively. Additionally, we have paid 
£10 million in business rates and collected 
£34 million stamp duty land tax through 
our Conveyancing division.  STRATEGIC REPORT

Net assets
At 31 December 2013, our net assets per share 
were 237.5 pence, a total of £521.2 million 
(2012: £242.3 million) an increase of 
£278.9 million (or 115%) driven by funds 
generated from the IPO (£220 million), 
net profit for the year (£34.3 million) and 
an increase in fair value of our investment 
in Zoopla (£27.5 million).
We hold 6.0% of the share capital of Zoopla 
Property Group Ltd which we report as an 
available-for-sale financial asset. The fair value 
of our holding was reviewed at the year end 
using a number of valuation techniques 
resulting in a £27.5 million unrealised gain 
recognised through the statement of 
comprehensive income. Following the 
announcement by Daily Mail and General 
Trust that they are reviewing their strategic 
options for Zoopla, we will continue to 
monitor the progress of developments. 
Capital expenditure
Throughout the prolonged market downturn, 
we carefully managed our level of capital 
expenditure to protect our overall cash position. 
As planned, during 2013 we commenced a 
programme of branch refurbishments using our 
centralised refit teams. This programme will 
carry on throughout 2014. We have invested 
£1.6 million in new software for our Surveying 
operations and a further £1 million in updating 
our Conveyancing systems, a project that is 
still ongoing.
The most significant increase in capital 
expenditure relates to our IT transformation 
project with CGI. Our seven year contract with 
CGI included transformation services, new data 
centres, software, telephony and refreshing the 
hardware across most of the Group. We have 
capitalised appropriate amounts and accounted 
for these as a finance lease. Consequently we 
have recognised significantly higher capital 
expenditure, the cost of which will be spread 
over the contract.

repayable in four annual instalments from 
March 2014; £5 million, £10 million, £15 million 
and £45 million. Additionally we have a 
£25 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) 
available until March 2017. In February 2014, 
we increased our term loan facility to £100 
million and the RCF to £50 million and at the 
same time negotiated a reduced margin and 
repayment schedule so that the loan amortises 
over three annual instalments from March 
2015: £20 million, £30 million and £55 million.

the year (2012: £31.1 million) representing 
18.8 pence per share (2012: 14.2 pence 
based on number of shares currently in issue). 
Both years have been impacted by payments 
to settle PI claims. Payments in 2013 were 
in line with expectation at £18.1 million 
compared to £14.0 million net of settlements 
received in 2012. Additionally in 2013 we paid 
£5.2 million in respect of long term bonuses 
that crystallised early due to the IPO.
Financing structure and strategy
A key focus for expansion within the Group 
remains the growth of the Lettings division 
to continue to further develop recurring 
income streams. To this end, we have 
completed the acquisition of 28 Lettings 
businesses during the year (2012: 13) 
for a total consideration of £18.2 million 
(2012: £13.1 million) and we have a healthy 
pipeline of additional opportunities identified 
for the forthcoming year. Since the year 
end, we have completed the acquisition 
of Tucker Gardner Residential (Cambridge) 
and Preston Bennett (North London), which 
both provide strategic opportunities for 
synergies with our existing businesses, 
as well as four smaller acquisitions.

Risk and risk 
management
Risk and impact
We carry out continuous high level reviews of 
the market and diversity of our products and 
services as part of our distribution strategy. 
For example, we continue to strengthen the 
Lettings division which, by its nature, is 
more stable and counter-cyclical to the 
housing market.
The UK housing market is highly cyclical and historically has 
been central to the strength of the UK economy. Changes in 
volumes and price are immediately realised in the results of the 
business, within both the Estate Agency division and also sales of 
complementary services throughout other areas of the Group.
Increases in interest rates typically have a negative impact on 
the UK residential property market. 
The parts of our business that do not relate to the prestige 
property market are particularly exposed to the level of 
mortgage approvals. The number of mortgage approvals can be 
affected by: macro-economic factors; new regulatory 
requirements; and changes in lenders’ approval policies.
There are a number of important commercial relationships 
which affect more than one area of the business. The loss of 
key customers or contracts, or significant reduction in volumes 
combined with pressure on fees, would have a significant 
impact on our profitability. The failure of a significant supplier 
could impair our ability to operate effectively.
Dependence on efficient systems for operational performance 
and financial information would be impacted by significant 
failures or interruptions to IT services. Data security is also 
essential to the secure processing, storage and transmission 
of routine personal, confidential and proprietary information.
The market continued to 
improve in 2013 and our 
programme of strategic 
acquisition includes 
further residential lettings 
businesses and the 
acquisition of Lambert 
Smith Hampton.
Reduction in risk following 
market recovery, assisted 
by Government measures 
designed to increase 
confidence such as the 
‘Help to Buy’ scheme.
Contracts with a number 
of major clients were 
renewed in 2013 and 
we enjoy a maturing 
relationship with our 
key suppliers.
The transition of our 
IT infrastructure via 
outsourcing to CGI has 
continued at pace and in 
accordance with plan in 
2014. The Information 
Security Steering 
Committee has met 
regularly in 2013 in order 
to co-ordinate Information 
Security best practice and 
to ensure continuing 
ISO 27001 accreditation 
within our B2B businesses.
We review trends in market volumes and 
determine whether actions such as cost 
base reduction measures are required.
We centralised the team responsible for liaising 
with key customers and developing new 
contracts. The operating divisions carry out 
regular reviews with key customers. We carry 
out regular reviews with key suppliers and 
operate appropriate contingency measures 
in the event of supplier collapse.
There has been significant investment to 
support operational expansion and to 
develop and maintain operational systems 
and infrastructure.
Mitigation Commentary Change
Risk and risk management
The Group is exposed to a number 
of risks and uncertainties which could 
have a material impact on its long term 
development and performance and 
management of these risks is an integral 
part of the management of the Group. 
The table below sets out the principal 
risks faced by the Group and examples of 
relevant key controls and mitigating factors. 
The Board considers these to be the most 
significant risks faced by the Group. They 
do not comprise all the risks associated 
with the Group and they are not set out 
in any order of priority. 
The successful management of risk is 
essential to enable us to deliver on its 
strategic priorities. Whilst the ultimate 
responsibility for risk management rests 
with the Board, the foundation of effective 
day-to-day management of risk is in the way 
we do business and the culture of our team. 
Our flat organisational structure ensures 
close involvement of senior management 
in all significant decisions.

Risk and impact
The previous downturn in the UK housing market and impact 
of sub-prime lending exposed the Group to a higher level of 
professional insurance claims within the Surveying division.
The Group is operationally geared and cash generation 
broadly follows the profitability of the business.
Failure to comply with legislation and regulatory requirements 
could result in reputational and financial damage, including 
withdrawal of authorisation or licences for the conduct of 
business streams. Changes to financial services regulations 
are also ongoing in response to the recent financial crisis.
Part of our success depends on the services provided 
by, and experience of, management, executive officers and 
key employees. There is also substantial competition for 
qualified employees in an industry characterised by high 
levels of employee turnover.
Reduction in risk as tail of 
claims from peak trading 
concludes and improved 
claims experience in 
latter periods.
Reduced liquidity risk as 
gearing down following 
IPO. Finance restructuring 
during the year has 
reduced debt and provided 
increased flexibility in 
funding arrangements.
Credit risk still requires 
active management due 
to a limited number of 
counterparties for corporate 
and client funds
The final impact of the new 
FCA regime and Mortgage 
Market Review is being 
assimilated within the 
business in accordance 
with plan.
Reduced risk as greater 
opportunities and 
remuneration flexibility 
or incentivisation within 
the plc environment are 
offset in part by increased 
opportunities elsewhere. 
The ‘My Countrywide’ 
survey was communicated 
in 2013 with a 70% 
response rate.
Monitoring arrangements include operational 
controls implemented for review of surveyor 
outputs and targeted use of Automated Valuation 
Models in perceived higher risk cases, as well as 
maintenance of risk management arrangements. 
In respect of legacy issues, we continue to review 
the judgements and estimates underpinning the 
existing professional indemnity provision.
Cash balances are managed through a central 
treasury arrangement and cash outflows can be 
predicted with reasonable accuracy. Credit risk 
within the treasury function is also mitigated by 
maintaining a list of accepted deposit 
institutions whose credit ratings are kept under 
review. In addition, our debt profile has been 
restructured during the year, significantly 
reducing interest payments and reducing risk 
of operational liquidity issues. 
Expertise within the operational divisions is also 
supported by centralised legal and compliance 
teams who closely monitor existing business 
practices and any reform proposals. Employees 
receive appropriate training. Managers attend 
industry forums and Government consultations. 
Robust complaints management systems are in 
place across all operating divisions.
Remuneration policies are regularly reviewed to 
ensure employees are appropriately incentivised. 
Succession planning and development of key 
employees are also considered by the Board. 
Management will review trends, including the 
views of leavers in exit interviews, and the views 
of employees are expressed in our first employee 
engagement survey.

A full corporate social responsibility policy 
statement is included on our website, but 
key areas are summarised below:
Striving to be a good 
corporate citizen
Corporate responsibility
We recognise the 
importance of good 
communication with  
our employees
The Group strives to be a good 
corporate citizen. Through its 
managers and its people, 
Countrywide is committed to 
promoting protection of the 
environment; supporting charities 
and local communities; promoting 
equal opportunities; ensuring safe 
and efficient working practices; 
and working with suppliers who 
uphold similar values. 
We recognise that our employees 
are our greatest asset and key to 
continued growth and success 
and, as such, we are committed 
to providing careers and working 
environments in which our people 
can achieve to their fullest potential.
Development and training
Developing future talent is fundamental 
to Countrywide. Talent management and 
leadership development programmes are 
operating for promising senior management 
within the business, whilst we continue to 
recruit and invest in trainee and graduate 
talent to help meet our future management 
requirements. New apprenticeship and 
graduate recruitment schemes have been 
implemented in several divisions of the Group, 
alongside City & Guilds accredited training 
for employees within our retail operations, 
including the opportunity of sponsorship to 
achieve recognised professional qualifications 
that are relevant to our sector. We provide full 
visibility of our customer facing employees, 
including their levels of training and experience 
to our customers and prospective customers 
through our online Register of Property 
Agents (www.agencypro.co.uk). The Register 
provides assurance that our estate agency 
employees all meet the requisite standards of 
professionalism that our customers will expect 
when we advise them and represent their 
interests during one of the most significant 
transactions that they are likely to undertake 
in their lifetime. 
Communication
We recognise the importance of regular 
communication with our employees. 
To support this we have a Group-wide 
newsletter, ‘Inside Countrywide’, as well 
as specific publications to keep our 
employees up-to-date and informed. 
The newsletter focuses on communicating 
operational changes, examples of best 
practice and highlights specific sales 
activities, success stories and 
teamwork around the business. 
Employees can access our intranet to obtain 
other general information on the Group. 
Our first Group-wide employee engagement 
survey was conducted in September 2013 
and feedback will be rolled into a continuous 
improvement programme. Employees are also 
encouraged to discuss operational issues 
with their line management and to suggest 
ways to improve performance and efficiency. 
Our employees are also encouraged 
to become shareholders in the Company. 
We introduced a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
in October 2013 for all employees with 
more than 18 months’ continuous service. 
The Company gives one matching share for 
every two shares purchased by the employee 
(within the maximum investment terms 
established by HMRC). The scheme was 
adopted by 1,785 employees (27% of eligible 
employees) and will result in over £1.8 million 
of additional investment in the first year.
Equal opportunities
We are committed to a policy of equal 
opportunity and diversity in employment 
and recognise that this is essential to ensuring 
the success and growth of the organisation. 
To this end, we make every effort to select, 
recruit, train and promote the best candidates 
based on suitability for the job; to treat all 
employees and applicants fairly, regardless 
of race, gender, marital status, age, nationality, 
ethnic origin, religious belief, sexual orientation 
or disability; and to ensure that no employee 
suffers harassment or intimidation. 
Employment opportunities are available to 
disabled persons in accordance with their 
abilities and aptitudes on equal terms with 
other employees. If an employee becomes 
disabled during employment, we make every 
effort to enable them to continue employment 
by making reasonable adjustments in the 
workplace and retraining for alternative 
work where necessary.

Group raised £145,000 
for charitable causes 
during 2013
The health and safety, welfare 
and wellbeing of employees is of 
paramount importance to us. It is 
our policy to create and improve 
standards of Health and Safety, 
which will lead to the avoidance and 
reduction of risks and to ensure that 
the Company complies with all Health 
and Safety legislation. A detailed 
Health and Safety Policy Statement 
is held at all branch premises and 
displayed on the notice boards.
Health and Safety and fire officers implement 
our policies, standards and procedures in 
all branches in which we operate. They are 
supported by dedicated, professionally 
qualified Health and Safety managers. A Group 
Health and Safety steering committee meets 
on a six-monthly basis to review activity and 
policy in this area. The Health and Safety 
officers report annually to their local operating 
Boards and to the Group Health and Safety 
Officer on issues relating to the health, safety 
and welfare of the employees. These reports 
are reviewed by the Group Board and suitable 
enhancements or improvements are made. 
We make every reasonable and practicable 
effort to provide safe and healthy working 
conditions in all our offices. It is the duty of 
all employees to exercise responsibility and 
to do everything they can to prevent injury 
to themselves and others. The policy standards 
and procedures are communicated to 
employees through contracts of employment, 
employee hand books, operating manuals, 
bulletins and notice boards and employee 
training as appropriate.
We are committed to ensuring the 
integrity and security of business 
information with particular attention 
given to personal and sensitive 
data where inappropriate use 
or inadequate maintenance and 
safeguarding could have serious 
repercussions. 
Our policies and procedures are based 
on requirements for a secure operating 
environment, an assessment of the risks 
that the Group faces and relevant legal 
and best practice requirements. We have 
achieved, and maintain, the ISO 27001 
accreditation in our major business to 
business operating divisions and aspire 
to operate in line with the International 
Standard for Information Security Management, 
ISO 27001, in all of our major retail operations. 
Responsibility for information security sits 
with the local management teams with 
appropriate training and support provided. 
A dedicated Group information security 
manager is responsible for the strategic 
management of information security, 
including risk management, together 
with implementation and enforcement 
of the Information Security Policy.

Countrywide supports a Workplace 
Charitable Giving scheme, so that 
employees can donate to their 
favourite charities tax efficiently 
through payroll deduction, donating 
over £19,700 during 2013. Countrywide 
also supports two national charities: 
Shelter (helping the homeless) and 
Cancer Research UK. 
The subsidiary businesses are also 
encouraged to support causes within 
their local communities and employees 
from across the country participated in 
a number of local initiatives. 
During 2013, some of our more significant 
achievements, amongst the wide variety 
of initiatives across the operating divisions, 
have been: 
Y 
Within our London & Premier division, 
Hamptons raised £80,000 for Cancer 
Research; John D Wood raised over 
£13,000 for Cancer Research, The Royal 
British Legion, Parkhaven Hospice and 
Oakhaven Hospice; and Faron Sutaria 
raised over £3,600 for Cancer Research 
and St Christopher’s Hospice

Corporate responsibility continued
While the Group is accountable  
to investors, we take into account  
the interest of all our stakeholders 
including our employees, our 
customers and our suppliers, as  
well as the local community and the 
environment in which we operate. 
Countrywide’s reputation is one of its 
key assets and, as a major player in the 
UK property services sector, adhering to 
the highest standards of integrity, personal 
conduct, ethics and fairness is deemed 
to be of vital importance.
We have judged that human rights are not a 
material risk for the business due to existing 
regulatory requirements in the UK and the 
nature of our supply chain. However, we will 
consider how Countrywide can contribute 
to the advancement of human rights in 2014.

Environmental savings make good 
business sense. Our primary objective 
is to minimise our carbon footprint and 
any negative impact we may have on 
the environment. 
We are committed to the following: 
 
Y 
To meet or exceed the requirements  
of relevant legislative, regulatory and 
environmental codes of practice 
Y 
To identify, reduce and dispose of waste 
arising from our operations in a manner 
that minimises harm to the environment 
and prevents pollution of land, air 
and water 
Y 
To reduce the consumption of energy and 
water and use renewable and/or recyclable 
resources wherever practicable 
Y 
To encourage our suppliers and 
subcontractors to implement good 
environmental practices and procedures 
which support our own objectives 
and targets 
Y 
 To take responsibility for the maintenance 
and revision of our environmental policy, 
which is reviewed on a regular basis, 
in order to set environmental objectives 
and targets for continuous improvement, 
as we recognise the need for 
sustainable development
The following initiatives are in place: 
Y 
 We use printing paper which is chlorine 
free and carries the FSC kitemark and 
which is compliant with ISO 9001:2008, 
ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 80001:2007 
certified. We aim to achieve an 85% rate 
of paper recycling across the Group 
by 2015

Epayslips were introduced for all 
Group employees in 2010, which 
reduced our carbon footprint and 
print and postal costs
Y 
 With effect from July 2011, we opted to 
ensure that all newly ordered company 
vehicles had a CO
2 
emission of no 
greater than 160gsm. This was further 
reduced to a cap of 130gsm on the 
introduction of a new fleet policy in 
January 2013
Y 
 In 2011, we launched a Cycle to Work 
scheme, in order that employees can 
tax efficiently purchase bicycles for 
cycling to work
Y 
 During 2013 we introduced a half-hourly 
meter pilot to monitor and reduce 
electricity usage and also commenced 
a voltage optimisation pilot to reduce 
energy consumption
In accordance with DEFRA regulations 
on the reporting of GHG emissions, 
we set out below our total tonnes 
of CO

e produced in the year. 
We have used the main requirements of the 
GHG Protocol and ISO 14064-1 (2006), energy 
consumption data and emission factors from 
the UK Government’s Conversion Factors 
for UK reporting. We have reported on all 
of the emission sources required under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. 
We have used the operational control 
consolidation method. These sources fall 
within our consolidated financial statements, 
but exclude non-wholly owned subsidiaries 
and joint ventures. We have not reported 
emissions arising from the acquisitions 
undertaken during the year for our period 
of ownership, but will be working to ensure 
that there will be processes in place for data 
collection in respect of those activities for 
the forthcoming year.

Dear shareholder
At Countrywide, we are committed to the 
delivery of high standards of corporate 
governance in support of the effective 
management of the business and the delivery 
of long term shareholder value. The corporate 
governance report that follows is intended to 
give shareholders a clear understanding 
of the Group’s corporate governance 
arrangements and how they operated during 
the year, including analysis of the level of 
compliance with the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’).
I joined the Board of Countrywide on 
2 September 2013, taking over from 
Neville Richardson as senior independent 
non‑executive director and Chairman of the 
Audit and Risk Committee. On 7 November 
2013, Robert Davies decided to step down as 
Chairman for personal reasons and I agreed 
to become interim Chairman with immediate 
effect. Despite these unplanned changes in 
the Board composition, we have continued 
to make solid progress as we enhance the 
governance structure previously embedded 
within the Group.
As part of the improvements to align 
our risk and internal audit capabilities, 
the Group undertook an exercise to review 
its risk appetite and refresh the risk registers. 
We conducted a bottom‑ up risk analysis 
in each of the divisions which will be used to 
shape the internal audit activities during 2014, 
providing a combined assurance plan and a 
more co‑ ordinated approach to the Group’s 
risk management and audit activities.
In addition, we have implemented in full 
the changes to the Code introduced this 
year by developing procedures to internally 
review and externally report on each of these 
areas. Our summary of significant accounting 
matters and how we have addressed them 
is detailed within the following report and 
formed part of our ongoing interaction with 
both management and the external auditor, 
considering related matters such as the 
additional financial reporting requirements 
arising during the year, to enable us to 
conclude on whether the financial statements 
are fair, balanced and understandable. 
We also developed and implemented a 
framework to review the effectiveness of 
the external auditor and note our proposal 
for their reappointment at the AGM.
As this is the first full period of reporting 
following the IPO, we report instances of 
non‑ compliance with the Code where we 
did not comply with specific provisions 
throughout the period under review. During 
this period of transition from private to public 
ownership, and the development of the Board 
and its Committees, these are not unexpected 
conclusions and we have plans in place to 
address them, details of which are provided 
with the explanations for non‑ compliance 
in the following report. 
As noted within my Chairman’s statement 
on page 3, Grenville Turner has indicated 
his desire to step down as CEO during 
2014 and the search for a successor has 
commenced. Given his extensive experience, 
the Board has asked Grenville to become 
non‑ executive Chairman and he has agreed 
to accept the appointment once a new CEO 
is in post. I will then become deputy chairman 
and senior independent director. We plan to 
progress the appointment of two new 
independent non‑ executive directors to return 
the composition of the Board to a majority of 
independent non‑ executive directors and 
compliance with the Code.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
Corporate governance statement
Board
Leadership
The Board provides leadership to the 
Group. It sets the strategy and oversees its 
implementation, ensuring that acceptable 
risks are taken. It ensures that the right 
people and resources are in place for 
the Group to meet its objectives, review 
management performance and deliver 
long term value to shareholders and 
other stakeholders.
The Board retains control of key decisions 
and has put in place a formal schedule of 
matters specifically reserved for its 
approval. The roles of Chairman and chief 
executive are separated, clearly defined 
and approved by the Board. A copy of 
matters reserved for Board approval and 
the division of responsibilities between the 
roles of the Chairman and the chief 
executive is available to view on the 
corporate governance section of the 
Company’s website. These documents 
are also accompanied by the terms of 
reference for each of the three Board 
committees listed below. 
The Board delegates matters to the three 
Board committees, identified below, 
in line with their terms of reference and the 
formal schedule of matters reserved for 
Board approval. Further information on the 
work of these committees during the year 
can be found in later sections of this report: 
Nomination Committee within Board 
effectiveness; Audit and Risk Committee 
within Accountability; and Remuneration 
Committee within the separate 
remuneration report.
The directors’ attendance at the scheduled 
Board meetings and Board committee 
meetings is shown in the table below. 
Attendance is expressed as the number 
of meetings that each director attended out 
of the number they were eligible to attend.
Prior to the IPO in March 2013, the 
Company was not required to follow 
the Code although it did take account 
of a number of its principles, including 
the provision of an internal audit function. 
Following listing the Board has sought 
to move towards full compliance with 
the Code. The directors have considered 
the contents and requirements of the 
Code and note the following instances 
of non-compliance: 
 Y
Until the appointment of Cathy Turner 
as a non‑ executive director on 
31 July 2013, the Audit Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee did 
not consist of at least three independent 
non‑ executive directors (provisions 
C.3.1 and D.2.1 of the Code). However, 
following this appointment the 
Company has complied with those 
provisions for the remainder of the 
financial year
 Y
Similarly, until the appointment 
of Cathy Turner, the Board did not 
consist of a majority of independent 
non‑ executive directors (excluding the 
Chairman) in accordance with provision 
B.1.2 of the Code. However, whilst 
compliance with this provision was 
therefore achieved on 31 July 2013, 
the resignation of Robert Davies on 
7 November 2013 means that the 
Company will not be compliant with 
this requirement until a new independent 
director is appointed
 Y
Annual evaluation of the performance 
of the Chairman and the Board, its 
Committees and individual directors 
(provisions A.4.2 and B.6.1 respectively) 
has not been conducted during the 
period as a year has not elapsed since 
the formation of the Board. Performance 
evaluations will be conducted during 
the forthcoming year
This statement describes how the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council in September 2012 have been applied to the affairs of 
the Company. The Code can be viewed at www.frc.org.uk.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
Nomination Committee
 
Board effectiveness
Following its formation during the year, the 
Nomination Committee was responsible for 
evaluation of the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge on the Board. 
Initial appointments made prior to the 
formation of the Committee were made by 
the Company using an independent search 
and selection agency, Egon Zehnder (whose 
services were also used by the Nomination 
Committee for the two subsequent 
appointments detailed below).
Formal annual evaluation of the performance 
of the Board, its Committees, the directors 
and the Chairman has not been conducted 
in the year under review as the Board and 
Nomination Committee were only formed 
during the year. Further details of this process 
will be provided in our 2014 annual report.
The Nomination Committee has met twice 
during the period to consider the 
appointments of Cathy Turner and 
David Watson, the non‑ executive directors 
appointed after completion of the IPO process 
and the establishment of the Nomination 
Committee. The Nomination Committee has 
appointed an independent search agency, 
Lygon Group, to assist in the identification of 
suitable candidates to join the Board 
and achieve full Code compliance. In light of 
Grenville Turner’s decision to step down as 
CEO and take on the role of non‑ executive 
Chairman, the Board are addressing the skills 
and experience sought in his successor. 
Grenville will be involved in the process and 
continue to serve as Group CEO until an 
appropriate candidate is in place.
The Company believes that diversity 
of experience and approach, including 
gender diversity, amongst Board members 
is of great importance and it is the Company’s 
policy to give careful consideration to issues 
of Board balance and diversity when making 
new appointments. The search for candidates 
and any subsequent appointments are, 
therefore, made purely on merit regardless 
of gender, race, religion, age or disability. 
Given our commitment to appointing the 
best people and ensuring that all employees 
have an equal chance of developing their 
careers within the Group, we do not think 
it is appropriate to set targets for Board 
appointments. In addition to Board diversity, 
we believe in promoting diversity at all levels 
of the organisation and further details of our 
workforce diversity are set out on page 32.
Following appointment to the Board, 
all directors are offered an induction 
and subsequent training to suit their needs. 
All directors also have access to the advice 
and services of the company secretary 
in addition to access to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense where they judge it necessary 
to discharge their duties as directors.
Although this is the initial period 
following appointment and therefore no 
formal performance evaluation has been 
conducted, the Nomination Committee is 
pleased with the time commitment of each 
non‑ executive director during their initial 
period of appointment and is confident 
that each of them would be in a position 
to discharge their duties to the Company 
in the coming year. Accordingly, as detailed 
in the notice of the AGM, all directors will 
stand for re‑ election.
Audit and Risk Committee
Accountability
The Audit and Risk Committee’s key role is to 
assist the Board in fulfilling its financial oversight 
responsibilities in ensuring the integrity of 
the Group’ s financial statements and the 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control processes. Accordingly, 
meetings were held at key times within the 
reporting and audit calendar and were also 
attended by the chief financial officer, the 
company secretary and the Company’s 
external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
In addition, the Chairman, internal audit 
and risk management representatives 
were invited to attend. 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. This has been designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of any failure to achieve its strategic objectives. 
It can provide reasonable, rather than absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. The Board’ s approach to risk management 
is supported by an oversight structure, as 
detailed on page 31, which includes the 
Audit Committee.
The Board has an ongoing process to identify, 
evaluate and manage the significant risks faced 
by the Group. This was in place throughout 
the year and up to the date of the approval 
of the annual report. This process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and accords with the 
Turnbull guidance. In addition, the Audit and 
Risk Committee and the Board reviewed the 
effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control systems, including the 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls. This was primarily achieved by: 
 Y
Reviewing the workstream undertaken 
by the Group Risk and Compliance 
Committee to update the Group’s risk 
register through liaison with each of 
the divisions, update the control risk 
assessments and the resultant residual 
risk map to ensure that this aligned 
with the Board’s risk appetite
 Y
Reviewing reports from the internal audit 
team, who report to the chief financial 
officer but have direct access to the 
chief executive and Chairman of the 
Audit Committee, including any issues 
identified in the course of their work 
(a programme approved by the Committee 
and updated on a rolling basis) so that 
appropriate actions can be undertaken
 Y
Reviewing annually the Group’s system 
of internal control. This includes a 
summary of key risks and associated 
controls and a report from the internal 
audit team on their work
 Y
Monitoring the risks and associated 
controls over the financial reporting 
processes, including the process by 
which the Group’s financial statements 
are prepared for publication
 Y
Reviewing reports from the external 
auditor on any issues identified during 
the course of their work, including 
a report on control weaknesses

COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
Corporate governance statement continued
In addition to the significant matters opposite 
which include an element of judgement, 
we also considered the presentation of the 
financial statements and, in particular, the 
compliance with financial reporting and 
disclosure requirements associated with 
premium listing. In respect of each of these 
matters, the Audit Committee reviewed 
papers presented by management and 
discussed critical judgements and estimates 
inherent within the conclusions, providing 
challenge where necessary. The Audit 
Committee also reviewed the reporting 
from the external auditor to ensure all that 
these matters had been considered and 
consistent conclusions had been reached.
At the request of the Board, the Audit 
and Risk Committee considered whether 
the 2013 annual report was fair, balanced 
and understandable and whether it provided 
the necessary information for the shareholders 
to assess Countrywide’ s performance, business 
model and strategy. The Committee was 
satisfied that, taken as a whole, the annual 
report is fair, balanced and understandable 
and has affirmed that view to the full Board.
The Audit Committee has policies in place 
to monitor and maintain the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor, PwC. 
A copy of the policy is available for review 
on the corporate governance section of our 
website. The policy requires prior approval 
by the Audit Committee of non‑audit work 
above a de minimis threshold of £50,000.
Audit and Risk Committee continued
Accountability continued
No material failings or weaknesses were identified during the review of the risk management 
and internal control system. The Audit Committee has also reviewed whistle‑blowing arrangements 
allowing employees to raise concerns on a confidential basis and ensures that investigation 
of any whistle‑blowing incidents is undertaken.
The Audit Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted 
and whether management have made appropriate estimates and judgements. In the year 
under review, the Audit Committee considered the following significant matters in relation 
to the financial statements: 
Matter Action the Audit Committee has taken
Provisions: 
professional 
indemnity, property 
and other provisions
We reviewed the methodology and resultant professional 
indemnity provision prepared by management and regularly 
compared the emerging pattern of settled claims to assess 
whether the methodology and assumptions were appropriate. 
The Committee concluded that the methodology and 
assumptions made were reasonable. Property and other 
provisions were reviewed for consistency of approach 
and assumptions agreed as reasonable. For more detail in 
respect of provisioning policies adopted see note 3.
Impairment of 
goodwill and 
intangibles with 
an indefinite life
We reviewed discounted cash flows and sensitivities prepared 
by management, discussing assumptions adopted and 
concurred that a prudent approach underpinned their 
conclusion of no impairment being required. 
Valuation of 
available-for-sale  
assets
We discussed the paper presented by management which 
outlined three alternative methodologies (discounted cash 
flow, EBITDA multiples and latest transaction prices) for 
valuation of assets held as available‑ for‑ sale. The assumptions 
and rationale were reasonable and all converged on a closely 
similar outcome.
Acquisitions 
accounting
We reviewed a management paper summarising the 
acquisitions undertaken during the year. Our discussion 
focused on the accounting treatment adopted in respect 
of Lambert Smith Hampton, due to individual materiality 
of the transaction. We were satisfied with the fair value 
accounting approach and valuation proposed by management.
Share-based 
payments
We reviewed the methodology and conclusion presented by 
management in relation to the various share‑ based payment 
arrangements. The assumptions made were reviewed and 
agreed as reasonable. For more detail in respect of share‑ based 
incentives and valuation methodologies see note 26. 43
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
During the year the external auditor 
undertook the following non‑audit work:
Matter
Fee
£’000
IPO due diligence reports 850
IPO remuneration advice 150
IPO fees agreed prior to listing 1,000
Subsequent remuneration advice 54
Tax advisory services 48
Due diligence on acquisition 
targets 152
Non-audit fees post IPO 254
Work undertaken in relation to the IPO 
was performed by PwC due to its role as the 
incumbent auditor and reporting accountant. 
Subsequent remuneration advice provided 
in respect of the creation of the new LTIP 
and share scheme plan was performed by 
PwC due to its familiarity with the subject 
matter arising from previous consultations 
during the IPO process. PwC performed 
the due diligence in relation to acquisition 
targets due to the short notice period to 
appoint investigating accountants. In order 
to maintain its independence and objectivity, 
PwC undertook its standard independence 
procedures in relation to those engagements. 
Further details on amounts paid to PwC are 
included in note 7 to the financial statements. 
These were reported to and considered by 
the Audit Committee. Excluding the fees in 
relation to the IPO, non‑audit fees represent 
less than 50% of the recurring base audit 
fee and will remain subject to scrutiny 
and approval by the Audit Committee.
The external auditor reported to the Board and 
confirmed their independence in accordance 
with ethical standards and that they had 
maintained appropriate internal safeguards 
to ensure their independence and objectivity. 
In addition to the steps taken by the Board 
to safeguard auditor objectivity, PwC operates 
a five year rotation policy for audit partners 
for a listed entity.
We also adopted a formal framework to 
conduct our review of the effectiveness 
of the external audit process and audit 
quality and applied this to the completion 
of the 2013 Group audit cycle. The framework 
takes the form of an annual questionnaire 
covering all key aspects of the audit and is 
completed by each member of the Committee 
and by the CFO. Feedback is also sought 
from other members of the Group finance 
team, divisional management and the head 
of internal audit. Based on responses to 
the questionnaires, management produces 
a report for detailed consideration by the 
Audit Committee. The feedback from this 
process is considered by the Committee and 
is provided to the auditor and to management, 
with action plans developed accordingly 
and reviewed by the Committee.
PwC was appointed as auditor to the 
Company in 2007 and we note that the 
current partner’s term will end in 2015. 
We are aware of the regulatory developments 
and transitional arrangements in relation to 
audit tendering provisions and will continue 
to monitor guidance. However, we may put 
the audit out to tender at any time before a 
regulatory retendering date if we were to 
conclude that this is in the Group’s interest. 
There are no contractual obligations restricting 
our choice of external auditor and no auditor 
liability agreement has been entered into.
Take‑over Directive details on share capital 
structures are included in the directors’ 
report on page 57.
Remuneration Committee
Remuneration
The work of the Remuneration Committee 
is subject to a separate report following 
this corporate governance section.
The Committee appointed, and received advice 
on remuneration from New Bridge Street, a 
trading name of AON plc. New Bridge Street 
is not otherwise connected to the Group.
Relations with shareholders
Shareholder relations are given high priority by 
the Board. The prime means of communication 
with the majority of our shareholders is via the 
interim and annual reports, supplemented 
by interim management statements, which 
aim to provide shareholders with a clear 
understanding of the Group’s activities and 
results. General presentations are given to 
both shareholders and analysts following the 
publication of the interim and annual results.
Shareholders have the opportunity to 
address questions to the Chairman and 
the Chairmen of the Audit and Risk Committee 
and Remuneration Committee at the AGM. 
All shareholders are encouraged to attend the 
AGM. Shareholders wishing to lodge questions 
in advance of the AGM, or to contact the 
Board at any other time, are invited to do 
so by writing to the company secretary at 
the registered address given on page 115.

Directors’ remuneration report
Annual statement
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
our inaugural remuneration report for the year 
ended 31 December 2013. The report has been 
divided into two principal sections, namely: 
 Y
remuneration policy report, which sets out 
the Group’s forward‑looking policy on the 
remuneration of executive and non‑executive 
directors; and
 Y
annual report on remuneration, which 
discloses details of the Remuneration 
Committee, how the remuneration 
policy will operate for the year ending 
31 December 2014 and how the policy 
was implemented in the year ended 
31 December 2013.
The remuneration policy report will be 
subject to a binding vote and it is our 
intention to put this section of the report 
to a binding vote every three years unless 
there are changes to our policy requiring 
shareholder approval. The remuneration 
policy will commence from 1 January 2014 
albeit it will not become formally effective 
until the 2014 AGM assuming that shareholder 
approval is obtained. The annual report on 
remuneration will be subject to an advisory 
vote each year starting with the 2014 AGM.
2013 performance and reward
Countrywide has delivered sustainable returns 
and growth for our shareholders with:  
 Y
EBITDA up by 37% to £86.6 million;
 Y
adjusted earnings per share 
of 24.4 pence; and
 Y
total dividends (including proposed final 
dividend) of 8.0 pence (net) per share.
Remuneration is weighted towards variable pay, 
dependent on performance. This ensures that 
there is a clear link between the value created 
for shareholders and the amount paid to our 
executive directors. Performance is assessed 
against a range of financial and longer term 
returns ensuring value is delivered to 
shareholders and participants are rewarded 
for the delivery of the key strategic objectives 
of the Group, specifically growth and returns.
The key remuneration outcomes in respect 
of 2013 were: 
 Y
basic salaries and benefits remain 
unchanged for the chief executive officer 
(CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO) 
since the IPO; and
 Y
annual bonuses are based on Group 
EBITDA and 83% of the maximum was 
awarded to the CEO and CFO in respect 
of 2013. This reflects the strong financial 
and operational results the Group 
has achieved.
Remuneration policy for 2014
The directors’ remuneration policy is 
set out for shareholder approval in the 
remuneration policy report on pages 45 to 
49. Details on how the policy will be applied 
in practice for the 2014 financial year are set 
out in the annual report on remuneration on 
page 50, although no structural changes are 
proposed for 2014.
Shareholder engagement
We take an active interest in shareholder 
views on our executive remuneration policy 
and will be reviewing voting outcomes from 
our first AGM. We believe in ongoing dialogue 
with shareholders on remuneration and will 
engage regularly.
We are committed to developing effective and 
performance‑based remuneration policies that 
are well governed. We welcome any comments 
you may have.
Cathy Turner
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
27 February 2014
We are committed to 
developing effective 
and performance‑ based remuneration 
policies that are 
well governed.
Statement from the Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee 45
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
Introduction
In this section, we explain: 
 Y
our remuneration strategy and policy;
 Y
how this strategy is reinforced by 
alignment of key components of 
our remuneration packages;
 Y
why we have selected the performance 
criteria for variable pay; and 
 Y
other information required to provide 
the wider Group context for the directors’ 
service agreements.
Remuneration strategy
Our remuneration strategy is underpinned 
by remuneration packages that are designed 
to motivate high performing people to deliver 
our strategy. These packages: 
 Y
are transparent and aligned with 
the interest of our shareholders;
 Y
are weighted to incentivise performance 
over the short and long term;
 Y
are structured to ensure higher 
rewards are only achieved for 
exceptional performance against 
challenging targets; and
 Y
encourage management to adopt a 
level of risk commensurate with the 
risk profile of the business as 
approved by the Board.
Statement of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
The remuneration policy described within this 
report provides an overview of the structure 
that operates for the most senior executives 
in the Group. The remuneration policy 
for the executive directors is more heavily 
weighted towards variable pay than for other 
employees to make a greater part of their 
pay conditional on the successful delivery 
of the business strategy. This aims to create 
a clear link between the value created for 
shareholders and the remuneration received 
by the executive directors. When setting the 
policy for remuneration for the executive 
directors the Committee takes into account 
the overall approach to reward for employees 
in the Group, including consideration of salary 
increases for the general employee population; 
overall spend on annual bonus; Group‑wide 
benefit offerings; and any other relevant 
factors as determined by the Committee.
Employees have not been consulted in respect 
of the design of the Company’s executive 
remuneration policy to date, although the 
Committee will keep this under review.
Statement of consideration 
of shareholder views
The views of the Company’s major 
shareholders on the Company’s senior 
executive remuneration policy were taken 
into account prior to admission. Going forward, 
the Committee will consider the views of major 
shareholders and representative bodies in 
addition to market practice when making 
changes to the policy. In the event that 
material changes to the policy are proposed, 
the Company will consult with major 
shareholders and representative bodies 
in advance of changes being made.

COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
Notes to summary policy table
1  A description of how the Company intends to implement 
the opposite policy for 2014 is set out in the following 
annual report on remuneration.
2  The annual bonus performance measures are currently 
focused on Group EBITDA measures to reflect how 
successful the Group has been in managing its operations. 
3  The long term incentive performance measures, 
currently EPS and TSR targets, have been selected to 
reward significant long term returns to shareholders and 
long term financial growth. EPS growth is derived from 
the audited financial statements. Targets take account of 
internal strategic planning and external market expectations 
for the Company. Only modest rewards are available for 
achieving threshold performance with maximum rewards 
requiring substantial out‑performance of challenging 
strategic plans approved at the start of each year. 
4  The Committee operates incentive arrangements for 
executive directors in accordance with their respective 
rules and the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where 
relevant. The Committee, consistent with market 
practice, retains discretion over a number of areas 
relating to the operation and administration of the plan 
rules. These include (but are not limited to) the following:
 Y
who participates;
 Y
the timing of grant of award and/or payment;
 Y
  the size of an award (up to plan/policy limits)  
and/or a payment;
 Y
the result indicated by the performance conditions;
 Y
  discretion relating to the measurement of 
performance in the event of a change of control 
or reconstruction;
 Y
  determination of a good leaver (in addition to any 
specified categories) for incentive plan purposes;
 Y
  adjustments required in certain circumstances 
(e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and 
special dividends); and
 Y
  the ability to adjust existing performance conditions 
for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil 
their original purpose.
5  For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this directors’ 
remuneration policy, authority is given to the Company 
to honour any commitments entered into with current 
or former directors (such as, the payment of a pension 
or the vesting or exercise of past share awards).

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
Illustration of the application of the remuneration policy 
Our aim is to ensure that superior rewards are only paid for exceptional performance, with 
a substantial proportion of executive directors’ remuneration payable in the form of variable, 
performance‑related pay. The charts that follow illustrate the opportunity at different levels 
of performance for the remuneration policy. 
 
 
 
 
*  Based on the intended policy for Grenville Turner before it was announced that he will become non‑executive Chairman 
once a successor is in place. While the precise remuneration arrangements for the successor may differ from Grenville Turner’s 
current package, they will be consistent with the remuneration policy.
The above scenarios adopt the following assumptions:
 Y
 fixed pay consists of base salary as at 1 January 2014, benefits and pension allowances. Benefits are based 
on the value provided for 2013;
 Y
 on‑target performance is based on the value of fixed pay plus on‑target incentive pay, based on 83% of the 
maximum bonus and 62.5% of the maximum long term incentive pay values;
 Y
   maximum performance is based on the value of fixed pay plus maximum incentive pay (i.e. a 120% of base 
salary annual bonus and a 150%/130% of salary LTIP award). IPO options, as described in the annual report 
on remuneration, have been excluded from the above analysis (even though they vest on the basis of 2014 
performance) as they do not form part of the ongoing remuneration policy; and
 Y
 no assumptions have been made as to the share price growth and any dividend accrual has been excluded 
from the above.
Recruitment of executive directors 
and promotions
When setting the remuneration package 
for a new executive director, the Committee 
will apply the same principles and implement 
the policy as set out in the table above. 
Base salary will be set at a level appropriate 
to the role and experience of the director 
being appointed. This may include setting 
a below‑market salary with an agreement 
on future increases up to a market rate, 
in line with increased experience and/or 
responsibilities, subject to performance, 
where this is considered appropriate. 
Our policy on maximum annual bonus 
and LTIP awards would apply.
In relation to external appointments, the 
Committee may structure an appointment 
package that it considers appropriate to 
recognise awards or benefits forfeited on 
resignation from a prior position, taking 
into account timing and valuation and 
other specific matters it considers relevant. 
This may take the form of cash and/or share 
awards. The maximum payment under any 
such arrangements (which may be in addition 
to normal variable remuneration) would be 
no more than the Committee considers is 
required to provide reasonable compensation 
to the incoming director and would not go 
beyond a like‑for‑like compensation. If a 
director is required to relocate in order to 
take up the position, the Company may 
consider reasonable relocation, travel, 
subsistence and any other incidental 
payments as appropriate. Any such payments 
will be at the discretion of the Committee.
In the case of an employee who is 
promoted to the position of director, it is 
the Company’ s policy to honour pre‑existing 
commitments in accordance with their terms.

Service agreements and letters 
of appointment
Each of the executive director’s service 
agreements is for a rolling term and may 
be terminated by the Company or the 
director by giving twelve months’ notice.
The non‑executive directors of the Company 
(including the Chairman) do not have service 
contracts. The independent non‑executive 
directors are appointed by letters of 
appointment and have an initial two year 
term. Caleb Kramer’s services are provided 
to the Company under an agreement 
between the Company and Oaktree Capital 
Management FIE LLC which runs for an 
initial period of three years. The initial terms 
of the non‑executive directors’ positions are 
subject to their re‑election by the Group’s 
shareholders at the AGM.
The directors’ service agreements and 
letters of appointment are available for 
inspections at the Company’s registered 
office and will be available at the AGM.
Policy on payment for loss of office
If an executive director’s employment 
is terminated, in the absence of a breach 
of service agreement by the director, the 
Company may (although it is not obliged to) 
terminate the director’s employment 
immediately by payment of an amount equal 
to the basic salary and specified benefits 
(including pension scheme contribution or 
equivalent salary supplement payment) in 
lieu of the whole or the remaining part of the 
notice period. Discretionary bonus payments 
will not form part of any payments in lieu of 
notice. Annual bonus may be payable with 
respect to the period of the financial year 
served although it would be paid in cash 
and pro‑rated for time and paid at the 
normal payout date. Payments in lieu of 
notice may be paid in monthly instalments 
over the length of the notice period with 
such instalments to be reduced or to cease 
upon the director receiving payment from 
a new position.
Any share‑based entitlements granted to an 
executive director under the Company’s share 
plans will be determined based on the 
relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the LTIP is that 
any outstanding awards lapse on cessation 
of employment. However, in certain prescribed 
circumstances, such as ill health, injury or 
disability, retirement, transfer of the employing 
company outside of the Group or in other 
circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may be 
applied. For good leavers, awards will 
normally vest on the normal vesting date, 
subject to the satisfaction of the relevant 
performance conditions and reduced 
pro‑rata to reflect the proportion of the 
performance period actually served. 
However, the Committee has discretion 
to determine that awards for good leavers 
vest at cessation and/or to disapply time 
pro‑rating. In the event of death, awards 
will normally vest on the date of death 
subject to performance conditions and 
time pro‑rating although the Committee 
has discretion to determine that awards 
vest at the normal vesting date and/or 
to disapply time pro‑rating.
The default treatment under the IPO options, 
the rules of which were drafted to replicate 
the pre‑admission long term incentive plan 
(see annual report on remuneration) is that 
any outstanding awards lapse on cessation 
of employment. However, in certain 
prescribed circumstances, such as death, 
permanent disability, retirement, transfer 
of the employing company outside of the 
Group, employment being terminated within 
twelve months of a material acquisition, 
cessation between the second and third 
anniversary of Admission where the chief 
executive officer or chief financial officer 
either receives a payment in lieu of notice 
or otherwise leave without notice or in 
other circumstances at the discretion of 
the Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may 
be applied. For good leavers, awards will 
normally vest on the normal vesting date, 
subject to the satisfaction of the relevant 
performance conditions. Other than where 
the chief executive officer or chief financial 
officer ceases employment between the 
second and third anniversary of Admission 
in circumstances where the individual 
receives a payment in lieu of notice, IPO 
options will be reduced pro‑rata to reflect 
the proportion of the vesting period served 
although the Committee has discretion to 
disapply time pro‑rating.
The default treatment for deferred bonus 
awards is that any outstanding awards 
vest on cessation of employment unless 
cessation is as a result of dismissal for gross 
misconduct or a similar ‘bad leaver’ reason.
External appointment 
of executive directors
The Board allows executive directors to 
accept appropriate outside commercial 
non‑executive director appointments 
provided the aggregate commitment is 
compatible with their duties as executive 
directors. The executive directors 
concerned may retain fees paid for these 
services, which will be subject to approval 
by the Board. Details of such appointments 
and fees retained for 2013 are disclosed 
on page 51. 50

COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
Annual report on remuneration
Implementation of the remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2014
Details of how the Committee intends to operate the remuneration policy for directors for the year ending 31 December 2014, including the 
impact of the recent announcement in respect of Group chief executive officer Grenville Turner becoming non‑executive Chairman once a 
succesor is in place, are set out below. 
Base salary
Base salaries for the executive directors are reviewed annually by the Committee, taking account of the director’s performance, experience 
and responsibilities. When determining base salaries, the Committee also has regard to economic factors, remuneration trends and the general 
level of salary increases awarded throughout the Group. Current base salaries, which have remained unchanged from IPO, are as follows:
2014
£’000
Grenville Turner 475
Jim Clarke 300
Benefits in kind and pension
Executive directors will continue to receive benefits in kind including a company car allowance, life assurance, private medical insurance 
and permanent health insurance. Jim Clarke will receive a company pension contribution of up to 12% of base salary while Grenville Turner will 
receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension entitlement of up to 15% of base salary up to the date he ceases to be an executive director.
Annual bonus 
For 2014, the annual bonus will continue to be based on Group EBITDA targets. The Committee has chosen not to disclose the 
performance targets in advance for 2014 as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. Retrospective 
disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be presented in the 2014 annual report on remuneration. 
The maximum bonus potential will continue to be 120% of salary for executive directors for 2014 and one‑ third of any bonus payable 
will be deferred into Company shares for a period of three years. Malus and clawback provisions will operate in respect of deferred bonus 
awards. The Group chief executive officer’s annual bonus will be pro‑ rated for the period of time served as an executive director, subject 
to performance targets and will be payable at the normal payment date, subject to the normal deferral policy.
Long term incentive plans
The annual award of LTIPs to be granted in 2014 will be subject to the following targets:
 Y
absolute EPS (two‑ thirds) – 25% of this part of an award will vest for EPS of 57.6 pence increasing pro‑ rata to 100% vesting for EPS 
of 70.4 pence for the year ending 31 December 2016; and
 Y
relative TSR (one‑ third) – the Company’s TSR measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding financial services 
companies and investment trusts). 25% of this part of an award will vest for performance at median of comparator group, 
increasing pro‑ rata to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
Long term incentive plans continued
The Group chief executive officer will not receive any further LTIP awards given his planned transition to non‑executive chairman. Existing 
awards will remain in place and vest in line with the relevant scheme rules. The Group chief financial officer will receive an award over 
shares worth 130% of salary and LTIP awards to any new Group chief executive officer will be consistent with the policy. Malus and 
clawback provisions will operate.
Shareholding guidelines will continue to operate. Executive directors will be required to retain no less than 50% of net of tax shares from 
vesting of share options or awards until such time as a shareholding equivalent in value to 100% of base salary has been achieved.
Non‑ executive directors
Non‑executive director fee levels for 2014, which remain unchanged from IPO (or appointment if later) unless otherwise stated, are as follows:
Committee 
Chairman role
2014
£’000
David Watson Audit and Risk* 150
Caleb Kramer — 40
Sandra Turner — 45

*  David Watson was appointed as interim Chairman of the Group from 8 November 2013. This has entitled him to additional fees for this role of £95,000 per annum pro‑rata on top of his 
normal £55,000 fee.

1 Remuneration disclosed for executive directors represents full year amounts as these directors performed qualifying services within the Group in both years.
2 Benefits consist of the provision of a car allowance, life assurance, private medical and health insurance.
3  Details of the annual bonus targets and payments are set out below. In respect of 2012 bonus settlements, Jim Clarke received an IPO bonus of £50,000 to reflect the additional 
requirements and achievements of the Listing process.
4  Grenville Turner receives a 15% of salary supplement in lieu of pension entitlements (introduced at the point of IPO) and Jim Clarke receives a pension contribution to the 
defined contribution section of the Group scheme of 12% of his base salary subject to his personal contribution of 9% of his base salary.
5  The independent non‑ executive directors were appointed during the year (and accordingly no comparatives are disclosed). Sanjay Patel and Caleb Kramer held positions as 
non‑ executive directors within the Group prior to their appointment to the listed Company Board during the year and so fees are disclosed for both years in respect of qualifying 
services. David Watson was appointed on 2 September 2013, Cathy Turner was appointed on 31 July 2013 and Sandra Turner was appointed on 18 March 2013. Robert Davies 
was appointed on 18 March 2013 and stepped down on 7 November 2013 and Neville Richardson was appointed on 18 March 2013 and stepped down on 18 June 2013.
6  As part of his appointment arrangements, Robert Davies was awarded £200,700 with an entitlement to purchase shares with an equivalent aggregate value, at the nominal per 
share value, prior to Admission. To maintain the Chairman’s independence, the shares were not subject to any restrictions other than those attaching to ordinary shares held by 
shareholders or required by law. However, shortly after grant, the individual confirmed in writing that he did not intend to sell the shares prior to the second anniversary of Admission.
7  Matching shares were issued to the executive directors under the Share Incentive Plan, in November and December 2013, following the introduction of the employee‑ wide 
share incentive plan. The aggregate value of these was £121 for each executive director.
8  In addition to the above, Grenville Turner was chairman of Knightsbridge Student Housing Limited and Bellpenny Limited and was a non‑ executive director of Zoopla Property 
Group Ltd. He received fees only in respect of his role with Knightsbridge Student Housing Limited, amounting to £50,000. 52
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
2013 annual bonus award
Executive directors had the potential to receive an annual bonus of up to 120% of base salary. The primary driver of any award is based on 
Group EBITDA performance relative to targets set at the start of the financial year. In assessing the final award, the required Group EBITDA 
is adjusted up or down dependent upon the actual market size relative to the plan. The market size is measured based on the independent 
Land Registry data (as at the end of September, plus full year indicative estimates). Group EBITDA is also adjusted for any significant benefit 
and costs associated with major unplanned initiatives such as acquisitions. To receive an award, an executive director also has to have 
performed at an individual level. 
In determining the 2013 annual bonus award, the Committee considered:
 Y
Group EBITDA of £86.6 million, which represents significant outperformance of the target Group EBITDA of £74.1 million in the plan;
 Y
an estimated market size considerably larger, +13%, than anticipated;
 Y
the achievement of significant projects, including the IPO, multiple acquisitions including LSH, ongoing efficiency, IT transformation 
programme; and
 Y
the strong contribution from each executive director.
Whilst performance against the original plan would have triggered a maximum bonus of 120% of base salary, the larger than expected 
market size resulted in a flexing downwards of the annual bonus award to 100% of base salary.
The following table illustrates the performance measures and Group targets, their significance in terms of value and the respective outcomes:

IPO options
Prior to the IPO, management participated in a management incentive plan (MIP) arrangement which was typical of those arrangements 
operated by private equity‑backed companies. Rather than crystallising the MIP arrangement at IPO and therefore significantly reducing the 
retentiveness of senior executive packages, following discussions with the Company’s major shareholders at the time, MIP awards were rolled 
over into a new arrangement with awards granted over Countrywide plc shares (IPO Options) to ensure that the management team continued 
to be appropriately retained and incentivised to deliver earnings growth and shareholder return in the years immediately following IPO. 
The following roll‑over awards were therefore granted to executive directors over Countrywide plc shares immediately prior to, and 
conditional upon, the IPO.

The performance condition on the vesting of IPO Options is based on the performance condition, detailed in the Listing Prospectus, 
as converted to reflect EBITDA per ordinary share in issue immediately following admission:
 Y
if EBITDA for financial year ending 31 December 2014 is £74 million or less, then no part of an IPO Option will vest (i.e. EBITDA 
per ordinary share of 33.72 pence);
 Y
if EBITDA for financial year ending 31 December 2014 is £120 million or more, then 100% of an IPO Option will vest (i.e. EBITDA 
per ordinary share of 54.68 pence); and
 Y
if EBITDA for financial year ending 31 December 2014 falls between this specified floor and ceiling, vesting of an IPO Option will 
occur on a straight line basis. 
SIP awards

COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report, the directors’ 
remuneration report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union, and the parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
 Y
select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
 Y
make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 Y
state whether IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the Group and parent company 
financial statements respectively; and
 Y
prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the directors’ remuneration report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, 
the directors consider that the annual report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the 
disclosure and transparency rules
Each of the directors, whose names and 
functions are listed within the corporate 
governance statement confirm that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
 Y
the Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group; and
 Y
the strategic report contained in the 
annual report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Group 
website, www.countrywide.co.uk. Legislation 
in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Strong financial

comprises applicable law and IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union.
What an audit of financial 
statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland’)). An audit 
involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of:
 Y
whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’ s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;
 Y
the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and 
 Y
the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Countrywide 
annual report (the ‘Annual Report’) to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These 
helped us to determine the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate 
the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement 
we determined overall materiality for the 
Group financial statements as a whole to 
be £2.9 million. This represented 5% of profit 
before tax adjusted for exceptional items and 
the non-recurring finance costs that arose as a 
result of the capital restructure on IPO, which 
we judged to be the most relevant measure 
of underlying profit for our audit.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to them all misstatements 
identified during our audit above £0.1 million 
as well as misstatements below that amount 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group is a residential estate agency and 
property services provider in the UK operating 
in seven complementary businesses as set out 
in the Annual Report. Each of the businesses 
is broken down into a number of reporting 
units which are consolidated into the Group 
financial statements along with the 
centralised functions.
Reporting units from the seven businesses 
were included in the scope of our work 
and were subject to audits by the group 
engagement team of their complete financial 
information. In some of the businesses we 
audited all the reporting units and in some 
we focused on the larger reporting units to 
give us appropriate coverage. Our scope 
meant that we achieved 95% coverage of 
revenue and 93% of the profit before tax 
for the Group as a whole. 
This, together with additional procedures 
performed by us on the remaining reporting 
units, and on impairment, going concern and 
acquisition accounting, gave us sufficient, 
appropriate audit evidence for our opinion 
on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the 
directors made a number of subjective 
judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain. We 
primarily focused our work in these areas 
by assessing the directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined 
information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we considered 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for 
us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit 
evidence through testing the effectiveness 
of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those 
that required particular focus in the current 
year. This is not a complete list of all risks or 
areas of focus identified by our audit. We 
discussed these areas of focus with the Audit 
Committee. Their report on those matters that 
they considered to be significant issues in 
relation to the financial statements is set 
out on page 42. FINANCIALS

Overview of our audit approach continued
Areas of particular audit focus continued 
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Management override of controls
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this as there is a risk that senior 
management can potentially override controls, regardless of how strong the 
control environment is.
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including the 
arrangements for employees to ‘whistle-blow’ inappropriate actions, and interviewed 
senior management and the Group’s internal audit function. 
We audited significant balances which were judgemental and subjective in nature,  
for example, provisions and impairment, and assessed whether there was evidence  
of bias by the senior employees in their estimates, individually and in aggregate. 
We tested manual journal entries posted during the year to identify unusual 
or irregular items.
Fraud in revenue recognition
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue recognition. 
Revenue is the key driver for the business and as such represents a financial 
statement line item that is susceptible to fraud or manipulation. We deemed 
occurrence of revenue transactions to be the particular risk.
We evaluated the process and key controls underlying the recording 
of revenue transactions. 
We tested recorded revenue transactions to underlying documentation,  
obtaining external confirmations in some cases.
Our work in this area also included tests of reconciliations between the  
detailed account listings and the general ledger, and of a sample of credit  
notes issued post year end, and we also examined journal entries posted to  
revenue accounts.
Accounting estimates and judgements
The Group financial statements include a number of significant accounting 
estimates that required judgement by the directors:
 Y
provisions for Professional Indemnity (PI) claims – principally from the 
surveying business. Our audit procedures had to take into account  
both the potential exposure and the extent to which liabilities are likely 
to crystallise;
 Y
onerous leases/dilapidation provisions – with a substantial property 
portfolio there is judgement around provisions in relation to the 
Group’s unoccupied properties and future dilapidation costs;
 Y
other provisions – such as bad debt and other litigation costs  
in the normal course of business; and
 Y
available-for-sale financial assets need to be fair valued  
at each balance sheet date.
We understood and evaluated the processes by which these accounting estimates 
and judgements were arrived at.
For each significant provision, we assessed the appropriateness of the methodology, 
tested the relevant data to supporting documentation, examined the integrity of the 
model used to generate the calculation, and evaluated discount rates where 
appropriate. We also looked at historical information on the outcome of previous 
provisions.
We corroborated the directors’ estimates and judgements to third party 
documentation where possible. 
In relation to the provisions for PI claims, we attended meetings with the Group’s 
lawyers and insurers and discussed the matter with the Group’s external and  
internal legal counsel and obtained legal confirmation letters from them.
For available-for-sale financial assets, we tested the valuations carried out by  
the management and obtained comfort over the fair value used by comparing  
it with the most recent share purchase transactions in the relevant company.
Financial statement disclosure
The Group has not reported as a listed company for a number of years, 
which could increase the risk of error or omission in the reporting process.
We carried out a full range of tests of the contents of the financial statement 
disclosures, and other aspects of the annual report that we audit, to check  
that they met the technical and regulatory requirements.
As reported below, we also considered whether the statement given by the directors 
that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable was materially inconsistent with our knowledge  
of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit.  FINANCIALS

Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review the directors’ statement, set out 
on page 57, in relation to going concern. 
We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the 
directors have concluded that it is appropriate 
to prepare the Group’s financial statements 
using the going concern basis of accounting. 
The going concern basis presumes that the 
Group has adequate resources to remain in 
operation, and that the directors intend it to 
do so, for at least one year from the date the 
financial statements were signed. As part of 
our audit we have concluded that the directors’ 
use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, these statements 
are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
Opinions on matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the 
strategic report and the directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the Group 
financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the Group financial statements.
Other matters on which we are 
required to report by exception
Adequacy of information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. 
We have no exceptions to report arising 
from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report if, in our opinion, certain 
disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law have not been made, and under 
the Listing Rules we are required to review 
certain elements of the report to shareholders 
by the Board on directors’ remuneration. 
We have no exceptions to report arising 
from these responsibilities.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with nine provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’). We have nothing to report 
having performed our review.
On page 58 of the Annual Report, as required 
by the Code Provision C.1.1, the directors state 
that they consider the Annual Report taken as 
a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for members to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
On page 42, as required by C.3.8 of the Code, 
the Audit Committee has set out the significant 
issues that it considered in relation to the 
financial statements, and how they were 
addressed. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 Y
the statement given by the directors 
is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our  
audit; or
 Y
the section of the Annual Report 
describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by 
us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising 
from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion, information 
in the Annual Report is:
 Y
materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited Group 
financial statements; or
 Y
apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, 
our knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our  
audit; or
 Y
is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising 
from this responsibility.

Notes to the financial statements
1. General information 
Countrywide plc (“the Company”) and its 
subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) is the 
leading integrated, full service residential 
estate agency and property services group 
in the UK, measured by both revenue and 
transaction volumes in 2013. It offers estate 
agency and lettings services, together with 
a range of complementary services, and has 
a significant presence in key areas and 
property types which are promoted through 
locally respected brands.
The Company is a public limited company, 
which is listed on the London Stock Exchange 
and incorporated and domiciled in the UK 
(registered number: 08340090). The address 
of its registered office is 17 Duke Street, 
Chelmsford, Essex CM1 1HP.
2. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in 
the preparation of these consolidated financial 
statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to the years 
presented, unless otherwise stated.
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, as modified by the revaluation 
of available-for-sale financial assets and 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss, and in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and 
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) 
as adopted by the European Union and 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS.
The preparation of the consolidated financial 
information in conformity with IFRS requires 
the use of certain critical accounting estimates 
and requires management to exercise 
judgement in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or 
complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.
Capital reorganisation during 2013
Countrywide Newco Limited was incorporated 
on 21 December 2012 and was subsequently 
re-registered as a public company on 
19 March 2013 with the name 
Countrywide plc.
With effect from 19 March 2013, the Company 
became the legal parent of Countrywide 
Holdings, Ltd and its subsidiary undertakings 
through an exchange of equity interests (see 
note 25). This has been accounted for as a 
capital reorganisation, reflecting the substance 
of the transaction. Hence the consolidated 
financial statements continue to be prepared 
on the same basis as previously. However, the 
capital reserves on the Group balance sheet 
reflect the share capital of the Company from 
 19 March 2013. The difference between the 
share capital of the Company and the share 
capital, share premium and capital redemption 
reserve of Countrywide Holdings, Ltd at 
 19 March 2013 is recognised in the capital 
reorganisation reserve. The results include: 
 Y
the consolidated income statement includes 
the results of Countrywide Holdings, Ltd 
and its subsidiaries for the year ended 
31 December 2013;
 Y
the comparative figures in the 
consolidated income statement are the 
results of Countrywide Holdings, Ltd 
and its subsidiaries for the year ended 
31 December 2012; and
 Y
the consolidated retained earnings 
reserve of the Group includes the retained 
earnings of Countrywide Holdings, Ltd 
and its subsidiaries for the period before 
and after 19 March 2013.
Prior year restatement
Revenue generated in Surveying Services from 
panel management contracts was previously 
reported inclusive of the fees received by the 
Group on behalf of panel valuers. A related 
cost was included in other operating expenses. 
A review of these contracts concluded that the 
division was acting as an agent and therefore 
the revenue has been restated net of the fees 
paid. There was no impact on net assets, profits 
or reserves of the Group as a result of this 
change. For the year ended 31 December 2012, 
the impact of this restatement was to reduce 
revenue by £15.1 million and reduce other 
operating costs by £15.1 million.
In addition, following the restructuring of internal 
reporting during the year, a change in segmental 
reporting has been undertaken (see note 4). 
There was no impact on net assets, profits or 
reserves of the Group as a result of this change, 
only their allocation between segments in 
the comparatives.
There was no material impact on the Group 
financial statements arising from the adoption of 
revised IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ during the 
year. Accordingly, there has been no restatement 
to prior year financial statements and no 
requirement for additional associated disclosures.
(b) Going concern 
These financial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis, which assumes that 
the Group will be able to meet its liabilities 
when they fall due for the foreseeable future. 
The Board of directors has reviewed cash flow 
forecasts, which have been stress tested with 
various assumptions regarding future housing 
market volumes, and concluded that it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial statements 
on a going concern basis.
(c) New standards, amendments 
and interpretations
Standards, amendments and 
interpretations effective and  
adopted by the Group
The following standards have been adopted 
by the Group for the first time for the financial 
year beginning on or after 1 January 2013 
but none have had a material impact on 
the Group:
 Y
Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Financial statement 
presentation’ regarding other comprehensive 
income. The main change resulting from 
these amendments has been to group 
items presented in ‘other comprehensive 
income’ (OCI) on the basis of whether they 
are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss 
subsequently (reclassification adjustments).
 Y
IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ was revised 
in June 2011. The changes to the Group’s 
accounting policies have been as follows: 
to immediately recognise all past service 
costs; and to replace interest cost and 
expected return on plan assets with a 
net interest amount that is calculated 
by applying the discount rate to the net 
defined benefit liability. (See note 24).
 Y
Amendment to IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
instruments: Disclosures’ on asset liability 
and offsetting includes new disclosures 
to facilitate comparison between entities 
preparing financial statements under IFRS 
to those that prepare in accordance with 
US GAAP. 
 Y
IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to 
improve consistency and reduce complexity 
by providing a precise definition of fair 
value and a single source of fair value 
measurement and has resulted in 
additional disclosure requirements 
(see note 33).
New standards and 
interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and interpretations 
are effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2014 and have not yet 
been applied in preparing these financial 
statements. None of these new standards 
or interpretations are expected to have a 
material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group.
 Y
IAS 28 (revised 2011) ‘Investments in 
associates and joint ventures’ (effective 
1 January 2014) includes the requirements 
for joint ventures, as well as associates, to 
be equity accounted following the issue of 
IFRS 11. The Group has historically applied 
the equity method to account for its joint 
venture interests.  FINANCIALS

(c) New standards, amendments  
and interpretations continued
New standards and interpretations 
not yet adopted continued
 Y
IAS 32 (amendment) ‘Financial instruments 
– Presentation’ on asset and liability offsetting 
(effective 1 January 2014) clarifies some 
of the requirements for offsetting financial 
assets and financial liabilities on the 
balance sheet.
 Y
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ 
(effective 1 January 2014) builds on existing 
principles by identifying the concept of 
control as the determining factor in whether 
an entity should be included within the 
consolidated financial statements and 
provides additional guidance to assist in 
determining control where this is difficult 
to assess. 
 Y
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other 
entities’ (effective 1 January 2014) covers 
the disclosure requirements for all forms 
of interests in other entities, including 
joint arrangements, associates, special 
purpose vehicles and other off balance 
sheet vehicles. 
 Y
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and 
IFRS 12 (effective 1 January 2014) provide 
additional transition relief to IFRSs 10, 11 
and 12, limiting the requirement to provide 
adjusted comparative information to only 
the preceding comparative period. 
 Y
Amendments to IAS 36 ‘Impairment 
of assets’, on the recoverable amount 
disclosures for non-financial assets 
removes certain disclosures of the 
recoverable amount of CGUs which 
had been included in IAS 36 by the 
issue of IFRS 13.
(d) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the 
Group has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies, generally accompanying 
a shareholding of more than one half of the 
voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group. They are deconsolidated from 
the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used 
to account for acquisitions and the cost of 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of 
assets given, equity instruments issued and 
liabilities incurred. Identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed 
in a business combination are measured at their 
fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition 
costs are written off to the income statement. 
The accounting policies of subsidiaries 
acquired are changed, where necessary, 
to ensure consistency with policies 
operated by the Group. 
The Group recognises any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interest’s proportionate share 
of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. If the business 
combination is achieved in stages, the 
acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree 
is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition 
date through profit or loss. 
Goodwill is recorded as the excess of the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred 
and fair value of non-controlling interest over 
the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. If this 
consideration is lower than the fair value 
of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, 
the difference is recognised in profit or loss. 
Transactions with non-controlling interests that 
do not result in loss of control are accounted 
for as equity transactions – that is, as transactions 
with the owners in their capacity as owners. 
The difference between fair value of any 
consideration paid and the relevant share 
acquired of the carrying value of net assets 
of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains 
or losses on disposals to non-controlling 
interests are also recorded in equity.
Joint ventures
Under the equity method of accounting, interests 
in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost 
and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s 
share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and 
movements in other comprehensive income. 
When the Group’s share of losses in a joint 
venture equals or exceeds its interests in the 
joint venture, the Group does not recognise 
further losses except to the extent that it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on 
behalf of the joint venture. Accounting policies 
of the joint venture are aligned where applicable. 
Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
Intra-group balances, and any gains and losses 
or income and expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated financial information. Gains arising 
from transactions with jointly controlled entities 
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the entity. Losses are eliminated in 
the same way as gains, but only to the extent 
that there is no evidence of impairment. 
(e) Foreign currency translation 
The functional currency of the Company is 
Pounds Sterling because that is the currency 
of the primary economic environment in 
which the Group operates. The Group’s 
presentation currency is Pounds Sterling. 
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated 
into the functional currency using the exchange 
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the translation at year-end exchange 
rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the income statement. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate 
to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents 
are presented in the income statement within 
‘finance income or costs’. All other foreign 
exchange gains and losses are presented 
in the income statement within ‘other 
income’ or ‘other operating costs’.
Group companies 
The results and financial position of all the 
Group entities (none of which has the currency 
of a hyperinflationary economy) that have 
a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated into 
the presentation currency as follows:
 Y
assets and liabilities for each balance sheet 
presented are translated at the closing 
rate at the date of that balance sheet;
 Y
income and expenses for each income 
statement presented are translated at 
average exchange rates (unless this average 
is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on 
the transaction dates, in which case income 
and expenses are translated at the rate on 
the dates of the transactions); and 
 Y
all resulting exchange differences are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated 
as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate. Exchange 
differences arising are recognised in equity.
The following exchange rates were applied 
for £1 Sterling at 31 December: 
2013 2012
Hong Kong Dollars 12.66 12.28
Euros 1.20 1.22
Barbadian Dollars 3.31 3.10
(f) Property, plant and equipment 
Owned assets 
Items of property, plant and equipment are 
stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset 
and the costs attributable to bringing the asset 
to its working condition for its intended use. 
When parts of an item of property, plant and 
equipment have different useful lives, those 
components are accounted for as separate 
items of property, plant and equipment.  FINANCIALS

2. Accounting policies continued
(f) Property, plant and equipment 
continued
Owned assets continued
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with 
the item will flow to the Group and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably.
Gains and losses on disposals are 
determined by comparing the proceeds 
with the carrying amount and are recognised 
in the income statement.
Leased assets 
Leases under which the Group assumes 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of an asset are classified as 
finance leases. Property, plant and equipment 
acquired under finance leases is recorded 
at fair value or, if lower, the present value of 
minimum lease payments at inception of the 
lease, less accumulated depreciation and any 
impairment losses.
Each lease payment is allocated between the 
liability and finance charges. The corresponding 
rental obligations, net of finance charges, are 
included within borrowings. The interest element 
of the finance cost is charged to the income 
statement over the lease period so as to produce 
a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability for each period. 
The property, plant and equipment under finance 
leases is depreciated over the shorter of the 
useful life of the asset and lease term.
Depreciation 
Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on 
a straight line basis over the estimated useful 
lives of each part of an item of property, plant and 
equipment. The property, plant and equipment 
acquired under finance leases is depreciated 
over the shorter of the useful life of the asset 
and the lease term. Freehold land is not 
depreciated. The estimated useful lives 
are as follows: 
 Y
Freehold buildings – 50 years 
 Y
Leasehold improvements – over the 
period of the lease 
 Y
Furniture and equipment – three to five years 
 Y
Motor vehicles – three to five years 
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed, 
and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance 
sheet date.
(g) Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill has been recognised on acquisitions 
of subsidiaries and joint ventures. Goodwill 
represents the excess of the cost of an 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the net identifiable assets of the 
acquiree at the date of acquisition and the 
value of the non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree. Acquisition costs are written off 
to the income statement.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to 
cash generating units and is not amortised 
but is tested annually for impairment or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate potential impairment.
In respect of joint ventures, the carrying 
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying 
amount of the investment in the joint venture. 
Excess of acquirer’s interest in the net 
fair value of acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost 
arising on an acquisition is recognised in 
the income statement.
Other intangible assets 
Intangible assets other than goodwill that 
are acquired by the Group, principally 
acquired brands, customer contracts and 
relationships, computer software, pipeline 
and other intangibles, are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation, where charged, 
and impairment losses. Brands are considered 
to have indefinite lives.
Acquired computer software is capitalised on 
the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and 
bring to use the specific software. Internal 
costs that are incurred during the development 
of significant and separately identifiable computer 
software for use in the business are capitalised 
where the software is integral to the generation 
of future economic benefits. Internal costs that 
are capitalised are limited to incremental costs 
specific to the project. Other development 
expenditures that do not meet the criteria for 
capitalisation are recognised as an expense 
as incurred. Development costs previously 
recognised as an expense are not recognised 
as an asset in a subsequent period.
Amortisation 
Amortisation is charged to profit or loss on 
a straight line basis over the estimated useful 
lives of intangible assets unless such lives 
are indefinite. The estimated useful lives 
are as follows:
 Y
Computer software – five years
 Y
Brand names – indefinite life
Assets are tested annually for impairment 
or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate potential impairment. 
 Y
Customer contacts and relationships – 
five to ten years
 Y
Pipeline (agreed but un-exchanged house 
sales at date of acquisition) – three months
 Y
Other intangibles – 25 years
(h) Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’ s non-current 
assets are reviewed for impairment annually or 
whenever events and changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. If any such indication exists, the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
In respect of goodwill, intangible assets that 
have an indefinite useful life and intangible 
assets that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount is estimated at each 
balance sheet date. The recoverable amount 
is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use.
Impairment losses represent the amount 
by which the carrying value exceeds the 
recoverable amount; they are recognised in 
profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in 
respect of cash generating units are allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit 
and then to reduce the carrying amount of 
the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is 
not reversed. In respect of other assets, an 
impairment loss is reversed if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine 
the recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, if no impairment loss had 
been recognised.  FINANCIALS

2. Accounting policies continued
(i) Financial assets 
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets as 
loans and receivables and available-for-sale 
financial assets. The classification depends 
on the purpose for which the financial assets 
were acquired. Management determines 
the classification of its financial assets at 
initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that arise principally through the 
provision of services to customers. They are 
initially recognised at fair value, and are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. They are included 
in current assets, except for maturities greater 
than twelve months after the end of the 
reporting period. Loans and receivables 
comprise mainly cash and cash equivalents 
and trade and other receivables. 
Available-for-sale
Available-for-sale financial assets are 
non-derivative financial assets that are either 
designated in this category or not classified in 
any of the other categories. They are included 
in non-current assets unless the investment 
matures or management intends to dispose 
of it within twelve months of the end of the 
reporting period.
Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets 
are recognised on the trade date: the date 
on which the Group commits to purchase or sell 
the asset. Financial assets are derecognised 
when the rights to receive cash flows from 
the investments have expired or have been 
transferred and the Group has transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Loans and receivables and available-for-sale 
financial assets are initially recognised at fair 
value. Available-for-sale financial assets are 
subsequently carried at fair value. Loans 
and receivables are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Changes in the fair value of monetary 
and non-monetary securities classified as 
available-for-sale are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. 
When securities classified as available-for-sale 
are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair 
value adjustments recognised in equity are 
included in the income statement as ‘gains and 
losses from investment securities’ . Dividends 
on available-for-sale equity instruments are 
recognised in the income statement as part 
of other income when the Group’s right to 
receive payments is established. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Impairment provisions are recognised when 
there is objective evidence (such as significant 
financial difficulties on the part of the 
counterparty or default or significant delay 
in payment) that the Group will be unable to 
collect all of the amounts due under the terms 
receivable, the amount of such a provision 
being the difference between the net carrying 
amount and the present value of the future 
expected cash flows associated with the 
impaired receivable. 
For trade receivables, which are reported net 
of provisions, such provisions are recorded 
in a separate provision account with the loss 
being recognised within other operating costs 
in the income statement. On confirmation that 
the trade receivable will not be collectable, 
the gross carrying value of the asset is written 
off against the associated provision. 
In the case of assets classified as 
available-for-sale, impairment losses are 
recognised in the consolidated income 
statement and arise from objective evidence 
that these assets have declined in value such 
as a significant or prolonged decline in the fair 
value of the security below its cost.
(j) Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are recognised 
initially at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost less an impairment provision. 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables 
is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms 
of the receivables. 
(k) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash 
balances and call deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less. Bank 
overdrafts that are repayable on demand 
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management are included as a component 
of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose 
of the statement of cash flows and are 
presented in current liabilities.
(l) Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are recognised 
initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost.
(m) Borrowings 
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair 
value, net of transaction costs incurred. Such 
interest bearing liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method, which ensures 
that any interest expense over the period to 
repayment is at a constant rate on the balance 
of the liability carried in the balance sheet. 
Interest expense in this context includes initial 
transaction costs and premiums payable on 
redemption, as well as any interest payable 
while the liability is outstanding. 
(n) Options to acquire  
non-controlling interest 
Options to acquire non-controlling interests 
in the future are initially accounted for at fair 
value with a corresponding charge directly 
to equity. Such options are subsequently 
measured at fair value, using the effective 
interest rate method, in order to accrete 
the liability up to the amount payable under 
the option at the date at which it becomes 
exercisable. The charge arising is recorded 
as a finance cost and the liability is shown in 
other financial liabilities. The risks and rewards 
of ownership of the non-controlling interests 
remain with the sellers and therefore the 
non-controlling interest is recognised by the 
Group. The put options are contractual puts 
at the discretion of the sellers.
(o) Pensions 
The Group operates various post-employment 
schemes, including both defined benefit and 
defined contribution pension plans.
Defined contribution plans
The Group pays fixed contributions to 
separately administered pension insurance 
plans. The Group has no further obligations 
once the contributions have been paid. The 
contributions are recognised as an employee 
benefit expense when they are due. 
Defined benefit plans 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in 
respect of defined benefit pension plans is the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation 
at the end of the reporting period less the fair 
value of plan assets. The defined benefit 
obligation is calculated annually by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting the 
estimated future cash outflows using interest 
rates of high quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid, and that have terms to 
maturity approximating to the terms of the 
related pension obligation. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from 
experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are charged or credited 
to equity in other comprehensive income in 
the period in which they arise. 
Past service costs are recognised 
immediately in income. FINANCIALS 
COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Notes to the financial statements continued
2. Accounting policies continued
(p) Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled 
share-based schemes under which the Group 
receives services from employees as 
consideration for equity instruments (options) 
of the Group. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant 
of the options is recognised as an expense. 
Where the share awards have non-market 
related performance criteria the Group has 
used the Binomial Lattice and Black Scholes 
option valuation models to establish the 
relevant fair values. Where the share awards 
have a TSR market related performance 
criteria the Group has used the Monte Carlo 
simulation valuation model to establish the 
relevant fair values (see note 26). The resulting 
values are amortised through the income 
statement over the vesting period of the 
options and other grants.
At the end of each reporting period, the 
Group revises its estimates of the number 
of options that are expected to vest based 
on the non-market conditions and recognises 
the impact of the revision to original estimates, 
if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The social security contributions payable in 
connection with the grant of the share options 
is considered an integral part of the grant 
itself, and the charge will be treated as a 
cash-settled transaction.
(q) Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance 
sheet when the Group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows 
at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, 
when appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. The increase in the provision due to 
passage of time is recognised in finance costs. 
(r) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to 
the issue of new shares are shown in share 
premium as a deduction from the proceeds. 
Where the employee benefit trust purchases 
the Company’s equity share capital (treasury 
shares), the consideration paid, including 
any directly attributable incremental costs, 
is deducted from equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders until the shares 
are cancelled or reissued.
(s) Revenue 
Services rendered 
Revenue comprises mainly commission 
and fees receivable. Commission earned 
on sales of residential and commercial 
property is accounted for on the exchange 
of contracts for such sales. Survey, valuation 
and conveyancing fees are accounted for 
on completion of the service being provided. 
Commission earned on sales of insurance 
policies, mortgages and related products is 
accounted for when the policies go on risk 
or the mortgage is exchanged. Commissions 
and fees earned under lettings contracts 
are recognised at the point of delivery of 
the service. Revenue generated by Surveying 
Services from panel management contracts 
is reported net of any fees paid on behalf 
of panel valuers, reflecting the fact that the 
Group does not act as the principal in 
these contracts.
Revenue in respect of consultancy services 
performed is recognised as activity progresses 
to reflect the Group’s partial performance of its 
contractual obligations. Activity performance 
in excess of invoices raised is included within 
‘amounts due from customers for contract 
work’. Where amounts have been invoiced 
in excess of work performed, the excess is 
included within ‘amounts due to customers for 
contract work’. If the right to consideration is 
conditional or contingent on a specified future 
event or outcome, the outcome of which is 
outside the control of the Group, revenue is 
not recognised until that critical event occurs.
Under certain service contracts, the Group 
manages client expenditure and is obliged to 
purchase goods and services from suppliers 
and recharge them on to the customer at 
cost. The amounts charged by suppliers and 
recharged to clients are excluded from 
revenue and administrative expenses. 
Receivables, payables and cash relating 
to these transactions are included in the 
balance sheet.
Deferred income
Where the Group receives an amount upfront 
in respect of future income streams, the value 
of the receipt is amortised over the period of 
the contract as the services are delivered and 
the unexpired element is disclosed in liabilities 
as deferred income.
(t) Other income 
Other income is recognised when its receipt 
is assured and the Group has no further 
obligations to any other party in respect of that 
income. Rental income from sub-let properties 
is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line 
basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
granted are recognised as an integral part 
of the total rental income. Dividend income 
is recognised when the right to receive 
payment is established. 
(u) Operating lease payments 
Payments under operating leases are recognised 
in profit or loss on a straight line basis over 
the term of the lease. Lease incentives received 
are recognised in profit or loss as an integral 
part of the total lease expense. 
(v) Net finance costs 
Finance costs
Finance costs comprise interest payable 
on borrowings (including finance lease 
commitments), net interest costs on the 
pension scheme liabilities, the unwinding 
of the discount rates in respect of financial 
liabilities and provisions, premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs. 
Interest costs accrue using the effective interest 
method. Fees paid on the establishment of 
loan facilities are recognised as transaction 
costs of the loan and amortised over the 
period to which the facility relates. 
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest receivable 
on funds invested. Interest income is recognised 
in profit or loss as it accrues using the 
effective interest method.
(w) Exceptional items
As permitted by IAS 1 ‘Presentation and 
disclosure’ certain items are presented 
separately in the income statement as 
exceptional where, in the judgement of 
the directors, they need to be disclosed 
separately by virtue of their nature, size 
or incidence in order to obtain a clear and 
consistent presentation of the Group’s 
underlying business performance. Examples 
of material and non-recurring items which 
may give rise to disclosure as exceptional 
items include costs of restructuring existing 
businesses, integration of newly acquired 
businesses, asset impairments and costs 
associated with acquiring new businesses. 
The columnar presentation of our income 
statement separates exceptional items, 
amortisation of intangibles arising on business 
acquisitions and share-based payments to 
illustrate consistently the Group’s underlying 
business performance.
(x) Income tax 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity, in which case it is recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity respectively. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on 
the taxable income for the year, using tax 
rates enacted or substantially enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment 
to tax payable in respect of previous years.  FINANCIALS 
COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

2. Accounting policies continued
(x) Income tax continued 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance 
sheet liability method, providing for temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes. 
The following temporary differences are not 
provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; 
the initial recognition of other assets or liabilities 
that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; 
and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they are unlikely 
to reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount 
of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement 
of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates enacted or substantially 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
offset when there is a legally enforceable right 
to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes 
assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on either 
the taxable entity or different taxable entities 
where there is an intention to settle the 
balances on a net basis.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries 
and joint ventures, except for deferred income 
tax liability where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary difference is controlled 
by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
Additional income taxes that arise from the 
distribution of dividends are recognised at 
the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend. 
(y) Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting to the 
Governance and Performance Committee 
which has been identified as the chief 
operating decision maker. 
(z) Dividend distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s 
shareholders is recognised as a liability in 
the Group’s financial statements in the period 
in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends 
are recognised when paid.
3. Critical accounting judgements 
and estimates 
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements under IFRS requires the 
directors to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements 
are continually evaluated and are based 
on historical experience and other factors 
including expectations of future events that 
are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates, given the uncertainty 
surrounding the assumptions and conditions 
upon which the estimates are based. 
The directors consider that the following 
estimates and judgements are likely to have 
the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements. 
Provisions and other contingencies 
Claims and litigation 
When evaluating the impact of potential liabilities 
arising from claims against the Group, the Group 
takes legal and professional advice to assist it in 
arriving at its estimation of the liability taking into 
account the probability of the success of any 
claims and also the likely development of claims 
based on recent trends. 
The Group has made provision for claims 
received under its professional indemnity 
insurance arrangements. The provision can 
be broken down to three categories:
 Y
Reserves for known claims: These losses 
are recommended by our professional claims 
handlers and approved panel law firms 
who take into account all the information 
available on the claims and recorded on 
our insurance bordereaux. Where there is 
insufficient information on which to assess 
the potential losses, initial reserves may be 
set at an initial level to cover investigative 
costs or nil. Further provisions are also 
made for specific large claims which may 
be subject to litigation and the directors 
assess the level of these provisions based 
on legal advice and the likelihood of success.
 Y
Provision for the losses on known claims 
to increase: It can take one to two years 
for claims to develop after they are initially 
notified to the Group. For this reason, 
the Group creates a provision based 
on historical loss rates for closed claims 
and average losses for closed claims. 
 Y
Provision for incurred but not reported 
(IBNR): The Group also provides for future 
liabilities arising from claims IBNR for 
mortgage valuation reports and home 
buyer reports performed by the Surveying 
Services division. This provision is estimated 
on a future projection of historical data for 
all claims received based on the number 
of surveys undertaken to date. This 
projection takes into account the historic 
claim rate, claim liability rate and the 
average loss per claim. In view of the 
significant events in the financial markets 
and the UK property market in recent years, 
the directors have identified a separate 
sub-population of claims received which is 
tracked separately from the normal level of 
claims. This sub-population has been defined 
as claims received since 2008 for surveys 
carried out between 2004 and 2007. 
The estimate of these provisions by their 
nature is judgemental. The three key inputs, 
claim rate, claim liability rate and average loss, 
are very sensitive to any change in trends. For 
example, a 5% increase in the claim rate could 
lead to a £3.3 million increase in future claims. 
Similarly a 5% increase in the claim liability rate 
would add £3.2 million to provision. However, 
a 10% increase in average loss per claim 
would add £0.9 million. 
During 2013 the number of claims received 
was in line with expectations and the cumulative 
rate increased but remained below the level 
modelled at the end of 2012. As expected, 
we did experience an increase in the claim 
liability rate as we made progress clearing a 
number of claims. The higher rate has been 
included in the model going forwards. There is 
a possible risk that a significant rise in mortgage 
interest rates could lead to an increase in 
repossessions and potential losses being 
incurred by the lenders. But since there are 
no macro-economic indicators that this is 
a reasonable likelihood in the short term, 
the directors do not consider it appropriate 
to provide for additional claims due to 
macro-economic changes.
The average loss per claim increased slightly 
in relation to claims relating to the 2004-2007 
period. However, this was offset by a reduction 
in the average loss arising for normal claims. 
The directors have reviewed this input and 
consider that the level of change is within 
normal fluctuations and therefore do not 
propose to uplift the average loss.  FINANCIALS

3. Critical accounting judgements 
and estimates continued
Provisions and other contingencies 
continued
Onerous contracts
When any of the Group’s businesses vacate a 
leased property prior to the expiration of the 
lease, a provision is established to reflect the 
expected lease payments that the Group will 
incur prior to the assignment or sublease 
of the property. Such a calculation requires 
a judgement as to the timing and duration of 
the expected vacancy periods. When making 
these judgements, the directors consider a 
number of factors including the location and 
condition of the property, the terms of the 
lease and current economic environment. 
Property repairs 
The Group occupies a significant number 
of leased properties across the country. 
These leases contain dilapidation obligations. 
The directors take the advice of the in-house 
surveyors in assessing the level of the future 
obligation. When assessing the level of 
dilapidation required for our retail properties, 
the likelihood of exiting each property is 
taken into account. 
Clawback provisions
The clawback provision in respect of life 
insurance commissions earned is calculated 
using a model that has been developed over 
several years. The model is based on historical 
information collating clawback data in quarterly 
cohorts. The directors use this data, together 
with latest market trends, to make a judgement 
as to the future clawback rates to be applied. 
Accounting for acquisitions
The Group accounts for all business 
combinations under the purchase method. 
Under the purchase method, the identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed are measured at their fair 
value at the acquisition date. Judgements 
and estimates are made in respect of the 
measurement of the fair values of assets 
and liabilities acquired and consideration 
transferred. Where necessary, the Group 
engages external valuation experts to 
advise on fair value estimates, or otherwise 
performs estimates internally. 
Impairment of goodwill and 
indefinite lived intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and indefinite 
lived intangible assets are impaired requires 
an estimation of the value in use of the cash 
generating units to which the assets have 
been allocated. Calculating the cash flows 
requires the use of judgements and estimates 
that have been included in our strategic plans 
and long range forecasts. In addition, judgement 
is required to estimate the appropriate interest 
rate to be used to discount the future cash 
flows. The data necessary for the execution 
of the impairment tests are based on 
management estimates of future cash flows, 
which require estimating revenue growth 
rates and profit margins. Further details of 
impairment reviews are set out in note 14. 
Fair value of available-for-sale assets
The fair value of available-for-sale financial 
assets that are not traded on an active market 
is derived using a combination of valuation 
techniques and the most recent purchase 
price for these assets (see note 16(c)).
Share-based payments
At the end of each reporting period, the Group 
revises its estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to vest based on the 
non-market vesting conditions. It recognises 
the impact of the revision to original estimates, 
if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity. 
4. Segmental reporting 
Management has determined the operating 
segments based on the operating reports 
reviewed by the Governance and Performance 
Committee that are used to assess both 
performance and strategic decisions. 
Management has identified that the Governance 
and Performance Committee is the chief 
operating decision maker in accordance with 
the requirements of IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’ .
The Governance and Performance Committee 
considers the business to be split into seven 
main types of business generating revenue: 
Estate Agency, London & Premier, Lettings, 
Financial Services, Surveying Services, 
Conveyancing Services and Lambert Smith 
Hampton divisions, and ‘all other segments’ 
comprise central head office functions. 
The Estate Agency division generates 
commission earned on sales of residential and 
commercial property. The London & Premier 
division revenue is earned from both estate 
agency commissions and lettings and 
management fees. The Lettings division 
earns fees from the letting and management 
of residential properties and fees for the 
management of leasehold properties. 
The Financial Services division receives 
commission from the sale of insurance 
policies, mortgages and related products 
under contracts with financial service 
providers. Surveying Services comprises 
surveying and valuation fees which are 
received primarily under contracts with 
financial institutions with some survey fees 
being earned from home buyers. Conveyancing 
Services generates revenue from conveyancing 
work undertaken from customers buying or 
selling houses through our network. Lambert 
Smith Hampton’s revenue is earned from 
commercial property consultancy and advisory 
services, property management and valuation 
services. Other income generated by head 
office functions, relates primarily to sub-let 
rental income or other sundry fees. 
The Governance and Performance Committee 
assesses the performance of the operating 
segments based on a measure of adjusted 
EBITDA. This measurement basis excludes 
the effects of exceptional items, share-based 
payment charges and related National Insurance 
contributions, management fees and income 
from joint ventures. Finance income and costs 
are not allocated to the segments, as this type 
of activity is driven by the central treasury 
activities as part of managing the cash 
position of the Group.
Revenue and other income from external 
customers arising from activities in the UK 
was £584,047,000 (2012: £524,372,000 
restated) and that arising from activities 
overseas was £721,000 (2012: £356,000). 
The assets and liabilities for each operating 
segment represent those assets and liabilities 
arising directly from the operating activities 
of each division. Pension assets and liabilities 
and liabilities arising from the term loan and 
revolving credit facility are not allocated to 
operating segments, but allocated in full to 
‘all other segments’ within the segmental 
analysis. All inter-segment pricing is done 
on an arm’s length basis. Non-current assets 
attributable to the UK of £707,903,000 
(2012:  £607,261,000) are included in the 
total assets in the tables on the following 
pages. Non-current assets of £24,000 
(2012: £56,000) are attributable to the 
overseas operations. The equity investment 
in joint venture is disclosed within ‘all other 
segments’; £2,913,000 (2012: £2,676,000).
The available-for-sale financial assets are 
disclosed within other ‘all other segments’ 
and are £42,877,000 (2012: £14,370,000). 
There are no differences from the last annual 
financial statements in the basis of measurement 
of segment profit or loss. However, the 
Governance and Performance Committee has 
implemented a restructuring of the reportable 
business segments during the latter half of 2013. 
The structure now includes a London & Premier 
segment comprising the previous Hamptons 
segment and other London Prime Estate Agency 
branches. Further details were announced 
in December 2013 and are available on the 
website. Accordingly, all segmental analysis 
has been restated for both 2012 and 2013 
to report on a consistent basis. FINANCIALS

2013
Exceptional income
In May 2012 Zoopla merged with The Digital Property Group crystallising a number of warrants, which were granted to the Group under an 
agreement to list properties on the Zoopla website, which converted to ordinary shares. At the merger date, the Group fair valued these shares 
at £12.2 million. The shares were consideration for services provided to Zoopla over a period of time to 2015 and therefore recognised as deferred 
income. The deferred income is being amortised to the income statement over the period to 2015 and the income recognised relates to one 
year of amortisation.
Exceptional costs
In March 2013 the Group was listed on the London Stock Exchange under a new holding company, Countrywide plc. The costs charged to the 
income statement relate to costs incurred as a result of the listing but not directly related to the issue of new shares. These costs include such 
items as marketing expenditure, executive search and selection and additional PAYE and NI triggered due to payments before the tax year end.
In May 2013 the Group repaid the £250 million Senior Secured Notes; as a result of the early redemption a penalty charge of £2.5 million was 
incurred. At the same time, the existing revolving credit facility was cancelled and these events triggered the acceleration of previously capitalised 
finance costs.
Acquisition expenses principally relate to the costs of acquisition of Lambert Smith Hampton which, as a material acquisition in the current year, 
has been treated as exceptional.
2012
Exceptional income
In 2011 the Group assessed the fair value of the put options in respect of Capital Private Finance and United Surveyors based on the information 
available at the time. The fair value is the amount Countrywide is expected to pay to buy out the non-controlling interest in those subsidiaries. 
Subsequently, these businesses performed well, although the lack of any significant recovery in the residential property market delayed the 
intended expansion plans and consequently the put options were reassessed at a lower amount. In accordance with IAS 39, the reduction in 
value was credited to the income statement and disclosed as exceptional income due to the size of the transaction.
In May 2012 Zoopla merged with The Digital Property Group crystallising a number of warrants, which were granted to the Group under an 
agreement to list properties on the Zoopla website, which converted to ordinary shares. At the merger date, the Group fair valued these shares 
at £12.2 million. The shares were consideration for services provided to Zoopla over a period of time to 2015 and therefore recognised as deferred 
income. The deferred income is being amortised to the income statement over the period to 2015; there was a catch-up to the end of 2011 of 
£2.2 million and credit in respect of 2012 of £2.4 million, both of which were recognised in 2012.
Exceptional costs
During the latter part of 2012 the Group experienced substantially worsening trends in terms of professional indemnity (PI) claims received 
and losses recognised on the insurance bordereaux. As a consequence of this the Group recognised a further exceptional charge of £25.2 million. 
As discussed in note 3, Critical accounting judgements and estimates, the directors base their assessment of the provision on a number of factors; 
legal and professional advice, historical trends of claims received and losses incurred. During 2012 the rate of claims received increased and the 
average loss also rose due the closure of the more challenging disputes. The directors noted that the claims received in 2012 were mainly from 
prime lenders, who until now had not reported losses. Furthermore, as the six year statute of limitations approached for surveys in 2006 and 2007, 
the level of claims increased as lenders sought to protect their position. The directors have reflected the experience changes in the predictive 
models, taken account of potential worsening of positions in certain legal cases and increased the provision accordingly. Of the £25.2 million 
charge, £15.3 million relates to claims not yet received or current claims not assessed by the professional legal advisors due to lack of information.
The management team continued to restructure its cost base and as a result recognised a further exceptional cost of £11.5 million, 
principally comprising:
 Y
outsourcing of the IT function to CGI: provision of costs to transition to CGI over the course of 18 months of £3.4 million. In addition to 
transitioning to CGI, there are a number of transformational initiatives and investment due to be implemented during the course of 2013. 
The benefits of both the transition and transformation are expected to be realised from 2014;
 Y
Estate Agency division: centralisation of operations and creation of a National Administration Centre incurred redundancy and office closure 
costs of £1.5 million. Restructuring of the division’s corporate property services operation and the removal of more layers of management 
increased the one-off charge in 2012 by £3.3 million;
 Y
the Lettings division closed some branches and consolidated its operations within the Estate Agency network in order to benefit from 
efficiencies and closer working ties in the future, incurring a charge of £0.8 million in 2012;
 Y
the Financial Services division restructured its Land and New Homes services and restructured some operations at a cost of £0.6 million; and
 Y
the Surveying division took the opportunity to restructure its claims handling operations within its National Operations Centre as the contract 
with external providers expired and further senior management layers were removed; the cost of both was £0.9 million.  FINANCIALS

The changes to the main rate of corporation tax for UK companies announced in the March 2013 Budget were substantively enacted for 
financial reporting purposes on 2 July 2013. The main changes in corporation tax rates, that will have accounting implications for deferred tax, 
are as follows: the main rate of corporation tax will reduce from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014; the main rate of corporation tax will further 
reduce to 20% from 1 April 2015. 
The relevant deferred tax balances have been remeasured using a rate of 21%. The overall effect of the change in tax rate to 20% effective 
from 1 April 2015, if applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by £1.5 million.

All amortisation charges have been treated as an expense in the income statement. Brand names are treated as having an indefinite life, as a 
result of the fact that the Group will continue to operate these brands into perpetuity and they are therefore subject to annual impairment reviews. 
The carrying amounts of various brand names owned by the Group have been disclosed below. No amortisation has been disclosed as brands 
are considered to have an indefinite life and as such are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate potential impairment. FINANCIALS

Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are allocated to cash generating units and have been allocated to the lowest level of reporting unit. 
In many cases, the operations of the acquired businesses have been fully integrated with the existing businesses and therefore it is not possible 
to identify separately the economic flows from those businesses. In these cases the goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets have been 
tested against the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit reported at the higher level. 
The goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets have been allocated to cash generating units as follows:

The recoverable amount of all the above operations has been calculated using the value in use calculation determined from cash flow 
projections from formally approved budgets and forecasts covering a five year period to 2018 (2012: 2017). The growth rates applied in the 
approved budgets and forecasts are based on past experience and outlook. The discount rate used is based on the Group’s estimated cost 
of capital. To evaluate the recoverable amount of each division, a terminal value has been assumed from the fifth year and includes a growth 
rate in the cash flows of 0% (2012: 1%) into perpetuity.  FINANCIALS

(c) Impairment continued
Under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’, the Group is required to:
 Y
review its intangible assets in the event of a significant change in circumstances that would indicate potential impairment. 
The reviews conducted at the end of 2013 concluded that there had been no further impairment of goodwill (2012: £Nil); and
 Y
review and test its goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually each year or in the event of a significant change in 
circumstances. The impairment reviews conducted at the end of 2013 concluded that there had been no further impairment 
of goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets (2012: £Nil).
The impairment review for 2013 was conducted in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ by estimating the value in use of each 
of the cash generating units based on the following assumptions which management believes are appropriate given the 2014 budget 
and forecast for future years:
 Y
there is a 10% increase in housing transaction volumes during 2014. Thereafter, a growth rate of 0% has been assumed; 
 Y
the pre-tax discount rate was calculated to be 8% (2012: 9%); and
 Y
the benefits of past restructuring changes have been taken into account where there is appropriate certainty over cost reductions.
Based on the impairment test performed at 31 December 2013, there was no impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets required.
Sensitivity analysis
The key assumption driving the value in use calculations is the growth rate of the housing transaction volumes. Therefore, as part of the sensitivity 
analysis, management has considered the impact of applying a nil growth rate to the volume of housing transactions in 2014 and beyond. 
The results indicated that with no growth in housing transaction volumes in 2014 and beyond, the Surveying Services division’s goodwill would 
be impaired by £26.9 million. Given the observed market trends, the Group believes that this scenario is unlikely.
Sensitivity analysis was also undertaken in respect of the discount rate applied within the value in use calculations and significant headroom 
was available for movements in the discount rate applied, such that no potential impairments were identified.

At 31 December 42,877 14,370
The Group owns some Wimbledon debentures which were acquired and amortised over the life of the debenture. The fair value of these 
debentures at 31 December 2013 was £31,000 (2012: £53,000). 
The Group purchased non-quoted equity instruments in Zoopla in 2010 for £242,000. A further investment of £905,000 was made in 2012. 
In May 2012, Zoopla merged with The Digital Property Group and as a result crystallised some warrants into shares which were due under an 
arm’s length commercial agreement. The fair value of these shares was assessed based on the most recent price paid for shares. 
As a result of acquiring the additional shares for a nominal price and the fact that these shares were issued to the Group as part of the commercial 
agreement signed in 2010 to list the Group’ s properties for sale and rent on the Zoopla website, the excess in the assessed fair value, of these shares on 
initial recognition, over the nominal cost has been treated as deferred income and is being released over the period of the contract. The amount released 
to the income statement is disclosed in note 10 and the amount held on the balance sheet as deferred income is identified in note 21.
In 2013, a further investment of £1,054,000 was made. At the year end, the Group reviewed the fair value of the assets in light of information 
available. Taking into account the fair value review undertaken and the recent transaction price paid for the shares (by the Group and other 
independent shareholders in Zoopla), the directors concluded there had been a change in fair value that could be reliably measured (see note 33) 
as an unrecognised gain through the statement of comprehensive income. FINANCIALS

they have passed their contracted due date. Trade receivables are reviewed for impairment if they are past due beyond 90 days for individual 
customers or 180 days for commercial contracts. Further information in respect of financial assets, including credit risk, is provided in note 33.
Trade and other receivables are denominated in Pounds Sterling with the exception of £698,000 (2012: £237,000) which are receivable

Borrowings and other loans
The Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due in 2018 were repaid on 8 May 2013 and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement 
for £25 million expiring in 2016 was prepaid at the same time.
On 20 March 2013 the Company entered into a £100 million Term and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement which terminates in March 2017, 
for which there are no assets pledged as security. The facilities are split between £75 million Term Loan and £25 million Revolving Credit 
Facility (RCF). The loan is repaid by instalments: £5 million on the first anniversary, £10 million on the second anniversary, £25 million on the 
third anniversary and the balance on termination. Interest is payable based on LIBOR plus a margin of 3%. The RCF is available for utilisation 
subject to satisfying fixed charge and leverage covenants, but was not drawn down during the year.
The unsecured loan notes are non-interest bearing, repayable in 2029, and arose on the purchase of Mortgage Intelligence Holdings Limited.

The Group recognises deferred income as a result of cash received in advance in relation to certain sales distribution contracts and lease 
incentives relating to the Group’s operating leases. The cash received is amortised over the life of the contracts to which they relate.
Non-cash proportion of deferred income relates to unamortised income portion created on acquisition of shares in Zoopla. This deferred 
income is being amortised over the period of the commercial agreement which gave rise to these assets (refer to notes 10 and 16(c)).

The provision for onerous contracts relates to property leases and represents the estimated unavoidable costs of leasehold properties which 
have become surplus to the Group’s requirements following the closure or relocation of operations. The provision is based on the present value 
of rentals and other unavoidable costs payable during the remaining lease period after taking into account rents receivable or expected to be 
receivable from sub-lessees, typically over a five year period. Provisions are released when properties are assigned or sub-let. 
The provision for property repairs represents estimates of the cost to repair existing dilapidations under leasehold covenants, in accordance with 
IAS 37 ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’. The average unexpired lease length of properties against which a provision has 
been made is two years.
Clawback represents the provision required to meet the estimated cost of repaying indemnity commission income received on life assurance 
policies that may lapse in the two years following issue.  FINANCIALS

22. Provisions continued
Claims and litigation provisions comprise the amounts set aside to meet claims by customers below the level of any PI insurance excess, the 
estimation of IBNR claims and any amounts that might be payable as a result of any legal disputes. The provisions represent the directors’ best 
estimate of the Groups’ liability having taken professional advice. 
In addition to the claims provisions recognised, the Group also provides for future liabilities arising from claims incurred but not received (IBNR) 
for mortgage valuation reports and home buyer reports provided by the Surveying Services division. The basis for calculating this provision is 
outlined further in note 3, Critical accounting judgements and estimates. While there are many factors which determine the settlement date of any 
claims, the expected cash flows are estimated based on the average length of time it takes to settle claims in the past, which is around two years.
Other provisions mainly comprise items relating to the operational reorganisation including some business closure costs and some IT transition 
expenses which are expected to be utilised over the next five years. 
23. Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 21% (2012: 23%).

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused capital losses of £25,548,000 (2012: £28,003,000) and £20,323,000 
(2012: £22,250,000) in respect of non-trading loan relationships, and £449,000 in respect of trading losses (2012: £411,000). There is no 
expiry date attributable to these unrecognised deferred tax assets, but no assets have been recognised as there are currently no expectations 
of offsetting income streams arising, with the exception of the value noted below where an identical liability would also be recognised.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised in respect of the tax impact of the unrealised capital gain of £5,770,000 (2012: £2,995,000) 
arising from the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets because the unrecognised losses above, would offset any future gain. FINANCIALS

24. Post-employment benefits 
The Group offers membership of the Countrywide plc Pension Scheme to eligible employees, the only pension arrangements operated 
by the Group. The Scheme has two sections of membership: defined contribution and defined benefit. 
Defined contribution pension arrangements
The pensions cost for the defined contribution scheme in the year was £4,804,000 (2012: £4,064,000).
Defined benefit pension arrangements
In the past the Group offered a defined benefit pension arrangement, however, this was closed to new entrants in 1988 and subsequently closed 
to further service accrual at the end of 2003. Members of the defined benefit arrangements earned benefits linked to final pensionable salary 
and service at the date of retirement or date of leaving the scheme if earlier. The average duration of the defined benefit pension scheme is 16 years.
The defined benefit pension arrangements provide pension benefits to its members based on earnings at the date of leaving the scheme. 
Pensions in payment are updated in line with the minimum of 4% or retail price index (RPI) inflation. The Scheme is established and administered 
in the UK and ultimately overseen by the Pensions Ombudsman. The regulatory framework requires the Group to fund the scheme every three 
years and for the Group to agree the valuation with the trustees. As such, the funding arrangements will be reviewed at the next valuation 
(due at 5 April 2015). The Group is responsible for ensuring that pension arrangements are adequately funded and the directors have agreed 
a funding programme to bring down the deficit in the defined benefit scheme over the next five years. During the year, the Group paid 
£1.9 million (2012: £Nil) to the defined benefit scheme. During the year which commenced on 1 January 2014, the employer is expected 
to pay contributions of £1.9 million (2013: £1.9 million). Further contributions of £1.9 million will be made in each of the next five years.
The Group’s obligations under the pension arrangements are subject to inherent estimation uncertainty. While the trustees and actuary assess 
the value of the scheme assets, and the extent of the liabilities, they are obliged to make a number of assumptions, sensitivities to which are 
detailed later on. Furthermore, the scheme assets under defined benefit pension arrangements are exposed to risks in the equities and bond 
markets and similarly the liabilities can fluctuate according to gilt or corporate bond rate.
The Scheme assets under defined benefit pension arrangements are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long term pension 
liabilities to past and present employees. The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the Scheme’s beneficiaries and they take 
independent advice when deliberating matters relating to the Scheme.
The liabilities of the scheme under defined pension arrangements are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid 
out by the scheme using the projected unit method, which is an accrued benefits valuation method. 
The defined benefit liabilities set out in this note have been calculated by an independent actuary based on the results of the most recent full 
actuarial valuation at 5 April 2012, updated to 31 December 2013. The results of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below.
The Group immediately recognises the actuarial gains and losses directly in other comprehensive income as shown in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.

– Male pensioner non-member (age 45 now) 24.5 24.5
– Female pensioner non-member (age 45 now) 26.9 26.9
To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free 
investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio 
is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the 
target assets allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. 
Sensitivity analysis
The results of the calculations are sensitive to the assumptions used. The defined benefit obligation position revealed by IAS 19 calculations 
must be expected to be volatile, principally because the market value of the assets (with a significant exposure to equities) is being compared 
with a liability assessment derived from corporate bond yields. However, the Group has taken steps to mitigate these risks of asset volatility, 
including insuring some of the pensioners (as illustrated by the asset portfolio).
The sensitivity analyses (below) are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely 
to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity 
analysis did not change compared to those disclosed in the Listing Prospectus.

Capital reorganisation
On 21 December 2012 the Company issued 100 ordinary shares at £1 each to the initial shareholder 7Side Secretarial Limited. These shares were 
transferred to Jim Clarke on 28 December 2012 and subsequently redesignated and subdivided into 10,000 C shares on 19 February 2013.
On 18 March 2013 the Company issued 146,066,312 £1 A shares, 146,066,312 £0.01 B shares and 12,960,429 £0.01 C shares as consideration 
for the purchase of the entire share capital of Countrywide Holdings Ltd. Each A share is stapled to a B share.
The Company subsequently reorganised its share capital. Each A share and one B share together were redesignated as one ordinary share 
of £0.01 each and 100 deferred shares of £0.01 each. Furthermore, each C share was redesignated as 10,464,164 ordinary shares of £0.01 
and 2,496,265 deferred shares of £0.01 each.
As part of the capital reorganisation, on 19 March 2013 the Company reduced its share capital by cancelling all the deferred shares in issue 
resulting in share capital of £1,565,305 and this reduction was accounted for as a realised profit, giving rise to distributable reserves of 
£146,091,275.
On 25 March 2013 the Company issued 62,914,485 ordinary shares of £0.01 for consideration of £220 million.

Where the employee benefit trust purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are

26. Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes for executive directors and other employees, all of which are equity-settled. 
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle any of the options in cash. The total cost recognised in the income 
statement was £8,054,000 in the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: £Nil). Employer’s NI is being accrued, where applicable, at the rate 
of 13.8% which management expects to be the prevailing rate at the time the options are exercised, based on the share price at the reporting 
date. The total NI charge for the year was £1,710,000 (2012: £Nil).

A summary of the main features of each scheme is given below. The schemes have been split into two categories: executive schemes and other 
schemes. For further details on executive schemes, see the remuneration report on pages 44 to 56.
Executive schemes
Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
The LTIP is open to executive directors and designated senior management, and awards are made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Awards are subject to market and non-market performance criteria and vest over a three year period.
IPO plan
At the time of the flotation in March 2013, the Company nil cost share options to executive directors and designated senior management designed 
for the grant of one-off awards in recognition of the loss of rights under a management incentive package that terminated prior to, and as a result 
of, the flotation (the ‘MIP’).
IPO options granted to the executive directors become exercisable as follows: 50% on the second anniversary of the date of granting the IPO option 
and 50% on the third anniversary of the date of granting the IPO option. IPO options granted to other participants will normally become exercisable 
on the second anniversary of the date of granting the IPO option. The number of options that will vest is subject to the performance criterion 
based on EBITDA for 2014 as well as continued service.
Management incentive plan (MIP)
Certain members of the management team subscribed to the MIP, under whose terms senior management purchased shares in Countrywide 
Holdings, Ltd. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of shares granted to employees were treated as share-based payments. 
Due to the share exchange on 18 March 2013 and subsequent reorganisation which crystallised the number of C shares exchanged, the vesting 
period was accelerated.
Other schemes
Share incentive plan (SIP)
An HMRC approved share incentive plan was introduced in October 2013. Under the SIP, eligible employees are invited to make regular monthly 
contributions into a scheme operated by Capita. Ordinary shares in the Company are purchased at the current market price and an award of one 
matching share is made for every two shares acquired by an employee, subject to a vesting period of three years from the date of each monthly grant. FINANCIALS

As part of his appointment arrangements, Robert Davies was awarded £200,700 with an entitlement to purchases shares with an equivalent aggregate value, at the nominal per share value, 
prior to admission. To maintain the Chairman’s independence, the shares were not subject to any restrictions other than those attaching to ordinary shares held by shareholders or required by 
law. However, shortly after grant, the individual confirmed in writing that he did not intend to sell the shares prior to the second anniversary of admission. 
None of the schemes were exercisable at the year end.

On 1 October 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the equity share capital of Lambert Smith Hampton Group Limited, Lambert Smith Hampton Limited 
(LSH), Associated Employers Limited and several non-trading dormant companies within this group. LSH was acquired in accordance with the Group 
strategy to grow its Land & New Homes and Residential Development & Investment businesses and underpins the growth of the Group’s Land & New 
Homes businesses and estate agency opportunities driven by LSH’s pipeline of future mixed-use developments which include residential units. The 
stronger links between the residential and commercial activities will strengthen Countrywide’s businesses going forward and will contribute to the 
overall synergies anticipated which underpin the goodwill recognised. FINANCIALS

28. Acquisitions during the year continued
During 2013 the Group completed the purchase of 28 lettings businesses in accordance with a strategy to increase the Group’s footprint 
in under-represented geographical areas. The most significant lettings acquisitions were as follows: on 1 February the Group acquired 100% 
of the equity share capital of Russells Limited for consideration of £1.9 million; on 15 November 2013 the Group acquired the trade and 
assets of John German Limited for consideration of £2.1 million; and on 1 December 2013 the Group acquired 100% of the equity share 
capital of Fitz-Gibbon Limited for consideration of £2.7 million.
The acquired trade and other receivables for all acquired businesses are all current and their fair value is not materially different. Furthermore there are 
no contractual cash flows that are not expected to be collected. The goodwill recognised by the Group upon acquisition has no impact on tax deductions.
The costs of these acquisitions amounted to £890,000 (2012: £377,000) and have been written off to profit and loss (disclosed as an 
exceptional cost – see note 10).
29. Acquisitions during the prior year 
During the prior year the Group acquired Life and Easy Limited and 13 small lettings businesses. The total consideration paid was £13.1 million 
and goodwill recognised was £11.6 million. The pro-forma revenue and EBITDA generated by businesses in 2012 was £8.2 million and 
£2.3 million respectively.

33. Financial risk management 
Financial risk factors
The Group is exposed through its operations to one or more of the following financial risks: 
 Y
cash flow and fair value interest rate risk;
 Y
liquidity risk;
 Y
counterparty credit risk; and
 Y
price risk.
The policy for managing these risks is set by the Board following recommendations from the chief finance officer. Certain risks are managed 
centrally, while others are managed locally following guidelines communicated from the centre. The policy for each of the above risks is described 
in more detail below. 
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate 
risk which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The interest profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 
2013
£’000
2012
£’000
Floating rate assets 13,822 29,044
Fixed rate assets 22,503 17,500
Interest free assets 116,345 67,370
Total financial assets 152,670 113,914
Floating rate liabilities 73,040 —
Fixed rate liabilities 10,704 250,000
Interest free liabilities 83,229 45,655
Total financial liabilities 166,973 295,655
The average rate at which the fixed rate liabilities were fixed in 2013 was 3.59% (2012: 10%) and the average period for which the liabilities 
were fixed was 180 days (2012: 366 days). 
There is no material difference between the book and the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities. 
The interest payable on the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes was fixed; therefore, the Group was not exposed to the risk of cash flow risk arising 
from changes in the interest rates. The interest payable on the term loan facility is at variable rates.
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s liabilities secured on a floating basis which 
are managed on a central basis. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on the portion 
of liabilities exposed to the floating rates.

Liquidity risk 
The liquidity risk of each Group entity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function who monitor rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity 
requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs whilst maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities. 
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation of its operations and acquisition strategy. Acquisitions are carefully selected 
with authorisation limits operating up to Group Board level and cash payback periods as applied as part of the investment appraisal process. 
The Group is also cash generative as demonstrated by the cash from operations. The requirement to pay creditors is managed through future 
cash generation and, if required, revolving credit facility. 
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by daily cash reporting. This reporting considers maturity of both its financial investments 
and financial assets (e.g. trade receivables and other financial assets) and projected cash flows from operations. The Group’s objective 
is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility for potential acquisitions. 
All surplus cash held by the operating entities is transferred to Group treasury and managed centrally to maximise the returns on deposits 
through economies of scale. The type of cash instrument used and its maturity date will depend on the Group’s forecast cash requirements. 
The Group maintains an overdraft facility with a major banking corporation to manage any unexpected short term cash shortfalls. 
The Group has a £75 million term loan facility which incurs interest payments quarterly. The Group also has a £25 million revolving credit facility 
which provides additional liquidity resource. 
The Group’s discounted financial liabilities at the year end are as follows:
2013
£’000
2012
£’000
Trade payables 13,625 15,290

Counterparty credit risk continued 
The Group is exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of major new customers 
before entering contracts. The majority of customers use the Group’s services as part of a housing transaction and consequently the sales are 
paid from the proceeds of the house sale. The following table presents a breakdown of the gross trade receivables between the three main 
types of customer:

Major lenders 9,899 11,391
Other commercial customers 16,325 9,034
67,300 48,420
The Group treasury function manages the Group’s cash balances and seeks to achieve reasonable rates of interest, but preservation of the 
capital is the overriding priority. A list of accepted deposit institutions is maintained and their credit ratings are kept under review. The following 
table presents a breakdown of cash at bank and short term deposits (the rest of ‘cash and cash equivalents’ is cash in hand):

BA2 — 8,000
36,325 46,544 
Price risk
The group is exposed to price risk because of investments held by the Group and classified on the consolidated balance sheet as available-for-sale 
amounting to £42,877,000 (2012: £14,370,000). This investment is not held in a publicly traded company, but if the price used in the 2013 year-end 
valuation had increased/decreased by 5% the carrying value of the investment and the unrealised gain recorded within the statement of 
comprehensive income would have reduced by £2.1 million.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of debt (subject to certain restrictions under the term loan 
facility), adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The Group defines capital as the total of equity shareholders’ funds and long term borrowings net of available cash balances: 
2013
£’000
2012

Borrowings (note 20) 84,744 250,145

Shareholders’ equity 520,723 241,798
Total capital 569,142 445,399

During the year, the Group have complied with any capital restrictions and covenant requirements in respect of leverage and interest cover ratios 
associated with the term loan facility.

As noted in note 16(c), the fair value of the Zoopla shares was assessed at the year end by reference to the recent transaction price paid for 
additional shares purchased in December 2013 (by the Group and other shareholders in Zoopla). In addition, other valuation methods were 
used to support the valuation adopted: a discounted cash flow was prepared and an appropriate discount rate was applied to reflect the fact 
that there is no liquid market for these shares (which are also subject to pre-exemption rights and restrictions up to 2015); and a valuation 
using an earnings multiple was undertaken. The year-end valuation was reviewed in light of available data at 31 December 2013, and 
resulted in a £27.5 million uplift in valuation. 
As noted in note 19, the fair value of put options is undertaken using a discounted cash flow based on management’s expectation of 
performance of the underlying entities, consistent with operating plans approved.
These methods continue to be based on unobservable market data, and therefore there have been no changes in valuation techniques 
adopted in the year and no changes in fair value hierarchies as defined by IFRS 13.
The Group’s finance department performs the valuations of financial instruments measured at fair value required for financial reporting 
purposes, including Level 3 fair values. This team reports directly to the CFO and Audit Committee. FINANCIALS

With the exception of dividends and management fees, these transactions are trading relationships which are made at market value. The company 
has not made any provision for bad or doubtful debts in respect of related party debtors nor has any guarantee been given during 2013 
regarding related party transactions.
Prior to the IPO, Oaktree Capital Management and Apollo Management LP both owned in excess of 20% of the share capital of the Group. 
Following the IPO, each entity had a director on the board of the Company until Apollo Management LP divested their shareholding in the 
second half of 2013. 
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group incurred £359,000 (2012: £1,500,000) split equally between Apollo Management 
and Oaktree Capital Management, in respect of management fees. Following the IPO, management fees have not been incurred but fees 
have been payable in respect of each of the respective directors appointed to the Board at a rate of £40,000 per annum.
35. Events after the reporting period
During the first few weeks of the year the Group has acquired 6 businesses for £15.1 million. At the time of preparing these financial 
statements, management is in the process of assessing the impact of these acquisitions on the Group. 
The Group has also invested £7.0 million in the first rental property investment for our private residential sector portfolio.
The Group debt facility has also been restructured in February 2014, resulting in an increase in the facility and reduction in interest margins 
payable. For further details please refer to the group financial review within the strategic report. FINANCIALS

Report on the Parent Company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:
 Y
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013;
 Y
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 Y
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Parent Company financial statements, which are prepared by Countrywide plc, comprise:
 Y
the Parent Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2013; and
 Y
the notes to the Parent Company financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report rather than in the notes 
to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves obtaining 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
 Y
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’ s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
 Y
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 Y
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Countrywide Annual Report (the “Annual Report”) to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited Parent Company financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinions on matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 Y
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Parent Company financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Parent Company financial statements; and
 Y
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 Y
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 Y
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 Y
 the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law have 
not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
 Y
 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Parent Company financial statements; or
 Y
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Parent Company acquired in the course 
of performing our audit; or
 Y
 is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 58, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Other Matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Countrywide plc for the year ended 31 December 2013.

Notes to the Company financial statements
1. General information and accounting policies 
(a) Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of Countrywide plc (the ‘Company’) are presented, for the period from incorporation until 31 December 2013. 
They have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. The principal accounting policies are set out below and have been applied 
consistently throughout the period.
As permitted under Section 408 of the Act the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the period. The loss 
after tax for the period was £11,870,000. The results of the parent company are disclosed in the reserves reconciliation in note 9.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, and has not disclosed 
information required by the standard as the consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures 
for the Group under IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’ and not disclosed related party 
transactions with wholly owned subsidiary undertakings.
(b) Going concern 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the accounts.
(c) Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at historical cost less provision for impairment. The carrying values of investments are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
(d) Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the period presented comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner or realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
(e) Share-based payments
The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration to employees and directors is recognised through the profit and loss 
account. These are equity-settled and therefore the fair value is measured at the grant date. Where the share awards have non-market related 
performance criteria the Company has used the Binomial Lattice and Black Scholes option valuation models to establish the relevant fair values. 
Where the share awards have a TSR market related performance criteria the Company has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to 
establish the relevant fair values. The resulting values are amortised through the income statement over the vesting period of the options and 
other grants. For awards with non-market related criteria, the charge is reversed if it appears probable that the performance criteria will not be met.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, 
and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
(f) Dividend income
Dividend income from subsidiary undertakings is recognised at the point the dividend has been declared.
(g) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at 
a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the balance sheet. 
(h) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
(i) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium 
as a deduction from the proceeds. Where the employee benefit trust purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), 
the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity 
holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. FINANCIALS

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 
COUNTRYWIDE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
Forward-looking statements 
This report includes forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements can be identified by 
the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, ‘anticipates’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘may’, ‘will’ or ‘should’ or, in each 
case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical 
facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this report and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations 
concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, the industry in which we 
operate and potential acquisitions. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are 
based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the 
impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking 
statements are based upon information available to us on the date of this report. 
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may 
or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual 
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the development of the industry in which we operate and the effect of acquisitions on us 
may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. In addition, even if our results 
of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking 
statements contained in this report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. 
Important factors that could cause those differences include, but are not limited to: 
 Y
a decline in the number of transactions, prices or commission levels in the UK residential property market, whether due to the impact 
of macro-economic factors or otherwise; 
 Y
increased or reduced competition in the industry in which we operate; 
 Y
changes in, or our failure or inability to comply with, government laws or regulations; 
 Y
the loss of any of our important commercial relationships; and
 Y
any increase in our professional liabilities or any adverse development in the litigation or other disputes to which we are a party.
We caution you that the foregoing list of important factors may not contain all of the material factors that are important to you. We urge you 
to read the operating and financial review for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry 
in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events described in this report may not occur. 
We undertake no obligation, and do not expect, to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of 
new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting 
on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this report. SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

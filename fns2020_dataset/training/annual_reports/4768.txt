p1-19 tp Q6  8/4/08  12:17  Page 3 Results
The Group’s fourth year as a listed company has once
again been successful. We have delivered on all aspects 
of our strategy, which has been in place since ﬂotation.
Good performance from all divisions, supported by an
efﬁcient capital structure, has resulted in a 26 per cent
increase in underlying earnings per share (which excludes
proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets and non-recurring exceptional
items) to 33.4 pence per share (2006: 26.6 pence 
per share).
Basic earnings per share were 34.4 pence per share
(2006: 25.9 pence per share), an increase of 33 per cent.
The year ﬁnished on a high, with the Group entering the
FTSE 250 in December 2007.
Dividends
In October, an interim dividend of 3.33 pence per Ordinary
Share was paid in respect of proﬁts relating to 2007.
The Board has proposed that a ﬁnal dividend of 6.67
pence per Ordinary Share should be paid from proﬁts
generated in 2007. Subject to shareholder consent at 
the Annual General Meeting, this will be paid on 27 June 
2008 to members on the register at close of business 
on 6 June 2008. 
These dividends represent a 10 per cent increase year 
on year, continuing the pattern of progressive dividends
since ﬂotation.
The Board, management and people
One of Dignity’s key strengths is its people, who are all
focused on providing client service excellence in whatever
role they perform. According to our clients, our service
continues to be excellent, which taken with these operating
results demonstrates that commitment.
There were no changes to the Board in 2007 and I thank
my fellow Directors for their continued support. I am
delighted the Non-Executive Directors have agreed to
extend their commitment to work with the Group for 
a further two years.
Outlook for 2008
Given the success of our strategy so far, we plan that our
approach for 2008 will remain unchanged.
Trading in the ﬁrst eight weeks of 2008 has been strong
and the Group is well placed to deliver further growth in
this coming year.
Richard Connell, Chairman

Chairman’s statement
“We have delivered on all aspects of 
our strategy, which has been in place
since ﬂotation.”
p1-19 tp Q6  8/4/08  12:17  Page 4 Strong performance
Dignity’s stable and predictable business has once again
delivered strong growth in underlying operating proﬁts,
increasing 8 per cent to £47.6 million (2006: £44.1
million). Operating proﬁts increased 10 per cent to £47.7
million (2006: £43.4 million). Combined with our funding
strategy, this has delivered an excellent return for our
shareholders in the period.
Valuing our people
During the period, my fellow Executive Directors and I have
increased the number of visits to our funeral locations to
see at ﬁrst hand the quality of service being provided by
our staff. During each visit, we have spoken to colleagues
who are passionate about looking after each and every
family to the best of their ability. They truly are a credit 
to this business and we look forward to meeting other
colleagues in similar visits in 2008.
I am delighted that service excellence has been converted
into strong operating results. This enabled us to make a
discretionary bonus payment of £1.2 million to permanent
members of staff not covered by any other bonus scheme.
This equates to £600 for each full time employee and 
is an increase of 20 per cent over that paid in the 
previous period.
Furthermore, we continue to maintain our ﬁnal salary
pension scheme, keeping it open to new employees.
Following our £10.0 million lump sum contribution in
2006, the scheme shows a surplus within these ﬁnancial
statements of £6.8 million (2006: £0.6 million).
Investing in growth responsibly
Since ﬂotation, the Group has invested £35.9 million in
acquisitions of funeral businesses, representing 43 funeral
locations. This investment in quality businesses delivers
excellent returns for our shareholders and is a very
effective use of our excess operating cash. 
Similarly, £20.9 million has been invested in 224 hearses
and limousines and 436 other new vehicles in the last four
years, whilst £14.6 million of other capital expenditure has
been spent to improve the facilities at 169 locations. This
substantial investment is helping to provide our staff with
a better environment for delivering excellent client service.
The marketing of pre-arranged funeral plans also serves as
a signiﬁcant investment in the business, being a key driver
of incremental revenues for future periods. The Group
expects to carry out the funeral for the majority of these
sales, which in turn, through client service excellence 
and recommendations, will deliver further volumes going
forward. At the same time, these plans provide great peace
of mind to people in our communities, who know that
their affairs will be dealt with as they wish.
Our focus
The Group’s strategy is very clearly focused on growing
proﬁtability in a responsible and sustainable manner.
Underpinning this is a commitment to excellent client
service and recognition of the importance of balancing the
needs of our customers, our employees, our shareholders
and the communities in which we work. 
We satisfy the needs of all our stakeholders by staying
committed to both helping people through one of the
most difﬁcult times of their lives and to our strategy. 
These have remained consistent for many years. 
The remainder of this Annual Report describes in more
detail how this approach has translated into success in
each aspect of our business, whilst encompassing our
corporate and social responsibilities.

Chief Executive’s overview
“I am delighted that service 
excellence has been converted 
into strong operating results.”
Peter Hindley, Chief Executive
p1-19 tp Q6  8/4/08  12:17  Page 5 Introduction
The Group’s operations are managed across three main
areas, namely funeral services, crematoria and pre-
arranged funeral plans, which respectively represent 79
per cent, 16 per cent and 5 per cent of the Group’s
revenues. Funeral services revenues relate to the provision
of funerals and ancillary items such as memorials and
ﬂoral tributes. Crematoria revenues arise from cremation
services and the sale of memorials and burial plots at the
Group’s crematoria and cemeteries. Pre-arranged funeral
plan income represents amounts to cover the costs of
marketing and administering the sale of plans.
Ofﬁce for National Statistics data
Some of the Group’s key performance indicators rely 
on the total number of estimated deaths for each period. 
This information is obtained from the Ofﬁce for National
Statistics (ONS).
In April 2007, the ONS suspended the provision of 
this information, pending the implementation of a new
computerised births, marriages and deaths system.
In October 2007, provision of the information
recommenced. Historically, the estimates were updated 
by the ONS from time to time, with such results typically
ﬂuctuating by approximately one per cent. To maintain
consistency of its key performance indicators, the Group
has not amended its reporting for these changes in 
the past.
It is unclear at present whether the new computerised
system will cause similar or smaller differences between
the initial and ﬁnal published deaths in any period and
therefore it is unclear to what extent the 2007 estimates
are directly comparable to the 2006 estimates, which were
reported under the old system.
Nonetheless, the ﬁgures continue to give a good general
background to the Group’s performance.
The initial publication recorded total estimated deaths for
2007 of 553,000 (2006: 548,100).
Funeral services
The Group operates a network of 540 (2006: 521) funeral
locations throughout Britain, trading under local established
names. During the period, the Group conducted 66,500
funerals (2006: 66,500) representing approximately 12.0
per cent (2006: 12.1 per cent) of total estimated deaths 
in Britain.
Underlying operating proﬁts were £42.1 million (2006:
£39.3 million), an increase of 7.1 per cent. This reﬂects
the beneﬁt from increased spend per funeral and
continued cost control. Reported operating proﬁts were
£42.2 million (2006: £39.3 million), an increase of 
7.4 per cent.
2007 has been the busiest period for funeral acquisitions
since ﬂotation, with a total of £16.6 million being invested
in 21 funeral locations. All acquisitions matched the

Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
Client service excellence remains at the heart of our
strategy to grow the business and we recognise the
signiﬁcant part our people play in the Group’s
performance.
During 2007 we invested £16.6 million in acquiring
a further 21 funeral locations that complement the
key Dignity values of quality, tradition of service,
dedication and trust, further enhancing our
reputation in the marketplace. These acquisitions
add great value to the growing Dignity family 
of businesses.
Valuing our people and relationships…
p1-19 tp Q6  8/4/08  12:18  Page 7 Group’s criteria for investment and have complemented
the existing core business well with their geographical
locations and client service ethic.
The Group closed two (2006: six) unproﬁtable locations 
in the period.
The division has continued to beneﬁt from ﬁnancial
investment in the period to help maintain and improve 
the network. £4.9 million has been spent in the period 
to acquire 46 new hearses and limousines and 99 other
vehicles. Furthermore, the Group has spent £2.4 million 
on ongoing maintenance capital expenditure to refurbish
and improve 84 locations.
Client service
The Group has always been clear that client service
excellence is at the heart of our strategy for growth. Our
quality of client service is borne out in the responses to
the surveys that are sent out to each family we care for.
These results continue to demonstrate exceptional levels 
of service, with 98 per cent (2006: 98 per cent) of families
responding saying that they would either deﬁnitely or
probably recommend our services.
Maintaining this level of service is of key importance, given
that 75 per cent of the Group’s funeral business comes
from reputation and recommendation.
As a result, close monitoring of local survey results, regular
training and detailed procedures are in place to ensure
standards are maintained.
Crematoria
The Group operates 22 crematoria and performed 38,900
cremations (2006: 38,500) in the period. This market
share of 7.0 per cent (2006: 7.0 per cent) reﬂects the
Group’s position as the largest single operator of crematoria
in Britain. The market share in 2007 includes approximately
500 additional cremations at two locations following the
temporary closure of a nearby local authority crematorium.
Revenues of £25.7 million (2006: £23.2 million) have
resulted in operating proﬁts of £14.0 million (2006: 
£12.1 million), an increase of 15.7 per cent. This reﬂects
an improved performance in memorial sales following
detailed training and focus in the period. This programme
of training continues into 2008. 
During the period, the Group opened new memorial areas
at its locations in South London and Crawley, at a cost of
£0.5 million. These developments will in time hold many
commemorative memorials and provide space for quiet
contemplation when families visit in the following years 
to remember their loved ones.
In addition to this investment, the Group has spent 
£0.7 million improving the facilities at its 22 locations.
98% 
98 per cent of families say that

Improving our facilities and services…
The needs of families are at the centre of everything
we do. This year we have opened two new memorial
gardens at our crematoria, including a four acre
memorial garden at Surrey and Sussex Crematorium 
in Crawley. 
We continue to invest in improving our facilities 
and providing more choice for families and as part 
of this we have refurbished 84 funeral locations. 
Recognising the needs of the whole community, 
we held our ﬁrst ever memorial service for 
Hindu families in London.
p1-19 tp Q6  8/4/08  12:18  Page 9 Pre-arranged funeral plans
The Group continues to be the market leader in this area.
Unfulﬁlled pre-arranged funeral plans were 197,300 at the
end of the period (2006: 188,800). These plans represent
future incremental business for the funeral division, as the
Group expects to perform the majority of these funerals. 
On 8 January 2007, the Group acquired the minority
interest in Advance Planning Limited from Age Concern
Enterprises Limited (ACEnt). As part of this arrangement,
the Group has a 10-year marketing agreement in place
with ACEnt to provide pre-arranged funeral plans using the
Age Concern brand during this time. This is an excellent
development, as this route to market has proved to be
successful in the past.
In order to grow this part of the business, our focus has
been on two distinct areas; developing the Dignity Funeral
Plan endorsed by the actor Christopher Timothy and
developing marketing and distribution relationships with
further reputable afﬁnity partners. In both cases, successful
tests lead us to expect further progress in 2008.
Head ofﬁce 
Head ofﬁce costs relate to central services that are not
speciﬁcally attributed to a particular operational division.
These include the provision of IT, ﬁnance, personnel and
Directors’ emoluments. In addition, the Group records the
costs of incentive bonus arrangements such as Long Term
Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and management incentives for 95
managers across all divisions within this segment.
Costs in the period were £10.9 million (2006: £9.7
million), an increase of 12.4 per cent. This primarily
reﬂects the increased pay-out of bonus arrangements 
and a payment to a former director in lieu of notice.
Investment for the future 
Acquisition activity in funeral services has continued 
in the ﬁrst quarter of 2008, with a further six funeral
locations being acquired for a total consideration of £4.4
million. Consistent application of our acquisition criteria
will continue, ensuring only well established, respected
businesses are acquired that will contribute to the future
growth of the Group.
The Group continues to seek opportunities with local
authorities to manage their crematoria and cemeteries. 
We continue to be the preferred bidder for Rotherham
Metropolitan Borough Council’s crematorium and
cemeteries and anticipate legal completion in the 
second quarter of 2008.
In the pre-arranged funeral plan division, testing of various
opportunities continues, each focused on the overall goal
of increasing the number of unfulﬁlled pre-arranged
funeral plans.

we have already helped over 300,000 people plan and
pay for their funerals in advance.  
Our pre-paid funeral plans continue to grow and as
part of our ongoing commitment to delivering client
service excellence we invest in training and support 
of our staff to ensure that we are able to best meet 
the needs of our customers and where appropriate, 
we look to explore and develop new opportunities 
to market our plans with other added-value

p1-19 tp Q6  8/4/08  12:18  Page 11 Introduction
The Group is committed to integrating corporate and social
responsibility into all areas of the business. We recognise
the importance of balancing the needs of our customers,
our shareholders, our employees and the communities in
which we work. This is central to the service we provide 
to our clients and is reﬂected in our business policies 
and procedures. The Group also believes in creating 
the appropriate culture for our staff, who are the most
important asset of the business. We aim to achieve our
business objectives in a caring and responsible manner
recognising the economic, social and environmental 
impact of our activities.
Richard Portman, the Corporate Services Director, is 
the Board member responsible for corporate and social
responsibility. It is his responsibility to identify key impacts
and report to the Board on such matters.
In our communities
Making a difference to the local communities we 
serve is at the heart of everything we do. Dignity staff are
extremely committed to this ethos and support hundreds
of local activities every year. From organising fundraising
events for national charities to helping out at local church
fêtes, our staff give a large amount of their time to help
good causes and charities. 
By listening to and understanding the needs of local
communities our staff are able to provide help where 
it is really needed. 
For example, Zealley Funeral Service in Newton Abbott,
Devon provides ofﬁce space at no charge to their local
CRUSE Bereavement counselling charity providing a
valuable service to the local community and a useful
resource to the charity. Blackburn’s Funeral Service 
of Broadstairs, Kent arranged a summer outing for
residents of a local nursing home, enjoying ﬁsh and 
chips at the seaside.
In Scotland, branches came together to raise over £8,000
at a charity dinner and dance. Daredevils from E F Edwards
of Erdington in Birmingham raised £250 for The Stroke
Association by abseiling 125ft down the side of Good Hope
Hospital in Sutton Coldﬁeld. 
At Dignity, we believe in supporting our staff every step 
of the way and provide advice and support for those who
want to give something back to their local community.
Supporting charities
As part of our commitment to local communities, staff
also raise thousands of pounds every year for national and
local charities of their choosing. 
At the beginning of March 2007, we presented a cheque 
to World Vision for £50,000. This marked the end of 
our successful national charity campaign to support
communities in Sri Lanka, affected by the 2005 Boxing 
Day Tsunami. 
Following the success of the Tsunami Appeal, the
opportunity to run another annual charity campaign 
was put to Dignity employees. Three staff favourites were
identiﬁed for the mantle of Charity of the Year; British
Heart Foundation; Guide Dogs for the Blind and Help the
Hospices, the ﬁnal selection was put to a staff ballot.
Nearly 1,000 staff took part in the ballot and 43 per cent 
of those responding voted for Help the Hospices as our
Charity of the Year 2008.
Our four charity fairground organs are provided for 
use by local charities. In 2007 the four organs helped to 
raise over £130,000 during the year for a variety of good
causes, church halls and community centres, hospices for
children and adults, care homes and national charity
partners. This is the highest annual total amount ever
raised by the charity organs.
Environment
As in previous years, our business continues to 
have a low environmental impact and its activities are 
not expected to give rise to any signiﬁcant environmental 
risk over the next 12 months.
Maintaining the quality of the environment in which we 
all live is an important concern for the Group. All areas 
of the business operate in accordance with the Group’s
Environmental Policy. We recognise the impact of our
operations on the environment and our aim is to reduce
this impact and to operate in an environmentally
responsible manner.
At our cofﬁn manufacturing facility in East Yorkshire, all
wood waste from the manufacture of cofﬁns is used to 
heat the factory. A signiﬁcant and increasing proportion 
of packaging which cofﬁns are packed in for transit to our
funeral locations is now returned to the factory for re-use.
As this is done when the next delivery is made, there is no
increase in the use of vehicles or emissions to achieve this.

Recognising our role and responsibilities
We are committed to achieving our strategic
objectives and integrating corporate and social
responsibility into all areas of our business. We
recognise the importance of balancing the needs 
of our customers, our shareholders, our employees
and the communities in which we work.
We aim to achieve our business objectives in a
caring and responsible manner recognising the
economic, social and environmental impact of 
our activities.
Throughout the year our staff participate in many
fundraising activities, raising thousands of pounds
for national and local charities.
p1-19 tp Q6  8/4/08  12:18  Page 13 All our raw materials are sourced from well-managed 
and sustainable sources, the majority of whom have Forest
Stewardship Council (FSC) accreditation. All promotional
literature produced and despatched by the pre-arranged
funeral plan division is printed on paper with FSC Mixed
Sources accreditation.
At our head ofﬁce in Sutton Coldﬁeld paper and card
recycling policies have been successfully introduced,
leading to the introduction of can and bottle recycling 
on the premises thus cutting waste by over half. 
A recycling mission statement has been developed 
and will be rolled out to all locations in 2008.
The Group and its employees undertake to act whenever
necessary to meet or exceed the standards of current
environmental legislation and continue to review the
policies, systems and services to this end. All waste
generated is properly disposed of in accordance with
current legislation and steps are taken to recycle waste
wherever practical.
Health and Safety
Effective heath and safety management is critical 
to the Group and is a key priority of the Directors. Its
operations are conducted at all times in such a way as 
to ensure, as far as is reasonably practical, the health,
safety and welfare of all of our employees and all persons
who may be attending our premises.
The Group is committed to the prevention of accidents 
and regularly reviews and updates procedures and training
to ensure that staff minimise any risks associated with 
their tasks. During 2007, we produced and issued policies
on smoking, pregnancy and distance driving to ensure 
that our employees understood their responsibilities and 
to keep them safe. This adds to the range of policies the
Group has already created covering health and safety.
For our staff involved in the preparation of the deceased, 
a training and assessment programme has been developed
and rolled out during the period. By the end of 2007, the
majority of embalmers had been successfully assessed 
and further training and assessment is continuing. 
The Group has a full time dedicated Health and Safety
Manager who is supported by a network of co-ordinators
who are based and work in all areas of the business. In
addition there are two other full time members of staff 
in the health and safety team. They are both qualiﬁed
embalmers and have conducted the assessment of
embalmers and the vaccination programme. Their roles 
will be broadened in 2008 to include all health and safety
matters thus strengthening the overall team in this area.
Supporting our staff
Our employees are critical in the continued success 
of the Group. We are committed to high standards of
employment practice and aim to encourage and develop
successful employees.
The Group provides direct support to employees through
both in-house training and external training courses. Such
external training includes both relevant job training and
tutoring for professional qualiﬁcations. These professional
qualiﬁcations include the National Association of Funeral
Directors (NAFD) Diploma and Membership of the British
Institute of Embalmers (BIE). In addition, the Group has
three members of staff who are qualiﬁed to act as tutors 
for the NAFD Diploma and two members of staff who are
accredited BIE tutor.
Furthermore, the Group supported staff development and
welfare through its Welfare Trust. The Welfare Trust provides
funds for staff for professional training and hardship grants.
The Trust has approximately £2.1 million of funds available
for use in the future.
The Group publishes a quarterly in-house magazine
‘Dignity Express’ which is supplemented by monthly 
news bulletins to keep all employees informed of what is
happening in the Group. Copies of ‘Dignity Express’ are
further provided to employees who have retired from the
Group. In addition, the Group has developed a dedicated
employee website which contains news, useful information
and background on the Group.

Financial review
“Underlying earnings per share 
were 33.4 pence, an increase of 
26 per cent.”
Mike McCollum, Finance Director
The market conditions in which the Group operates and 
its trading performance during the 52 week period ended
28 December 2007 are described in the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Overview and the 
Business Review. 
Financial highlights
Increase
2007 2006 %
Revenue (£million) 159.5 149.8 6
Underlying operating proﬁt* (£million) 47.6 44.1 8
Underlying proﬁt before tax* (£million) 30.1 27.9 8

operations* (£million) 57.5 51.7 11

Interim dividend (pence) 3.33 3.03 10
Final dividend (pence) 6.06 – n/a
*Underlying amounts exclude proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets and 
exceptional items.
The Board has proposed a dividend of 6.67 pence per
Ordinary Share as a ﬁnal distribution of proﬁts relating 
to 2007. This brings the total dividend in respect of 2007
to 10 pence per share, an increase of 10 per cent.
Capital structure and ﬁnancing
The Group’s only external long term debt ﬁnancing is the
Class A and B Secured Notes, rated A and BBB respectively.
The Board considers that maintaining a leveraged balance
sheet is appropriate for the Group, given the highly stable
and predictable nature of its cash ﬂows. This has the
beneﬁt of maximising shareholder returns, whilst leaving
sufﬁcient ﬂexibility to invest in the growth of the business.
The Board is of the opinion that the following provides
additional indicative information regarding the net debt
position of the Group: 
28 December 29 December
2007 2006
£m £m
Net amounts owing on Class A and B 
Secured Notes per ﬁnancial statements (267.0) (268.4)
Add: unamortised issue costs (17.2) (18.6)
Gross amounts owing (284.2) (287.0)
Accrued interest on Class A and B 
Secured Notes (paid 31 December 2007) (9.9) –
Cash and cash equivalents 52.6 41.4
Net debt (241.5) (245.6)
The Group’s ﬁnance expense substantially consists of the
interest on the Class A and B Secured Notes and ancillary
instruments. The principal and interest on the Secured
Notes amortise fully over their life and are completely
repaid by 2031. The interest rate is ﬁxed for the life of 
the Secured Notes and interest is calculated on the
outstanding principal. The net ﬁnance charge in the period
relating to these instruments was £20.1 million (2006:
£19.4 million). This year on year increase reﬂects the
Secured Notes issued in February 2006 only incurring
interest since issue in 2006 and for a full 52 week period
in 2007.
Other ongoing ﬁnance costs incurred in the period
amounted to £0.8 million (2006: £1.0 million), including
the unwinding of discounts on the Group’s provisions and
other ﬁnancial liabilities.
Interest receivable on bank deposits was £2.7 million
(2006: £4.0 million). Interest receivable in 2006 was
greater due to the £90.0 million proceeds of the debt issue
in 2006, which were retained in cash for approximately 
six months before being returned to shareholders and
used to pay a £10.0 million contribution to the Group’s
pension scheme.
This contribution to the pension scheme has helped to
improve its position, demonstrated by the £0.7 million
(2006: £nil) of net ﬁnance income. No signiﬁcant interest
was earned on the debenture loan (2006: £0.2 million)
following its repayment during the period.

Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
Underlying proﬁt after tax 
The Board believes that whilst statutory reporting
measures provide a useful indication of the ﬁnancial
performance of the Group, additional insight is gained 
by excluding certain non-recurring or non-trading
transactions. Accordingly, the following information 
is presented to aid understanding of the performance 
of the Group:
52 week period 52 week period
ended ended
28 December 29 December
2007 2006
£m £m
Operating proﬁt for the
period as reported 47.7 43.4

Exceptional costs of redemption of B shares – 0.7
Proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets (0.1) –

Net ﬁnance charges (17.5) (16.2)
Underlying proﬁt before tax 30.1 27.9
Tax charge on underlying proﬁt before tax (9.1) (8.6)
Underlying proﬁt after tax 21.0 19.3
Weighted average number of Ordinary 
Shares in issue during the period (million) 62.8 72.6
Underlying EPS (pence) 33.4p 26.6p
Increase in underlying EPS (per cent) 26
Earnings per share 
The Group’s earnings were £21.6 million (2006: £18.8
million). Basic earnings per share were 34.4 pence per
share (2006: 25.9 pence per share).
However, the Group’s reported earnings include the 
£0.5 million one off beneﬁt for taxation described later in
this review and £0.1 million proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets.
Consequently, the Group’s underlying proﬁt after tax was
£21.0 million (2006: £19.3 million), giving underlying
earnings per share of 33.4 pence per share (2006: 26.6
pence per share), an increase of 26 per cent.
This increase demonstrates the strong operating performance
combined with a 13 per cent reduction in the weighted
average number of shares in issue. This reduction was 
a combination of two factors.
The principal factor is the result of what was effectively 
a share buy back programme, made possible by the issue
of Secured Notes and return of value of £1 per share 
(£80 million) in August 2006.
Secondly, the ﬁrst Save As You Earn (SAYE) and Long Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP) Schemes introduced in 2004, the 
year of ﬂotation, matured. This resulted in 1.0 million new
Ordinary Shares being issued at various points during the
period. Consequently, the weighted average number of
shares was 62.8 million in the period, compared to 
72.6 million in the previous period.
Cash ﬂow and cash balances
Cash generated from operations before exceptional items
was £57.5 million (2006: £51.7 million). This increase in
cash generation is more than the equivalent increase in
operating proﬁts before depreciation. This demonstrates
that the Group’s operations convert trading activities to
cash efﬁciently, with effective working capital management
also positively impacting the position. 
A busy year for acquisitions witnessed £16.6 million
(2006: £7.3 million) being spent on funeral acquisitions,
with a further £2.0 million (2006: £nil million) being
incurred in the period to acquire the minority interest 
in Advance Planning Limited. 
Capital expenditure increased year on year, with £8.5
million (2006: £8.0 million) being spent principally on
replacing older vehicles in the Group’s ﬂeet in line with 
a planned replacement programme and improvements 
to the Group’s premises and plant.
During the period, the Group’s £1.0 million debenture loan
to KCH Repatriation Limited was repaid. In addition, £1.5
million was received in exchange for new Ordinary Shares
following the completion of the Group’s ﬁrst SAYE scheme.
The Group also made a ﬁnal dividend payment in the
period totalling £3.8 million. No separate ﬁnal dividend
was paid in 2006, as a result of the £1 per share return 
of value in August 2006.
Cash balances at the end of the period were £52.6 million.
£12.4 million represents amounts legally set aside to fund
the Group’s liabilities to Class A and B Secured Noteholders.
This payment was due on 31 December 2007, the ﬁrst day
of the Group’s 2008 trading period as it reports on a 52

week basis rather than on a calendar year. These funds 
do not qualify as cash or cash equivalents for the purposes
of IAS 7, Cash Flow Statements. Accordingly, £10.2 million
has been reported within the cash ﬂow statement as
‘Payments to restricted bank accounts for ﬁnance charges’
and £2.2 million has  been reported as ‘Payments to
restricted bank accounts for repayment of borrowings’.
£21.5 million of the remainder has been set aside for
acquisitions, of which £4.4 million has been used since the
balance sheet date. £10.6 million has also been set aside
for future corporation tax and dividend payments. However,
these funds could be used for further acquisitions if suitable
opportunities arose, with statutory payments being funded
out of future operating cash ﬂows.
Full details and analysis of the Group’s cash balances 
are included in note 15 to the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements.
Taxation
In June 2007, legislation was passed conﬁrming that the
rate of corporation tax would reduce from 30 per cent 
to 28 per cent from 1 April 2008. As a result, the Group
recognised exceptional tax income of £0.5 million through
its income statement to reﬂect the one off reduction in the
period of the Group’s deferred tax position.
This also had the effect of reducing the Group’s effective
tax rate (excluding the non-recurring adjustment) to 
30 per cent in 2007, compared to 31 per cent in the 
previous period.
The Group anticipates its effective tax rate will transition 
to 29 per cent in the 2009 ﬁnancial period and beyond
following these legislative changes.
The latest Budget Report was issued on 12 March 
2008, the day before the release of this Annual Report.
Accordingly, it is too early to have completed any detailed
analysis on any new proposals announced by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer. The Group will make appropriate
announcements in due course as required by the Listing
Rules if any aspect is considered to have a material effect
on the Group’s earnings.
However, further legislation is anticipated in respect 
of Industrial Buildings Allowances. If this is substantially
enacted in the form expected in 2008, then this will result
in a one off charge to the income statement of £0.5 million.
Key performance indicators
The Group uses a number of performance indicators to
both manage the business and ensure that the Group’s
strategy and objectives are being delivered.

subsidiaries for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair
view of the state of the affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
The Directors are required to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the Company and Group will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been applied consistently, as explained in note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements. They also confirm that reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates have been
made in preparing the financial statements for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 and that applicable
accounting standards have been followed.
The Directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that as far as each Director is aware there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s
auditors are unaware. The Directors further confirm each of them have taken all steps that they ought to have done as
Directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are
aware of that information.
The maintenance and integrity of the Dignity plc websites are the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out
by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility
for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the Dignity
plc investor website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Principal activities and business review 
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of funeral services including funeral directing, crematoria operation
and the marketing and administration of pre–arranged funeral plans. The principal activity of the Company is that of a
holding company.
The principal activities and key performance indicators of the Group are also described on pages 15 to 17 of the
Financial Review, which is incorporated into this Directors’ Report by reference. A review of the development of the
business in 2007, events affecting the Group since the end of the year and likely future developments are referred to
in the Business Review. The review of business activities in the Business Review and Financial Review are in line with
the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
Risks and uncertainties
Operational and financial risks are considered in the Business Review and the Financial Review.
The Group’s principal operational risks are a significant reduction in the death rate and nationwide adverse publicity,
which could affect the Group’s market share.
However, the profile of deaths has historically followed a similar profile to that predicted by the ONS, giving the Group
the ability to plan its business accordingly. Adverse publicity is addressed by ensuring appropriate policies and
procedures are in place to ensure client service excellence.
An assessment of the Group’s exposure to financial risks and a description of how these risks are managed are
included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

The issued share capital of Dignity plc at 28 December 2007 consists of 63,240,971 Ordinary Shares of 9 pence each.
All the Ordinary Shares carry the same rights and obligations. There are no other class or type of share in issue.
During the period the Group issued 1,016,832 Ordinary Shares of 9 pence each. 368,806 Ordinary Shares of 9 pence
each were issued to satisfy Long Term Incentive Plan share options exercised in the period and 648,026 shares issued
to satisfy options exercised under the Save As You Earn Scheme. Both lots of options were granted in 2004.
A special resolution passed at the last Annual General Meeting on 8 June 2007 gives Dignity plc the authority to
purchase up to 3,111,111 Ordinary Shares of 9 pence each at not less than nominal value and not more than
5 per cent above the average middle market quotation for the preceding 5 business days. At the same meeting the
Company was also given authority to allot Ordinary Shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,120,000 of which
up to £280,000 may be for cash. These authorities will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting

General Meeting.
Results
The results for the period are set out in the Consolidated Income Statement on page 36. Group profit before tax
amounted to £30.2 million (2006: £27.2 million).
Dividends
An interim dividend of 3.33 pence per share was paid on 26 October 2007. The Board has declared a final dividend 
of 6.67 pence per share, which subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 27 June 2008 to
shareholders on the register at 6 June 2008. This makes a total of 10 pence per share for the period.
Payments policy
The Group has no formal code or standard that deals specifically with the payment of suppliers. However, the Group’s
policy on the payment of all creditors is to ensure that the terms of payment as specified by, and agreed with, the
supplier are not exceeded, provided all trading terms and conditions have been complied with. The average creditor
payment period for the Group was 31 days (2006: 31 days). The Company has no trade creditors.
Employment policies
During the period the Group has maintained its obligations to develop and improve arrangements aimed at involving
employees in its affairs. Methods of communication used include an in–house newsletter, an employee website,
bulletins and management briefings. This is discussed in more detail in the Corporate and Social Responsibility
Report on pages 12 to 14.
Employment policies are designed to provide equal opportunities irrespective of age, sexuality, colour, ethnic or
national origin, religion, nationality, sex or marital status. Full consideration is given to the employment, training and
career development of disabled persons subject only to their aptitudes and abilities. The Group makes every effort to
treat disabled persons equally with others.
Directors and their interests
Details of the Directors of the Company who served during the period are shown in the Report on Directors’
Remuneration on page 26. In accordance with the Articles of Association, at the Annual General Meeting, Mike
McCollum and James Newman retire as Directors of the Company and, being eligible, offer themselves for re–election
at the Annual General Meeting on 6 June 2008.
During the period, the Company maintained liability insurance for its Directors and Officers. The Directors of each of
the Company’s subsidiaries, have the benefit of an indemnity provision in the Company’s Articles of Association. The
indemnity provision, which is a qualifying third–party indemnity provision as defined by section 234 of the Companies
Act 2006, was in force throughout the period and is currently in force.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 12 March 2008, the Company had been notified of the following interests of 3 per cent or more of the issued
share capital:
Holder Number of Ordinary Shares Percentage of issued share capital
Lloyds TSB Group plc 5,732,622 9.01%

The takeover directive
The Group has one class of share capital, Ordinary Shares. All of the shares rank pari passu. There are no special
control rights in relation to the Group’s shares. The rules governing the appointment and replacement of Board
members and changes to the Articles of Association accord with usual English company law provisions. The Board has
authority to purchase its own shares and is seeking renewal of that power at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting
within the limits set out in the notice of that meeting. There are no significant agreements to which the Group is party
which take effect, alter or terminate in the event of change of control of the Group.
Health and safety policy
The Group’s operations are executed at all times in such a way as to ensure, so far as reasonably practical, the health,
safety and welfare of all of our employees and all other persons who may be attending our premises. This is discussed
in the Corporate and Social Responsibility Report on pages 12 to 14.

Directors’ report continued
MAC_RF63322_A  8/4/08  08:18  Page 22 This report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the Group in respect of the Executive Directors, together with
disclosures on all Directors’ remuneration. The auditors are required to report on the ‘auditable’ part of this report
and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006.
The Board has reviewed the Group’s compliance with the 2006 Combined Code (‘the Code’) on remuneration related
matters and has followed the Code in the preparation of the report of the Remuneration Committee. It is the opinion
of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the period except that,
the annual bonus awarded to the Chief Executive is pensionable. He is however not a member of the Group pension
scheme and maintains his own personal pension scheme. As a consequence there is no impact on the Group’s
pension scheme.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior
management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
Bill Forrester chairs the Remuneration Committee and its other members are James Newman and the Non–Executive
Chairman, Richard Connell. The Code requires that a Group of this size has a Remuneration Committee with a
minimum of two members. The Chairman is specifically excluded from discussions regarding his remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters
to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day–to–day involvement in
running the business.
The Chief Executive attended Remuneration Committee meetings when required and Richard Portman attended
meetings as Company Secretary and hence Secretary to the Remuneration Committee. No Executive Director takes
part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference. A copy of the terms of reference
is available for inspection on the Group’s investor website www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk. The Committee met five times
during 2007. At those meetings basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers were reviewed, the targets
and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for directors were also agreed as were options granted under
the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The meetings also approved the payment of the 2006 performance
related bonus and the vesting of the options granted under the LTIP scheme in 2004.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee’s policy has been to progressively set the main elements of the Executive Directors’
remuneration at the following quartiles in comparison to a comparable group of companies (‘the Comparator Group’):
• Basic salary – median.
• Annual bonus potential – median to upper quartile.
• Share incentives – median to upper quartile.
• Total compensation – median to upper quartile.
The Comparator Group is a group of 20 companies with similar corporate attributes to the Group such as market
capitalisation, turnover and number of employees. However, since the Group was promoted to the FTSE 250 in
December 2007 and given the lack of any clear peer group, it is the intention of the Committee to, in the future,
set the elements of the remuneration package by reference to the constituent companies of the bottom half of the
FTSE 250.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will:
• Motivate and encourage superior performance;
• Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy;
• Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management; and
• Align rewards with the interests of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this policy will retain and develop further the Group’s entrepreneurial
culture whilst also focusing executive remuneration on performance, which the Committee believes will best serve
shareholders’ interests. It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior
performance by Executive Directors with that performance being based on the measurable delivery of strong financial
performance and returns to shareholders. This is achieved by weighting the overall remuneration package towards
achievement of that performance. Only 31 per cent of each Executive Directors’ total remuneration package (ignoring
benefits and pension contributions) is accounted for by basic salary assuming a full annual related bonus is achieved
and a maximum conditional award under the LTIP is made.

Report on Directors’ remuneration
for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007
MAC_RF63322_A  8/4/08  08:18  Page 23 The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the policy on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the
Group’s objectives and shareholders’ interests.
Basic salary
No significant changes were made to the Executive Directors’ basic salaries during the period. Available market
information and Comparator Group information was reviewed during the period to ensure that basic salaries remained
appropriate and competitive given the roles and responsibilities of each individual Director.
When determining the basic salary of the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration:
• The levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of
broadly similar size and complexity;
• The performance of the individual Executive Director;
• The individual Executive Director’s experience and responsibilities; and
• Pay and conditions throughout the Group.
Annual performance related bonus
The Committee’s policy during the period was to set the maximum annual bonus potential for Executive Directors
between the median and the upper quartile in relation to the Comparator Group.
The targets for the year, which are based on the achievement of set earnings per share targets, are reviewed and set
annually by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and remain challenging.
They are ratified by the full Board. The targets are designed to enhance shareholder value.
The maximum bonus attainable for 2007 by Executive Directors was 100 per cent of basic salary. A bonus of
70 per cent is attainable for meeting the first earnings per share target set by the Committee and a further bonus of
30 per cent may be earned by achieving a second and more demanding earnings per share target. The increase in
underlying earnings per share during the period was 26 per cent and the bonus percentage earned by the Executive
Directors in the period was 100 per cent.
No other bonuses of any description were paid in the period to Executive Directors.
Share incentives
Shareholders approved the current discretionary share incentive plan, the LTIP on 31 March 2004 prior to admission
to the London Stock Exchange on 8 April 2004.
If existing LTIP’s were to be amended or if there was a new LTIP Scheme, approval would be sought from the
shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee reviews awards each year to Executive Directors at the median to upper quartile level
compared to the Comparator Group.
All Executive Directors and other employees are entitled to be considered for the grant of conditional share awards
under the LTIP . Under the rules, the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 125 per cent of
salary. All four Executive Directors, serving at the start of the year, were granted conditional share awards during
2007 equivalent to the maximum award. The Committee deemed this award appropriate, as in previous years,
mindful of the need to encourage superior performance from the Executive Directors and ensure that a significant
proportion of their total remuneration is linked to the performance of the Group. This award is in addition to those
granted in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Richard Portman, prior to his appointment to the Board, received a conditional
share award in 2006 equal to 100 per cent of his salary. Total awards made to the Executive Directors under the
scheme are shown on page 28.
Eligible Executives are awarded rights, in the form of nil cost conditional share awards, to acquire a maximum
number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the
end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee
at the time the allocation is made, are satisfied.
The Remuneration Committee selected comparative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) as the performance condition for
LTIP awards as it ensures that the Group outperform the FTSE 350 Index over the measurement period in delivering
shareholder value, before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions. The
constituent companies of the FTSE 350 Index, at the time the awards are made, were selected as a benchmark as
there are no directly comparable quoted companies in the UK and the ‘enterprise value’ of the Group (debt plus
equity) gives it a comparative value to FTSE 350 companies. The Remuneration Committee will calculate the TSR in
accordance with the rules of the scheme and ratify the calculation prior to the release of any award. Performance
conditions under the LTIP are not subject to re–testing.

Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007
MAC_RF63322_A  8/4/08  08:18  Page 24 The percentage of the conditional share award exercisable or vesting is calculated as follows:
• Ranked in the top quintile: 100 per cent of the total award.
• Ranked at median: 40 per cent of the total award.
• Ranked below median: zero.
• Ranked between median and top quintile: straight–line apportionment.
The Remuneration Committee has set the percentage of conditional awards exercisable at 40 per cent for median
performance. This is based on the Committee’s assessment of an appropriate and necessary award for achieving 
such a performance after considering all elements of the total remuneration package.
In addition and irrespective of the TSR performance target, no award will vest unless in the opinion of the
Remuneration Committee the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory over the
measurement period.
The graph shows the Group’s TSR compared to the FTSE 350. This gives a broad indication of the likelihood of any
conditional award vesting.
On 8 April 2007 the conditional share awards made in 2004 under the LTIP became capable of vesting. The TSR of
the Group over the measurement period was compared to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 350 at the
time the awards were made. The performance of the Group was found to be in the top quintile. On that basis the
Remuneration Committee, mindful also of the continued strong performance of the Group, recommended that the
entire 2004 share award vest and be issued to the relevant Directors. The shares were issued to the Directors on
11 April 2007 and sold in their entirety the following day by the Group’s brokers.
The total conditional awards held by each Director are shown on page 28 in the section of the Remuneration
Committee’s Report that is subject to audit.
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Group can issue a maximum of 10 per cent of its issued share capital in 
a rolling ten year period to employees under all share plans. In addition, of this 10 per cent, the Company can only
issue 5 per cent to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans. At the period end, conditional awards under
the LTIP Scheme to Executive Directors and senior managers amount to 1.28 per cent of the current issued share
capital. If the awards made in 2004, that have just vested, are included that percentage is 1.87 per cent. The total
including SAYE options granted in both the 2004 and 2007 Schemes is 3.36 per cent.
Pensions
The Group provides Peter Hindley with a contribution to his personal pension plan of 10 per cent of his salary and 
any bonus payable. As this is a personal pension plan any pension contributions paid on a bonus do not affect the
Group’s pension scheme. Mike McCollum and Richard Portman are members of the Group’s pension scheme into
which the Group contributed 10.5 per cent of salary (details are set out within the audited section of this report on
page 27). The Group makes no pension contributions for Andrew Davies. No Non–Executive Directors receive any
pension contributions.
Benefits in kind
Benefits included the following elements: provision of a company car or allowance, fuel, landline telephone at each
Executive Director’s home residence and a mobile telephone together with a pre–arranged funeral plan in accordance
with any scheme established by the Group in respect of the funeral of the Executive Director or his wife. All Executive
Directors received all of their benefits in kind.

The Board has recently reviewed the terms and conditions of the Non–Executive Directors and the Chairman and have
agreed further Letters of Appointment. These Letters are for a period of 24 months.
There are no special provisions in service contracts of employees or Directors relating to cessation of employment 
or change of control. The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual
obligations, which do not include any payment from the takeover or liquidation of the Group. In addition, the
Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, one third of the Directors are required to submit themselves for
re–election every year. The Board determines the fees of the Non–Executive Directors. It is based upon recommendations
from the Chairman and Chief Executive (or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the
Remuneration Committee and the Chief Executive). The level of fees of the Non–Executive Directors reflects the time
commitment and responsibility of their respective roles. In future, their fees will be set by reference to the constituent
companies of the bottom half of the FTSE 250.
No Executive Directors hold a Non–Executive position with any other company. However, the Group encourages one
such appointment per Executive Director.
The following information on pages 26 to 29 has been audited.

MAC_RF63322_A  8/4/08  08:18  Page 29 Introduction
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance in order to achieve its objectives and meet the
necessary standards of accountability and integrity. In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority Dignity plc is required to state whether it has complied with the relevant provisions set out in Section 1 of
the 2006 Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) and, where the provisions have not been complied
with, to provide an explanation. Dignity plc is also required to explain how it has applied the principles set out in
the Code. The following paragraphs, together with the Audit Committee report on pages 32 and 33 and the Report on
Directors’ Remuneration on pages 23 to 29 provide a description of how the main and supporting principles of the
Code have been applied within Dignity plc during 2007.
The Group has complied with all provisions of the Code during 2007, with the exception of the annual bonus awarded
to the Chief Executive, which is pensionable. He is however not a member of the Group pension scheme and 
maintains his own personal pension scheme. As a consequence there is no impact on the Group pension schemes
(schedule A, note 6).
The Board is accountable to the Group’s shareholders for good governance. A narrative statement on how the
Company has applied the principles of the Code and a statement explaining how the provisions of the Code have been
applied and complied with are described below.
Narrative statement
The Code establishes nine principles of good governance, which are split into four areas as outlined below:
1. The Board
The Group is controlled through the Board of Directors that meets regularly throughout the year. Informal meetings
are held between individual Directors as required. The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters reserved to it.
The Board is responsible for:
• Overall management of the Group;
• Strategy;
• Approval of major capital expenditure projects and consideration of significant financial matters;
• Monitoring the exposure to key business risks;
• Reviewing the strategic direction of the Group; and
• Setting annual budgets and reviewing progress towards achievement of these budgets.
All Directors are provided with the necessary papers in advance of the meetings to permit them to make informed
decisions at those meetings. The Board also considers employee issues and key appointments including the role of
Company Secretary.
The Board comprises four Executive Directors and three Non–Executive Directors including the Chairman, Richard
Connell. The Chief Executive is Peter Hindley and the Finance Director is Mike McCollum. The Board considers that
four Executive Directors were sufficient to manage a Company of this size and organisational structure. As the
Company was not part of the FTSE 250 for the majority of 2007, the Board considers that two independent
Non–Executive Directors was sufficient and appropriate for the Group and was specifically permitted under the Code.
However, in late December 2007, the Company was promoted to the FTSE 250. To comply with the terms of the Code
two further Non–Executive Directors will be appointed to the Board and its Committees by the end of the 2008,
assuming the Company remains in the FTSE 250, so that there are the same number of independent Non–Executive
Directors as Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman.
There is a clear division of responsibility between the Non–Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive so as to give 
no individual unfettered powers of decision making. The Chairman is responsible for:
• Ensuring the Board functions in all aspects of its role;
• Facilitating the effective contribution of Non–Executive Directors and ensuring constructive relations between
Executive and Non–Executive Directors;
• Setting the agenda so all relevant issues are discussed; and
• Ensuring effective communication with stakeholders and acting as the public face of the Group.
The Chief Executive is responsible for:
• Operational management and control of the Group on a day–to–day basis;
• Formulating and proposing strategy to the Board; and
• Implementing the strategy and policies adopted by the Board.

Directors’ statement on corporate governance
MAC_RF63322_A  8/4/08  08:18  Page 30 There are two independent Non–Executive Directors, Bill Forrester and James Newman. James Newman is the appointed
Senior Independent Director of the Group. Biographical details, including committee membership, appears on pages 18
to 19. The Chairman and the Non–Executive Directors have formally confirmed to the Board, mindful of their other
commitments, that they have and will have sufficient time to devote to their responsibilities as Directors of the Group.
All Directors are able to take independent professional advice on the furtherance of their duties if necessary. They also
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director and,
where it is considered appropriate and necessary, training is made available to Directors. All Directors receive annual
training and updates on the duties and responsibilities of being a Director of a listed company. This covers legal,
accounting and tax matters as required. The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of any legal
action against its Directors. The level of cover is currently £40 million.
All Directors, in accordance with the Code, submit themselves for re–election at least once every three years. In
addition any Director appointed in the year must submit himself for re–election.
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee, an Audit Committee and a Nomination Committee all of which
operate within defined terms of reference. The specific terms of reference for all the committees may be obtained
from the Company Secretary at the Registered Office and are also available for inspection on the Group’s investor
website www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk. All Committees are provided with sufficient resources to undertake their duties.
Those attending and the frequency of Board and Committee meetings held during the year was as follows:
When Directors are unable to attend a meeting, they are advised of the matters to be discussed and given an
opportunity to make their views known to the Chairman prior to the meeting. A process exists whereby such views will
be included in the minutes of the meeting if necessary.
A process exists whereby the Non–Executive Directors can meet without the Executive Directors being present. Three
such meetings were held during 2007. During the year the Board again undertook a formal and rigorous evaluation of
its own performance and that of its Committees by way of the issue of a detailed questionnaire to all Directors. This
was then followed by a detailed review of the responses, by the Directors, and identification of any actions arising.
The Non–Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, were responsible for the performance evaluation
of the Chairman. The Board was satisfied that its performance and that of its individual Directors and Committees
was of the appropriate standard. Full evaluations will be completed again during 2008.
Bill Forrester and James Newman are independent of management, as defined by the Code.
The Company Secretary, Richard Portman, is responsible for the preparation and distribution of all agendas, minutes
and related Board and Committee papers. As Corporate Services Director he attends the Board meetings in his capacity
as a Director of the Company but also acts as Secretary to those meetings. He attends the Committee meetings in his
capacity as Company Secretary and thus Secretary of those Committees when requested to do so by the Chairman of
that Committee. He is also responsible for ensuring all Board procedures are followed and for advising the Board on
corporate governance matters.
2. Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Bill Forrester, determines and agrees with the Board, within formal terms 
of reference, the framework and policy of Directors’ and senior managements’ remuneration and its cost to the Group.
The Committee met five times during 2007. The Committee measures the performance of the Executive Directors as a
prelude to recommending and approving their annual remuneration, bonus awards and awards of share options to the
Board for final determination.

Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
MAC_RF63322_A  8/4/08  08:18  Page 31 The Committee members are the independent Non–Executive Directors and the Chairman. This reflects the
requirements of the Code to have a Committee of at least two members. The Chairman is a member of the Committee
to provide additional experience and balance given the small number of Non–Executive Directors.The Chief Executive,
Peter Hindley, also attends the meetings by invitation of the Committee. No Director or senior manager is involved in
any decisions with regard to their own remuneration.
The Executive Directors recommend the remuneration of Non–Executive Directors and recommendations take into
account time commitment and role responsibilities in the fulfilment of those duties. The Non–Executive Directors 
are not eligible for pensions and do not participate in the Group’s bonus or share schemes. The Committee has
considered the remuneration of senior management immediately below Board level during the year. It concluded 
that their remuneration was commensurate with their various duties and in line with market rates.
3. Accountability and audit 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the two Non–Executive Directors and the Chairman. James Newman, who is a Fellow 
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, is considered to have recent and relevant financial
experience to chair this Committee. Its membership is restricted to Non–Executive Directors. The Committee has specific
written terms of reference that explain its authority and duties. The Committee has met three times during 2007 and
again in March 2008. The external auditors, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director have attended all the meetings
by invitation. The external auditors and the Internal Audit Function also have the right to discrete private audiences with
the Audit Committee or its Chairman if either party requires or requests them. One such meeting was held during 2007
between the Chairman and the Head of Internal Audit and one between the Chairman and the external auditors.
The Committee reviews the Group’s Annual Report and Interim Report before submission to the Board. It keeps under
review the Group’s accounting policies, financial controls and internal control and risk management systems. It also
evaluates, on a regular basis, the work of the Internal Audit Function and reviews its effectiveness. The Committee
also reviews matters brought to its attention both internally and by the external auditors. The Committee reports all
findings to the Board.
A formal process, established via the Audit Committee, exists by which employees of the Group may, in confidence,
raise concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. This ensures arrangements are in
place for the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow–up action.
The Committee also keeps under review the relationship with the external auditors, including their terms of
engagement, independence, objectivity and effectiveness. The Committee reviews the remuneration received by the
external auditors for non–audit work, which ongoing principally relates to taxation advice. Where considered necessary
the Committee approves such work. The external auditors have confirmed their audit independence in writing to the
Committee. The Committee also retains responsibility for the appointment and removal of the external auditors.
Reporting responsibilities
The Board is required to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects,
not only in the Directors’ Report and Accounts but also in the Chairman’s Statement (page 4), the Chief Executive’s
Overview (page 5), the Business Review (pages 6 to 10), the Financial Review (pages 15 to 17), Interim Reports,
Interim Management Statements and in price sensitive announcements. The Group will release its Annual Information
Update by 2 April 2008. A summary of the Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements is set out on page 20.
Going concern
The Directors regularly receive and review management accounts, cash balances, forecasts and the annual budget.
After careful consideration the Directors confirm they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis for
preparing the accounts.
Internal control
The Board recognises it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss. A formal process of identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the Group exists. This process was in place at the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and is, in accordance with Turnbull guidance (as revised in 2005), within the Code.
Internal controls are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis. Internal Audit completes a programme of work each 
year that provides assurance that the internal controls they have tested are working effectively and also propose
improvements where appropriate and necessary. Coupled with this, the bi–annual review of the Risk Register provides
a further formal review mechanism for considering and reviewing internal controls. All such work is reported to and
monitored by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board, as part of an ongoing process, has formally reviewed and continues to
keep under review the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal controls, including financial, operational and
32
Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued
MAC_RF63322_A  8/4/08  08:18  Page 32 compliance controls and risk management systems. The Audit Committee reviews risk management annually and
receives reports from executive management regarding weaknesses in internal control, any losses arising out of
weaknesses in internal control and progress in implementing revised procedures to improve and enhance internal
control. There have been no reports of system weaknesses that have resulted or would have resulted in a material
misstatement or loss.
The key procedures, which operated throughout the period, are as follows:
• Financial reporting – The Group has a comprehensive system of internal budgeting and forecasting. Monthly actual
results analysed by operating division are reported to the Board and significant variances to budget are investigated
with revised forecasts prepared as necessary. Operational management receives comprehensive management
accounts covering their areas of responsibility;
• Financial controls – The Executive Directors have defined appropriate and necessary financial controls and procedures
to be employed by operational management. Key controls over major business risks include reviews against budgets
and forecasts, review against key performance indicators and exception reporting;
• Quality and integrity of personnel – One of the Group’s core values is integrity. This is regarded as vital to the
maintenance of the Group’s system of internal financial control. The Directors have put in place an organisation
structure appropriate to the size and complexity of the Group with defined lines of responsibility and delegation 
of authority where the Board considers it necessary;
• Internal audit – The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit team, which reports to the Chief Executive. It coordinates
the completion of self–assessment reports by operational management that assists in highlighting areas of control
weakness or exposure. Internal audit reviews are completed on such areas together with selected areas of the head
office function and any area where an Executive Director requests a review. During 2007 (as in 2006), there were
quarterly meetings between the Head of Internal Audit, the Executive Directors and the Financial Controller to
formally review and discuss Internal Audit’s work programme and findings. In addition, regular meetings between
Internal Audit and the external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , were held during the year to discuss and plan
audit work and to ensure a coordinated approach. The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee at
every meeting of that Committee;
• Procedures – The Group has established and documented processes and procedures covering most parts of its
operations, both client facing and in support departments. These provide clear guidance on the correct or most
appropriate course of action in various circumstances. Procedures are supplemented by training where needs have
been identified. Both Internal Audit and a comprehensive management structure monitor the adherence to such
processes and procedures; and 
• Risk assessment – Management has responsibility for the identification and evaluation of significant risks that might
arise in their area of responsibility together with the design of suitable internal controls. The Executive Directors 
and the wider management team continually assess the risks. A Risk Register is maintained, which is formally
presented to and reviewed by the Audit Committee twice a year.
Nomination Committee
Richard Connell chairs the Nomination Committee, which has met twice during the year. The other members of the
Committee are James Newman and Bill Forrester, the Non–Executive Directors.
The Committee regularly reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and composition 
of the Board and the senior management team. It is also responsible for identifying and nominating for the approval
of the Board, replacement or additional Directors and members of the senior management team. The Committee
formally considered succession planning during 2007. The Committee concluded that appropriate succession
planning exists within the Group.
4. Relations with shareholders
The Group encourages two–way communication with both its institutional and private shareholders and responds
promptly to any queries received either verbally or in writing.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director have regular meetings with institutional investors, fund managers and analysts
to discuss information made public by the Group. Where appropriate or if requested, such meetings could include either
or both of the Chairman and the Senior Non–Executive Director or be without any Executive Directors present. The
Chairman discusses governance and strategy matters with the major shareholders. Further, the Group has and will
arrange visits to their facilities, if requested by a shareholder, where it will not disrupt normal operational activity.
Each year every shareholder receives a full Annual Report and Accounts and an Interim Report at the half year.
The Group has a separate investor relations website, www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk, upon which users can access 
the latest financial and corporate news and information. The Company Secretary is also available to answer general
investor queries.
The Board regards the Annual General Meeting as an opportunity to communicate directly with all shareholders.
At least 20 working days notice will be given of the Annual General Meeting at which all Directors and Committee
Chairmen plan to be present and available to answer questions.

MAC_RF63322_A  8/4/08  08:18  Page 33 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Dignity plc
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes. These consolidated
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended
28 December 2007 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having
been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the consolidated financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been
prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act
1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements. The information given in the Directors’
Report includes that specific information presented in the Business Review and Financial Review that is cross referred
from the principal activities and business review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding director’s remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the company‘s compliance with the nine provisions 
of the Combined Code (2006) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we
report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks
and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
consolidated financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Overview, the Business Review, the Financial Review, the Corporate and Social
Responsibility Report, the unaudited section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Corporate Governance
Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the consolidated financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the consolidated financial
statements.

European law requires that the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the 52 week period ended 28 December
2007 are prepared in accordance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’), as adopted
by the European Union. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations (as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention, as modified by the
revaluation of land and buildings and financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the income statement.
Preparation of financial statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. This will
also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements are presented in the form of Group financial statements. The Group financial statements
consolidate the accounts of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company (including all of its subsidiary
entities) after eliminating internal transactions and recognising any minority interests in those entities. Control is
achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as
to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007
IFRS 7, Financial instruments disclosures, these have been implemented in the period. This standard does not have
any impact on the classification and valuation of the Groups financial instruments.
IFRIC 10, Interim financial reporting and impairment, prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim 
period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at 
a subsequent balance sheet date. This standard does not have any impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence to
enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Transactions which may give rise to exceptional
items are principally:
• professional fees relating to capital restructuring where they cannot be offset against amounts borrowed in
accordance with IAS 23; and
• non–recurring changes in taxation following the implementation of new legislation.
Pre–arranged funeral plan trusts
The three pre–arranged funeral plan trusts were not consolidated during the period as they were not controlled by
the Group. Specifically, Article 60 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) order 2001
requires a majority of the managing trustees to be independent of the Group. Furthermore, the Group did not direct
their financial and operating policies, nor did it have substantially all of the risks and rewards of their ownership.
Acquisition or disposal of subsidiary undertakings
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included from the effective date of control using the
acquisition method of accounting. The separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of newly acquired subsidiary
undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the fair value to the Group as at the
effective date of control.
Revenue
Revenue from funeral operations comprises the amount recoverable from customers for the provision of funerals, income
from crematoria and other services, to the extent that those services have been performed or the goods supplied.
Income from memorial sales is recognised at the point of sale, to the extent that the goods have been supplied.
Costs of maintaining memorials are recognised as incurred.

MAC_RF63322_C1  8/4/08  08:27  Page 39 1 Accounting policies (continued)
The accounting policies for recognising turnover for pre–arranged funeral plans are stated below.
The Group pays certain disbursements such as crematoria fees, burial plots, ministers’ fees and doctors’ fees on
behalf of its clients. These amounts are recovered as part of the invoicing process. However, these amounts are not
included within net revenues as they are simply passed on to the customer at cost.
The Group views the UK as one geographical segment, given each local business exhibits similar long term
characteristics.
All amounts are exclusive of VAT .
Pre–arranged funeral plans
Trust plans
The Group markets and sells pre–arranged funeral plans, monies received from selling funeral plans being held 
and controlled by independent pre–arranged funeral plan trusts (‘the Trusts’). The responsibility for the ultimate
performance of funerals is allocated to funeral directors, who are selected by the beneficiary of the plan and some 
of whom are not owned by the Group.
The Group receives monies from the Trusts in respect of the following transactions:
• A marketing and administration fee in respect of each plan sold. The marketing element is refundable in the event
that the plan is subsequently cancelled. A provision is made for cancellations, where material, to cover the estimated
marketing element refundable to the Trusts. Marketing and administration fees are included in Group revenue when
the related plan is sold.
• Further contributions are also received from the Trusts in return for the provision of general ongoing administrative
services supplied to the Trusts. These contributions are included in Group revenue for the period to which they relate.
All costs in respect of the marketing and administration of the pre–arranged funeral plans are expensed in the Group
income statement as incurred.
From time to time, the Group receives monies from certain of the Trusts, in line with the relevant Trust’s deed, which
have been assessed by the trustees as not required to ensure the Trust has sufficient assets to meet its future liabilities
in respect of current members (‘Recoveries’). All Recoveries are recognised as other operating income in the period in
which the trustees approve their payment.
The Group makes payments on behalf of the Trusts relating to the ongoing overheads of the Trusts, refunds to
members of the Trusts in event of cancellation, and the payments made to funeral directors when the funeral is
ultimately performed. All such payments are reimbursed in full by the Trusts on demand, in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Trust’s deed.
Neither the sales value of plans nor the costs of providing funerals are recognised in the financial statements of the
Group when a pre–arranged funeral plan is sold.
Each Dignity marketing company contractually guarantees with the customer of a pre–arranged funeral plan that (i) if
the customer chooses to cancel their selected funeral plan, a full refund will be made to the customer of all monies
paid in respect thereof (less in certain cases an administration fee payable to the relevant Dignity marketing company);
(ii) the funeral director’s services (as selected by the customer) will be provided regardless of price rises in the future;
and (iii) for certain plans sold, specific disbursements will be provided regardless of price rises in the future.
Insurance plans
Previously marketed propositions
The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by an insurance company in
consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral (including some disbursements) of the
plan holder at no further charge. Marketing of these policies has now ceased.
In the event of death of the policyholder, the Group makes an agreed payment to the nominated funeral director and 
a debtor is recognised. At this time a commission fee is recognised as turnover. All monies are reclaimed in full from
the life insurance company.

The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies,
in consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral (including some disbursements) of the
plan holder at no further charge.
A commission is paid when the policy is charged to the Group. As this commission is fully refundable if the Group
does not perform the funeral for any reason, it is carried as a debtor and expensed when the funeral is performed.
Share–based payments
The Group issues equity settled share–based payments to certain employees. A fair value for the equity settled share
awards is measured at the date of grant. Management measures the fair value using the valuation technique that they
consider to be the most appropriate to value each class of award, which include Black–Scholes calculations and
Monte Carlo simulations. The valuations take into account factors such as non–transferability, exercise restrictions and
behavioural considerations.
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight–line basis, after
allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will eventually vest. The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed
at least annually, with any impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately.
Earnings per Ordinary Share
Basic Earnings per Ordinary Share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the profit on ordinary activities after taxation and
minority interests by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by
dividing profit on ordinary activities after taxation and minority interests by the weighted average number of shares in
issue during the period increased by the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares (primarily share options).
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration for subsidiaries and other businesses over
the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is capitalised and stated at historical cost less
provisions for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The business and subsidiaries
acquired are generally combined with existing operations in the year of acquisition. For this reason, the cash–generating
units typically consist of those business segments, which are engaged in providing products or services that are subject
to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
Intangible assets – trade names 
Intangible trade names are recognised as assets at the fair value of the consideration paid to acquire them and are
carried at historical cost less provisions for amortisation and impairment. When acquired as part of a business
combination the fair value is calculated by reference to the estimated incremental cash flows expected to arise by
virtue of the trade name being well–established.
Amortisation is provided from the date of acquisition so as to write–off the asset on a straight–line basis over the term
of its useful life. Where there are indicators that a trade name has an indefinite life then these assets are not amortised
but are subject to annual impairment reviews. The factors that indicate an indefinite life of trade names acquired
include the fact that the Group is a significant operator in a well–established market with inelastic demand, the
conservative nature of the UK funeral industry that acts as a barrier to entry for new trade names, and the Group’s
track record for actively monitoring and relocating trade names to combat shifting demographics. In addition, when
allocating a useful life to acquired trade names, the following matters are considered:
• The strength of the trade name in its local environment which is assessed by reference to relative market share and
anticipated profitability;
• The likelihood that market based factors could truncate a trade name’s life such as competition and shifting
demographics and the Group’s ability to combat these;
• The length of time, prior to acquisition, for which trade has been conducted under the name acquired; and
• The likely support the Group will give to the name in its local environment through marketing and promotion,
maintaining community awareness etc.
The useful lives of all capitalised trade names are considered to be indefinite and are reviewed on a regular basis.
Intangible assets – non–compete contracts
Non–compete contracts arising from business combinations are capitalised at the fair value, which is calculated as the
present value of any consideration paid discounted at the Group’s cost of capital.

MAC_RF63322_C1  8/4/08  08:27  Page 41 1 Accounting policies (continued)
All costs are amortised over the term of the relevant agreement on a straight–line basis.
Intangible assets – software
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is treated as an
intangible asset. Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and
bring into use the specific software.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development of computer systems (including web–sites)
is recognised if and only if the costs are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software
products, controlled by the Group and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. All other
costs incurred in research or development are expensed as incurred. Capitalised costs will include, where appropriate,
directly attributable payroll costs and a portion of direct overheads. Costs recognised as assets are amortised over
their estimated useful lives (three to eight years).
Intangible assets – use of third party brand
On 8 January 2007, the Group acquired the remaining 25 per cent voting share capital of Advance Planning Limited
for consideration of £2.0 million. As part of this arrangement, the Group obtained a 10–year marketing commitment
from Age Concern Enterprises Limited, the previous minority shareholder, giving rights to use the Age Concern brand
for the next ten years. The value of this right has been recognised as a separate intangible asset.
This asset is being amortised over twenty years on a straight–line basis, recognising that each year’s additional
marketing activity generates incremental revenues and profits to the Group for at least the following twenty years.
Property, plant and equipment 
Assets are recorded in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes, where appropriate, directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each asset to its present location and
condition. Depreciation is charged (excluding freehold land and assets in the course of construction) so as to write off
the cost of assets to their residual value, over their expected useful lives using the straight–line method. The bases
and annual depreciation rates in use for the various classes of assets are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2% – 10% 
Short leasehold buildings Over term of lease
Motor vehicles 11% – 20%
Computers 20% 
Other plant and equipment 5% – 33% 
Fixtures and fittings 15%
Freehold land is not depreciated on the basis that land has an unlimited life. Where the historical cost of land and
buildings cannot be split, the Directors have estimated that the historical cost attributable to land is one third of the
original cost of acquiring the land and buildings. This estimate is regularly reviewed.
Major renovations of the Group’s trading premises and crematory re–linings are depreciated over the remaining life 
of the related asset or to the estimated date of the next major renovation or cremator re–lining, whichever is sooner.
Depreciation rates and residual values for each class of asset are reviewed annually.
Repairs and renewals
All repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement unless they represent an enhancement to the
original asset.
Property, plant and equipment held under leases
When assets are financed by leasing agreements, where the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the
Group, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright and the corresponding liability to the lessor is
included as an obligation under finance leases. Depreciation on leased assets is charged to the income statement on
the same basis as owned assets. Leasing payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the
interest is charged to the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate on the outstanding lease obligation.
All other leases are ‘operating leases’ and the relevant annual rentals are charged to the income statement.

Notes to the financial statements continued
for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007
MAC_RF63322_C1  8/4/08  08:27  Page 42 Impairment of assets
The carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in periods
where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets that have 
an indefinite useful life (e.g. goodwill) are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable
amount of the cash–generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs
to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future discounted cash flows of the cash–generating unit
are estimated, based on latest budgets for the following year and an annual growth rate of UK GDP in subsequent years.
These cash flows are discounted at rates that management estimate to be the risk affected average cost of capital for
the particular segment and compared to the carrying value of the relevant asset. Any impairment in the value of an asset
below its carrying value is charged to the income statement within operating profit. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised in the income statement to the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Inventories
Inventories, which comprise funeral supplies and monumental masonry, are stated at the lower of cost and fair value
less costs to sell. Cost includes all directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location
and condition. Fair value less costs to sell is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be
incurred in completion and sale.
Taxation
The tax charge for the period includes the charge for tax currently payable and deferred tax. The current tax charge
represents the estimated amount due that arises from the operations of the Group in the period and after making
adjustments to estimates in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, except where the
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised where the carrying value of an asset is greater than its associated tax basis or
where the carrying value of a liability is less than its associated tax basis. Deferred tax is provided for any differences
that exist between the tax base and accounting base of intangibles arising from a business combination that does not
involve the acquisition of a subsidiary.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future
reversal of the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted, by the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non–discounted basis.
Pensions
The cost of defined contribution retirement schemes is charged as an expense as the costs become payable. Any
difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short term asset or liability.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing the benefits is determined using the projected unit
credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent the benefits are vested, and otherwise are amortised on 
a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. The current service cost and the
recognised element of any past service cost are presented within operating profit. The expected return on plan assets
less the interest arising on the pension liabilities is presented within net interest payable. Actuarial gains and losses
are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the income statement and presented in the
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
The expected return on plan assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long term yields that will arise
from the specific assets held within the pension plan. The retirement benefit net asset recognised in the balance sheet
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost net of
the fair value of any relevant scheme assets. The discount rate applied in arriving at the present value represents
yields on high quality corporate bonds in a similar economic environment with lives similar to the maturity of the
pension liabilities.
Group Accounts

Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
MAC_RF63322_C1  8/4/08  08:27  Page 43 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company or the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result
of a past event, where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and
where a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions (other than deferred tax) are discounted where the present value of the provision is materially different to
the undiscounted value. The unwinding of discounts is included within net interest payable and similar charges.
Dividends
Interim dividends payable are recognised when they are paid. Year end dividends are recognised when they are
appropriately approved.
Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions recognised in the income statement are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate on
the date the transaction took place.
Financial instruments 
Borrowings
All borrowings are stated at the fair value of consideration received after deduction of transaction costs. The transaction
costs and interest payable on debt finance are charged to the income statement, as finance costs, on a constant–yield
basis over the term of the borrowings, or over a shorter period where it is more likely than not that the lender will
require earlier repayment using the effective interest method.
Early termination costs on borrowings
Premiums and discounts arising on the early repayment of borrowings are written–off to the income statement as
incurred.
Interest rate swaps
The Group currently uses several types of financial instruments as part of an overall interest rate risk management
strategy. It does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest rate risk associated with net debt
is managed by using a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings and financial liabilities. The cash flows from,
and losses arising on terminations of, these contracts are recognised as cash flows from operating activities. See note
16(d) for further information.
Trade receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment is established based on historical experience. When a trade receivable is not collectable 
it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting 
all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct
transaction costs. Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial
statements in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded
in the financial statements when paid.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 but not relevant 
The following standard, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 but they are not relevant to the Group’s operations:
IFRS 4, Insurance contracts
IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyper–inflationary economies 
IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2
IFRIC 9, Re–assessment of embedded derivatives.

MAC_RF63322_C1  8/4/08  08:27  Page 44 Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for accounting periods
beginning on or after 29 December 2007 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted:
IFRS 8, Operating segments. This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009
and introduces new rules on the disclosure of operating results by business segment.
IFRIC 11, IFRS 2, Group and treasury transactions. It provides guidance an whether share–based payments involving
treasury shares or involving group entities (for example, options over a parent’s shares) should be accounted for as
equity–settled or cash–settled share–based payment in the stand–alone accounts of the parent and Group companies.
This is not expected to have any impact on the Group’s accounts.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19, the limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction. IFRIC 14
provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset.
It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding
requirement. The Group will apply IFRIC 14 from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any impact on the
Group’s consolidated financial statements.
IAS 23 (Amendment), Borrowing costs. The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the
European Union. It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction
or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) as part of
the cost of that asset. The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed. The Group will
apply IAS 23 (Amended) from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU but is currently not applicable to
the Group as there are no qualifying assets.
Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the Group’s operations 
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s accounting
periods beginning on or after 28 December 2007 or later periods but are not relevant for the Group’s operations:
IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements. IFRIC 12 is not relevant to the Group’s operations as it does not have any
service concession arrangements.
IFRIC 13, Customer loyalty programs. IFRIC 13 is not relevant to the Group’s operations as it does not operate any
loyalty programs.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and
assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The most sensitive estimates affecting the
financial statements are in the areas of assessing the recoverability of receivables and post–retirement benefits.
Provision for doubtful trade receivables
Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of management may be impaired. Within each division,
assessment is made of the recoverability of trade receivables based on a range of factors including the age of the
receivable and the type of services provided. The provision is assessed monthly against actual experience of
irrecoverable accounts and adjusted if appropriate.
The Group held a provision for impairment of trade receivables at the balance sheet date of £2.5 million (2006:
£2.8 million).
Pensions
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme that is accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial
assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements. These actuarial assumptions
include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would
affect the balance sheet and income statement. The Group considers that the most significant assumptions are the
discount rate and the expected return on plan assets.
Employee share trust 
The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the directors consider 
that Dignity plc has de facto control. In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts and the substance of
the transaction, the trust’s assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet within share capital 
and reserves.
Group Accounts
45
Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
MAC_RF63322_C1  8/4/08  08:27  Page 45 2 Financial risk management 
The Group finances its operations by a mixture of shareholders’ funds, Secured Notes, with other bank borrowings
available if required. This approach seeks to minimise financing costs and generate optimum shareholder value
through efficient leveraging of the Group’s balance sheet, which is made possible by the stable and predictable cash
generative nature of the business.
It is not the Group policy to actively trade in derivatives.
Market risk
Currency risk
All the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling. The Group purchases minimal amounts
from overseas. Accordingly, exposure to currency fluctuations are not significant and therefore not actively managed.
Interest rate risk and other price risk
The Group’s main borrowings consist of Class A and B Secured Notes, which are at fixed interest rates, resulting in a
predetermined repayment profile. The fair value of these financial instruments is based on underlying gilt prices and
yield spreads based on the market’s current view of the risk profile of the Secured Notes. Consequently, the fair value
of these instruments will fluctuate. Fair values are not relevant to the Group unless it was to change its funding
strategy and repays the Secured Notes early.
The Group has significant cash balances that are held by institutions rated at least A–1 by Standard and Poors.
These balances earn interest by reference to the Bank of England base rate. If base rates reduced by one per cent at
the beginning of 2008 then the Group would receive £0.1 million less interest income on a annualised basis for each 
£10 million held. Given the level of cash held during the period the Group does not consider this to be a significant
exposure.
None of the Group’s other financial liabilities or financial assets carry any significant interest rate risk.
Credit risk
Trade receivables are the main source of credit risk to the Group. However, this risk is minimised as much as possible
through well–established credit control procedures. Quantitative disclosures regarding the aging of these receivables
are included in note 21(c).
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash reserves, committed undrawn borrowing facilities
and regular monitoring and forecasting of cash balances. In addition, the Group is required under the terms of its
secured borrowings to maintain a precisely defined EBITDA to total debt service ratio of at least 1.5:1. This ratio was
determined when raising the debt as being sufficient to ensure all borrowings could be repaid. At 28 December 2007
the actual ratio was 2.31:1 (2006: 2.32:1).
Capital risk management
The Group’s objective under managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to provide returns for shareholders, repay holders of Class A and B Secured Notes and benefit other
shareholders. It also aims to reduce its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
In order to achieve these expectations, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or issue further Class A and B Secured Notes.
During the period, the Group achieved its covenants under the terms of the Group’s secured borrowings
(see ‘Liquidity risk’ above).
3 Revenue and segmental analysis
As described in the Business Review and Financial Review, the Group is organised into three main business segments:
funeral services, crematoria and pre–arranged funeral plans.
Funeral services represent the sale of funerals and memorials at the time of need.
Crematoria represent the performance of cremations at the time of need, together with the sale of memorials at the
time of need and in advance.
Pre–arranged funeral plans represent the revenue from the sale of funerals in advance to customers wishing to make
their own funeral arrangements, and the marketing and administration costs associated with making such sales.
Substantially all Group revenue is derived from, and substantially all of the Group’s net assets are located in, the
United Kingdom and Channel Islands. Overseas transactions are not material.

Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.2 0.2
Total taxation 8.6 8.4
Under IFRS the tax rate is lower (2006: higher) than the standard UK tax rate of 30 per cent due to the impact of
disallowable trading expenses and expenditure on the Group’s premises that does not attract any deductions for tax
purposes, which has been offset in 2007 by the change in deferred tax rates from 30 per cent to 28 per cent.
In June 2007, legislation was passed confirming that the rate of Corporation Tax would reduce from 30 per cent to
28 per cent from 1 April 2008. As a result, the Group recognised exceptional tax income of £0.5 million through its
income statement to reflect the one off reduction in the period of the Group’s deferred tax provision.
This also had the effect of reducing the Group’s effective tax rate (excluding the non–recurring adjustment) to 
30 per cent in 2007, compared to 31 per cent in the previous period.
The Group anticipates its effective tax rate will transition to 29 per cent in the 2009 financial period and beyond
following these legislative changes.

The latest Budget Report was issued on 12 March 2008, the day before the release of this annual report. Accordingly,
it is too early to have completed any detailed analysis on any new proposals announced by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. The Group will make appropriate announcements in due course as required by the Listing Rules if any
aspect is considered to have a material effect on the Group’s earnings.
Further legislation is anticipated in respect of Industrial Buildings Allowances. If this is substantially enacted in the
form expected in 2008, then this will result in a one off charge to the income statement of £0.5 million.

Total dividends recognised in the period 5.9 1.9
A final dividend of 6.67 pence per share, in respect of 2007, has been proposed by the Board. This will be paid on 
27 June 2008 provided approval is gained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 6 June 2008 and will
be paid to shareholders on the register at close of business on 6 June 2008.
8 Earnings per share 
The calculation of basic earnings per Ordinary Share has been based on the profit for the relevant period.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to
assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares being those share options granted to employees
under the Group’s SAYE Scheme and the contingently issueable shares under the Group’s LTIP Schemes.
At the balance sheet date, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the LTIP Schemes had not
been met and these contingently issueable shares have been excluded from the diluted EPS calculations.
The Board believes that profit on ordinary activities before exceptional items, profit on sale of fixed assets and after
taxation is a useful indication of the Group’s performance, as it excludes significant non–recurring items. This
reporting measure is defined as ‘Underlying profit after taxation’ in the Financial Review.
Accordingly, the Board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation
is also a useful indicator of financial performance.
Reconciliations of the earnings and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

In 2007 , the potential issue of new shares pursuant to the Group’s share option plans in the period would not affect
the earnings per share (2006: would affect earnings per share by less than 0.1 pence per share if exercised).

The recoverable amount of a CGU is based on a value–in–use calculation. However, the assets allocated to head office
are tested for impairment by reference to the Group as a whole.
The value–in–use calculations use cash flow projections based on the latest annual budgets approved by management.
Key assumptions used to produce the annual budget are the estimated UK death rates (based on historical death rates
supplied by ONS), anticipated market share (based on actual experience) and anticipated price increases. Cash flows
beyond the initial 12 month period are extrapolated using the historic UK GDP growth rate. The cash flows are
discounted at a pre–tax rate of 9.2 per cent (2006: 9.2 per cent). Given the stability and predictability of the industry,
cash flows for the following 20 years have been taken into account.
On the basis of the above, the review indicated that no impairment arose in any segment (2006: £nil).

This investment represented a £1,000,000 debenture loan to KCH Repatriation Limited (formerly Kenyon Christopher
Henley Limited) a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The debenture loan to KCH Repatriation Limited was secured on the assets of that business, earned interest at
15 per cent per annum and was repayable in 2022.
The loan was repaid in full in the second quarter of the 52 week period.
(b) Prepayments
This balance represents the amounts paid to acquire the long leasehold interest in land at certain of the Group’s
properties. Management consider that leases greater than fifty years at inception are long leases. The balance is
expensed on a straight–line basis over the term of the relevant lease. The leases expire at various times over the next
thirty to nine hundred years.
(c) Deferred commissions
The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies.
A commission is paid when the policy is charged to the Group. As this commission is fully refundable if the Group
does not perform the funeral for any reason, it is carried as a debtor and expensed when the funeral is performed.

At 28 December 2007, £1.6 million (2006: £1.8 million) and £1.6 million (2006: £1.7 million) of the transaction
costs in respect of the Further A notes and the Further B notes respectively remain unamortised.
The Further A notes and Further B notes were issued at a premium of £3.6 million and £10.8 million respectively,
which is being released in proportion to the interest cost in the notes. At the balance sheet date £3.0 million 
(2006: £3.3 million) and £9.7 million (2006: £10.2 million) respectively remained unamortised.

(d) Other financial liabilities
On 20 December 2002, Dignity (2002) Limited entered into contracts to swap the floating rate interest on a bank loan
into fixed rate. Contractually, these swaps were not effective until 30 April 2003.
On 11 April 2003, as described in note 16(a), the Group issued Secured Notes at a fixed rate of interest. These notes
replaced the bank loan. Consequently, the swaps were no longer required as the Group had no interest rate risk on the
Secured Notes. As result, the Group entered into further contracts on 11 April 2003 to swap fixed rate interest into
floating in order to offset the original swaps and eliminate any interest rate risk in this regard.
As a result of interest rate movements between these two dates, the combined effect of all the contracts was that the
Group makes fixed and determinable bi–annual payments on a notional principal amount.
These swap agreements were entered into under one ISDA master agreement. This master agreement forces the swaps
to be viewed and settled on a net basis only; a position that cannot be altered without the written consent of both parties.
Accordingly, the overall transaction represents a financial liability. The fair value represents the discounted net present
value of future cash flows. Further, as these contracts related to the raising of the Secured Notes, the liability has
been accounted for as a transaction cost of the Class A and B Secured Notes and is being amortised in accordance
with IAS 39.
(e) Current financial liabilities
The current financial liabilities represent the amounts falling due within one year of the Group’s accounting reference
date, 31 December.

47.8 43.3
The non–cancellable operating leases principally relate to leasehold land and buildings.
Of the total operating lease payments charged to trading expenses, £0.1 million (2006: £0.1 million) are in respect of
contingent rentals. The contingent rentals are based on the revenues generated at the specific locations.
Sublease payments received in the year amount to £0.6 million (2006: £0.6 million). Total future sublease payments
receivable relating to operating leases amount to £0.5 million (2006: £0.8 million).
In addition, the Group has operating lease commitments with rentals determined in relation to sales. It is not possible
to quantify future rentals payable under such leases.

(a) Dilapidations
The provision for dilapidations covers the costs of repair to leased premises occupied by the Group in respect of which
a dilapidations notification has been received, and properties where a dilapidation obligation exists but for which no
notification has been received.
It is anticipated that the element of provision relating to dilapidation notices served, £0.4 million (2006: £0.6 million),
will be incurred in the following financial year, and the element relating to dilapidation obligations where no notice has
been served will be utilised over the terms of the relevant property leases, the majority of which is expected to be by
31 December 2017.
(b) Asbestos rectification
In May 2004, the Control of Asbestos at Work regulations came into effect. This introduces an explicit duty to manage
asbestos in all non–domestic properties. Those who have responsibility for the maintenance and/or repair of the premises
are similarly responsible for the control of asbestos. Therefore, where the Group has entered into leases with a
‘tenant–repairing’ clause, it is also responsible for the control of asbestos.
The provision includes the expected rectification costs of properties not yet surveyed for asbestos plus the estimated
costs of surveying these properties. It is anticipated that the provision will be utilised by the end of 2008.
(c) Onerous contracts
The Group has provided for the discounted future costs of certain contracts to which the Group is legally bound.
These contracts relate to vacant leasehold properties and other contracts from which no economic benefit is derived.
The provision will be utilised over the term of the contracts and it is anticipated that it will be fully utilised after 
nine years.
Included within the provision is an amount of £0.2 million (2006: £0.1 million) relating to the expected costs of ongoing
rent reviews, the outcomes of which have been based on recent experience of similar reviews on other properties.
(d) Cancellation provision
As described in note 1, the Group receives monies from certain pre–arranged funeral plan Trusts in respect of the
marketing of pre–arranged funeral plans, which are refundable to the trust in the event of cancellation.
The provision covers the expected cost of such cancellations anticipated to occur in future years relating to plans sold
before the balance sheet date and is anticipated to be utilised over the next three years.

All of the deferred tax assets were available for offset against deferred tax liabilities and hence the net deferred tax
provision at 28 December 2007 was £14.9 million (2006: £7.2 million).
No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of losses within the Group amounting to £4.1 million net at 28 per cent
(2006: £4.4 million net at 30 per cent). Based on the current debt structure of the Group and the nature of these
losses, the Directors do not consider that taxable profits will arise in the relevant company from which the future
reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Elements of these deferred tax balances may be payable/recoverable within one year. However, the Directors consider
that it is not possible to quantify the amount because of a significant level of uncertainty in the timing of events and
have therefore classified the whole balance as due after more than one year.
The deferred income tax (credited)/charged to equity during the period was as follows:

As at 28 December 2007, £7.0 million of the gross trade receivables (2006: £6.6 million) were past due and partially
impaired. A provision for impairment is established based on historical experience. The amount of the provision was
£2.5 million (2006: £2.8 million). The individually impaired receivables principally relate to monies owing for funerals
performed by the funeral services division. The aging of these receivables is as follows:

£40.0 million of the amount above is a liquidity facility relating to the Class A and B Secured Notes. This facility may
only be used to repay interest and principal on the Secured Notes in the event of insufficient cash to service these
instruments. The facility is subject to annual renewal. However, if the bank providing the facility does not renew it,
then the provider is required to place £40.0 million in a bank account, which the Group may access as if it
represented a borrowing facility on the same terms.
The remaining £5.0 million facility is expected to be renewed for a further five years in April 2008. All these facilities
incur commitment fees at market rates.

Potential issues of Ordinary Shares 
Certain employees hold options to subscribe for shares in the Company under an approved Save As You Earn (SAYE)
Scheme started in 2007. In addition, Executive Directors and senior management hold options to subscribe for shares
in the Company under Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIP) awarded in 2005, 2006 and 2007.
The number of shares subject to options (excluding lapses), the periods in which they were granted and the periods in
which they may be exercised are given below:

LTIP Schemes
The LTIP Scheme was introduced after the flotation of the Group in 2004. Under the LTIP Scheme, the Remuneration
Committee can grant options over shares in the Company to employees of the Group. Awards under the LTIP Scheme
are generally reserved for Executive Directors and senior management. The Company has made annual grants since
April 2004. Options granted under the LTIP Scheme will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of
grant, subject to the conditions described on page 24. Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment
unless an individual ceases to be an employee by reason of death, illness, redundancy or other similar circumstances.
Options were valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. Performance conditions were included in the fair
value calculations. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
27 March 23 March 13 April 8 April
Grant date 2007 2006 2005 2004

Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 0% 0% 0% 0%
Fair value per option £3.62 £2.67 £1.94 £1.34
The expected volatility is calculated by reference to the estimated volatility over the last three years of the members of
the Comparator Group. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the
yield on zero–coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
During the period 6,194 options (2006: none) under the 2004 LTIP Scheme, 20,991 options (2006: none) under the
2005 LTIP Scheme, 31,727 options (2006: none) under the 2006 LTIP Scheme and 2,000 options under the 2007
LTIP Scheme were forfeited. 368,806 options (2006: none) were exercised under the 2004 LTIP Scheme during the
period. The share price of the options exercised during the period was £6.86.
The charge to the income statement in the period in respect of the LTIP Schemes was £0.6 million 
(2006: £0.5 million).

During the period 29,729 options (2006: 38,836) under the 2004 SAYE Scheme and 11,504 (2006: none) under the
2007 SAYE Scheme were forfeited. 648,026 options (2006: 548) were exercised under the 2004 SAYE Scheme during
the period. The weighted average share price of the options exercised during the period was £7.14.
The charge to the income statement in the period in respect of the SAYE Schemes was £0.2 million (2006: £0.2 million).

During 2007, the Group acquired seven funeral businesses and on 8 January 2007 the remaining minority interest of
APL. These have been accounted for under the acquisition method.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess over the net assets acquired 
is recognised as goodwill. This represents the value to the Group of the funeral locations.
The fair value adjustments contain some provisional amounts, which will be finalised in 2008. These adjustments
reflect the recognition of trade names and associated deferred taxation and adjustments to reflect the fair value of
other working capital.
The businesses acquired have their assets and liabilities amalgamated within the existing business structure and 
as such, it is impractical to determine, without undue expense and delay due to the immaterial size of each, the
post acquisition results.
The profit before tax generated by APL in the period was £1.7 million.
It is also not possible to quantify the results of these businesses prior to acquisition as it represents confidential
information relating to the vendors, which the Directors do not have authority to disclose.

Defined benefit plans
In 2005 the Group operated two defined benefit plans in the UK. On 6 April 2006 the Dignity 1972 Pension Scheme
was merged into the Dignity Pension and Assurance Scheme. A full actuarial valuation was carried out in respect of
both plans at 6 April 2005. The valuation results of the merged scheme were updated to 31 December 2007 by a
qualified independent Actuary.
For 2007 the employer’s contribution rate payable was 5.5 per cent of Pensionable Salaries plus £39,750 per 
month (2006: 10.5 per cent of Pensionable Salaries to 5 April 2006 and 5.5 per cent of Pensionable Salaries plus
£39,750 per month thereafter). No special contributions have been paid for 2007 (2006: £10.0 million). The total
monetary contribution paid by the employer for 2007 was £1.2 million (2006: £11.2 million).
The principal assumptions used by the actuary were:
Assumptions 2007 2006
Discount rate 5.85% 5.1%
Expected long–term rate of return on assets 6.3% 6.2%
Rate of increase in salaries 3.7% 3.6%
Rate of increase in payment of pre April 1997
excess over GMP pensions – Dignity Pension and Assurance Scheme members 0% 0%
Rate of increase in payment of post April 1997 pensionable service 3.2% 3.1%
Rate of increase in payment of post April 2005 pensionable service 2.5% 2.5%
Price inflation assumption 3.2% 3.1%
The underlying mortality assumption is PA92 on a year of birth usage with medium cohort improvement factors
(2006: PA92, scaled to 2007 for current pensioners and PA92, scaled to 2020 for deferred pensioners and active
members).

29 Other commitments
Dignity Pre–Arrangement Limited, Dignity Securities Limited and Advance Planning Limited are fellow members of the
Dignity Group in the United Kingdom. These companies have sold pre–arranged funeral plans to their clients in the past.
All monies from these sales are held and controlled by three independent Trusts, being the National Funeral Trust, the
Dignity Limited Trust Fund and the Trust for Age Concern Funeral Plans respectively. Full details of the transactions can
be found in the financial statements of these companies, which are available from Plantsbrook House, 94 The Parade,
Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, B72 1PH.
The Group has given commitments to certain of these clients to perform their funeral. The cost of the performance of
these funerals will be paid out of the funds held in the Trusts.
It is the view of the Directors that none of these commitments are onerous to the Group.
30 Contingent liabilities
On 11 April 2003, the Group refinanced its debt by way of a whole business securitisation. Furthermore on 21 February
2006 further Secured Notes were issued on identical terms. As a result, the following guarantees and charges were
granted to BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited in its capacity as Security Trustee in the securitisation:
• The Dignity (2002) Group have granted the Security Trustee fixed and floating charges over the assets and
undertakings of the Dignity (2002) Group;
• Dignity Holdings No. 2 Limited has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the
shares (and any monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity Holdings Limited;
• Dignity Holdings Limited has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares
(and any monies receivable in respect of the shares) which its holds in Dignity Mezzco Limited;
• Dignity Holdings Limited has also assigned to the Security Trustee by way of security with full title guarantee, its right
title and interest in the loans (both interest and non interest bearing) to Dignity Mezzco Limited;
• Dignity (2004) Limited has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares
(and any monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity (2002) Limited; and 
• Dignity Mezzco Limited has also assigned to the Security Trustee by way of security with full title guarantee, its right
and interest in the loan to Dignity (2002) Limited.

Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007
MAC_RF63322_C1  8/4/08  08:27  Page 69 30 Contingent liabilities (continued)
At 28 December 2007, the amount outstanding in relation to these borrowings was £284.2 million (2006: £287.0 million).
In the opinion of the Directors no liability is likely to crystallise in respect of these guarantees.
On 28 August 2007, the Group acquired the trade and assets of seven funeral locations. As part of this acquisition
there is a contingent consideration clause, payable during 2009. The maximum amount payable in accordance with
this clause is £1.8 million. However, at 28 December 2007, no provision has been recognised in respect of this clause
as the Board do not believe that any further consideration will be payable, based on information currently available.
31 Related party transactions
The ultimate controlling party of the Group is Dignity plc.
Pre–arrangement trusts 
During the period the Group entered into transactions with the Trusts associated with the pre–arranged funeral plan
businesses. The nature of the relationship with the Trusts is set out in the accounting polices. Transactions represent:
• Expenses paid by the Group on behalf of the respective Trusts;
• Transfers of funds in relation to payments in respect of deaths and cancellations of existing members;
• The recovery of marketing and administration expenses in relation to plans sold net of cancellations; and
• The payment of realised surpluses generated by the Trust funds as and when the trustees sanction such payments.
Related party transactions are summarised below:

Age Concern
On 8 January 2007, the Group acquired all the allotted and issued ordinary B shares in Advance Planning Limited
from Age Concern Enterprises Limited, for consideration of £2 million. As the Group already owned all the allotted
and issued ordinary A shares of Advance Planning Limited, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group on this
date and Age Concern Enterprises Limited ceased to be a related party on this date.
The Group paid commissions to Age Concern Enterprises Limited that relate to the period to 8 January 2007 totalling
£0.2 million (52 week period ended 29 December 2006: £2.3 million).
32 Post balance sheet events
The Group acquired six funeral locations subsequent to the balance sheet date for total consideration of £4.4 million.
The latest Budget Report was issued on 12 March 2008, the day before the release of this annual report. Accordingly,
it is too early to have completed any detailed analysis on any new proposals announced by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. The Group will make appropriate announcements in due course as required by the Listing Rules if any
aspect is considered to have a material effect on the Group’s earnings.
However, further legislation is anticipated in respect of Industrial Buildings Allowances. If this is substantially enacted
in the form expected in 2008, then this will result in a one off charge to the income statement of £0.5 million.

MAC_RF63322_C1  8/4/08  08:27  Page 70 We have audited the parent company financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended 28 December
2007 which comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes. These parent company financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended
28 December 2007.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent
company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members
as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our
opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
The information given in the Directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the Business Review and
Financial Review that is cross referred from the principal activities and Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent
company financial statements.The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement,
the Chief Executive’s Overview, the Business Review, the Financial Review, the Corporate and Social Responsibility
Report, the unaudited section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Corporate Governance Statement. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 28 December 2007;
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.

MAC_RF63322_C1  8/4/08  08:27  Page 72 C1 Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention and in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been
consistently applied, is set out below.
In accordance with the concession granted under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account
of the Company has not been separately presented in the financial statements.
In the current period, the Company’s financial statements have been prepared for the 52 week period ended
28 December 2007. For the comparative period, the Company’s financial statements have been prepared for the 
52 week period ended 29 December 2006.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 1, Cash Flow Statements and has not prepared
a cash flow statement as the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements of Dignity plc, which
include a cash flow statement.
Furthermore, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided within FRS 8, Related Party Transactions,
not to disclose transactions with subsidiary undertakings, 90 per cent or more of whose voting rights are controlled
within the Group.
Furthermore, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided within FRS 29, Financial Instruments and
Disclosures, not to disclose details of any financial instruments held.
Implementation of UITF 44
During the period, the Group has adopted UITF 44 in respect of share option schemes, which has required a prior
year adjustment to the Company’s financial statements. As a result, the charge for such schemes is recognised in a
subsidiary of the Company. The Company’s financial statements now reflect the cost of the scheme as an increase in
the cost of investment in the subsidiary. The financial impact for the Company is to decrease the reported net assets
at 29 December 2006 by £0.4 million. This represents a £1.4 million increase in investments and a £1.8 million
reduction in deferred taxation.
Fixed assets investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at historical cost, less any provision for impairment.
Impairment of fixed assets
The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or at the end of the first full financial year following the
recognition. Any impairment in the value of fixed assets below depreciated historical cost is charged to the profit and
loss account within operating profit. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account to
the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Employee share schemes
The Company operates two employee share schemes: The Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’) and Long Term Incentive
Plan Scheme (‘LTIP’).
The expected fair value of the share options awarded under the LTIP scheme are charged to the profit and loss account
over the period in which the right to the options is earned. The fair value is calculated by reference to the market value of
the shares at the date on which the options are awarded reduced by any consideration payable by the relevant employee.
Details of Directors’ remuneration can be found in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 23 to 29.
Taxation including deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are regarded as more likely
than not to be recoverable. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Employee share trust 
The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the Directors consider that
Dignity plc has de facto control. In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts and the substance of the
transaction, the trust’s assets and liabilities are recognised in the Company’s balance sheet within share capital
and reserves.

the Company to allot relevant securities (within the meaning of Section 80 of the Act) up to an aggregate nominal
amount of £1,138,337 provided that (unless previously revoked, varied or renewed) such authority shall expire at

Special Business

equity securities respectively attributable to the interests of all ordinary shareholders are proportionate (as
nearly as may be) to the respective number of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company (‘Ordinary Shares’)

nominal amount of £284,584;
and (unless previously revoked, varied or renewed) shall expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General

conferred hereby had not expired.
This power applies in relation to the sale of shares, which is an allotment of equity securities by virtue of
Section 94(3A) of the Act as if in the first paragraph of this resolution the words ‘pursuant to the authority conferred
by the previous resolution’ were omitted.

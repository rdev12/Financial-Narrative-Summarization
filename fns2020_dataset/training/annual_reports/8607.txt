Chairman’s letter
David Tyler
Chairman
Dear shareholder,
Your Board is pleased to report 
on what has been a good year for 
Sainsbury’s. We have continued 
to outperform the market for a 
number of years by remaining 
true to our values of providing 
great quality, service and value  
to our customers. 
Underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 was	 up	 7.1	 per	 cent	 to	 £712	 million.	
Underlying	 earnings	 per	 share	 were	 up	 6.0	 per	 cent	 to	 28.1	
pence.	 This	 year,	 your	 Board	 recommends	 a	 final	 dividend	 of	 	
11.6	 pence	 per	 share,	 making	 a	 full-year	 dividend	 of	 16.1	 pence,	
which	 is	 an	 increase	 of	 6.6	 per	 cent	 over	 the	 previous	 year,	
covered	 1.75	 times	 by	 underlying	 earnings.	 Sainsbury’s	 remains	
focused	 on	 delivering	 returns	 to	 shareholders.	 The	 Board	 plans	
to	 increase	 the	 dividend	 each	 year	 and	 now	 intends	 to	 build	
cover	 to	 two	 times	 over	 the	 medium	 term.	
A winning team
I	 would	 like	 to	 thank	 all	 of	 our	 colleagues	 for	 their	 efforts	
in	 providing	 excellent	 service	 to	 our	 customers.	 Our	 people	
are,	 of	 course,	 the	 face	 of	 Sainsbury’s,	 and	 are	 central	 to	 our	
ongoing	 success.	 We	 continue	 to	 invest	 in	 their	 training	 and	
development,	 and	 in	 ensuring	 Sainsbury’s	 is	 a	 great	 place	 to	
work.	 I	 am	 delighted	 that	 they	 share	 in	 a	 bonus	 of	 over	 £60	
million	 this	 year,	 meaning	 that	 over	 the	 last	 five	 years	 we	 will	
have	 awarded	 over	 £300	 million	 to	 colleagues	 in	 this	 way.
This	 year	 we	 have	 added	 strength	 and	 depth	 to	 our	
management	 team.	 In	 January	 2012,	 Sarah	 Warby	 joined	 the	
Operating	 Board	 as	 Marketing	 Director,	 having	 previously	 	
been	 UK	 Marketing	 Director	 at	 Heineken.	 We	 also	 changed	
two	 roles	 on	 the	 Operating	 Board	 in	 March	 2012.	 Helen	 Buck,	
previously	 Convenience	 Director,	 became	 Retail	 Director	
responsible	 for	 performance	 across	 our	 supermarket	 estate;	
and	 Roger	 Burnley,	 previously	 Retail	 and	 Logistics	 Director,	
became	 Managing	 Director,	 General	 Merchandise,	 Clothing	 	
and	 Logistics,	 leading	 our	 growing	 non-food	 business	 while	
retaining	 responsibility	 for	 logistics.	 		 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 2012	 J Sainsbury plc 3
Chairman’s letter continued
In	 May	 2012	 we	 announced	 that	 Bob	 Stack	 has	 decided	 to	
stand	 down	 as	 a	 Non-Executive	 Director	 of	 our	 plc	 Board	 at	 the	
AGM	 in	 July	 2012.	 I	 would	 like	 to	 thank	 Bob	 for	 his	 outstanding	
contribution	 since	 his	 appointment	 in	 January	 2005,	 both	
as	 a	 valued	 member	 of	 the	 Board	 and	 as	 Chairman	 of	 our	
Remuneration	 Committee.	 During	 his	 tenure,	 the	 Remuneration	
Committee	 has	 progressively	 introduced	 a	 range	 of	 plans	 which	
have	 effectively	 incentivised	 management	 through	 the	 recovery	
and	 growth	 phases	 of	 the	 last	 seven	 and	 a	 half	 years,	 which	 has	
been	 very	 much	 in	 shareholders’	 best	 interests.	 Sainsbury’s	
has	 developed	 a	 sound	 reputation	 for	 strong	 governance	 of	
remuneration	 while	 he	 has	 chaired	 the	 Committee.
Mary	 Harris	 will	 succeed	 Bob	 as	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Committee	 and	
we	 are	 currently	 conducting	 a	 search	 for	 a	 new	 Non-Executive	
Director	 to	 join	 the	 Board.	
The value of our values 
Our	 unique	 values	 and	 strong	 culture	 are	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 the	
Company’s	 success.	 This	 remains	 as	 true	 today	 as	 it	 was	 143	
years	 ago.	 In	 October	 2011,	 we	 published	 a	 new	 20	 by	 20	
Sustainability	 Plan	 with	 bold	 targets.	 We	 believe	 they	 are	 key	
to	 the	 long-term	 sustainability	 of	 our	 business	 and	 can	 bring	
increased	 sales,	 deeper	 customer	 loyalty	 and	 greater	 efficiency,	
as	 well	 as	 improved	 colleague	 development	 and	 satisfaction,	 	
all	 ultimately	 contributing	 to	 shareholder	 value.
Outlook
The	 wider	 economic	 situation	 looks	 likely	 to	 remain	 uncertain,	
but	 by	 helping	 our	 customers	 make	 their	 money	 go	 further	
and	 Live Well for Less,	 we	 have	 demonstrated	 we	 can	 succeed	
against	 this	 backdrop.	 Furthermore,	 the	 business	 has	 some	
exciting	 growth	 opportunities	 including	 our	 multi-channel	
strategy	 to	 help	 our	 customers	 to	 shop	 the	 way	 they	 want,	 and	
our	 store	 space	 strategy	 which	 brings	 our	 great	 food,	 clothing	
and	 general	 merchandise	 to	 new	 customers.
We	 have	 laid	 strong	 foundations	 for	 growth.	 Your	 Board	 believes	
these	 will	 allow	 us	 to	 achieve	 our	 vision	 to	 be	 the	 most	 trusted	
retailer	 where	 people	 love	 to	 work	 and	 shop.

Chief Executive’s letter
Dear shareholder,
Having achieved 29 quarters 
of like-for-like sales growth, 
Sainsbury’s is not only a strong 
business with a successful core 
of food and non-food retailing, 
but also a business with real 
opportunities for further growth. 
We remain focused on doing 
a great job for customers and 
helping them Live Well for Less.
Our	 market	 share	 is	 its	 highest	 for	 nearly	 a	 decade,	 driven	 by	
underlying	 market	 beating	 like-for-like	 sales	 growth	 of	 2.1	 per	
cent	 excluding	 fuel.	 In	 the	 business	 review	 you	 will	 see	 how	
we	 are	 building	 towards	 a	 future	 of	 continued	 success.	 We	 are	
confident	 that	 our	 investment	 plans	 will	 drive	 further	 growth,	
while	 contributing	 to	 additional	 improvements	 in	 returns.	 	
Helping customers Live Well for Less
We	 believe	 in	 quality	 for	 everyone,	 in	 everything	 we	 do.	 We	 now	
have	 22	 million	 customer	 transactions	 a	 week,	 an	 increase	 of	
one	 million	 on	 last	 year.	 We	 have	 succeeded	 by	 understanding	
what	 our	 customers	 want	 and	 delivering	 universal	 appeal	 to	
help	 them	 Live Well for Less.	 They	 want	 a	 great	 deal,	 whether	
they	 are	 on	 a	 tight	 budget,	 have	 a	 bit	 more	 to	 spend	 or	 simply	
want	 to	 treat	 themselves.	 In	 Brand Match	 we	 now	 have	 the	 best	
and	 simplest	 tool	 in	 the	 market	 to	 help	 customers	 appreciate	
our	 great	 value.	 Similarly,	 our	 Nectar	 loyalty	 programme	
continues	 to	 be	 a	 key	 source	 of	 competitive	 advantage.	 The	 data	
enables	 us	 to	 understand	 our	 customers	 better	 and	 to	 offer	
them	 efficient,	 meaningful	 and	 targeted	 promotions,	 which	 in	
turn	 helps	 us	 increase	 customer	 loyalty.
Great food
Offering	 great	 food	 at	 fair	 prices	 remains	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 what	
we	 do.	 While	 price	 remains	 important,	 customers	 do	 not	 want	
to	 compromise	 on	 quality	 and	 demand	 great	 service.	 We	 have	
invested	 heavily	 in	 this	 over	 recent	 years	 and	 will	 continue	 to	
do	 so.	 One	 of	 our	 20 by 20 Sustainability Plan	 commitments	
is	 to	 double	 the	 amount	 of	 British	 food	 we	 sell	 by	 2020,	 and	
this	 year	 we	 sold	 more	 British	 produce	 than	 ever	 before.	 Our	
own	 label	 investment	 goes	 from	 strength	 to	 strength	 and	 we	
are	 seeing	 tangible	 results,	 with	 nearly	 nine	 per	 cent	 growth	 in	
Taste the Difference,	 over	 half	 of	 our	 by	 Sainsbury’s	 products	
improved	 and	 re-launched,	 and	 basics	 now	 the	 second	 biggest	
supermarket	 value	 brand.
Opportunities for continuing growth
Justin King
Chief	 Executive
Business	 review 		 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 2012	 J Sainsbury plc 5
Chief Executive’s letter continued
Compelling general merchandise and clothing
Our	 general	 merchandise	 and	 clothing	 businesses	 continue	 to	
grow	 faster	 than	 our	 food	 business	 and	 gain	 share	 in	 fiercely	
competitive	 markets.	 Direct	 sourcing,	 in	 particular,	 has	 helped	
us	 forge	 better	 relationships	 with	 our	 suppliers	 and	 provide	
better	 deals	 for	 our	 customers.	 		
Complementary channels and services
Customers	 expect	 to	 shop	 whenever,	 wherever	 and	 however	
best	 suits	 them.	 We	 see	 the	 opportunities	 this	 provides	 and	
are	 integrating	 new	 technology,	 channels	 and	 services	 into	 our	
business	 to	 serve	 customers	 in	 new	 ways.	 We	 have	 the	 fastest-
growing	 online	 business	 of	 any	 major	 food	 retailer.	 We	 have	 a	
convenience	 business	 of	 scale	 that	 is	 expanding	 by	 one	 to	 two	
stores	 a	 week,	 growing	 total	 and	 like-for-like	 sales	 well	 ahead	 of	
the	 market,	 and	 helping	 customers	 to	 shop	 locally	 and	 manage	
their	 weekly	 bills.	 We	 already	 have	 a	 Click & Collect	 facility	 in	
over	 900	 stores,	 one	 of	 the	 UK’s	 largest	 networks,	 designed	
to	 make	 shopping	 easier	 and	 more	 flexible.	 We	 will	 continue	 to	
invest	 in	 these	 channels,	 and	 to	 find	 new	 ways	 to	 improve	 the	
customer	 experience.
Developing new business
We	 are	 also	 investing	 beyond	 our	 core	 and	 developing	 new	
business.	 By	 moving	 into	 areas	 that	 are	 a	 natural	 extension	 	
of	 our	 brand	 –	 such	 as	 banking,	 pharmacy	 and	 energy	 –	 we	 aim	
to	 grow	 value	 based	 on	 the	 trust	 people	 have	 in	 Sainsbury’s,	
our	 colleagues	 and	 our	 values.	 Sainsbury’s	 Bank	 has	 enjoyed	
another	 successful	 year	 with	 a	 40	 per	 cent	 increase	 in	 pre-
tax	 operating	 profit.	 Our	 strategy	 of	 rewarding	 Sainsbury’s	
shoppers	 with	 double	 Nectar	 points	 for	 choosing	 to	 bank	 with	
us	 has	 been	 a	 major	 factor	 in	 this	 growth.	
Growing space and creating property value
Growing	 our	 UK	 sales	 space	 remains	 central	 to	 our	 strategy.	
This	 year	 we	 opened	 a	 further	 1.4	 million	 sq	 ft	 of	 space,	
adding	 19	 new	 supermarkets	 and	 73	 new	 convenience	 stores	
to	 our	 estate.	 We	 also	 extended	 28	 stores	 by	 an	 average	 of	
18,000	 sq	 ft,	 as	 we	 continue	 to	 bring	 our	 non-food	 ranges	 to	
more	 UK	 customers.	 There	 are	 areas	 of	 the	 country	 where	 we	
do	 not	 yet	 have	 a	 strong	 presence,	 and	 we	 continue	 to	 expand	
our	 coverage	 to	 reach	 them.	 At	 the	 same	 time	 we	 are	 also	
creating	 valuable	 property	 assets	 for	 our	 shareholders	 and	 our	
property	 estate	 is	 now	 valued	 at	 £11.2	 billion,	 with	 development	
activity	 delivering	 £83	 million	 property	 profits	 this	 year.	 We	 will	
continue	 to	 use	 these	 assets	 to	 help	 fund	 our	 growth.
Operational excellence
When	 we	 invest	 in	 new	 stores,	 technology	 or	 processes,	
we	 do	 so	 with	 strict	 control	 of	 the	 capital	 spent	 to	 ensure	
appropriate	 returns.	 By	 carefully	 managing	 costs	 we	 have	
improved	 operating	 margins	 yet	 further,	 with	 over	 £100	
million	 of	 operational	 savings	 this	 year,	 contributing	 to	 almost	
£600	 million	 of	 cost	 savings	 over	 five	 years.	 This	 is	 a	 result	
of	 improved	 productivity,	 ongoing	 procurement	 savings	 and	
simplification	 of	 in-store	 processes.	
“
  Our customers trust Sainsbury’s  
to do the right thing and expect 
us to maintain high social, 
ethical and environmental 
standards across all aspects  
of our business.”
Our values make us different
We	 have	 a	 clear	 vision:	 to	 be	 the	 most	 trusted	 retailer,	 where	
people	 love	 to	 work	 and	 shop.	 Our	 goal	 is	 to	 make	 all	 our	
customers’	 lives	 easier	 every	 day	 by	 offering	 great	 quality	
and	 service	 at	 fair	 prices.	 Our	 values	 are	 critical	 to	 achieving	
this.	 Our	 customers	 trust	 Sainsbury’s	 to	 do	 the	 right	 thing	 and	
expect	 us	 to	 maintain	 high	 social,	 ethical	 and	 environmental	
standards	 across	 all	 aspects	 of	 our	 business.	 Our	 values	 are	
part	 of	 what	 make	 us	 different	 from	 other	 supermarkets,	 so	 	
we	 see	 this	 as	 a	 strength,	 as	 well	 as	 a	 responsibility.	 In	 October	
2011,	 we	 published	 our	 20 by 20 Sustainability Plan	 to	 ensure	 	
we	 continue	 to	 lead	 in	 this	 aspect	 of	 business,	 and	 derive	 	
long-term,	 sustainable	 advantage	 from	 it.	
One	 example	 of	 this	 is	 carbon:	 our	 absolute	 electricity	
consumption	 for	 supermarkets	 has	 reduced	 by	 9.1	 per	 cent	 	
over	 the	 past	 four	 years,	 despite	 an	 increase	 in	 space	 of	 	
25	 per	 cent.	 It	 is	 this	 approach	 which	 has	 led	 to	 Sainsbury’s	
being	 rated	 the	 highest	 performer	 relative	 to	 our	 sector	 	
across	 all	 three	 pillars	 of	 environmental,	 social	 and	 governance	
practices	 in	 the	 internationally	 respected	 FTSE4Good	 Index.
Looking forward
As	 we	 look	 to	 the	 year	 ahead,	 we	 do	 so	 with	 the	 benefits	 of	 	
our	 clear	 strategy,	 customer	 insight	 and	 strong	 culture.	 We	 are	
demonstrating	 that	 delivering	 quality	 and	 value	 is	 a	 compelling	
offer	 for	 customers.	 The	 economic	 climate	 is	 likely	 to	 remain	
challenging	 and	 we	 are	 committed	 to	 helping	 customers	 Live 
Well for Less.	 However,	 in	 the	 year	 ahead,	 there	 are	 many	
reasons	 to	 be	 cheerful	 as	 a	 nation.	 We	 know	 our	 customers	 	
trust	 us	 to	 make	 their	 celebrations	 truly	 special	 and	 memorable	
–	 from	 national	 occasions	 like	 the	 Diamond	 Jubilee,	 Olympics	
and	 Paralympics,	 to	 more	 personal	 and	 family	 events.	 	
We	 are	 focused	 on	 ensuring	 that	 we	 continue	 to	 succeed	 for	
our	 customers,	 our	 colleagues	 and,	 of	 course	 for	 you	 our	
shareholders,	 in	 what	 is	 set	 to	 be	 a	 year	 like	 no	 other.

Market overview
Our marketplace
The UK economic climate 
continued to be challenging  
for customers in 2011/12
Over	 the	 last	 three	 years	 inflation	 has	 increased	 faster	 than	
wages
1
,	 putting	 pressure	 on	 customers	 and	 affecting	 consumer	
confidence
2
.	
The	 economic	 downturn	 has	 changed	 how	 and	 what	 consumers	
buy,	 and	 these	 changes	 appear	 to	 be	 lasting.	 There	 has	 been	
a	 significant	 shift	 towards	 cooking	 more	 meals	 from	 scratch,	
shopping	 more	 frequently	 to	 manage	 waste	 and	 spend,	 and	
looking	 out	 for	 discounts	 and	 deals
3
.	
Although	 these	 trends	 have	 been	 developing	 since	 the	
beginning	 of	 the	 downturn,	 2011/12	 saw	 a	 further	 decline	 in	
food	 sales	 volumes.	 This	 change	 in	 customer	 behaviour,	 driven	
particularly	 by	 an	 increase	 in	 petrol	 prices	 to	 over	 £1.30	 per	
litre,	 made	 delivering	 profitable	 sales	 growth	 more	 challenging	
than	 ever	 and,	 while	 inflation	 kept	 total	 sales	 growing,	 the	 profit	
pool	 delivered	 by	 the	 industry	 declined

.
Succeeding	 and	 growing	 market	 share

	 in	 this	 environment	
requires	 better	 customer	 understanding	 than	 ever.	 Through	 	
our	 Nectar	 loyalty	 scheme	 we	 have	 a	 wealth	 of	 data	 about	 	
our	 customers’	 behaviour.	 We	 combine	 this	 with	 listening	 	
and	 engaging	 customers,	 across	 a	 broad	 range	 of	 channels,	 	
to	 create	 real	 insight.

Market overview continued
We	 believe	 our	 customer	 insight	 and	 understanding	 is	 best-in-
class.	 This	 is	 what	 informed	 our	 Live Well for Less	 campaign,	
which	 we	 launched	 in	 the	 year.	 While	 many	 in	 the	 market	
thought	 that	 the	 economic	 environment	 meant	 low	 prices	 would	
be	 the	 primary	 motivator	 in	 supermarket	 choice,	 our	 research	
told	 us	 that	 customers	 were	 looking	 for	 real	 value:	 quality	
without	 compromise	 at	 good	 prices.	
We	 saw	 that	 customers	 were	 shopping	 more	 frequently	 and	
locally	 to	 reduce	 food	 waste,	 and	 pressed	 ahead	 with	 our	
convenience	 growth	 plans.	 We	 recognised	 that,	 more	 than	 ever,	
customers	 are	 looking	 for	 reasons	 to	 celebrate,	 and	 we	 helped	
them	 do	 so	 at	 the	 Royal	 Wedding,	 Halloween	 and	 Christmas,	
driving	 market	 outperformance.	 Despite	 the	 economic	 pressure	
customers	 face,	 we	 saw	 that	 they	 were	 not	 compromising	 on	
their	 values;	 donations	 to	 Sport	 Relief	 increased,	 and	 sales	 of	
fairly	 traded	 and	 higher	 animal	 welfare	 products	 continued	
to	 grow.

Apple	 harvesting	 at	 the	 Blackmoor	 Estate	 orchard	
in	 Hampshire	 takes	 place	 each	 year	 from	 August	
to	 October,	 supplying	 us	 with	 eight	 varieties.	 We	
are	 the	 largest	 retailer	 of	 British	 apples	 and	 pears,	
selling	 a	 third	 of	 all	 those	 bought	 in	 the	 UK. 		 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 2012	 J Sainsbury plc 13
Business	 review
Investment	 in	 our	 supply	 chain	 ensures	 we	 are	 frequently	
the	 quickest	 to	 market	 on	 key	 fresh	 lines,	 with	 some	 British	
vegetables	 going	 from	 field	 to	 store	 in	 an	 industry-leading	 	
48	 hours.	 With	 Jersey	 Royal	 potatoes,	 for	 example,	 we	 wash	
and	 pack	 them	 on	 the	 island	 to	 ensure	 they	 arrive	 in	 store	 as	
quickly	 as	 possible.	
Our	 focus	 on	 fresh	 food	 is	 closely	 related	 to	 our	 20	 by	 20	
commitment	 to	 double	 the	 amount	 of	 British	 food	 we	 sell	
by	 2020.	 This	 will	 help	 develop	 British	 farming	 and	 protect	
livelihoods,	 while	 reducing	 food	 miles	 and	 delivering	 fresh,	
healthy,	 nutritious	 food	 to	 the	 table.	 Developing	 ever	 closer	 links	
with	 farmers	 is	 key	 to	 our	 continuing	 leadership	 in	 this	 area.	 For	
example,	 we	 are	 the	 largest	 retailer	 of	 British	 apples	 and	 pears,	
selling	 a	 third	 of	 all	 those	 bought	 in	 the	 UK.	 We	 are	 working	 to	
preserve	 traditional	 British	 varieties,	 as	 well	 as	 introducing	 new	
ones	 to	 the	 UK.	 This	 year	 our	 customers	 will	 see	 more	 British	
food	 in	 our	 stores	 than	 ever	 before,	 from	 early	 season	 lamb	
through	 to	 chillies	 grown	 in	 northern	 England	 and	 blueberries	
from	 Scotland.
We	 have	 also	 continued	 to	 expand	 and	 improve	 our	 fresh	 food	
service	 counters.	 We	 have	 trained	 18,000	 colleagues	 in	 our	
bakery	 college	 and	 six	 food	 colleges.	 Their	 service,	 skills	 and	
expertise	 have	 resulted	 in	 sales	 from	 our	 counters	 growing	
faster	 than	 at	 any	 other	 retailer.	 We	 were	 delighted	 in	 June	
2011	 when	 City	 &	 Guilds	 formally	 accredited	 the	 high	 standards	
of	 training	 available	 at	 these	 colleges,	 which	 includes	 bakery,	
fishmonger,	 butchery	 and	 delicatessen	 skills	 –	 the	 largest	
accreditation	 of	 its	 kind	 in	 the	 UK.
Fresh food remains 
central to our business 
and its success. It is a 
key battleground for 
UK supermarkets, 
with today’s savvy 
shoppers having high 
expectations about 
the quality, value and 
integrity of their food,  
particularly fresh 
produce.  
Customers	 are	 turning	 to	 our	 own	 brand	 items	 for	 quality	 and	
value,	 and	 shopping	 across	 the	 whole	 range.	 Our	 Taste	 the	
Difference	 and	 basics	 brands	 are	 both	 performing	 particularly	
well,	 and	 appear	 side-by-side	 in	 many	 baskets,	 showing	 that	
even	 within	 a	 single	 shopping	 trip	 customers	 are	 saving	 on	
some	 items	 to	 treat	 themselves	 on	 others.	 Our	 basics	 range	 is	
now	 the	 second	 biggest	 selling	 supermarket	 value	 brand,	 with	
sales	 growing	 6.8	 per	 cent	 in	 the	 year,	 driven	 by	 purchases	 of	
store	 cupboard	 essentials	 and	 ingredients	 for	 home	 cooking.	
Taste	 the	 Difference	 grew	 by	 8.7	 per	 cent,	 gaining	 market	 share	
in	 the	 premium	 tier,	 and	 was	 particularly	 popular	 at	 Christmas	
2011.	 The	 re-launch	 of	 our	 core	 own	 label	 brand	 by	 Sainsbury’s,	
is	 well	 under	 way.	 Over	 half	 way	 through	 the	 programme	 with	
3,700	 lines	 launched,	 re-introduced	 or	 refreshed,	 we	 are	 already	
seeing	 3.1	 per	 cent	 growth.
Ethically	 traded	 goods	 are	 also	 important	 to	 our	 business	 and	
we	 are	 the	 largest	 Fairtrade	 retailer	 in	 the	 world.	 Our	 customers	
expect	 us	 to	 do	 the	 right	 thing	 by	 our	 suppliers	 and	 source	 our	
products	 with	 integrity.	 We	 sold	 over	 £12	 million	 of	 Fairtrade	
goods	 during	 Fairtrade	 Fortnight	 in	 February	 2012,	 an	 11	 per	 cent	
increase	 on	 last	 year.	 We	 are	 well	 on	 the	 way	 to	 reaching	 our	
20	 by	 20	 commitment	 for	 sales	 of	 our	 fairly	 traded	 products	
to	 hit	 £1	 billion	 by	 2020,	 with	 over	 £288	 million	 sales	 this	 year.	
We	 are	 the	 UK’s	 leading	 retailer	 of	 Freedom	 Food	 products,	
which	 ensure	 animals	 are	 raised	 to	 rigorous	 and	 higher	 RSPCA	
welfare	 standards.	 We	 offer	 both	 the	 widest	 range	 of	 Freedom	
Food	 products	 with	 over	 300	 lines,	 and	 sell	 more	 than	 any	 other	
retailer,	 with	 over	 50	 per	 cent	 market	 share.

As	 we	 develop	 our	 store	 estate,	 we	 have	 expanded	 our	 ability	
to	 offer	 non-food.	 We	 now	 have	 161	 stores	 selling	 our	 larger	 	
non-food	 offer,	 22	 more	 than	 last	 year.	 	
We	 have	 a	 clear	 strategy	 based	 on	 offering	 high	 street	 style	
at	 supermarket	 prices	 in	 a	 way	 which	 makes	 the	 most	 of	 our	
strength	 in	 great	 food.	 We	 focus	 first	 on	 giving	 customers	
the	 best	 possible	 food	 and	 then	 add	 our	 compelling	 range	 of	
general	 merchandise	 and	 clothing.	 We	 are	 also	 clear	 about	
which	 areas	 of	 non-food	 we	 focus	 on.	 Our	 ‘hero’	 categories,	
which	 complement	 and	 add	 value	 to	 our	 core	 business,	 are	
womenswear,	 childrenswear,	 cookshop,	 home,	 papershop	
and	 seasonal.	
In	 clothing,	 TU	 is	 the	 UK’s	 seventh	 largest	 clothing	 brand	 by	
volume,	 and	 sixth	 for	 childrenswear.	 Last	 year,	 we	 announced	 a	
partnership	 with	 TV	 personality	 Gok	 Wan,	 to	 create	 a	 number	 of	
womenswear	 collections	 with	 us.	 We	 launched	 his	 debut	 range,	
Gok	 for	 TU,	 in	 October	 2011	 with	 the	 second	 collection	 launched	
just	 six	 weeks	 later	 in	 anticipation	 of	 the	 Christmas	 season,	
and	 the	 third	 in	 March	 2012.	 It	 is	 available	 in	 over	 200	 stores	
with	 prices	 from	 £20.	 In	 childrenswear	 we	 saw	 record-breaking	
schoolwear	 sales,	 up	 38	 per	 cent	 on	 the	 year,	 and	 in	 our	 peak	
week	 we	 sold	 over	 100,000	 pairs	 of	 trousers	 and	 over	 140,000	
polo	 shirts.	
Our general 
merchandise and 
clothing businesses 
continue to grow  
faster than our food 
business and continue 
to gain market share. 
In	 our	 home	 ranges,	 we	 improved	 and	 re-branded	 our	 top	 tier	
cookshop	 items	 as	 Cook’s Collection,	 increasing	 sales	 by	 89	 per	
cent	 on	 its	 predecessor	 Different	 by	 Design.	 Our	 July	 2011	 home	
event	 was	 our	 biggest	 ever,	 with	 customers	 snapping	 up	 our	
great	 value	 TU	 cookshop	 and	 tableware	 ranges.	 Our	 range	 of	
cast	 iron	 casserole	 dishes	 and	 pans	 continues	 to	 be	 a	 best	 seller,	
with	 over	 127,000	 units	 sold	 since	 its	 introduction	 in	 autumn	
2010.	 We	 also	 launched	 three	 cookery	 books,	 Summer	 Recipe	
Collection,	 Classics	 Recipe	 Collection	 and	 Cook	 Britain,	 with	
sales	 of	 own	 brand	 cookery	 books	 reaching	 almost	 300,000	
copies	 since	 initial	 launch.	
We	 are	 increasing	 the	 amount	 of	 general	 merchandise	 products	
we	 source	 direct	 from	 suppliers,	 rather	 than	 through	 a	 third	
party,	 and	 now	 have	 sourcing	 offices	 in	 China,	 Hong	 Kong	 and	
Bangladesh.	 These	 closer	 relationships	 help	 us	 to	 secure	 better	
prices	 leading	 to	 better	 value	 for	 our	 customers.	 Direct	 sourcing	
also	 makes	 it	 easier	 to	 ensure	 our	 suppliers	 adhere	 to	 our	
rigorous	 ethical	 and	 quality	 standards.	 Buying	 more	 directly	 	
and	 on	 shorter	 lead	 times	 improves	 our	 flexibility	 and	 enables	
us	 to	 react	 quickly	 to	 sales	 and	 trends,	 a	 factor	 particularly	
important	 in	 clothing.

Business	 review
Sainsbury’s	 Bank	 has	 enjoyed	 another	 successful	 year,	 with	
pre-tax	 operating	 profit	 up	 40	 per	 cent.	 Our	 strategy	 of	
rewarding	 Sainsbury’s	 shoppers	 with	 double	 Nectar	 points	 for	
choosing	 to	 bank	 with	 us	 has	 been	 a	 major	 factor	 in	 this	 growth,	
with	 the	 offer	 now	 available	 on	 six	 key	 products.	 In	 particular	 	
we	 have	 used	 Nectar	 with	 great	 success	 for	 our	 new	 home	 	
and	 car	 insurance	 products,	 offering	 preferential	 pricing	 and	
double	 Nectar	 points.	 Nectar	 also	 plays	 a	 vital	 role	 in	 the	 	
Bank’s	 marketing	 activity.	
Following	 a	 successful	 re-launch,	 our	 sales	 of	 car	 insurance	
increased	 by	 almost	 150	 per	 cent	 year-on-year.	 We	 also	
introduced	 an	 online	 ordering	 service	 for	 travel	 money,	 and	 	
now	 have	 122	 in-store	 travel	 money	 bureaux.	 Travel	 money	
turnover	 grew	 by	 almost	 85	 per	 cent	 year-on-year.
Once	 again,	 the	 Bank	 was	 recognised	 by	 a	 number	 of	 high-
profile	 consumer	 and	 industry	 awards	 including:	 Best	 Low	 Rate	
Credit	 Card	 Provider	 (Moneynet	 2012),	 Best	 Personal	 Loan	
Provider	 (Moneyfacts	 2011	 and	 Consumer	 Moneyfacts	 2012),	
Best	 Direct	 Home	 Insurance	 Provider	 (Your	 Money	 Direct	 2011)	
and	 Best	 Overall	 Online	 Provider	 (Your	 Money	 Direct	 2011).
We	 are	 now	 expanding	 our	 pharmacy	 offer.	 Our	 research	 	
shows	 that	 many	 people	 are	 more	 likely	 to	 discuss	 common	 	
or	 minor	 ailments	 with	 a	 pharmacist	 than	 with	 their	 GP.	 Many	
are	 already	 using	 our	 pharmacy	 services,	 with	 flu	 vaccinations	
at	 Sainsbury’s	 up	 over	 40	 per	 cent	 on	 last	 year	 and	 cholesterol	
testing	 up	 over	 150	 per	 cent.	 This	 year	 we	 have	 trained	 our	
pharmacists	 as	 healthy	 eating	 advisors,	 to	 provide	 free	 	
tailored	 information	 to	 customers.	 We	 also	 believe	 our	
convenient	 locations	 and	 parking	 facilities	 make	 our	 stores	
potentially	 excellent	 locations	 for	 GP	 surgeries,	 to	 complement	
our	 pharmacies.	
We are exploring  
a range of new 
opportunities beyond 
our core business, 
looking to grow  
value based on the  
trust customers have  
in Sainsbury’s. 
In	 January	 2012,	 Newton	 Abbot	 became	 our	 fifth	 store	 to	 have	 a	
GP	 surgery,	 while	 five	 of	 our	 stores	 also	 host	 dental	 surgeries.	 In	
addition,	 we	 were	 delighted	 to	 open	 our	 first	 hospital	 outpatient	
pharmacy,	 at	 James	 Cook	 University	 Hospital	 in	 South	 Tees.
Sainsbury’s	 Energy	 has	 over	 120	 experts	 in	 store	 each	 day	
offering	 customers	 energy	 deals,	 products	 like	 solar	 panels	
and	 insulation,	 and	 advice	 such	 as	 home	 energy	 assessments.	
Sainsbury’s	 Energy	 online	 launched	 this	 year	 and	 has	 been	 well	
received	 by	 customers,	 with	 over	 a	 third	 of	 sales	 now	 generated	
through	 this	 channel.
As	 the	 UK’s	 leading	 retail	 user	 of	 anaerobic	 digestion	 (‘AD’),	
which	 converts	 organic	 waste	 into	 energy,	 we	 became	 a	
strategic	 partner	 and	 investor	 in	 Tamar	 Energy	 Ltd	 in	 February	
2012.	 Tamar	 plans	 to	 develop	 a	 network	 of	 over	 40	 AD	 plants	
to	 generate	 100MW	 of	 green	 electricity	 over	 the	 next	 five	
years,	 enough	 to	 power	 200,000	 homes.	 By	 investing	 in	 this	
technology	 we	 not	 only	 ensure	 sustainable	 solutions	 for	 our	 	
own	 waste	 streams	 and	 energy	 requirements,	 but	 also	 offer	 	
our	 suppliers	 the	 same,	 as	 part	 of	 our	 20	 by	 20	 commitments.	
In	 October	 2011,	 we	 acquired	 online	 entertainment	 company	
Global	 Media	 Vault	 Limited	 to	 support	 our	 drive	 into	 the	 growing	
online	 and	 digital	 entertainment	 market,	 retailing	 games,	 music,	
films	 and	 books	 via	 our	 Sainsbury’s	 Entertainment	 website.

Following the roll-out 
of over 250 pharmacies

introduced five GP and 
five dental surgeries,

Growing space & creating property value

property value
Our	 Dawlish	 store	 is	 made	 entirely	 of	 timber	 from	
sustainable	 sources	 and,	 thanks	 to	 its	 environmental	
features,	 the	 store	 uses	 50	 per	 cent	 less	 energy	 from	
the	 national	 grid	 than	 a	 standard	 supermarket. 		 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 2012	 J Sainsbury plc 21
Business	 review
Our	 strategy	 for	 growing	 space	 has	 three	 principal	 strands:	
convenience	 stores,	 extensions	 and	 new	 supermarkets.	 Our	
convenience	 stores	 help	 grow	 our	 market	 share	 and	 deliver	
a	 particularly	 good	 return.	 Many	 of	 our	 supermarkets	 lend	
themselves	 to	 extensions,	 notably	 those	 with	 large	 car	 parks	
acquired	 at	 a	 time	 when	 land	 was	 cheaper.	 By	 extending	 these	
stores,	 particularly	 in	 the	 south-east,	 we	 can	 bring	 our	 clothing	
and	 general	 merchandise	 ranges	 to	 more	 customers.	 Around	 25	
per	 cent	 of	 the	 UK	 population	 is	 not	 within	 a	 15	 minute	 drive	 of	 a	
Sainsbury’s.	 Therefore	 our	 focus	 for	 new	 store	 openings	 is	 the	
North,	 the	 West,	 Wales,	 Scotland	 and	 Northern	 Ireland	 –	 areas	 	
in	 which	 Sainsbury’s	 has	 historically	 been	 under-represented	
and	 capital	 costs	 per	 sq	 ft	 are	 typically	 lower.	 This	 gives	 us	 	
the	 opportunity	 to	 expand	 our	 store	 estate	 and	 drive	 growth.	 	
By	 approaching	 our	 development	 in	 this	 way,	 focusing	 on	 	
these	 opportunities,	 and	 with	 clear	 control	 of	 capital	 sign-off,	 	
we	 ensure	 that	 all	 our	 investments,	 individually	 and	 overall,	
deliver	 good	 returns.
Our	 investments	 over	 the	 past	 three	 years	 are	 delivering	 ahead	
of	 expectations,	 above	 our	 investment	 hurdle	 rate.	 Following	
our	 fundraising	 in	 2009,	 we	 stepped	 up	 both	 our	 development	
activity	 and	 investment	 pipeline.	 Next	 year,	 we	 plan	 to	 return	 	
to	 space	 growth	 of	 around	 five	 per	 cent	 per	 annum.	 We’ll	
continue	 to	 open	 a	 mix	 of	 convenience	 stores,	 supermarkets	 	
and	 extensions	 and	 to	 ensure	 that	 our	 core	 estate	 is	 kept	
up-to-date	 and	 competitive	 through	 our	 refurbishment	
programme.	 We	 have	 a	 healthy	 future	 pipeline	 of	 space	 ready	
for	 development,	 including	 planning	 consents	 for	 almost	 	
70	 supermarket	 extensions	 and	 we	 will	 continue	 to	 manage	 	
our	 portfolio	 with	 discipline.
We	 also	 work	 with	 joint	 venture	 partners	 to	 add	 property	 value	
and	 trading	 space.	 We	 completed	 five	 extensions	 within	 our	
British	 Land	 joint	 venture,	 as	 well	 as	 securing	 planning	 consent	
for	 one	 further	 extension.	 On	 other	 projects,	 contractors	 are	
due	 to	 start	 work	 on	 our	 Fulham	 Wharf	 regeneration	 project	
We achieved our target 
of opening 1.4 million 
sq ft of gross new space 
during the year, across 
19 new supermarkets, 
28 extensions and  
73 convenience stores.

in	 summer	 2012,	 and	 our	 joint	 venture	 with	 Land	 Securities	
continues	 to	 make	 good	 progress,	 submitting	 planning	
applications	 for	 180,000	 sq	 ft	 of	 supermarket	 space	 and	 a	
further	 500,000	 sq	 ft	 of	 commercial	 floor	 space.	 Works	 to	
extend	 our	 Wandsworth	 store	 for	 mixed	 use	 development	 have	
started,	 and	 we	 have	 exchanged	 occupational	 agreements	 for	
leases	 on	 new	 stores	 in	 Salisbury	 and	 Selly	 Oak,	 Birmingham.	
This	 year,	 we	 opened	 our	 most	 northerly	 store,	 in	 Nairn,	
Scotland	 on	 the	 same	 day	 as	 we	 opened	 our	 latest	
environmental	 store,	 in	 Dawlish,	 Devon,	 600	 miles	 away.	 In	
December	 2011	 we	 opened	 our	 1,000th	 store,	 in	 Irvine,	 Scotland.	
Our	 new	 space	 programme	 has	 increased	 the	 value	 of	 our	
property	 to	 an	 estimated	 £11.2	 billion.	 When	 stores	 are	 fully	
developed,	 we	 review	 them	 for	 potential	 sale	 and	 lease	 back,	 to	
release	 capital	 to	 reinvest	 in	 profitable	 growth.	 This	 has	 been	 a	
source	 of	 cash	 in	 each	 of	 the	 last	 few	 years,	 and	 this	 year	 we	
generated	 a	 profit	 of	 £83	 million	 on	 the	 disposal	 of	 properties.

Our	 Waltham	 Point	 distribution	 centre	 is	 the

deliveries	 a	 week	 to	 83	 stores.	 World	 class	
systems,	 updated	 with	 sales	 data	 every

Business	 review
We	 have	 achieved	 over	 £100	 million	 of	 operational	 cost	 savings	
over	 the	 year,	 taking	 the	 total	 to	 almost	 £600	 million	 of	 cost	
savings	 over	 five	 years.	 This	 is	 a	 result	 of	 improved	 productivity,	
ongoing	 procurement	 savings	 and	 simplification	 of	 in-store	
processes.	 For	 example,	 in	 logistics	 we	 continue	 to	 make	
improvements	 in	 vehicle	 efficiency,	 load	 and	 fuel	 efficiency,	 and	
route	 optimisation.	 In	 addition,	 we	 have	 recently	 introduced	 new	
warehouse	 technology	 which	 enables	 colleagues	 to	 work	 more	
efficiently,	 help	 improve	 product	 availability	 and	 reduce	 waste.
Brand Match	 is	 a	 great	 example	 of	 how	 we	 are	 using	 technology	
to	 deliver	 for	 customers	 and	 for	 shareholders.	 It	 price	 checks	
over	 14,000	 branded	 goods	 against	 Tesco	 and	 Asda	 in	 a	 fraction	
of	 a	 second.	 Importantly,	 this	 includes	 offers	 and	 promotions.	
The	 immediate	 issue	 of	 a	 voucher,	 either	 confirming	 the	
savings	 made	 or	 offering	 the	 difference	 for	 the	 customer	 to	
spend	 on	 their	 next	 visit,	 is	 a	 fundamental	 part	 of	 the	 power	
of	 Brand Match.	 We	 issue	 millions	 of	 coupons	 each	 week,	
more	 than	 half	 of	 which	 tell	 customers	 that	 their	 shopping	 at	
Sainsbury’s	 was	 cheaper	 than	 it	 would	 have	 been	 at	 Tesco	 or	
Asda.	 Our	 research	 shows	 that	 the	 number	 of	 customers	 who	
agree	 that	 Sainsbury’s	 sells	 brands	 at	 the	 same	 price	 as	 other	
supermarkets	 has	 risen	 from	 68	 per	 cent	 to	 80	 per	 cent	 since	
the	 trial	 of	 Brand	 Match	 in	 August	 2011.	
Nectar	 is	 the	 UK’s	 largest	 and	 most	 popular	 loyalty	 programme	
and	 Sainsbury’s	 has	 11.5	 million	 active	 Nectar	 card	 users.	
With	 its	 data,	 we	 can	 reward	 customers	 directly	 at	 the	 till	 with	
points,	 and	 relevant	 rewards	 and	 promotions.	 Coupon-at-till	 in	
particular	 achieves	 great	 returns	 on	 our	 marketing	 investment	
and,	 because	 of	 its	 effectiveness,	 is	 widely	 supported	 by	 our	
suppliers.	 We	 also	 use	 Nectar	 data	 to	 identify	 potential	 store	
locations	 and	 help	 determine	 which	 goods	 customers	 in	 that	
area	 are	 likely	 to	 buy.	 A	 record	 number	 of	 people	 used	 their	
Nectar	 cards	 to	 do	 their	 Christmas	 2011	 shopping	 with	 us,	 with	
£100	 million	 worth	 of	 points	 redeemed.	 We	 have	 signed	 a	 new	
long-term	 contract	 with	 Nectar	 to	 ensure	 we	 retain	 this	 source	
of	 customer	 insight	 –	 a	 key	 competitive	 advantage.	
Remaining commercially 
competitive is crucial. 
When we invest,  
we do so with strict 
controls on the capital 
spent to ensure 
appropriate returns.

You	 will	 find	 examples	 of	 how	 our	 values	 are	 being	 integrated	
into	 our	 business	 throughout	 this	 report.
Highlights	 include:
	 •
Best	 for	 food	 and	 health:	 Customers	 continue	 to	 recognise	
our	 colour-coded	 multiple	 traffic	 light	 nutritional	 labelling	
system	 as	 the	 easiest	 way	 to	 make	 informed	 choices	 in	 store.	
We	 display	 point	 of	 sale	 communication	 about	 responsible	
drinking	 to	 help	 customers	 understand	 the	 number	 of	 units	 	
in	 the	 alcoholic	 drinks	 they	 buy,	 and	 we	 have	 increased	
awareness	 with	 sales	 of	 lighter	 alcohol	 wines	 up	 14	 per	 cent.	
	 •
Sourcing	 with	 integrity:	 We	 were	 the	 first	 –	 and	 remain	
the	 number	 one	 –	 major	 retailer	 to	 only	 use	 cage-free	 fresh	
eggs,	 including	 those	 used	 as	 ingredients,	 in	 our	 own	 brand	
products.	 We	 are	 the	 world’s	 largest	 retailer	 of	 Fairtrade	
products,	 and	 were	 the	 largest	 retailer	 of	 British	 apples	 and	
pears	 for	 the	 third	 consecutive	 season.
	 •
Respect	 for	 our	 environment:	 We	 achieved	 zero	 food	 waste	 to	
landfill	 and	 became	 the	 UK’s	 largest	 retail	 user	 of	 anaerobic	
digestion	 technology.	 Our	 absolute	 electricity	 consumption	
for	 supermarkets	 over	 the	 past	 four	 years	 has	 reduced	 by	 	
9.1	 per	 cent,	 despite	 an	 increase	 in	 space	 of	 25	 per	 cent.	 	
We	 were	 the	 first	 supermarket	 to	 announce	 a	 change	 to	
labelling	 guidance	 to	 encourage	 freezing	 up	 to	 the	 product’s	
use	 by	 date,	 helping	 customers	 to	 waste	 less	 food.	
	 •
A	 positive	 difference	 to	 our	 community:	 We	 donated	 £25.4	
million	 to	 good	 causes	 over	 the	 past	 year,	 with	 £5.5	 million	
raised	 for	 Sport	 Relief	 2012.	 In	 a	 new	 initiative	 with	 FareShare,	
over	 1.2	 million	 meals	 were	 donated	 by	 the	 Company	 and	 our	
customers,	 to	 support	 disadvantaged	 families	 in	 the	 UK	 in	 the	
run	 up	 to	 Christmas	 2011.
	 •
A	 great	 place	 to	 work:	 We	 have	 trained	 18,000	 colleagues	 	
in	 our	 bakery	 college	 and	 six	 food	 colleges.	 Over	 13,000	
colleagues	 now	 have	 20	 years	 or	 more	 service,	 and	 we	 also	
instigated	 a	 new	 Youth	 Can	 initiative	 to	 help	 young	 people	
start	 and	 build	 their	 careers	 in	 retail.	
We have a strong 
culture, and focus on 
ensuring our values 
make us different. This 
underpins our business, 
and is interwoven into 
our strategy.  
We	 involved	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 external	 organisations	 in	 the	
creation	 of	 our	 new	 20	 by	 20	 Sustainability	 Plan,	 published	 	
in	 October	 2011.	 The	 response	 to	 this	 has	 been	 very	 positive,	
both	 within	 Sainsbury’s	 and	 outside.	
Our	 customers	 recently	 rated	 Sainsbury’s	 joint	 first	 among	 our	
peers	 for	 taking	 our	 social	 and	 environmental	 responsibilities	
seriously,	 above	 Waitrose,	 Morrisons,	 Tesco	 and	 Asda.	
Talkback,	 our	 regular	 survey	 of	 colleague	 opinion	 over	 a	 wide	
range	 of	 measures,	 tells	 us	 that	 our	 colleagues	 increasingly	
trust	 Sainsbury’s	 to	 do	 the	 right	 thing	 for	 them	 and	 for	 the	
world	 we	 live	 in.	
Amongst	 industry	 experts,	 our	 approach	 has	 been	 recognised	
through	 our	 inclusion	 in	 the	 globally	 respected	 Dow	 Jones	
Sustainability	 Index.	 We	 have	 retained	 our	 listing	 in	 the	
FTSE4Good	 Index,	 which	 rated	 us	 the	 highest	 performer	 relative	
to	 our	 sector	 across	 all	 three	 pillars	 of	 environmental,	 social	
and	 governance	 practices.	 We	 have	 also	 retained	 our	 Platinum

Dear shareholder,
In a challenging year for  
retailers, Sainsbury’s continued  
to grow sales (including V AT)  
by 6.8 per cent to £24,511 million 
(2010/11: £22,943 million), 
outperforming the market  
and growing market share. 
This	 performance	 is	 rooted	 in	 helping	 our	 customers	 Live Well for 
Less.	 In	 particular	 the	 introduction	 of	 Brand Match	 is	 reassuring	
our	 customers	 that	 they	 are	 paying	 either	 the	 same	 or	 less	 with	
us	 for	 their	 branded	 goods.	 This,	 combined	 with	 coupon-at-till,	
has	 improved	 price	 perception	 while	 retaining	 the	 benefits	 of	
Sainsbury’s	 heritage	 in	 quality	 and	 service.
We	 continued	 to	 manage	 inflationary	 pressures	 on	 costs	
through	 tight	 control,	 achieving	 over	 £100	 million	 of	 savings	
during	 the	 year.	 Our	 underlying	 operating	 profit	 increased	
by	 6.9	 per	 cent	 to	 £789	 million	 (2010/11:	 £738	 million),	
representing	 an	 operating	 margin	 improvement	 of	 4	 basis	
points,	 and	 10	 basis	 points	 at	 constant	 fuel	 prices.	 Underlying	
profit	 before	 tax	 improved	 by	 7.1	 per	 cent	 to	 £712	 million	
(2010/11:	 £665	 million).
Sainsbury’s	 continues	 to	 benefit	 from	 cash	 generated	 from	
operations,	 up	 13.4	 per	 cent	 year-on-year,	 facilitated	 in	 part	
by	 an	 overall	 improvement	 in	 working	 capital.	 This	 cash	
continues	 to	 be	 invested	 in	 long-term	 return-enhancing	 growth	
opportunities.	 During	 the	 year,	 core	 capital	 expenditure	
amounted	 to	 £1,240	 million	 (2010/11:	 £1,138	 million)	 and	 we	 	
are	 pleased	 that	 the	 investments	 made	 over	 the	 past	 few	 years	
continue	 to	 deliver	 an	 expected	 return	 above	 our	 required	
hurdle	 rate.	
In	 June	 2009,	 we	 decided	 to	 accelerate	 our	 investment	 in	
new	 space	 taking	 advantage	 of	 the	 relatively	 low	 cost	 of	 land	
and	 higher	 availability	 at	 that	 time.	 We	 have	 since	 established	
a	 strong	 property	 pipeline	 for	 future	 stores,	 targeting	 sales	
growth	 in	 areas	 where	 we	 can	 generate	 high	 returns,	 including	
those	 areas	 where	 we	 are	 under-represented	 in	 the	 market	 and	
across	 our	 convenience	 business.	 Our	 increased	 investment	 in	
space	 over	 recent	 years	 has	 helped	 both	 our	 sales	 and	 property	
value	 grow,	 although	 new	 space	 has	 an	 initially	 dilutive	 impact	
on	 profits	 due	 to	 opening	 costs	 and	 the	 sales	 build	 up	 curve.	
Having	 delivered	 the	 promised	 acceleration	 in	 space	 growth	 	
we	 will	 now	 return	 to	 space	 growth	 of	 around	 five	 per	 cent	 a	
year.	 This	 will	 reduce	 our	 capital	 expenditure	 and	 improve	 our	
cash	 flow	 and	 our	 overall	 returns,	 as	 sales	 from	 these	 new	
stores	 mature.

The	 return	 on	 average	 capital	 employed	 (‘ROCE’)	 of	 11.1	 per	 cent	
remains	 in	 line	 with	 last	 year’s	 performance,	 held	 back	 by	 the	
cumulative	 effect	 of	 our	 accelerated	 investment	 in	 space	 growth	
since	 June	 2009.	
During	 the	 year,	 funds	 were	 generated	 through	 the	 selective	
sale	 and	 leaseback	 of	 supermarkets	 that	 have	 no	 further	
development	 potential,	 taking	 advantage	 of	 very	 competitive	
market	 pricing.	 We	 generated	 £303	 million	 of	 cash	 through	
property	 transactions	 (2010/11:	 £275	 million),	 delivering	 a	
property	 profit	 of	 £83	 million	 (2010/11:	 £108	 million).	 The	
estimated	 market	 value	 of	 our	 overall	 property	 portfolio	
increased	 by	 £0.7	 billion,	 to	 £11.2	 billion	 (19	 March	 2011:

The	 balance	 sheet	 remains	 robust	 and	 the	 business	 has	 funding

(2010/11:	 26.5	 pence),	 up	 6.0	 per	 cent.	 Basic	 earnings	 per	 share	
decreased	 by	 7.0	 per	 cent	 to	 32.0	 pence	 (2010/11:	 34.4	 pence),	 	
as	 a	 consequence	 of	 reduced	 property	 profits	 year-on-year.	
The	 Board	 has	 proposed	 a	 final	 dividend	 of	 11.6	 pence	 	
(2010/11:	 10.8	 pence),	 making	 a	 full	 year	 dividend	 of	 16.1	 pence,	
up	 6.6	 per	 cent	 year-on-year	 (2010/11:	 15.1	 pence)	 and	 covered	
1.75	 times	 by	 underlying	 earnings,	 at	 the	 upper	 end	 of	 our	 policy

space	 growth	 a	 year.

Business	 review 28 J Sainsbury plc	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 2012
Financial review continued
Sales	 (excluding	 fuel)	 grew	 by	 4.5	 per	 cent,	 with	 LFL	 growth	 of	
2.1	 per	 cent,	 lower	 than	 the	 sales	 including	 fuel	 number	 due	 to	
the	 impact	 of	 high	 fuel	 price	 inflation,	 and	 below	 Sainsbury’s	
medium-term	 planning	 objective	 of	 between	 three	 and	 four	 per	
cent.	 This	 was	 ahead	 of	 the	 market,	 with	 Sainsbury’s	 market	
share	 for	 the	 year	 to	 17	 March	 2012	 growing	 to	 16.6	 per	 cent	 	
(as	 measured	 by	 Kantar).
LFL	 sales	 growth	 (excluding	 fuel)	 was	 1.9	 per	 cent	 in	 the	 	
first	 half,	 and	 2.3	 per	 cent	 in	 the	 second	 half.	 The	 second	 	
half	 performance	 reflected	 a	 strong	 third	 quarter,	 with	 a	 	
market	 beating	 performance	 over	 Christmas,	 followed	 by	 	
an	 improvement	 on	 last	 year’s	 quarter	 four	 performance.	 	
Average	 trading	 intensity	 (‘TI’)	 excluding	 fuel	 declined	 to	 £19.47	
per	 sq	 ft	 per	 week	 (2010/11:	 £20.04	 per	 sq	 ft),	 caused	 by;	 the	
increased	 proportion	 of	 stores	 not	 trading	 at	 maturity;	 the	
higher	 proportion	 of	 space	 dedicated	 to	 general	 merchandise	
and	 clothing	 which	 trades	 less	 intensively	 than	 food;	 an	
increasing	 presence	 in	 those	 parts	 of	 the	 country	 where	 trading	
intensity	 is	 likely	 to	 be	 lower	 (albeit	 capital	 costs	 are	 also	 lower);	
and	 the	 disruption	 caused	 at	 the	 32	 supermarkets	 replaced	 or	
extended	 in	 the	 year	 (2010/11:	 29	 replacements	 or	 extensions).	
Convenience	 TIs	 continue	 to	 grow	 benefiting	 from	 formats	
adapted	 to	 meet	 local	 catchments	 and	 located	 to	 help	 our	
customers	 top-up	 their	 weekly	 shopping.	
New	 space,	 excluding	 extensions	 and	 replacements,	 contributed	
a	 net	 2.4	 per	 cent	 to	 the	 sales	 growth	 of	 4.5	 per	 cent.	 Sainsbury’s	
added	 a	 gross	 1,401,000	 sq	 ft	 of	 selling	 space	 in	 the	 year	
(including	 replacements	 and	 extensions),	 an	 increase	 of	 7.3	 per	
cent	 since	 the	 start	 of	 the	 year	 (2010/11:	 8.4	 per	 cent).	 Including	
the	 impact	 of	 closures,	 this	 translated	 into	 net	 space	 growth	 	
of	 1,239,000	 sq	 ft,	 an	 increase	 of	 6.5	 per	 cent	 since	 the	 start	 	
of	 the	 year	 (2010/11:	 7.7	 per	 cent).	
Growth	 in	 new	 supermarkets	 continued	 through	 opening	 19	 new	
stores,	 adding	 750,000	 sq	 ft	 including	 four	 replacements	 (net	
623,000	 sq	 ft).	 There	 were	 no	 other	 closures,	 apart	 from	 the	
replaced	 stores.	 Sainsbury’s	 continued	 to	 open	 space	 in	 under-
represented	 areas,	 with	 strong	 growth	 in	 Scotland,	 Wales,	 and	
North	 West	 England.	 These	 stores	 typically	 bring	 higher	 returns	
due	 to	 lower	 build	 costs,	 although	 ultimate	 TI	 is	 lower	 than	 in	
other	 parts	 of	 the	 country.
We	 also	 continued	 to	 grow	 through	 28	 extensions,	 adding	
492,000	 sq	 ft	 to	 our	 estate,	 and	 growing	 strongly	 in	 the	 	
South	 East,	 especially	 in	 non-food,	 where	 we	 continue	 to	 	
grow	 market	 share.	
We	 increased	 our	 investment	 in	 the	 convenience	 estate,	 adding	
73	 stores	 during	 the	 year	 (2010/11:	 47	 stores)	 and	 refurbishing	
28	 stores,	 adding	 160,000	 sq	 ft	 to	 our	 estate.	
In	 March	 2012,	 around	 one	 year	 after	 opening,	 we	 chose	 to	
close	 our	 trial	 of	 Fresh	 Kitchen,	 a	 new	 Sainsbury’s	 format	 in	 the	
competitive	 lunchtime	 food-to-go	 market.	 While	 performance	
of	 the	 store	 was	 satisfactory,	 we	 concluded	 that	 the	 market	
opportunity	 was	 smaller	 than	 anticipated,	 and	 decided,	 for	 	
the	 time-being,	 not	 to	 roll	 out	 this	 offer.	 In	 addition,	 three	 other	
convenience	 stores	 were	 closed,	 and	 six	 petrol	 filling	 station	
sites	 are	 no	 longer	 included	 within	 the	 convenience	 stores	 	
space	 analysis.
The	 contribution	 from	 net	 new	 space	 (excluding	 extensions	
and	 replacements)	 of	 2.4	 per	 cent	 was	 in	 line	 with	 Sainsbury’s	
expectations.
The	 overall	 non-food	 market	 was	 very	 challenging	 during	 the	
year,	 although	 we	 continue	 to	 grow	 well	 ahead	 of	 the	 market.	
Convenience	 and	 online	 are	 also	 growing	 ahead	 of	 the	 market	 	
as	 our	 multi-channel	 offer	 means	 customers	 can	 do	 more	 of	
their	 shopping	 with	 Sainsbury’s.	 Convenience	 is	 now	 a	 £1.3	
billion	 business	 and	 online,	 growing	 at	 20	 per	 cent	 per	 year,	 	
is	 now	 a	 £0.8	 billion	 business.

Financial review continued
We	 expect	 the	 market	 to	 remain	 tough,	 and	 forecast	 LFLs	 in	
2012/13	 similar	 to	 those	 in	 2011/12.	
In	 2012/13,	 Sainsbury’s	 expects	 gross	 space	 growth	 of	 around	
5	 per	 cent,	 while	 we	 expect	 net	 new	 store	 space,	 excluding	
extensions	 and	 replacements,	 to	 contribute	 around	 2	 per	 cent	 	
to	 total	 sales	 growth	 (excluding	 fuel).
Underlying operating profit 
Underlying	 operating	 profit	 increased	 by	 6.9	 per	 cent	 to	
£789	 million	 (2010/11:	 £738	 million),	 reflecting	 a	 good	 sales	
performance	 and	 continued	 cost	 savings	 of	 over	 £100	 million	 	
in	 the	 year.
Underlying	 operating	 margin	 improved	 by	 4	 basis	 points	 to	
3.54	 per	 cent	 (2010/11:	 3.50	 per	 cent),	 which	 was	 a	 10	 basis	
point	 improvement	 at	 constant	 fuel	 prices.	 Underlying	 EBITDAR

of	 around	 £100	 million	 in	 2012/13,	 to	 offset	 the	 effect	 of	 cost	
inflation.
Sainsbury’s Bank joint venture (‘JV’)
Sainsbury’s	 share	 of	 Sainsbury’s	 Bank	 post-tax	 profit	 amounted	
to	 £16	 million	 (2010/11:	 £11	 million).	 The	 bank	 has	 continued	 to	
perform	 strongly	 with	 profit	 growth	 coming	 from	 steady	 income	
growth,	 particularly	 in	 personal	 loans	 and	 pet,	 car	 and	 home	
insurance,	 as	 well	 as	 tight	 control	 over	 costs	 and	 bad	 debts.	
The	 Sainsbury’s	 Bank	 JV	 is	 expected	 to	 contribute	 a	 further	
step-up	 in	 trading	 profit	 in	 2012/13.
Property joint ventures
Sainsbury’s	 underlying	 share	 of	 post-tax	 profit	 from	 the	 JV	 with	
British	 Land	 was	 £14	 million	 (2010/11:	 £11	 million).	 Its	 underlying	
share	 of	 post-tax	 profit	 from	 its	 JV	 with	 Land	 Securities	 was	 	
£2	 million	 (2010/11:	 £2	 million).	
At	 the	 year	 end,	 there	 was	 no	 surplus	 on	 revaluation	 recognised	
within	 the	 share	 of	 post-tax	 profit	 from	 the	 JVs	 in	 the	 income	
statement	 (2010/11:	 £39	 million).	 Due	 to	 disposals	 during	 the	
year,	 the	 average	 yield	 on	 the	 properties	 within	 these	 JVs	
increased	 to	 5.0	 per	 cent	 (2010/11:	 4.9	 per	 cent).	
Sainsbury’s	 expects	 the	 Property	 JVs	 to	 make	 a	 similar	 level	 	
of	 profit	 in	 2012/13.
Underlying net finance costs
Underlying	 net	 finance	 costs	 increased	 by	 £12	 million	 to	 £109	
million	 (2010/11:	 £97	 million),	 mainly	 as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 increase	
in	 RPI	 rate,	 which	 increased	 the	 rate	 on	 Sainsbury’s	 inflation	
linked	 debt.

We	 expect	 underlying	 net	 finance	 costs	 in	 2012/13	 to	 increase	 by	
£5	 to	 £10	 million,	 principally	 due	 to	 the	 higher	 forecast	 average	
net	 debt	 balance,	 partly	 offset	 by	 a	 decrease	 in	 RPI	 rate	 on	 the	
component	 of	 the	 Group’s	 inflation-linked	 debt.	 The	 interest	 rate	
on	 the	 inflation-linked	 debt	 resets	 annually	 in	 April,	 by	 reference	
to	 the	 RPI	 rate	 (capped	 at	 five	 per	 cent)	 prevailing	 in	 January.	
Taxation
The	 tax	 charge	 was	 £201	 million	 (2010/11:	 £187	 million),	 with	 an	
underlying	 tax	 rate	 of	 26.1	 per	 cent	 (2010/11:	 26.0	 per	 cent)	 and	
an	 effective	 tax	 rate	 of	 25.2	 per	 cent	 (2010/11:	 22.6	 per	 cent).	
The	 underlying	 rate	 is	 slightly	 higher	 than	 last	 year,	 due	 to	 the	
reduction	 in	 corporation	 tax	 rates	 in	 the	 current	 year	 not	 quite	
offsetting	 the	 benefit	 to	 last	 year’s	 charge	 of	 the	 resolution	
of	 the	 historical	 tax	 exposures	 with	 HMRC.	 These	 factors,	 in	
addition	 to	 the	 non-taxable	 profit	 on	 disposal	 of	 properties	
partially	 offset	 by	 the	 change	 in	 deferred	 tax	 rate,	 result	 in	 the	
effective	 tax	 rate	 being	 lower	 than	 the	 statutory	 rate.

Dividends
The	 Board	 has	 recommended	 a	 final	 dividend	 of	 11.6	 pence	 per	
share	 (2010/11:	 10.8	 pence),	 which	 will	 be	 paid	 on	 13	 July	 2012	
to	 shareholders	 on	 the	 Register	 of	 Members	 at	 the	 close	 of	
business	 on	 18	 May	 2012,	 subject	 to	 approval.	 This	 will	 increase	
the	 full	 year	 dividend	 by	 6.6	 per	 cent	 to	 16.1	 pence	 per	 share	
(2010/11:	 15.1	 pence).
The	 dividend	 is	 covered	 1.75	 times	 by	 underlying	 earnings	
(2010/11:	 1.75	 times),	 in	 line	 with	 Sainsbury’s	 policy	 of	 providing	
cover	 of	 between	 1.50	 and	 1.75	 times.	 The	 proposed	 final	
dividend	 was	 recommended	 by	 the	 Board	 on	 8	 May	 2012	 and,	 	
as	 such,	 has	 not	 been	 included	 as	 a	 liability	 as	 at	 17	 March	 2012.	
Sainsbury’s	 remains	 focused	 on	 delivering	 returns	 to	
shareholders.	 The	 Board	 plans	 to	 increase	 the	 dividend	 each	
year	 and	 now	 intends	 to	 build	 cover	 to	 two	 times	 over	 the	
medium	 term.
Return on capital employed
The	 return	 on	 average	 capital	 employed	 (‘ROCE’)	 over	 the	
52	 weeks	 to	 17	 March	 2012	 was	 11.1	 per	 cent	 (2010/11:	 11.1	 per	
cent),	 a	 year-on-year	 movement	 of	 (2)	 basis	 points.	
ROCE	 growth	 was	 held	 back	 by	 the	 cumulative	 effect	 of	
Sainsbury’s	 accelerated	 investment	 in	 space	 growth	 since	 June	
2009.	 This	 has	 an	 initially	 dilutive	 impact	 on	 profits	 as	 the	
stores	 mature,	 while	 increasing	 the	 value	 of	 capital	 employed.

Sainsbury’s	 net	 debt	 as	 at	 17	 March	 2012	 was	 £1,980	 million	
(2010/11:	 £1,814	 million),	 a	 year-on-year	 increase	 of	 £166	
million.	 The	 increase	 came	 primarily	 from	 investment	 in	 estate	
development,	 partially	 offset	 by	 cash	 generated	 from	 sale	 	
and	 leasebacks.
There	 was	 continued	 strong	 operating	 cash	 flow	 generation	 of	
£1,067	 million	 (2010/11:	 £854	 million)	 representing	 150	 per	 cent	
of	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 (2010/11:	 128	 per	 cent).	 Working	
capital	 improved	 by	 £53	 million,	 mainly	 due	 to	 increased	 trade	
and	 other	 payables,	 which	 are	 £182	 million	 higher	 than	 at	 	
19	 March	 2011,	 partially	 offset	 by	 an	 increase	 in	 inventories	 	
of	 £126	 million	 from	 the	 prior	 year.

Sainsbury’s	 expects	 net	 debt	 to	 be	 around	 £2.2	 billion	 at	 the	 end	
of	 2012/13,	 driven	 by	 higher	 tax	 cash	 flows	 given	 this	 year’s	 benefit	
brought	 about	 by	 a	 prior	 year	 overpayment,	 and	 slightly	 lower	
assumed	 property	 proceeds,	 offset	 in	 part	 by	 a	 reduction	 in	 core	
capital	 expenditure.
Financing
Sainsbury’s	 seeks	 to	 manage	 its	 financing	 by	 diversifying	 funding	
sources,	 minimising	 refinancing	 risk	 and	 maintaining	 sufficient	
stand-by	 liquidity.	 Sainsbury’s	 has	 drawn	 debt	 facilities	 of	 £2.7	
billion	 and	 an	 un-drawn	 committed	 credit	 facility	 of	 £0.7	 billion	 	
at	 its	 disposal.
The	 principal	 elements	 of	 Sainsbury’s	 core	 funding	 comprise	 two

Capital expenditure 
Core	 capital	 expenditure	 increased	 by	 £102	 million	 to	 £1,240	
million	 (2010/11:	 £1,138	 million)	 due	 to	 Sainsbury’s	 extensions	
and	 convenience	 opening	 programme,	 with	 28	 extensions	
(2010/11:	 24	 extensions)	 and	 73	 new	 convenience	 stores	
(2010/11:	 47	 new	 convenience	 stores).	 Core	 capital	 expenditure	
as	 a	 percentage	 of	 sales	 (including	 fuel,	 excluding	 VAT)	 was	 	
5.6	 per	 cent	 (2010/11:	 5.4	 per	 cent).
Sainsbury’s	 took	 advantage	 of	 continued	 good	 property	 yields	
to	 increase	 its	 sale	 and	 leaseback	 activity	 of	 mature	 stores	
with	 no	 further	 property	 development	 potential,	 generating	
proceeds	 of	 £303	 million	 (2010/11:	 £275	 million),	 which	
contributed	 £83	 million	 to	 a	 total	 profit	 on	 disposal	 of	 properties	
(2010/11:	 £108	 million).	 Net	 capital	 expenditure	 was	 £962	 million	
(2010/11:	 £880	 million).

In	 2012/13,	 Sainsbury’s	 expects	 core	 capital	 expenditure	 of	
around	 £1	 billion.	 As	 well	 as	 continuing	 to	 grow	 our	 estate	
through	 new	 stores	 in	 areas	 in	 which	 we	 are	 under-represented,	
we	 plan	 to	 step	 up	 the	 refurbishment	 of	 existing	 stores	 as	
well	 as	 invest	 in	 our	 IT	 infrastructure	 to	 support	 future	 online	
growth.	 We	 expect	 core	 capital	 expenditure	 as	 a	 percentage	 of

Summary balance sheet
Shareholders’	 funds	 as	 at	 17	 March	 2012	 were	 £5,629	 million	 	
(19	 March	 2011:	 £5,424	 million),	 an	 increase	 of	 £205	 million.	 	
This	 is	 mainly	 attributable	 to	 the	 continued	 profitable	 growth	
of	 the	 underlying	 business,	 continued	 investment	 in	 space	
to	 support	 future	 growth,	 offset	 by	 an	 increase	 in	 the	 net	
retirement	 benefit	 obligations	 and	 net	 debt.
Property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 assets	 have	 increased	 by	 	
£545	 million,	 as	 a	 result	 of	 increased	 space	 growth.
Net	 debt	 is	 £166	 million	 higher	 than	 at	 19	 March	 2011	 due	 to	 an	
investment	 in	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment,	 with	 additional	
debt	 partly	 offset	 by	 slightly	 higher	 cash	 balances	 at	 year-end	 	
as	 a	 result	 of	 improved	 working	 capital	 management.	
Gearing	 increased	 year-on-year	 to	 35.2	 per	 cent	 (2010/11:	 33.4	
per	 cent),	 as	 a	 result	 of	 the	 higher	 net	 debt.	 Our	 interest	 cover	
moved	 to	 7.5	 times	 (2010/11:	 7.9	 times),	 while	 fixed	 charge	 cover	
was	 in	 line	 with	 last	 year	 at	 3.1	 times	 (2010/11:	 3.1	 times),	 as	 was	
adjusted	 net	 debt	 to	 EBITDAR	 at	 4.1	 times	 (2010/11:	 4.1	 times).

properties	 rose	 by	 £0.7	 billion	 to	 £11.2	 billion	 (19	 March	 2011:	
£10.5	 billion),	 driven	 by	 property	 value	 added	 of	 £1.0	 billion,	
partly	 offset	 by	 sale	 and	 leasebacks	 of	 £0.3	 billion.	 The	 property	
value	 is	 based	 on	 a	 yield	 of	 4.9	 per	 cent	 and	 includes	 a	 50	 per

Pensions 
At	 17	 March	 2012,	 the	 post-tax	 pension	 deficit	 was	 £455	 million	
(19	 March	 2011:	 £241	 million).	 The	 increase	 in	 the	 deficit	 is	 the	
result	 of	 a	 0.5	 per	 cent	 reduction	 in	 the	 real	 discount	 rate	 used	
to	 value	 the	 liabilities,	 partially	 offset	 by	 a	 13	 per	 cent	 increase	 	
in	 the	 value	 of	 plan	 assets.	
The	 IAS	 19	 pension	 service	 cost	 included	 within	 UPBT	 was	 	
£59	 million,	 £4	 million	 higher	 than	 last	 year.

The	 Directors	 recommend	 the	 payment	 of	 a	 final	 dividend	 of	 11.6	 pence	
per	 share	 (2011:	 10.8	 pence),	 making	 a	 total	 dividend	 for	 the	 year	 of	 16.1	
pence	 per	 share	 (2011:	 15.1	 pence),	 an	 increase	 of	 6.6	 per	 cent	 over	 the	
previous	 year.	 Subject	 to	 shareholders	 approving	 this	 recommendation	
at	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 (‘AGM’),	 the	 dividend	 will	 be	 paid	 on	 	
13	 July	 2012	 to	 shareholders	 on	 the	 register	 at	 the	 close	 of	 business	 	
on	 18	 May	 2012.
Changes to the Board 
On	 13	 July	 2011	 Darren	 Shapland	 stood	 down	 from	 his	 position	 as	 a	
Director.	 He	 remains	 with	 Sainsbury’s	 as	 Non-Executive	 Chairman	 of	
Sainsbury’s	 Bank.	 Val	 Gooding,	 Non-Executive	 Director,	 also	 stepped	
down	 from	 the	 Board	 on	 13	 July	 2011,	 to	 take	 up	 the	 position	 of	 	
Chairman	 of	 Premier	 Farnell	 plc.	
In	 May	 we	 announced	 that	 Bob	 Stack	 had	 decided	 to	 stand	 down	 from	
his	 position	 as	 a	 Non-Executive	 Director	 with	 effect	 from	 the	 AGM	 on	 	
11	 July	 2012.
Re-election of Directors
The	 UK	 Corporate	 Governance	 Code	 provides	 for	 all	 directors	 of	 FTSE	
companies	 to	 stand	 for	 election	 or	 re-election	 by	 shareholders	 every	
year.	 Accordingly	 all	 members	 of	 the	 Board	 will	 retire	 and	 seek	 re-
election	 at	 this	 year’s	 AGM.	 Full	 biographical	 details	 of	 all	 of	 the	 current	
Directors	 are	 set	 out	 on	 page	 33.	
Annual General Meeting
The	 AGM	 will	 be	 held	 on	 Wednesday,	 11	 July	 2012	 at	 The	 Queen	 Elizabeth	
II	 Conference	 Centre,	 Broad	 Sanctuary,	 Westminster,	 London	 SW1P	 3EE	
at	 11.00am.	 The	 Chairman’s	 letter	 and	 the	 Notice	 of	 Meeting	 accompany	
this	 report,	 together	 with	 notes	 explaining	 the	 business	 to	 be	 transacted	
at	 the	 meeting.
At	 the	 meeting,	 resolutions	 will	 be	 proposed	 to	 declare	 a	 final	 dividend,	
to	 receive	 the	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 and	 approve	 the	
Remuneration	 Report,	 to	 re-elect	 all	 of	 the	 Directors,	 other	 than	 Bob	
Stack,	 and	 to	 re-appoint	 PricewaterhouseCoopers	 LLP	 as	 auditors.	 In	
addition,	 shareholders	 will	 be	 asked	 to	 renew	 both	 the	 general	 authority	
of	 the	 Directors	 to	 issue	 shares	 and	 to	 authorise	 the	 Directors	 to	
issue	 shares	 without	 applying	 the	 statutory	 pre-emption	 rights.	 In	 this	
regard	 the	 Company	 will	 continue	 to	 adhere	 to	 the	 provisions	 in	 the	 	
Pre-emption	 Group’s	 Statement	 of	 Principles.
Shareholders	 will	 be	 asked	 to	 authorise	 the	 Company	 to	 make	 market	
purchases	 of	 its	 own	 shares.	 Shareholders	 will	 also	 be	 asked	 to	
authorise	 the	 Directors	 to	 hold	 general	 meetings	 at	 14	 clear	 days’	 notice	
(where	 this	 flexibility	 is	 merited	 by	 the	 business	 of	 the	 meeting	 and	 is	
thought	 to	 be	 in	 the	 interests	 of	 shareholders	 as	 a	 whole).	 A	 resolution	
to	 renew	 the	 authority	 to	 make	 ‘political	 donations’	 as	 defined	 by	 	
Part	 14	 of	 2006	 Companies	 Act,	 will	 also	 be	 proposed.
Share capital and control
The	 following	 information	 is	 given	 pursuant	 to	 Section	 992	 of	 the	 2006	
Companies	 Act.
Except	 as	 described	 below	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 Company’s	 employee	 share	
schemes,	 there	 are	 no	 restrictions	 on	 the	 voting	 rights	 attaching	 to	 the	
Company’s	 ordinary	 shares	 or	 the	 transfer	 of	 securities	 in	 the	 Company;	
no	 person	 holds	 securities	 in	 the	 Company	 carrying	 special	 rights	
with	 regard	 to	 control	 of	 the	 Company;	 and	 the	 Company	 is	 not	 aware	
of	 any	 agreements	 between	 holders	 of	 securities	 that	 may	 result	 in	
restrictions	 in	 the	 transfer	 of	 securities	 or	 voting	 rights.	 Further	 details	
of	 the	 rights,	 restrictions	 and	 obligations	 attaching	 to	 the	 share	 capital	
of	 the	 Company,	 including	 voting	 rights,	 are	 contained	 in	 the	 Company’s	
Articles	 of	 Association.	 The	 Articles	 of	 Association	 may	 only	 be	 changed	
with	 the	 agreement	 of	 shareholders.	
Shares	 acquired	 through	 the	 Company’s	 employee	 share	 plans	 rank	
pari	 passu	 with	 shares	 in	 issue	 and	 have	 no	 special	 rights.	 Where,	 under	
the	 Company’s	 All	 Employee	 Share	 Ownership	 Plan,	 participants	 are	
beneficial	 owners	 of	 the	 shares	 but	 the	 Trustee	 is	 the	 registered	 owner,	
the	 voting	 rights	 are	 normally	 exercised	 by	 the	 registered	 owner	 at	 the	
direction	 of	 the	 participants.	 The	 J	 Sainsbury	 Employee	 Benefit	 Trusts	
waive	 their	 right	 to	 vote	 and	 to	 dividends	 on	 the	 shares	 they	 hold	 	
which	 are	 unallocated.	 Some	 of	 the	 Company’s	 employee	 share	 plans	
include	 restrictions	 on	 transfer	 of	 shares	 while	 the	 shares	 are	 held	
within	 the	 plan.
At	 the	 AGM	 held	 in	 July	 2011,	 the	 Company	 was	 authorised	 by	
shareholders	 to	 purchase	 its	 own	 shares,	 within	 certain	 limits	 and	
as	 permitted	 by	 the	 Articles	 of	 Association.	 The	 Company	 made	
no	 purchases	 of	 its	 own	 shares	 during	 the	 year	 and	 no	 shares	 were	
acquired	 by	 forfeiture	 or	 surrender	 or	 made	 subject	 to	 a	 lien	 or	 charge.
All	 of	 the	 Company’s	 employee	 share	 plans	 contain	 provisions	 relating	
to	 a	 change	 of	 control.	 On	 a	 change	 of	 control,	 options	 and	 awards	
granted	 to	 employees	 under	 the	 Company’s	 share	 plans	 may	 vest	
and	 become	 exercisable,	 subject	 to	 the	 satisfaction	 of	 any	 applicable	
performance	 conditions	 at	 that	 time.	
The	 Company	 is	 not	 party	 to	 any	 significant	 agreements	 that	 would	 	
take	 effect,	 alter	 or	 terminate	 upon	 a	 change	 of	 control	 following	 a	
takeover	 bid.
Ordinary shares
Details	 of	 the	 changes	 to	 the	 ordinary	 issued	 share	 capital	 during	 the	
year	 are	 shown	 on	 page	 95.	 At	 the	 date	 of	 this	 report,	 1,884,064,677

Directors’ indemnities
The	 Directors	 are	 entitled	 to	 be	 indemnified	 by	 the	 Company	 to	 the	
extent	 permitted	 by	 law	 and	 the	 Company’s	 Articles	 of	 Association	 in	
respect	 of	 all	 losses	 arising	 out	 of	 or	 in	 connection	 with	 the	 execution	
of	 their	 powers,	 duties	 and	 responsibilities.	 The	 Company	 has	 executed	
deeds	 of	 indemnity	 for	 the	 benefit	 of	 each	 Director	 in	 respect	 of	
liabilities	 which	 may	 attach	 to	 them	 in	 their	 capacity	 as	 Directors	 of	
the	 Company.	 The	 Company	 purchased	 and	 maintained	 Directors’	 and	
Officers’	 liability	 insurance	 throughout	 2011/12,	 which	 has	 been	 renewed	
for	 2012/13.	 Neither	 the	 indemnities	 nor	 the	 insurance	 provide	 cover	 	
in	 the	 event	 that	 the	 Director	 is	 proved	 to	 have	 acted	 fraudulently.
Market value of properties 
The	 Directors	 believe	 that	 the	 aggregate	 open	 market	 value	 of	 Group	
properties	 exceeds	 the	 net	 book	 value	 as	 set	 out	 in	 note	 11	 on	 page	 86	 	
to	 the	 financial	 statements.	
Essential contracts
Sainsbury’s	 has	 contractual	 and	 other	 arrangements	 with	 numerous	
third	 parties	 in	 support	 of	 its	 business	 activities.	 None	 of	 the	
arrangements	 is	 individually	 considered	 to	 be	 essential	 to	 the	 business	
of	 Sainsbury’s.	
Policy on payment of creditors
The	 policy	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 its	 principal	 operating	 companies	 is	
to	 agree	 terms	 of	 payment	 prior	 to	 commencing	 trade	 with	 a	 supplier	
and	 to	 abide	 by	 those	 terms	 on	 the	 timely	 submission	 of	 satisfactory	
invoices.	 The	 Company	 is	 a	 holding	 company	 and	 therefore	 has	 no	 trade	
creditors.	 Statements	 on	 the	 operating	 companies’	 payment	 of	 suppliers	
are	 contained	 in	 their	 financial	 statements.	
Corporate responsibility 
Sainsbury’s	 continues	 its	 strong	 commitment	 to	 corporate	
responsibility,	 which	 is	 an	 everyday	 part	 of	 how	 the	 Company	 does	
business.	 Sainsbury’s	 company	 values	 underpin	 our	 goal	 to	 make	
all	 of	 our	 customers’	 lives	 easier	 everyday	 by	 offering	 great	 quality	
and	 service	 at	 fair	 prices.	 In	 October,	 we	 announced	 our	 20	 by	 20	
Sustainability	 Plan	 a	 new	 cornerstone	 of	 our	 business	 strategy	 designed	
to	 accelerate	 Sainsbury’s	 commitment	 to	 social	 and	 environmental	
responsibility	 and	 excellence.	 This	 year,	 we	 have	 further	 integrated	
the	 reporting	 of	 corporate	 responsibility	 into	 this	 Annual	 Report	 and	
Financial	 Statements	 to	 illustrate	 how	 our	 values	 underpin	 and	 influence	
our	 broader	 business	 strategy.	
The	 Company’s	 Corporate	 Responsibility	 Report	 will	 be	 issued	 later	 in	
the	 year	 and	 will	 provide	 an	 update	 on	 our	 20	 by	 20	 Sustainability	 Plan.	
This	 report	 will	 be	 available	 online	 (www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/cr).	 We	 have	
five	 key	 corporate	 responsibility	 principles:	 ‘Best	 for	 food	 and	 health’,	
‘Sourcing	 with	 integrity’,	 ‘Respect	 for	 our	 environment’,	 ‘Making	 a	
positive	 difference	 to	 our	 community’	 and	 ‘A	 great	 place	 to	 work’.	 	
Each	 of	 our	 20	 by	 20	 Sustainability	 Plan	 commitments	 is	 aligned	 	
under	 one	 of	 these	 principles.	
As	 part	 of	 ‘A	 great	 place	 to	 work’	 the	 Company	 has	 well-developed	
policies	 for	 fair	 and	 equal	 treatment	 of	 all	 colleagues,	 employment	
of	 disadvantaged	 persons	 and	 colleague	 participation.	 It	 is	 our	 policy	
that	 people	 with	 disabilities	 are	 given	 full	 and	 just	 consideration	 for	 all	
vacancies	 and	 over	 the	 year	 we	 have	 conducted	 a	 number	 of	 training	
sessions	 to	 raise	 awareness	 and	 understanding	 of	 our	 customers	 and	
colleagues	 with	 disabilities	 and	 how	 we	 can	 better	 support	 them.	 Under	
the	 banner	 of	 You	 Can,	 the	 Company	 also	 actively	 works	 with	 a	 number	
of	 organisations	 which	 seek	 to	 promote	 employment	 for	 disadvantaged	
persons	 and	 inclusion	 within	 the	 workplace	 and	 has	 made	 one	 of	 our	
20	 by	 20	 Sustainability	 Plan	 commitments	 that	 by	 2020	 we	 will	 provide	
30,000	 people	 from	 disadvantaged	 groups	 with	 work	 opportunities.	
These	 include	 JobCentre	 Plus,	 A	 Fairer	 Chance,	 the	 Shaw	 Trust,	
Remploy	 and	 Mencap.	 Further	 details	 of	 Sainsbury’s	 diversity	 policy	 	
can	 be	 found	 at	 www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/diversity.
The	 Company’s	 quarterly	 trading	 statements,	 interim	 and	 annual	 results	
are	 presented	 to	 all	 senior	 management	 and	 are	 communicated	 to	 all	
colleagues.	 Colleagues	 have	 always	 been	 encouraged	 to	 hold	 shares	 	
in	 the	 Company.
Donations
Sainsbury’s	 is	 committed	 to	 making	 a	 positive	 difference	 to	 the	
communities	 in	 which	 it	 operates.	 We	 support	 many	 charitable	
organisations	 and	 community	 projects	 through	 either	 donating	 cash,	
making	 in-kind	 donations	 or	 through	 colleague	 volunteering.
During	 the	 year,	 Sainsbury’s	 colleagues,	 customers	 and	 suppliers	
raised	 £25.4	 million	 (2011:	 £22.9	 million)	 for	 charities	 through	 events	
supported	 by	 the	 Company,	 including	 Sport	 Relief.	 Cash	 and	 in-kind	
donations	 totalled	 £4.2	 million	 (2011:	 £2.1	 million).	
The	 Company	 made	 no	 political	 donations	 in	 2012	 (2011:	 £nil).
Post balance sheet events
There	 are	 no	 post	 balance	 sheet	 events.	
Financial risk management
The	 financial	 risk	 management	 and	 policies	 of	 the	 Group	 are	 disclosed	 	
in	 note	 28	 on	 pages	 99	 to	 104	 to	 the	 financial	 statements.
Going concern 
The	 Group’s	 business	 activities,	 together	 with	 the	 factors	 likely	 to	
affect	 its	 future	 development,	 performance	 and	 position	 are	 set	 out	
in	 the	 Business	 review	 on	 pages	 1	 to	 31.	 The	 financial	 position	 of	 the	
Group,	 its	 cash	 flows	 and	 liquidity	 are	 highlighted	 in	 the	 Financial	 review	
on	 pages	 26	 to	 31.	 The	 Group	 manages	 its	 financing	 by	 diversifying	
funding	 sources,	 maintaining	 core	 borrowings	 with	 long-term	 maturities	
and	 sufficient	 standby	 liquidity.	 Full	 details	 of	 the	 Group’s	 financing	
arrangements	 can	 be	 found	 in	 note	 20	 on	 pages	 92	 and	 93	 to	 the	
financial	 statements.	 In	 addition,	 notes	 28	 and	 29	 on	 pages	 99	 to	 108	
to	 the	 financial	 statements	 include	 the	 Group’s	 objectives,	 policies	
and	 processes	 for	 managing	 its	 capital;	 its	 financial	 risk	 management	
objectives;	 details	 of	 its	 financial	 instruments	 and	 hedging	 activities;	
and	 its	 exposures	 to	 credit	 risk	 and	 liquidity	 risk.	
The	 debt	 refinancing	 in	 March	 2006	 removed	 the	 Group’s	 reliance	 on	
unsecured	 credit	 markets	 for	 medium	 and	 long-term	 finance	 and	 the	
Group’s	 first	 significant	 re-financing	 exposure	 is	 not	 until	 2014.	
As	 a	 consequence,	 the	 Directors	 believe	 that	 the	 Group	 is	 well	 placed	 to	
manage	 its	 business	 risks	 successfully	 despite	 the	 current	 challenging	
economic	 outlook.	 The	 Directors	 have	 a	 reasonable	 expectation	 that	
the	 Company	 has	 sufficient	 resources	 to	 continue	 in	 operation	 for	
the	 foreseeable	 future.	 Accordingly,	 they	 continue	 to	 adopt	 the	 going	
concern	 basis	 in	 preparing	 the	 financial	 statements	 which	 are	 shown	 on	
pages	 68	 to	 118.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each	 of	 the	 Directors	 has	 confirmed	 that,	 so	 far	 as	 he/she	 is	 aware,	
there	 is	 no	 relevant	 audit	 information	 of	 which	 the	 auditors	 are	 unaware.	
Each	 Director	 has	 taken	 all	 steps	 that	 he/she	 ought	 to	 have	 taken	
as	 a	 Director	 in	 order	 to	 make	 himself/herself	 aware	 of	 any	 relevant	
audit	 information	 and	 to	 establish	 that	 the	 auditors	 are	 aware	 of	 that	
information.	
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers	 LLP	 have	 expressed	 their	 willingness	 to	 be	
reappointed	 as	 auditors	 of	 the	 Company.	 Upon	 the	 recommendation	 	
of	 the	 Audit	 Committee,	 resolutions	 to	 reappoint	 them	 as	 auditors	 	
and	 to	 authorise	 the	 Directors	 to	 determine	 their	 remuneration	 will	 	
be	 proposed	 at	 the	 AGM.

Corporate governance statement
Dear shareholder,
Y our Board is committed to 
effective governance and we 
believe that we have established  
a strong track record over  
a number of years.
The	 governance	 agenda	 for	 the	 UK’s	 largest	 companies	 has	 continued	
to	 attract	 attention	 since	 I	 last	 wrote	 to	 you	 in	 our	 2011	 Annual	 Report.	
This	 is	 the	 first	 year	 that	 companies	 are	 required	 to	 report	 on	 their	
compliance	 against	 the	 standards	 of	 the	 new	 UK	 Corporate	 Governance	
Code	 (the	 ‘Code’).	 We	 have	 also	 seen	 specific	 aspects	 of	 governance	
maintaining	 a	 high	 profile,	 particularly	 board	 diversity	 and	 directors’	
remuneration	 and	 performance	 related	 pay.	
The	 Code	 emphasises	 the	 need	 for	 well	 balanced,	 effective	 boards,	
strong	 oversight	 of	 risk	 management,	 alignment	 of	 remuneration	
policies	 with	 shareholder	 interests,	 and	 sound	 shareholder	 relations.	
The	 following	 pages	 explain	 how	 we	 apply	 these	 principles	 in	 order	 to	
help	 create	 long-term,	 sustainable	 growth	 in	 value	 for	 shareholders.	
I	 can	 confirm	 that	 Sainsbury’s	 has	 complied	 with	 all	 provisions	 of	 the	
Code	 during	 the	 last	 financial	 year.	
In	 January	 2011,	 a	 thorough	 review	 of	 your	 Board’s	 performance	
was	 completed	 by	 Manchester	 Square	 Partners,	 a	 board	 evaluation	
consultancy.	 This	 confirmed	 that	 the	 Board	 was	 seen	 as	 being	 effective,	
with	 a	 number	 of	 specific	 strengths	 as	 regards	 ethics,	 organisation,	
information,	 decision	 making	 and	 culture.	 This	 year,	 the	 Board	 agreed	
that	 we	 should	 carry	 out	 an	 internal	 review	 and	 this	 is	 described	 in	 detail	
on	 pages	 40	 to	 41.	 This	 exercise	 showed	 that	 we	 had	 made	 satisfactory	
progress	 with	 the	 priorities	 that	 we	 identified	 last	 year	 as	 a	 result	 of	 the	
Manchester	 Square	 Partners	 review.	 In	 particular,	 we	 have	 placed	 even	
greater	 emphasis	 on	 our	 strategic	 debate	 and	 I	 believe	 that	 this	 has	 been	
particularly	 important	 against	 the	 background	 of	 the	 challenging	 economic	
and	 market	 conditions	 that	 we	 have	 faced,	 and	 has	 helped	 to	 deliver	 the	
pleasing	 financial	 results	 that	 have	 been	 achieved	 during	 the	 year.	
One	 of	 our	 strengths	 continues	 to	 be	 our	 diversity	 which	 is	 the	 result	 	
of	 a	 high	 proportion	 of	 women	 having	 been	 appointed	 on	 merit	 	
throughout	 the	 organisation.	 Although	 Val	 Gooding	 stepped	 down	 from	 	
the	 Board	 during	 the	 year	 to	 take	 up	 the	 role	 of	 Chairman	 at	 Premier	 	
Farnell	 plc,	 I	 am	 pleased	 to	 report	 that	 we	 continue	 to	 benefit	 from	 the	
very	 able	 contributions	 of	 Mary	 Harris	 and	 Anna	 Ford	 on	 our	 Board	 and	
Committees.	 In	 addition,	 during	 the	 year,	 we	 have	 increased	 the	 number	 	
of	 women	 who	 hold	 the	 most	 senior	 executive	 positions	 in	 the	 Company.	 	
We	 have	 16	 women	 in	 our	 46	 most	 senior	 executive	 positions,	 and	 overall	
54	 per	 cent	 of	 our	 150,000	 colleagues	 are	 female.
Earlier	 this	 year,	 we	 responded	 to	 the	 report	 “Women	 on	 Boards”	 by	
Lord	 Davies	 of	 Abersoch	 CBE	 and	 confirmed	 that	 we	 anticipate	 that	 we	
will	 maintain	 and,	 over	 time,	 increase	 these	 high	 proportions	 of	 women	
in	 board	 and	 senior	 positions	 and	 be	 at	 least	 in	 line	 with	 the	 Davies	
recommendations,	 including	 the	 aspirational	 target	 that	 25	 per	 cent	 of	
board	 positions	 at	 FTSE	 100	 companies	 should	 be	 filled	 by	 women	 by	 	
2015.	 Appointments,	 however,	 will	 continue	 to	 be	 made	 on	 merit.	
Directors’	 remuneration	 continues	 to	 attract	 much	 focus	 –	 we	 believe	 	
that	 we	 have	 a	 good	 track	 record	 in	 this	 regard.	 Our	 Directors’	 salary	
increases	 have	 been	 in	 line	 with	 our	 wider	 colleague	 population	 for	 a	
number	 of	 years,	 and	 that	 remains	 the	 case	 with	 the	 below	 inflation	
increases	 for	 2012/13.	 We	 have	 regularly	 consulted	 with	 our	 key	 investors	
when	 we	 have	 proposed	 any	 material	 changes	 to	 our	 remuneration	
policy	 and	 this	 has	 helped	 us	 to	 develop	 a	 range	 of	 incentive	 plans	 which	
create	 a	 very	 strong	 link	 between	 Company	 performance	 and	 Directors’	
pay,	 thereby	 aligning	 management	 and	 shareholders’	 interests.	 We	 have	
received	 strong	 support	 from	 shareholders	 over	 recent	 years	 for	 the	
policies	 and	 procedures	 that	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 has	 applied.	 	
Our	 Remuneration	 Report	 is	 set	 out	 on	 pages	 52	 to	 65	 and	 describes	 both	 	
the	 principles	 and	 the	 actual	 amounts	 earned	 by	 Directors	 during	 the	 year.

Corporate governance statement continued
Compliance
The	 following	 sections	 explain	 how	 the	 Company	 applies	 the	 main	
principles	 of	 Section	 1	 of	 the	 UK	 Corporate	 Governance	 Code	 (the	
‘Code’).	 The	 Board	 is	 committed	 to	 strong	 governance	 and,	 during	
the	 year,	 the	 Company	 has	 complied	 with	 all	 the	 provisions	 of	 	
the	 Code.	
The role of the Board
The	 Board	 is	 chaired	 by	 David	 Tyler	 and,	 at	 the	 year-end,	 there	 were	
three	 Executive	 Directors	 and	 six	 Non-Executive	 Directors.	 John	
McAdam	 is	 the	 Senior	 Independent	 Director.	 The	 Directors’	 biographical	
details	 are	 set	 out	 on	 page	 33.	
The	 Board’s	 key	 focus	 in	 helping	 to	 create	 long-term	 sustainable	 value	
for	 shareholders	 is	 on	 strategic	 leadership,	 performance	 management,	
investor	 relations,	 risk	 management	 and	 governance	 and	 succession	
planning,	 each	 of	 which	 is	 described	 below.	 We	 have	 a	 scheduled	
forward	 programme	 of	 Board	 meetings	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 Board	 can	
allocate	 sufficient	 time	 to	 each	 of	 these	 key	 areas.	 This	 enables	 us	 to	
plan	 Board	 and	 Committee	 meetings	 appropriately	 and	 use	 the	 time	
most	 effectively.	 There	 is	 sufficient	 flexibility	 in	 the	 programme	 to	
enable	 specific	 items	 to	 be	 added	 to	 any	 particular	 agenda	 and	 this	
ensures	 that	 the	 Board	 can	 focus	 on	 the	 key	 matters	 relating	 to	 the	
business	 at	 the	 appropriate	 time.	 Our	 annual	 Board	 evaluation	 exercise	
enables	 us	 to	 review	 whether	 board	 meetings	 are	 structured	 with	 a	 clear	
focus	 on	 the	 key	 issues	 facing	 the	 Company,	 with	 a	 full	 and	 open	 debate	
before	 major	 decisions	 are	 taken.	 We	 ensure	 that	 all	 Directors	 are	
aware	 of	 the	 key	 discussions	 and	 decisions	 of	 each	 of	 the	 four	 principal	
Committees	 –	 the	 Chairman	 of	 each	 Committee	 provides	 a	 detailed	
summary	 to	 all	 Directors	 at	 the	 Board	 meeting	 following	 the	 relevant	
Committee	 meeting.	 Minutes	 of	 Board	 and	 Committee	 meetings	 are	
circulated	 to	 Directors	 shortly	 after	 those	 meetings	 take	 place.	 The	
Board	 has	 a	 schedule	 of	 formally	 reserved	 powers	 (which	 it	 reviews	 each	
year)	 and	 receives	 a	 number	 of	 in-depth	 presentations	 during	 the	 year	
on	 other	 key	 matters	 including	 pensions,	 treasury,	 brand	 management,	
values	 and	 governance.
During	 the	 year	 we	 increased	 the	 number	 of	 informal	 meetings	 of	 the	
Board,	 which	 was	 an	 agreed	 action	 from	 a	 previous	 Board	 evaluation.	
These	 enable	 all	 the	 Directors	 to	 spend	 more	 time	 together	 and	 to	 discuss	
specific	 areas	 of	 the	 business	 with	 individual	 Operating	 Board	 members.	
The	 Board	 continued	 to	 focus	 on	 strategic	 matters	 during	 the	 year.	
We	 hold	 a	 two-day	 Strategy	 Conference	 in	 the	 autumn,	 with	 the	
Operating	 Board	 Directors	 in	 attendance	 for	 the	 first	 day.	 This	 enables	
the	 Board	 to	 conduct	 an	 in-depth	 review	 of	 relevant	 economic	 factors	
and	 their	 likely	 impact	 on	 customers	 and	 the	 market,	 to	 evaluate	 key	
opportunities	 and	 threats,	 consider	 the	 draft	 budget	 and	 corporate	
plan	 and	 agree	 the	 strategic	 goals	 for	 the	 short-term	 and	 longer	
term	 perspectives.	 The	 Board	 receives	 a	 detailed	 half-year	 update	 on	
progress	 against	 the	 agreed	 priorities	 and	 then,	 to	 complete	 the	 cycle	
in	 July,	 agrees	 the	 objectives	 and	 principal	 areas	 of	 focus	 for	 the	 next	
conference.	 Specific	 projects	 are	 considered	 at	 other	 meetings	 during	
the	 year	 as	 necessary.	 Our	 2012	 Board	 Evaluation	 exercise	 concluded	
that	 the	 Board	 had	 made	 real	 progress	 in	 driving	 the	 strategic	 debate	
during	 the	 year.
Performance	 management	 against	 delivery	 of	 the	 agreed	 key	 targets	
is	 reviewed	 at	 every	 meeting	 with	 particular	 reference	 to	 the	 detailed	
management	 accounts.	 The	 Chief	 Executive,	 Group	 Commercial	 Director	
and	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer	 comment	 on	 the	 market	 and	 current	 trading	
at	 each	 meeting.	
During	 the	 year	 the	 Board	 was	 fully	 engaged	 in	 the	 development	 and	
launch	 of	 our	 new	 brand,	 Live Well for Less,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 planning	 and	
roll	 out	 of	 Brand	 Match.	 The	 Board	 also	 reviewed	 Sainsbury’s	 20	 by	 20	
Sustainability	 Plan	 described	 in	 the	 Business	 review.
The	 Board	 reviews	 the	 Company’s	 principal	 risks	 on	 an	 annual	 basis,	
in	 addition	 to	 receiving	 regular	 updates	 on	 risk	 management	 and	
internal	 controls	 from	 the	 Chairman	 of	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 after	 each	
committee	 meeting.	 The	 Board	 also	 receives	 an	 annual	 update	 on	 all	
matters	 relating	 to	 safety,	 supported	 by	 regular	 quarterly	 updates,	
together	 with	 updates	 on	 relevant	 controls	 and	 governance.	 Any	 specific	
issues	 on	 these	 and	 other	 matters	 which	 might	 affect	 the	 Company’s	
reputation	 are	 reported	 to	 the	 Board	 as	 they	 occur.	 The	 Board	 also	
reviewed	 Sainsbury’s	 business	 continuity	 and	 crisis	 management	
processes	 and	 governance.	
Turning	 to	 investor	 relations,	 the	 Board	 receives	 an	 annual	 independent	
survey	 at	 the	 Strategy	 Conference	 which	 reports	 on	 the	 views	 of	 	
major	 shareholders	 and	 analysts,	 together	 with	 updates	 at	 each	 	
Board	 meeting	 on	 the	 IR	 programme	 and	 feedback	 from	 major	
shareholders,	 particularly	 following	 each	 major	 announcement	 	
of	 the	 Company’s	 results.
Succession	 plans	 and	 management	 development	 are	 considered	 by	
the	 Nomination	 Committee	 each	 year	 at	 the	 time	 of	 the	 Strategy	
Conference	 with	 specific	 follow	 up	 and	 updates	 thereafter	 as	 necessary.	
The	 Nomination	 Committee	 also	 reviews	 succession	 to	 the	 Board.	
Division of responsibilities 
There	 is	 a	 clear	 division	 of	 responsibilities	 between	 the	 Chairman	 and	
the	 Chief	 Executive	 which	 is	 set	 out	 in	 writing	 and	 has	 been	 approved	
by	 the	 Board.	 The	 Chairman	 is	 responsible	 for	 leadership	 of	 the	 Board,	
ensuring	 its	 effectiveness	 and	 setting	 its	 agenda	 to	 enable	 the	 Board	 to	
fulfil	 all	 aspects	 of	 its	 role.	 As	 set	 out	 above,	 we	 ensure	 that	 the	 Board	
has	 sufficient	 time	 to	 allocate	 to	 its	 key	 areas	 of	 focus	 throughout	
the	 annual	 cycle	 of	 Board	 meetings.	 The	 Chairman	 ensures	 effective	
communication	 with	 shareholders	 and	 that	 the	 Board	 is	 aware	 of	 the	
views	 of	 major	 shareholders.	 He	 facilitates	 the	 contribution	 of	 the	
Non-Executive	 Directors	 through	 a	 culture	 of	 openness	 and	 debate,	
and	 ensures	 constructive	 relations	 between	 the	 Executive	 and	 Non-
Executive	 Directors.	
The	 Chief	 Executive	 is	 responsible	 for	 the	 day-to-day	 management	 of	
the	 Company,	 and	 executing	 the	 strategy,	 once	 agreed	 by	 the	 Board.	 	
He	 creates	 a	 framework	 of	 strategy,	 values,	 organisation	 and	 objectives	
to	 ensure	 the	 successful	 delivery	 of	 results,	 and	 allocates	 decision	
making	 and	 responsibilities	 accordingly.	 He	 takes	 a	 leading	 role,	 with	 	
the	 Chairman,	 in	 the	 relationship	 with	 all	 external	 agencies	 and	 in	
promoting	 Sainsbury’s.

Corporate governance statement continued
Independence 
The	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 bring	 wide	 and	 varied	 commercial	
experience	 to	 Board	 and	 Committee	 deliberations.	 On	 appointment	
they	 confirm	 that	 they	 will	 have	 sufficient	 time	 available	 to	 be	 able	 to	
discharge	 their	 responsibilities	 effectively.	 They	 are	 appointed	 for	 an	
initial	 three-year	 term,	 subject	 to	 election	 by	 shareholders	 at	 the	 first	
AGM	 after	 their	 appointment,	 after	 which	 their	 appointment	 may	 be	
extended	 for	 a	 second	 term,	 subject	 to	 mutual	 agreement.	 All	 members	
of	 the	 Board	 will	 retire	 by	 rotation	 and	 seek	 re-election	 by	 shareholders	
at	 this	 year’s	 AGM	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Code.
The	 Companies	 Act	 2006	 provides	 that	 directors	 must	 avoid	 a	 situation	
where	 they	 have,	 or	 can	 have,	 a	 direct	 or	 indirect	 interest	 that	 conflicts,	
or	 possibly	 may	 conflict,	 with	 a	 company’s	 interests.	 Directors	 of	 public	
companies	 may	 authorise	 conflicts	 and	 potential	 conflicts,	 where	
appropriate,	 if	 a	 company’s	 articles	 of	 association	 permit.	 Shareholders	
approved	 the	 appropriate	 amendments	 to	 the	 Company’s	 Articles	 at	 the	
2008	 AGM.	 The	 Board	 has	 established	 procedures	 for	 the	 disclosure	
by	 Directors	 of	 any	 such	 conflicts,	 and	 also	 for	 the	 consideration	 and	
authorisation	 of	 these	 conflicts	 by	 the	 Board.	 In	 accordance	 with	 the	
Act,	 the	 Board	 considered	 and	 authorised	 each	 Director’s	 reported	
potential	 conflicts	 of	 interest	 during	 the	 year.	 Whenever	 a	 Director	 takes	
on	 additional	 external	 responsibilities,	 the	 Board	 considers	 any	 potential	
conflicts	 that	 may	 arise	 and	 whether	 the	 Director	 continues	 to	 have	
sufficient	 time	 to	 fulfil	 his	 or	 her	 role	 as	 a	 Director	 of	 the	 Company.	 The	
Board	 will	 continue	 to	 monitor	 and	 review	 potential	 conflicts	 of	 interest	
on	 a	 regular	 basis.
The	 Chairman	 satisfied	 the	 independence	 criteria	 of	 the	 Code	 on	 his	
appointment	 to	 the	 Board	 in	 October	 2009	 and	 all	 the	 Non-Executive	
Directors	 are	 considered	 to	 be	 independent	 according	 to	 the	 provisions	
of	 the	 Code.	 The	 Board	 has	 specifically	 considered	 the	 executive	 or	
non-executive	 roles	 that	 some	 of	 the	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 have	 with	
companies	 who	 may	 be	 in	 competition	 with,	 or	 suppliers	 to	 Sainsbury’s.	
The	 Board	 is	 satisfied	 that	 the	 independence	 of	 the	 Directors	 who	
have	 executive	 or	 non-executive	 roles	 with	 other	 companies	 is	 not	
compromised	 and	 that	 they	 all	 have	 sufficient	 time	 available	 to	 devote	
to	 the	 Company.
During	 the	 year	 the	 Board	 considered	 Mike	 Coupe’s	 proposed	
appointment	 as	 a	 Non-Executive	 Director	 of	 Greene	 King	 plc	 –	 in	
approving	 the	 appointment	 the	 Board	 concluded	 that	 there	 was	 limited	
potential	 for	 conflict	 with	 a	 small	 supplier	 and	 that,	 in	 any	 event,	 there	
were	 appropriate	 safeguards	 in	 place	 to	 manage	 any	 conflicts	 that	
might	 arise.	 Moreover,	 joining	 the	 board	 of	 another	 listed	 company	
would	 provide	 a	 valuable	 development	 opportunity	 for	 Mike	 Coupe	 	
and	 thereby	 benefit	 Sainsbury’s.
The	 Board	 also	 considered	 a	 potential	 conflict	 for	 Justin	 King,	 whose	
son,	 Jordan	 King,	 is	 one	 of	 the	 country’s	 top	 young	 racing	 drivers.	
His	 recent	 success	 is	 attracting	 interest	 from	 potential	 sponsors.	
Current	 sponsors	 include	 high	 net-worth	 individuals	 and	 companies	
with	 established	 interests	 in	 motor	 sport.	 Some	 of	 the	 sponsors	 are	
also	 suppliers	 to	 Sainsbury’s.	 Jordan	 King	 arranges	 his	 sponsorships	
through	 his	 company,	 42	 Racing	 Ltd.	 The	 Board	 has	 satisfied	 itself	
that	 Justin	 King	 has	 no	 direct	 involvement	 in	 the	 trading	 relationship	
between	 Sainsbury’s	 and	 any	 supplier	 who	 may	 have	 an	 interest	
in	 42	 Racing	 Ltd.	 It	 is	 satisfied	 that	 the	 governance	 of	 all	 supplier	
relationships	 is	 robust	 and	 that	 there	 is	 therefore	 no	 conflict	 of	 interest	
regarding	 these	 arrangements.
Information and development 
The	 Chairman	 is	 responsible	 for	 ensuring	 that	 all	 Directors	 are	 properly	
briefed	 on	 issues	 arising	 at	 Board	 meetings	 and	 that	 they	 have	 full	
and	 timely	 access	 to	 relevant	 information.	 The	 quality	 and	 supply	 of	
information	 provided	 to	 the	 Board	 is	 reviewed	 as	 part	 of	 the	 Board	
evaluation	 exercise.	 The	 conclusion	 from	 this	 year’s	 evaluation	 was	 that	
Board	 meetings	 and	 processes	 were	 very	 effective.
We	 have	 a	 programme	 for	 meeting	 Directors’	 training	 and	 development	
requirements.	 Newly	 appointed	 Directors	 who	 do	 not	 have	 previous	
public	 company	 experience	 at	 Board	 level	 are	 provided	 with	 detailed	
training	 on	 their	 role	 and	 responsibilities.	 All	 new	 Directors	 participate	 in	
a	 comprehensive	 and	 tailored	 induction	 programme	 including	 store	 and	
depot	 visits	 and	 meetings	 with	 other	 members	 of	 the	 Board,	 members	
of	 the	 Operating	 Board,	 senior	 management	 and	 external	 advisors.	 The	
induction	 programme	 includes	 a	 full	 review	 of	 corporate	 responsibility.	
Subsequent	 training	 is	 available	 on	 an	 ongoing	 basis	 to	 meet	 any	
particular	 needs.	 Matt	 Brittin’s	 induction	 programme	 has	 addressed	 all	
of	 these	 aspects	 since	 his	 appointment	 to	 the	 Board	 in	 January	 2011.
During	 the	 year	 the	 Company	 Secretary,	 Tim	 Fallowfield,	 has	 provided	
updates	 to	 the	 Board	 on	 relevant	 governance	 matters,	 Directors’	
duties	 and	 obligations,	 and	 new	 legislation	 and	 its	 impact	 on	 the	
Company,	 such	 as	 the	 2011	 Bribery	 Act.	 The	 Audit	 Committee	 regularly	
considers	 new	 accounting	 developments	 through	 presentations	
from	 management	 and	 the	 external	 auditors.	 The	 consultants	 to	
the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 advise	 the	 Committee	 on	 relevant	
governance	 and	 trends	 in	 remuneration.	 The	 Board	 programme	 includes	
regular	 presentations	 from	 management	 and	 informal	 meetings	 which	
increase	 the	 Non-Executive	 Directors’	 understanding	 of	 the	 business	
and	 the	 sector.	 During	 the	 year	 the	 Board	 held	 a	 Board	 meeting	 at	
our	 Coventry	 Store	 Support	 Centre	 and	 received	 presentations	 from	
members	 of	 the	 general	 merchandise	 and	 clothing	 management	 teams.	
Directors	 have	 visited	 stores	 and	 other	 sites	 as	 part	 of	 their	 continuing	
engagement	 with	 the	 business.	
All	 Directors	 have	 access	 to	 the	 advice	 and	 services	 of	 the	 Company	
Secretary.	 He	 has	 responsibility	 for	 ensuring	 that	 Board	 procedures	 are	
followed	 and	 for	 governance	 matters.	 The	 appointment	 and	 removal	 of	
the	 Company	 Secretary	 is	 one	 of	 the	 matters	 reserved	 for	 the	 Board.	
There	 is	 an	 agreed	 procedure	 by	 which	 members	 of	 the	 Board	 may	
take	 independent	 professional	 advice	 at	 the	 Company’s	 expense	 in	 the	
furtherance	 of	 their	 duties.
Board evaluation
The	 Board	 agreed	 that	 the	 2011	 evaluation	 exercise	 should	 be	 facilitated	
by	 Manchester	 Square	 Partners	 (who	 had	 no	 other	 relationship	 with	
Sainsbury’s).	 The	 key	 objectives	 agreed	 with	 the	 Chairman	 were	 to	 ask	
the	 Board	 to	 assess	 itself	 by	 defining	 its	 own	 objectives	 and	 analyse	
how	 it	 was	 performing	 against	 these	 objectives	 across	 number	 of	
dimensions.	 The	 review	 was	 conducted	 through	 a	 discussion	 framework	
circulated	 in	 advance	 to	 Directors,	 followed	 by	 one-to-one	 in	 depth	
interviews	 with	 all	 Directors	 and	 the	 Company	 Secretary	 and	 a	 review	
of	 relevant	 papers.	 The	 performance	 of	 the	 Board	 Committees	 was	
also	 reviewed,	 and	 Directors	 provided	 feedback	 on	 each	 others’	
contributions.	
Governance 		 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 2012	 J Sainsbury plc 41
Corporate governance statement continued
Manchester	 Square	 Partners’	 report	 concluded	 that	 the	 Board	 was	
working	 effectively	 across	 many	 dimensions.	 The	 Board	 identified	
actions	 to	 develop	 some	 aspects	 of	 Board	 succession	 and	 management	
transition,	 and	 to	 strengthen	 further	 the	 focus	 on	 strategic	 initiatives.	
Following	 last	 year’s	 external	 evaluation,	 the	 Board	 agreed	 that	 this	
year’s	 review	 should	 be	 carried	 out	 by	 the	 Company	 Secretary,	 and	
that	 the	 key	 objectives	 were	 to	 determine	 whether	 progress	 had	 been	
made	 on	 last	 year’s	 action	 points,	 to	 identify	 any	 emerging	 themes	
and	 to	 consider	 whether	 the	 Board	 and	 its	 committees	 were	 working	
effectively.	 A	 questionnaire	 was	 circulated	 to	 all	 Directors	 seeking	
their	 evaluation	 of	 a	 number	 of	 subject	 matters,	 including	 strategy,	
management	 transition,	 succession,	 Board	 culture	 and	 balance,	
meetings	 and	 processes,	 investor	 relations,	 risk	 management	 and	 board	
committees.	 This	 was	 followed	 up	 in	 separate	 discussions	 with	 each	 of	
the	 Directors	 to	 take	 their	 detailed	 feedback	 on	 any	 emerging	 themes.	
The	 Company	 Secretary	 then	 presented	 the	 principal	 conclusions	 to	 the	
Board	 at	 a	 meeting	 convened	 for	 that	 purpose,	 and	 the	 Board	 discussed	
the	 key	 points	 and	 agreed	 certain	 actions.
The	 Board	 agreed	 that	 good	 progress	 has	 been	 made	 on	 the	 action	
points	 from	 the	 2011	 evaluation,	 especially	 as	 regards	 the	 focus	 on	 the	
strategic	 debate	 which	 has	 become	 particularly	 important	 against	 the	
background	 of	 a	 challenging	 and	 changing	 market.	 Steps	 have	 also	
been	 taken	 to	 develop	 the	 transition	 plans	 at	 Operating	 Board	 level,	
culminating	 in	 the	 new	 roles	 for	 Roger	 Burnley	 and	 Helen	 Buck,	 and	
a	 number	 of	 internal	 promotions.	 The	 Board	 concluded	 that	 it	 was	
working	 well	 as	 a	 team	 and	 was	 benefiting	 from	 a	 broad	 range	 of	 skills	
and	 diversity,	 with	 a	 strong	 and	 open	 culture.
Various	 actions	 were	 agreed	 from	 this	 year’s	 exercise,	 including	 finding	
more	 opportunities	 for	 the	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 to	 meet	 other	
members	 of	 the	 management	 team	 and	 to	 learn	 more	 about	 them	 and	
their	 roles.
As	 part	 of	 the	 Board	 evaluation	 exercise,	 the	 Senior	 Independent	
Director	 reviewed	 the	 Chairman‘s	 performance	 with	 the	 other	 Directors	
and	 subsequently	 met	 him	 to	 provide	 feedback.	 The	 Chairman	 provided	
feedback	 to	 each	 Director	 on	 their	 individual	 contribution	 to	 the	 Board	
and	 considered	 their	 development	 priorities	 with	 each	 of	 them.
Attendance
The	 table	 shows	 the	 attendance	 of	 Directors	 at	 scheduled	 Board	 and	
Committee	 meetings.	 The	 Board	 scheduled	 eight	 meetings	 during	 the	
year,	 including	 the	 two-day	 Strategy	 Conference,	 and	 additional	 ad	 hoc	
conference	 calls	 were	 also	 convened	 to	 deal	 with	 specific	 matters	 which	
required	 attention	 between	 scheduled	 meetings.

Directors	 being	 present,	 and	 the	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 also	 met	
without	 the	 Executive	 Directors	 or	 the	 Chairman	 being	 present.	
Investor relations 
The	 Company	 is	 committed	 to	 maintaining	 good	 communications	
with	 investors.	 Normal	 shareholder	 contact	 is	 the	 responsibility	 of	
Justin	 King,	 John	 Rogers	 and	 Adam	 Wilson	 Katsibas,	 Head	 of	 Investor	
Relations.	 The	 Chairman	 is	 generally	 available	 to	 shareholders	
and	 meets	 with	 institutional	 and	 other	 large	 investors;	 the	 Senior	
Independent	 Director	 is	 also	 available	 as	 required.	
The	 Company	 regularly	 meets	 with	 its	 large	 investors	 and	 institutional	
shareholders	 who,	 along	 with	 sell-side	 research	 analysts,	 are	 invited	 to	
presentations	 by	 the	 Company	 immediately	 after	 the	 announcement	
of	 the	 Company’s	 interim	 and	 full-year	 results.	 They	 are	 also	 invited	
to	 participate	 in	 conference	 calls	 following	 the	 announcement	 of	 the	
Company’s	 trading	 statements.	 The	 content	 of	 these	 presentations	 and	
conference	 calls	 are	 webcast	 and	 are	 posted	 on	 the	 Company’s	 website	
(www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investors)	 so	 as	 to	 be	 available	 to	 all	 investors.	
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Investor	 Relations	 department	 met	 with	 members	
of	 The	 UK	 Small	 Shareholders’	 Association.
The	 Board	 regularly	 receives	 feedback	 on	 the	 views	 of	 major	 investors	
and	 the	 IR	 programme.	 In	 addition,	 Makinson	 Cowell	 provide	 investor	
relations	 consultancy	 services	 to	 the	 Company	 and	 give	 an	 external	
analysis	 to	 the	 Board	 at	 the	 strategy	 conference	 on	 the	 views	 of	
institutional	 investors	 and	 sell-side	 analysts.	 Non-Executive	 Directors	
also	 receive	 regular	 market	 reports	 and	 broker	 updates	 from	 the	
Company’s	 Investor	 Relations	 department.
Shareholders	 have	 the	 opportunity	 to	 meet	 and	 question	 the	 Board	
at	 the	 AGM,	 which	 this	 year	 will	 be	 held	 on	 11	 July	 2012.	 There	 will	 be	 a	
display	 of	 various	 aspects	 of	 the	 Company’s	 activities	 and	 Justin	 King	
will	 make	 a	 business	 presentation.	 A	 detailed	 explanation	 of	 each	 item	 of	
special	 business	 to	 be	 considered	 at	 the	 AGM	 is	 included	 with	 the	 Notice	
of	 Meeting	 which	 will	 be	 sent	 to	 shareholders	 at	 least	 20	 working	 days	
before	 the	 meeting.	 All	 resolutions	 proposed	 at	 the	 AGM	 will	 be	 taken	
on	 a	 poll	 vote.	 This	 follows	 best	 practice	 guidelines	 and	 enables	 the	
Company	 to	 count	 all	 votes,	 not	 just	 those	 of	 shareholders	 who	 attend	
the	 meeting.

The	 Operating	 Board	 has	 delegated	 certain	 powers	 to	 the	 Trading	
Board,	 the	 Retail	 &	 Logistics	 Board,	 the	 Investment	 Board,	 the	 Group	
Safety	 Committee	 and	 the	 Corporate	 Responsibility	 Steering	 Group,	
each	 of	 which	 has	 approved	 terms	 of	 reference	 setting	 out	 its	 areas	 	
of	 responsibility.	
Nomination Committee 
The	 Nomination	 Committee	 is	 chaired	 by	 David	 Tyler	 and	 comprises	
all	 of	 the	 Non-Executive	 Directors.	 Justin	 King	 is	 not	 a	 member	 of	 the	
Committee	 although	 he	 is	 invited	 to	 attend	 meetings.	
As	 referred	 to	 above,	 the	 Board	 evaluations	 considered	 the	 balance,	
skills	 and	 diversity	 of	 the	 Board	 as	 part	 of	 the	 review	 of	 whether	 it	 is	
working	 effectively.	 This	 assists	 with	 succession	 planning.	 Our	 diversity	
is	 described	 in	 more	 detail	 on	 page	 37	 of	 the	 Directors’	 report	 and	 in	 the	
Chairman’s	 statement	 above.
During	 the	 year	 Darren	 Shapland	 decided	 to	 step	 down	 from	 the	 Board	
but	 agreed	 to	 remain	 Non-Executive	 Chairman	 of	 Sainsbury’s	 Bank.	 	
The	 Committee	 was	 fully	 engaged	 in	 the	 change	 in	 responsibilities	 in	
July	 2011	 which	 resulted	 from	 Darren’s	 decision.
In	 May	 2012	 we	 announced	 that	 Bob	 Stack	 had	 decided	 to	 stand	 down	
from	 the	 Board	 with	 effect	 from	 our	 AGM	 in	 July.	 Mary	 Harris	 will	 then	
take	 over	 as	 chair	 of	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee.	 The	 Nomination	
Committee	 has	 instructed	 search	 consultants	 Egon	 Zehnder	 in	
connection	 with	 the	 recruitment	 of	 a	 new	 Non-Executive	 Director.	 The	
Committee	 has	 considered	 the	 balance	 of	 skills,	 experience	 and	 diversity	
on	 the	 Board	 in	 determining	 the	 types	 of	 candidate	 who	 might	 best	 fit	
the	 specification	 of	 this	 role.
The	 Committee	 also	 conducted	 reviews	 of	 succession	 plans	 for	
the	 Operating	 Board,	 Departmental	 Director	 development,	 talent	
management	 and	 the	 graduate	 programme	 at	 the	 time	 of	 the	 Strategy	
Conference.	 The	 Committee	 was	 engaged	 in	 the	 changes	 made	 to	
the	 Operating	 Board	 in	 March	 2012	 which	 saw	 Roger	 Burnley	 become	
Managing	 Director,	 General	 Merchandise,	 Clothing	 and	 Logistics	 after	
four	 years	 as	 Retail	 and	 Logistics	 Director,	 and	 Helen	 Buck	 became	
Retail	 Director	 after	 18	 months	 as	 Convenience	 Director.	
The	 Committee’s	 terms	 of	 reference	 are	 available	 on	 the	 website	
(www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/governance)	 and	 set	 out	 the	 Committee’s	
responsibilities.	 The	 Committee	 meets	 on	 such	 further	 occasions	 as	 	
are	 necessary	 and	 in	 2011/12	 held	 four	 meetings	 in	 total.	
Audit Committee
The	 Committee	 is	 chaired	 by	 Gary	 Hughes	 with	 John	 McAdam,	 	
and	 Matt	 Brittin	 as	 its	 other	 members,	 all	 of	 whom	 are	 independent	
Non-Executive	 Directors.	 See	 page	 46	 for	 further	 details.
Remuneration Committee 
The	 Committee	 is	 chaired	 by	 Bob	 Stack,	 with	 Anna	 Ford	 and	 Mary	 Harris	
as	 its	 other	 members.	 Mary	 joined	 the	 Committee	 in	 July	 2011.	 The	
Remuneration	 Report	 is	 set	 out	 on	 pages	 52	 to	 65.
Corporate Responsibility Committee 
The	 Committee	 is	 chaired	 by	 Anna	 Ford,	 and	 Justin	 King	 and	 Mary	
Harris	 are	 its	 members.	 David	 Tyler	 attends	 each	 meeting.	 It	 met	 twice	
during	 the	 year.	 These	 formal	 committee	 meetings	 are	 supported	 by	
CR	 strategic	 meetings	 hosted	 by	 Anna	 Ford	 and	 Justin	 King.	 Each	
meeting	 is	 based	 around	 one	 of	 the	 five	 CR	 principles	 and	 key	 external	
stakeholders	 are	 invited	 to	 attend.	 During	 the	 year	 five	 such	 meetings	
were	 held,	 relating	 to	 each	 of	 the	 five	 principles,	 framed	 within	 our	 	
20	 by	 20	 Sustainability	 Plan	 which	 was	 launched	 in	 October	 2011.
The	 Committee	 is	 supported	 by	 an	 internal	 corporate	 responsibility	
governance	 structure	 whereby	 members	 of	 the	 Operating	 Board	 have	
responsibility	 for	 each	 of	 our	 five	 values	 and	 sit	 on	 our	 Corporate	
Responsibility	 Steering	 Group,	 which	 meets	 quarterly	 and	 is	 chaired	 by	
Justin	 King.	 The	 members	 of	 the	 Steering	 Group	 are	 shown	 on	 page	 45.

Corporate governance statement continued
Dear shareholder,
With 22 million customer visits 
every week, employing around 
150,000 colleagues and 2,000 
direct suppliers in over 70 
countries, Sainsbury’s operates  
a significant economic, social  
and environmental value chain.
Corporate	 responsibility	 (‘CR’)	 is	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 Sainsbury’s	 business,	
with	 our	 five	 values	 critical	 to	 our	 goal	 of	 making	 all	 our	 customers’	 lives	
easier	 every	 day,	 by	 offering	 great	 quality	 and	 service	 at	 fair	 prices.	
They	 are	 also	 key	 to	 achieving	 our	 vision	 to	 be	 the	 most	 trusted	 retailer	
where	 people	 love	 to	 work	 and	 shop.
As	 chair	 of	 the	 Corporate	 Responsibility	 Committee,	 I	 report	 to	 the	
Board	 twice	 a	 year	 on	 our	 plans	 and	 on	 the	 progress	 we	 have	 made	
against	 each	 of	 these	 values.	 I’ve	 chaired	 the	 work	 of	 the	 Committee	
for	 six	 years	 and	 have	 seen	 a	 significant	 development	 in	 the	 Company’s	
approach	 in	 that	 time.	 While	 our	 values	 remain	 constant,	 the	 level	 of	
organisation	 and	 activity	 has	 become	 increasingly	 sophisticated	 with	
a	 sharp	 focus	 on	 ensuring	 our	 values	 also	 provide	 value	 for	 customers,	
colleagues	 and	 shareholders.	
In	 October	 2011	 we	 launched	 our	 20	 by	 20	 Sustainability	 Plan	 to	
strengthen	 and	 further	 integrate	 corporate	 responsibility	 into	 our	
business.	 We	 created	 the	 plan	 by	 working	 closely	 with	 over	 40	
stakeholders	 and	 specialists,	 ranging	 from	 the	 National	 Farmers’	 Union	
to	 the	 World	 Wildlife	 Fund.	 It	 has	 been	 well	 received	 by	 colleagues,	
customers	 and	 experts.	 We	 continued	 our	 external	 engagement	
during	 the	 year,	 meeting	 35	 key	 stakeholders	 through	 five	 corporate	
responsibility	 discussions.	 Each	 focused	 on	 one	 of	 our	 five	 values	
looking	 at	 topics	 such	 as	 youth	 engagement,	 water	 stewardship,	
community	 activities,	 sustainable	 living	 and	 how	 we	 can	 break	 down	 	
the	 barriers	 to	 healthy	 eating.	 In	 addition	 we	 have	 met	 with	 a	 number	 	
of	 sustainable	 or	 socially	 responsible	 investors.
Our	 major	 highlights	 over	 the	 past	 year	 are	 noted	 on	 pages	 8	 to	 9	 as	
well	 as	 being	 outlined	 in	 the	 business	 review	 on	 page	 25.	 This	 track	
record	 has	 been	 recognised	 by	 numerous	 awards	 and	 sustainability	
indices,	 a	 selection	 of	 which	 is	 listed	 on	 these	 pages	 with	 others	 noted	
on	 our	 corporate	 website.
We	 hold	 Gold	 class	 status	 in	 the	 Dow	 Jones	 Sustainability	 Index,	 which	
we	 first	 joined	 in	 2003,	 and	 were	 recognised	 as	 a	 sector	 leader	 in	 this	
globally-recognised	 Index.	 We	 have	 retained	 our	 high	 rating	 in	 the	
FTSE4Good	 Index,	 which	 we	 have	 been	 part	 of	 since	 its	 inception	 in	 2001.	
Within	 FTSE4Good	 we	 were	 rated	 the	 highest	 performer	 relative	 to	 our	
sector	 across	 all	 three	 pillars	 of	 environmental,	 social	 and	 governance	
practices.	 These	 are	 the	 two	 most	 respected	 indices	 which	 enable	
financial	 institutions	 to	 benchmark	 companies’	 performance	 in	 corporate	
responsibility	 and	 sustainability.	 We	 also	 retained	 our	 Platinum	 Plus	
status	 in	 the	 Business	 in	 the	 Community	 Corporate	 Responsibility	 Index,	
as	 well	 as	 being	 recognised	 for	 our	 performance	 on	 a	 range	 of	 specific	
issues	 including	 energy,	 marine	 stewardship	 and	 animal	 welfare.	
Perhaps	 most	 importantly,	 our	 customers	 voted	 Sainsbury’s	 joint	 first	
among	 our	 peers	 for	 taking	 social	 and	 environmental	 responsibilities	
seriously.	 I	 find	 it	 particularly	 heartening	 that	 in	 challenging	 economic	
times	 we	 see	 that	 Sainsbury’s	 customers	 continue	 to	 look	 to	 us	 to	 help	
them	 live	 their	 values.	
The	 Company	 remains	 focused	 on	 ensuring	 our	 values	 make	 us	 different	
and	 benefit	 our	 customers,	 colleagues	 and	 shareholders.	 We	 will	 be	
providing	 a	 full	 update	 in	 our	 Corporate	 Responsibility	 Report	 later	
this	 year.	 This	 will	 be	 published	 to	 coincide	 with	 the	 anniversary	 of	
Sainsbury’s	 20	 by	 20	 Sustainability	 Plan.	 In	 the	 meantime	 I	 encourage	
you	 to	 find	 out	 more	 about	 this	 important	 aspect	 of	 our	 business	 at

Our 20 by 20 Sustainability Plan
In	 many	 ways	 the	 commitments	 encapsulated	 in	 our	 20	 by	 20	
Sustainability	 Plan	 are	 not	 new	 to	 Sainsbury’s.	 We	 have	 sought	
throughout	 our	 143-year	 history	 to	 lead	 in	 matters	 of	 business	
responsibility	 and	 ethics.	 Examples	 of	 our	 contribution	 over	 the	 past	
decade	 include	 transforming	 the	 market	 for	 fairly	 traded	 products	
and	 sustainable	 seafood,	 improving	 animal	 welfare,	 and	 championing	
community	 investment.
With	 our	 20	 by	 20	 Sustainability	 Plan,	 we	 formalise	 our	 action	 against	
those	 values,	 as	 well	 as	 recognising	 the	 new	 and	 changing	 issues	 which	
today’s	 world	 faces.
In	 developing	 the	 plan	 we	 undertook	 a	 detailed	 auditing	 and	 materiality	
process.	 This	 encompassed	 listening	 to	 our	 customers,	 suppliers	 and	
opinion	 formers	 to	 make	 sure	 we	 have	 the	 most	 relevant	 and	 effective	
agenda,	 leverage	 the	 knowledge	 and	 experience	 of	 experts,	 and	 remain	
at	 the	 forefront	 of	 sustainability	 between	 now	 and	 2020.	
With	 the	 clarity	 of	 purpose	 that	 the	 20	 by	 20	 Sustainability	 Plan	 brings,	
we	 are	 focused	 on	 its	 delivery,	 whilst	 also	 ensuring	 we	 continue	 to	
engage	 and	 look	 beyond	 2020.

Governance 46 J Sainsbury plc	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 2012
Corporate governance statement continued
Dear shareholder,
As part of the Board’s  
overall responsibility for risk, 
supervision of Sainsbury’s 
internal controls and risk 
management is clearly delegated 
to the Audit Committee. We 
have a good balance of skills 
and experience amongst the 
Committee members, supported 
by a strong Internal Audit 
function and a management 
team who have instilled a strong 
culture throughout the business.
The	 Committee	 is	 satisfied	 that	 there	 is	 transparency	 and	 clear	 lines	
of	 accountability	 so	 that	 the	 identification	 and	 management	 of	 risks	
is	 embedded	 throughout	 the	 business,	 with	 strong	 oversight	 by	 the	
Operating	 Board.	 Risks	 are	 actively	 managed	 and	 reviewed,	 with	
focus	 on	 specific	 areas	 of	 change.	 In	 addition	 to	 reviewing	 the	 overall	
processes,	 the	 Committee	 regularly	 receives	 updates	 on	 the	 specific	
areas	 of	 risk	 from	 the	 relevant	 members	 of	 the	 management	 team.
We	 believe	 that	 governance	 of	 risk	 at	 Sainsbury’s	 is	 strong	 and	 this	 view	
has	 been	 supported	 by	 recent	 annual	 Board	 and	 Committee	 evaluations,	
which	 reviewed	 the	 overall	 approach	 to	 risk	 management.	 The	 Internal	
Audit	 function	 plays	 a	 vital	 role	 in	 the	 governance	 structure	 and	 the	
Committee	 was	 therefore	 pleased	 with	 the	 review	 of	 the	 function	
conducted	 and	 presented	 to	 the	 Committee	 by	 Deloitte	 during	 the	 year.	
The	 overall	 assessment	 was	 that	 it	 is	 a	 high	 performing	 function	 which	 is	
well	 respected	 by	 its	 key	 stakeholders,	 compliant	 with	 the	 requirements	
of	 the	 Institute	 of	 Internal	 Auditors	 standards	 and	 achieving	
performance	 levels	 which	 were	 considered	 to	 be	 leading	 practice	 in	
many	 key	 areas.	 The	 team	 has	 strong	 complementary	 skills	 and	 there	
has	 been	 significant	 improvement	 since	 the	 last	 external	 review	 which	
was	 conducted	 five	 years	 ago.

Corporate governance statement continued 
The	 Audit	 Committee	 is	 chaired	 by	 Gary	 Hughes	 with	 John	 McAdam,	
and	 Matt	 Brittin	 as	 its	 other	 members,	 all	 of	 whom	 are	 independent	
Non-Executive	 Directors.	 Mary	 Harris	 attended	 one	 meeting	 of	 the	
Committee	 before	 she	 joined	 the	 Remuneration	 Committee	 in	 July.	
The	 Board	 has	 determined	 that	 Gary	 Hughes	 has	 recent	 and	 relevant	
financial	 experience.	 The	 Chairman,	 Justin	 King,	 John	 Rogers,	 Susannah	
Hall	 (Director	 of	 Internal	 Audit),	 other	 senior	 members	 of	 the	 Finance	
Division	 and	 the	 external	 auditors	 are	 invited	 to	 attend	 Committee	
meetings.	 Tim	 Fallowfield	 is	 secretary	 to	 the	 Committee.
The	 Committee’s	 terms	 of	 reference,	 which	 are	 available	 on	 our	
website	 (www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/governance),	 set	 out	 the	 Committee’s	
responsibilities.
Principal activities during the year
During	 the	 year	 the	 Committee	 met	 on	 four	 occasions,	 the	 agendas	
being	 organised	 around	 the	 Company’s	 reporting	 cycle.	 The	 Committee	
regularly	 met	 with	 the	 external	 auditors	 without	 management	 being	
present.	 It	 monitored	 the	 integrity	 of	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 any	
formal	 announcements	 relating	 to	 the	 Company’s	 financial	 performance	
and	 reviewed	 any	 significant	 financial	 judgements	 contained	 in	 them.	
The	 Committee	 has	 a	 calendar	 of	 standard	 items	 within	 its	 remit:

In	 addition,	 the	 Committee	 reviewed	 a	 number	 of	 specific	 presentations	
and	 updates	 during	 the	 year.	 For	 instance,	 it	 reviewed	 a	 new	 store	
audit	 approach	 which	 will	 be	 implemented	 over	 the	 coming	 year	 and	
an	 update	 on	 the	 Company’s	 IT	 change	 framework	 and	 an	 external	
independent	 review	 on	 IT	 security.	
The	 Committee	 has	 regularly	 reviewed	 the	 Internal	 Audit	 department’s	
resources,	 budget,	 work	 programme,	 results	 and	 management’s	
implementation	 of	 its	 recommendations.	 Susannah	 Hall	 reports	 to	
the	 Committee	 Chairman	 and	 has	 direct	 access	 to	 all	 members	 of	 the	
Committee	 and	 the	 Chairman.	 She	 meets	 the	 Committee	 separately	
after	 each	 meeting	 without	 management	 being	 present.	 She	 has	 regular	
meetings	 with	 all	 Committee	 members.	 The	 purpose,	 authority	 and	
responsibility	 of	 Internal	 Audit	 are	 defined	 in	 the	 Internal	 Audit	 Charter.	
The	 Committee	 reviews	 the	 Charter	 annually.	 During	 the	 year	 the	
independent	 review	 of	 the	 Internal	 Audit	 function	 described	 above	 was	
conducted	 and	 presented	 to	 the	 Committee	 by	 Deloitte.	
As	 described	 in	 detail	 below,	 the	 Committee	 has	 also	 reviewed:
•	
the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Company’s	 financial	 controls	 and	 the	 systems	
of	 internal	 control	 by	 approving	 the	 Internal	 Audit	 plans	 twice	 yearly	
and	 reviewing	 the	 findings	 quarterly,	 and	 by	 reviewing	 the	 scope	 of	
work	 and	 reports	 of	 the	 external	 auditors.	 The	 detailed	 actions	 for	
resolution	 of	 any	 identified	 weaknesses	 are	 closely	 monitored	 by	 the	
Committee	 through	 to	 completion;	 and
•	
the	 management	 of	 risk	 by	 reviewing	 the	 risk	 assessment	 process	 and	
corporate	 and	 divisional	 risk	 maps	 and	 registers	 twice	 yearly.	 The	 risk	
registers	 outline	 the	 key	 risks	 faced	 by	 the	 business	 including	 their	
impact	 and	 likelihood,	 along	 with	 the	 relevant	 mitigating	 controls,	
assurance	 providers	 and	 actions,	 and	 they	 form	 the	 basis	 of	 the	
Internal	 Audit	 planning	 process.
The	 Committee	 also	 regularly	 reviews	 the	 Company’s	 funding	 and	
liquidity	 position	 and	 has	 considered	 its	 impact	 on	 the	 Company’s	
financial	 and	 operational	 capabilities.	 The	 Committee’s	 detailed	 review	
of	 the	 year-end	 position	 assisted	 the	 Board	 in	 making	 the	 going	 concern	
statement	 set	 out	 on	 page	 37.
The	 Committee	 reviewed	 PricewaterhouseCoopers	 LLP’s	 (‘PwC’)	 overall	
work	 plan	 and	 approved	 their	 remuneration	 and	 terms	 of	 engagement	
and	 considered	 in	 detail	 the	 results	 of	 the	 audit,	 PwC’s	 performance	 	
and	 independence	 and	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 overall	 audit	 process.	
PwC	 have	 been	 the	 Company’s	 auditors	 since	 1995.	 PwC	 are	 required	 	
to	 rotate	 the	 audit	 partner	 responsible	 for	 the	 Group	 and	 subsidiary	
audits	 every	 five	 years.	 Richard	 Hughes,	 the	 current	 audit	 partner,	 	
was	 appointed	 in	 July	 2010.	 The	 Committee	 recommended	 PwC’s	 	
re-appointment	 as	 auditors	 to	 the	 Board	 and	 this	 resolution	 will	 be	 	
put	 to	 shareholders	 at	 the	 AGM.
In	 order	 to	 ensure	 their	 independence,	 the	 Committee	 has	 implemented	
the	 Company’s	 policy	 which	 restricts	 the	 engagement	 of	 PwC	 in	 relation	
to	 non-audit	 services.	 The	 majority	 of	 the	 non-audit	 work	 undertaken	
by	 PwC	 during	 2011/12	 related	 to	 a	 segregation	 of	 duties	 review	 in	
relation	 to	 a	 systems	 upgrade.	 The	 non-audit	 fees	 for	 the	 year	 were	
£0.1	 million,	 and	 the	 audit	 fee	 for	 the	 year	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 Group,	
Company	 and	 its	 subsidiaries	 (including	 the	 fee	 for	 the	 interim	 review)	
totalled	 £0.8	 million.	 The	 policy	 was	 reviewed	 during	 the	 year	 and	 is	
consistent	 with	 the	 Auditing	 Practices	 Board’s	 Ethical	 Standards	 No.	 5	 –	
Non	 Audit	 Services.	 The	 policy	 is	 designed	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 provision	
of	 such	 services	 does	 not	 have	 an	 impact	 on	 the	 external	 auditors’	
independence	 and	 objectivity.	 It	 identifies	 certain	 types	 of	 engagement	
that	 the	 external	 auditors	 shall	 not	 undertake,	 including	 internal	
audit	 and	 actuarial	 services	 relating	 to	 the	 preparation	 of	 accounting	
estimates	 for	 the	 financial	 statements.	 It	 also	 requires	 that	 individual	
engagements	 above	 a	 certain	 fee	 level	 may	 only	 be	 undertaken	 with	
appropriate	 authority	 from	 the	 Committee	 Chairman	 or	 the	 Committee.	
Governance 48 J Sainsbury plc	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 2012
Corporate governance statement continued
The	 policy	 also	 recognises	 that	 there	 are	 some	 types	 of	 work,	 such	
as	 accounting	 and	 tax	 advice,	 where	 a	 detailed	 understanding	 of	 the	
Company’s	 business	 is	 advantageous.	 The	 policy	 is	 designed	 to	 ensure	
that	 PwC	 is	 only	 appointed	 to	 provide	 a	 non-audit	 service	 where	 it	
is	 considered	 to	 be	 the	 most	 suitable	 supplier	 of	 the	 service.	 The	
Committee	 receives	 a	 report	 at	 each	 meeting	 on	 the	 non-audit	 services	
being	 provided	 and	 the	 cumulative	 total	 of	 non-audit	 fees.	 In	 the	 event	
that	 cumulative	 non-audit	 fees	 exceed	 the	 audit	 fee	 then	 all	 subsequent	
non-audit	 expenditure	 must	 be	 approved	 by	 the	 Committee	 Chairman.	
The	 Company’s	 ’whistleblowing’	 procedures	 ensure	 that	 arrangements	
are	 in	 place	 to	 enable	 colleagues	 and	 suppliers	 to	 raise	 concerns	 about	
possible	 improprieties	 on	 a	 confidential	 basis.	 All	 issues	 raised	 have	
been	 investigated	 and	 appropriate	 actions	 taken.	 Any	 significant	 issues	
would	 be	 highlighted	 to	 the	 Audit	 Committee.
The	 Company	 has	 a	 fraud	 policy	 and	 a	 Serious	 Fraud	 Committee,	 which	
convenes	 in	 the	 event	 of	 serious	 incidents	 to	 oversee	 case	 management	
and	 ensure	 appropriate	 actions	 are	 taken.	 The	 Audit	 Committee	
receives	 a	 fraud	 update	 at	 each	 meeting.	
The	 Committee	 receives	 an	 update	 at	 each	 meeting	 about	 matters	
discussed	 at	 the	 Sainsbury’s	 Bank	 Audit	 Committee	 and	 on	 any	 other	
key	 matters.	 Given	 the	 economic	 climate	 it	 has	 continued	 to	 focus	 on	 the	
Bank’s	 liquidity	 and	 cash	 flows,	 capital	 adequacy	 and	 risk	 management	
processes.
Grocery Supply Code of Practice 
In	 February	 2010,	 a	 new	 Grocery	 Supply	 Code	 of	 Practice	 (‘GSCOP’)	
was	 implemented	 following	 the	 recommendation	 of	 the	 Competition	
Commission.	 Each	 grocery	 retailer	 to	 which	 it	 applies	 had	 to	 appoint	
a	 Code	 Compliance	 Officer	 whose	 duties	 include	 hearing	 disputes	
between	 suppliers	 and	 the	 relevant	 retailer.	 Sainsbury’s	 has	 appointed	
the	 Director	 of	 Internal	 Audit	 as	 its	 Code	 Compliance	 Officer.	
GSCOP	 requires	 that	 each	 grocery	 retailer	 to	 which	 it	 applies	 must	
deliver	 an	 annual	 compliance	 report	 to	 the	 Office	 of	 Fair	 Trading	 which	
has	 been	 approved	 by	 the	 chair	 of	 the	 Audit	 Committee.	 Furthermore,	
a	 summary	 of	 the	 compliance	 report	 must	 be	 included	 in	 our	 Annual	
Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements.
Summary Annual Compliance Report
Sainsbury’s	 has	 invested	 significant	 time	 and	 resource	 in	 providing	
comprehensive	 training	 to	 all	 relevant	 colleagues	 as	 required	 under	
GSCOP.	 This	 training	 is	 reinforced	 by	 online	 knowledge	 testing	 and	
further	 supported	 by	 training	 and	 reference	 materials	 on	 our	 intranet.	
Sainsbury’s	 has	 also	 dedicated	 internal	 legal	 resource	 to	 provide	 all	
relevant	 colleagues	 with	 day-to-day	 advice	 and	 guidance.
A	 small	 number	 of	 alleged	 breaches	 of	 GSCOP	 has	 been	 received	 in	 the	
reporting	 period,	 all	 of	 which	 either	 have	 been	 or	 are	 in	 the	 process	 of	
being	 resolved	 to	 the	 supplier’s	 satisfaction	 within	 the	 Trading	 Division	
using	 our	 standard	 internal	 escalation	 procedure.	 The	 resolution	 of	
one	 alleged	 breach	 was	 facilitated	 by	 the	 Code	 Compliance	 Officer	 in	
accordance	 with	 GSCOP.
Risk management and internal controls
The	 Board	 has	 overall	 responsibility	 for	 risk	 management	 and	 the	
system	 of	 internal	 controls	 and	 for	 reviewing	 their	 effectiveness.	 Certain	
of	 these	 responsibilities	 have	 been	 delegated	 to	 the	 Audit	 Committee	
as	 outlined	 on	 page	 47.	 The	 system	 is	 designed	 to	 manage	 rather	
than	 eliminate	 the	 risk	 of	 failure	 to	 achieve	 the	 Company’s	 business	
objectives	 and	 can	 only	 provide	 reasonable	 and	 not	 absolute	 assurance	
against	 material	 misstatement	 or	 loss.	
The	 risk	 management	 process	 and	 the	 system	 of	 internal	 controls	
have	 been	 in	 place	 for	 the	 whole	 year,	 up	 to	 the	 date	 of	 approval	 of	 the	
Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements,	 and	 accord	 with	 the	 Turnbull	
guidance	 and	 the	 UK	 Corporate	 Governance	 Code.	
The	 Audit	 Committee	 has	 reviewed	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 system	 of	
internal	 controls	 and	 has	 ensured	 that	 any	 required	 remedial	 action	 on	
any	 identified	 weaknesses	 has	 been,	 or	 is	 being	 taken.
Risk management
Accepting	 that	 risk	 is	 an	 inherent	 part	 of	 doing	 business,	 the	 risk	
management	 system	 is	 designed	 to	 identify	 key	 risks	 and	 to	 provide	
assurance	 that	 these	 risks	 are	 fully	 understood	 and	 managed.	 The	
effectiveness	 of	 the	 process	 is	 reviewed	 twice	 a	 year	 by	 the	 Audit	
Committee.	 The	 Board	 carries	 out	 an	 annual	 review	 of	 the	 significant	
risks	 facing	 the	 business.	
The	 Operating	 Board	 maintains	 an	 overall	 corporate	 risk	 register	 which	
is	 reviewed	 twice	 yearly	 by	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 and	 formally	 discussed	
with	 the	 Board.	 The	 risk	 register	 contains	 the	 significant	 risks	 faced	 by	
the	 business	 and	 identifies	 the	 potential	 impact	 and	 likelihood	 at	 both	
a	 gross	 level	 (before	 consideration	 of	 mitigating	 controls)	 and	 net	 level	
(after	 consideration	 of	 mitigating	 controls).	 This	 gives	 the	 Board	 the	
opportunity	 to	 review	 the	 level	 of	 risk	 that	 the	 business	 is	 prepared	 to	
accept.	 The	 register	 also	 contains	 the	 assurance	 provided	 over	 current	
key	 mitigating	 controls.	 Where	 further	 actions	 have	 been	 identified	
to	 mitigate	 risks	 to	 a	 level	 deemed	 acceptable,	 these	 are	 agreed	 with	
specific	 timelines	 for	 delivery	 and	 are	 monitored	 closely	 until	 fully	
implemented.	
The	 risk	 management	 process	 is	 cascaded	 from	 the	 Operating	 Board	
through	 to	 each	 of	 the	 operating	 divisions	 of	 the	 business	 as	 follows:
•	
the	 divisional	 operating	 management	 teams	 are	 responsible	 for	
managing	 the	 risks	 to	 their	 business	 objectives	 and	 for	 identification	
and	 implementation	 of	 internal	 controls	 so	 as	 to	 provide	 reasonable,	
but	 not	 absolute,	 assurance	 that	 the	 risks	 in	 their	 areas	 of	
responsibility	 are	 appropriately	 identified,	 evaluated	 and	 managed;
•	
this	 divisional	 risk	 process	 is	 achieved	 through	 twice	 yearly	 workshops	
(in	 January/August)	 held	 by	 the	 divisional	 management	 and	 facilitated	
by	 Internal	 Audit.	 Each	 divisional	 management	 team	 produces	 and	
maintains	 a	 divisional	 key	 risk	 register.	 The	 likelihood	 and	 impact	 of	
each	 key	 risk	 is	 evaluated	 and	 actions	 deemed	 necessary	 to	 mitigate	
them	 are	 identified.	 In	 addition,	 the	 risks	 and	 the	 robustness	 of	 the	
mitigating	 controls	 are	 regularly	 reviewed	 by	 divisional	 management	
as	 part	 of	 their	 normal	 business	 activities;
•	
management	 certify	 annually	 (in	 May)	 that	 they	 are	 responsible	 for	
managing	 their	 business	 objectives	 and	 that	 the	 internal	 controls	 are	
such	 that	 they	 provide	 reasonable	 but	 not	 absolute	 assurance	 that	
the	 risks	 in	 their	 areas	 of	 responsibility	 are	 appropriately	 identified,	
evaluated	 and	 managed;
•	
the	 Operating	 Board	 reviews	 (in	 February/August)	 and	 challenges	
the	 output	 of	 the	 divisional	 risk	 process	 and	 then	 updates	 the	 overall	
corporate	 risk	 register	 as	 appropriate;
•	
Game-Changer	 risk	 workshops	 are	 held	 (in	 June/July)	 to	 focus	 on	
external	 and	 unknown	 risks;
•	
the	 corporate	 and	 divisional	 risk	 registers	 form	 the	 basis	 of	 the	 	
risk-based	 plan	 of	 Internal	 Audit	 for	 the	 subsequent	 half-year	 	
period	 (in	 March/September);	
•	
Internal	 Audit	 provides	 independent	 assurance	 to	 management	 and	
the	 Audit	 Committee	 as	 to	 the	 existence	 and	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 risk	
management	 process;	 and
•	
The	 Board	 reviews,	 in	 May,	 the	 risk	 process,	 corporate	 risks	 and	
approves	 the	 Company’s	 Principal	 Risks	 and	 Uncertainties.

The	 risk	 management	 process	 is	 illustrated	 below:
Company’s strategy, plans and objectives
Internal controls
The	 system	 of	 internal	 control	 encompasses	 all	 controls	 including	 those	
relating	 to	 financial	 reporting	 processes	 (including	 the	 preparation	 of	
the	 consolidated	 Group	 accounts),	 operational	 and	 compliance	 controls,	
and	 those	 relating	 to	 risk	 management	 processes.	 It	 also	 includes	 the	
controls	 over	 Sainsbury’s	 interests	 in	 Sainsbury’s	 Bank	 and	 property	
joint	 ventures.
The	 Audit	 Committee	 assesses	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 internal	 controls	
systems	 on	 an	 ongoing	 basis,	 enabling	 a	 cumulative	 assessment	 to	 be	
made.	 The	 processes	 used	 during	 the	 year	 to	 support	 this	 assessment

Governance 50 J Sainsbury plc	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 2012
Colleague engagement, retention and capability
Risk
The	 Group	 employs	 around	 150,000	 colleagues	 who	 are	 critical	
to	 the	 success	 of	 our	 business.	 Attracting	 and	 maintaining	 good	
relations	 with	 talented	 colleagues	 and	 investing	 in	 their	 training	 and	
development	 is	 essential	 to	 the	 efficiency	 and	 sustainability	 of	 the	
Group’s	 operations.	
Mitigation
The	 Group’s	 employment	 policies	 and	 remuneration	 and	 benefits	
packages	 are	 regularly	 reviewed	 and	 are	 designed	 to	 be	 competitive	
with	 other	 companies,	 as	 well	 as	 providing	 colleagues	 with	 fulfilling	
career	 opportunities.	 Colleague	 surveys,	 performance	 reviews,	
communications	 with	 trade	 unions	 and	 regular	 communication	
of	 business	 activities	 are	 some	 of	 the	 methods	 the	 Group	 uses	 to	
understand	 and	 respond	 to	 colleagues’	 needs.	 Processes	 are	 also	
in	 place	 to	 identify	 talent	 and	 actively	 manage	 succession	 planning	
throughout	 the	 business.	
Data security
Risk
It	 is	 essential	 that	 the	 security	 of	 customer,	 colleague	 or	 company	
confidential	 data	 is	 maintained.	 A	 major	 breach	 of	 information	 security	
could	 have	 a	 major	 impact	 on	 the	 business.
Mitigation
Various	 information	 security	 policies	 and	 standards	 are	 in	 place	
which	 focus	 on	 encryption,	 network	 security,	 access	 controls,	 system	
security,	 data	 protection	 and	 information	 handling.	 A	 review	 of	 key	
contractors	 across	 the	 organisation	 who	 hold	 sensitive	 customer	
or	 colleague	 data	 is	 ongoing,	 and	 progress	 is	 monitored	 by	 the	
Information	 Security	 Risk	 Committee.	 A	 risk-based	 security	 testing	
approach	 across	 Sainsbury’s	 IT	 infrastructure	 and	 applications	 is	 in	
place	 to	 identify	 and	 remediate	 ongoing	 vulnerabilities.
Environment and sustainability
Risk
Environment	 and	 sustainability	 are	 core	 to	 Sainsbury’s	 values.	 The	 key	
risk	 facing	 the	 Group	 in	 this	 area	 relates	 to	 reducing	 the	 environmental	
impact	 of	 the	 business	 with	 a	 focus	 on	 reducing	 packaging	 and	 new	 ways	
of	 reducing	 waste	 and	 energy	 usage	 across	 stores,	 depots	 and	 offices.
Mitigation
A	 number	 of	 initiatives	 are	 in	 place,	 which	 are	 being	 led	 by	 the	
Environmental	 Action	 Team	 and	 the	 Corporate	 Responsibility	
Steering	 Group,	 to	 reduce	 our	 environmental	 impact	 and	 to	 meet	 our	
customers’	 expectations	 in	 this	 area.	 Further	 details	 are	 included	 in	
the	 Corporate	 Responsibility	 review	 on	 pages	 44	 to	 45.
Financial strategy and treasury risk
Risk
The	 main	 financial	 risks	 are	 the	 availability	 of	 short	 and	 long-
term	 funding	 to	 meet	 business	 needs,	 counterparty	 liabilities	 and	
fluctuations	 in	 interest	 and	 foreign	 currency	 rates	 which	 continue	 to	
be	 impacted	 by	 the	 turbulence	 in	 the	 financial	 markets.
Mitigation
The	 Group	 Treasury	 function	 is	 responsible	 for	 managing	 the	 Group’s	
liquid	 resources,	 funding	 requirements,	 and	 interest	 rate	 and	 currency	
exposures	 and	 the	 associated	 risks	 as	 set	 out	 in	 note	 28	 on	 pages	 99	
to	 104.	 The	 Group	 Treasury	 function	 has	 clear	 policies	 and	 operating	
procedures	 which	 are	 regularly	 reviewed	 and	 audited.
Corporate governance statement continued
Principal risks & uncertainties 
The	 risk	 management	 process	 is	 closely	 aligned	 to	 accelerating	 our	
growth	 plan,	 which	 focuses	 on	 growing	 the	 business	 through	 the	
addition	 of	 new	 range,	 space,	 business	 development,	 channels	 to	
market	 and	 property	 management.	 Risk	 is	 an	 inherent	 part	 of	 doing	
business.	 The	 system	 of	 risk	 management	 used	 to	 identify	 the	 principal	
risks	 the	 Group	 faces	 and	 to	 develop	 and	 closely	 monitor	 key	 controls,	
is	 described	 on	 page	 48.	 The	 management	 of	 these	 risks	 is	 based	 on	
a	 balance	 of	 risk	 and	 reward	 determined	 through	 careful	 assessment	
of	 both	 the	 potential	 likelihood	 and	 impact.	 Consideration	 is	 given	 to	
both	 reputational	 as	 well	 as	 financial	 impact,	 recognising	 the	 significant	
commercial	 value	 attributable	 to	 the	 Sainsbury’s	 brand.	 The	 principal	
risks	 identified	 by	 the	 Board	 and	 the	 corresponding	 mitigating	 controls	
are	 set	 out	 below	 in	 no	 order	 of	 priority.
Business continuity and major incidents response 
Risk
A	 major	 incident	 or	 catastrophic	 event	 could	 impact	 on	 the	 Group’s	
ability	 to	 trade.	
Mitigation
Sainsbury’s	 has	 detailed	 plans	 in	 place,	 supported	 by	 senior	
representatives	 who	 are	 trained	 in	 dealing	 with	 major	 incidents	 and	
have	 the	 authority	 levels	 to	 make	 decisions	 in	 the	 event	 of	 a	 potentially	
disruptive	 incident.
The	 Business	 Continuity	 Steering	 Group	 meets	 quarterly	 to	 ensure	 that	
the	 business	 continuity	 (‘BC’)	 policy	 and	 strategy	 is	 fit	 for	 purpose.	
In	 addition,	 it	 oversees	 the	 mitigation	 of	 all	 risks	 associated	 with	 BC	
and	 IT	 disaster	 recovery.	 In	 the	 event	 of	 any	 unplanned	 or	 unforeseen	
events,	 the	 Business	 Continuity	 Management	 Team	 is	 convened	 at	
short	 notice	 to	 manage	 any	 associated	 risk	 to	 the	 business.
All	 key	 strategic	 locations	 have	 secondary	 backup	 sites	 which	 would	 be	
made	 available	 within	 pre-defined	 timescales	 and	 are	 regularly	 tested.
Business strategy 
Risk
If	 the	 Board	 adopts	 the	 wrong	 business	 strategy	 or	 does	 not	
implement	 its	 strategies	 effectively,	 the	 business	 may	 be	 negatively	
impacted.	 Risks	 to	 delivering	 the	 strategy	 need	 to	 be	 properly	
understood	 and	 managed	 to	 deliver	 long-term	 growth	 for	 the	 benefit	
of	 all	 stakeholders.
Mitigation
A	 clear	 strategy	 remains	 in	 place	 with	 five	 key	 areas	 of	 focus:
•	
Great	 food;
•	
Compelling	 general	 merchandise	 and	 clothing;
•	
Complementary	 channels	 and	 services;
•	
Developing	 new	 business;	 and
•	
Growing	 space	 and	 creating	 property	 value.
Progress	 against	 these	 areas	 of	 focus	 and	 any	 risks	 to	 delivery,	 	
such	 as	 the	 availability	 of	 suitable	 new	 store	 sites,	 are	 regularly	
reviewed	 by	 the	 Board	 and	 the	 overall	 strategy	 is	 reviewed	 at	 the	 	
two-day	 Strategy	 Conference.	 The	 Operating	 Board	 also	 holds	 	
regular	 sessions	 to	 discuss	 strategy.	 This	 activity	 is	 supported	 by	 	
a	 dedicated	 strategy	 team.	 To	 ensure	 the	 strategy	 is	 communicated	
and	 understood,	 the	 Group	 engages	 with	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 stakeholders	
including	 shareholders,	 colleagues,	 customers	 and	 suppliers	 on	 a	
continual	 basis.
Governance 		 Annual	 Report	 and	 Financial	 Statements	 2012	 J Sainsbury plc 51
Health and safety – people and product
Risk
Prevention	 of	 injury	 or	 loss	 of	 life	 for	 both	 colleagues	 and	 customers	
is	 of	 utmost	 importance.	 In	 addition	 it	 is	 paramount	 to	 maintaining	 the	
confidence	 our	 customers	 have	 in	 our	 business.
Mitigation
Clear	 policies	 and	 procedures	 are	 in	 place	 detailing	 the	 controls	
required	 to	 manage	 health	 and	 safety	 and	 product	 safety	 risks	
across	 the	 business	 and	 comply	 with	 all	 applicable	 regulations.	 These	
cover	 the	 end-to-end	 operation,	 from	 the	 auditing	 and	 vetting	 of	
construction	 contractors,	 to	 the	 health	 and	 safety	 processes	 in	 place	
in	 our	 depots,	 stores	 and	 offices	 to	 the	 controls	 in	 place	 to	 ensure	
people	 and	 product	 safety	 and	 integrity.	
Process	 compliance	 is	 supported	 by	 external	 accreditation	 and	
internal	 training	 programmes,	 which	 are	 aligned	 to	 both	 health	 and	
safety	 laws	 and	 Sainsbury’s	 internal	 policies.	 In	 addition,	 resource	
is	 dedicated	 to	 manage	 the	 risk	 effectively,	 in	 the	 form	 of	 the	 Group	
Safety	 Committee	 and	 specialist	 teams	 including	 Convenience	 Risk	
Managers	 and	 Logistics	 and	 Commercial	 Safety	 Specialists.
IT systems and infrastructure
Risk
The	 Group	 is	 reliant	 on	 its	 IT	 systems	 and	 operational	 infrastructure	 in	
order	 to	 trade	 efficiently.	 Inadequate	 systems	 or	 failure	 of	 key	 systems	
could	 have	 a	 significant	 impact	 on	 our	 business.
Mitigation
The	 Group	 has	 extensive	 controls	 in	 place	 to	 maintain	 the	 integrity	 and	
efficiency	 of	 its	 systems	 including	 detailed	 recovery	 plans	 in	 the	 event	
of	 a	 significant	 failure.	 New	 innovations	 and	 upgrades	 to	 systems	
are	 ongoing	 to	 improve	 both	 the	 customer	 experience	 and	 colleague	
efficiency.	 Prior	 to	 introducing	 system	 changes,	 rigorous	 testing	 is	
completed.
Pension risk
Risk
The	 Group	 operates	 a	 number	 of	 pension	 arrangements	 which	
includes	 a	 defined	 benefit	 scheme.	 This	 scheme	 is	 subject	 to	 risks	
in	 relation	 to	 its	 liabilities	 as	 a	 result	 of	 changes	 in	 life	 expectancy,	
inflation	 and	 future	 salary	 increases,	 and	 to	 risks	 regarding	 the	 value	
of	 investments	 and	 the	 returns	 derived	 from	 such	 investments.	
Mitigation
An	 investment	 strategy	 is	 in	 place	 which	 has	 been	 developed	 by	 the	
pension	 trustee,	 in	 consultation	 with	 the	 Company,	 to	 mitigate	 the	
volatility	 of	 liabilities,	 to	 diversify	 investment	 risk	 and	 to	 manage	 cash.	
Regulatory environment
Risk
The	 Group’s	 operations	 are	 subject	 to	 a	 broad	 spectrum	 of	 regulatory	
requirements.	 Key	 areas	 subject	 to	 regulation	 include	 planning,	
competition	 and	 environmental	 issues,	 employment,	 pensions	 and	 tax	
laws	 and	 regulations	 over	 the	 Group’s	 products	 and	 services.
Failure	 to	 comply	 with	 laws	 and	 regulations	 could	 lead	 to	 civil	 and/
or	 criminal	 legal	 prosecution	 and	 fines	 or	 imprisonment	 imposed	
on	 Sainsbury’s	 or	 our	 colleagues.	 In	 addition,	 a	 breach	 could	 lead	 to	
reputational	 damage.
Mitigation
There	 is	 an	 established	 governance	 process	 in	 place	 to	 monitor	
regulatory	 developments	 and	 to	 ensure	 that	 all	 existing	 and	
forthcoming	 regulations	 are	 complied	 with.	 Regular	 reviews	 are	
completed	 across	 the	 estate	 to	 ensure	 compliance	 and	 that	 training	
needs	 are	 addressed	 as	 required.
Processes	 for	 monitoring	 and	 embedding	 training	 for	 key	 new	
legislation	 are	 in	 place	 and	 Sainsbury’s	 also	 has	 a	 dedicated	 internal	
legal	 department	 to	 provide	 the	 relevant	 colleagues	 impacted	 by	 the	
regulations	 with	 advice	 and	 guidance.
Trading environment
Risk
Effective	 management	 of	 the	 trading	 account	 is	 key	 to	 the	
achievement	 of	 performance	 targets.	 The	 continued	 challenging	
economic	 environment	 and	 competitive	 retail	 pressure	 could	 affect	
the	 performance	 of	 the	 Group	 in	 terms	 of	 sales,	 costs	 and	 operations,	
through:
•	
the	 ongoing	 challenges	 to	 household	 disposable	 income;
•	
competitor	 pricing	 positions;	
•	
the	 reduction	 of	 the	 industry	 profit	 pool	 in	 the	 last	 year;	 and
•	
commodity	 costs	 driving	 up	 the	 cost	 of	 goods.
There	 is	 also	 a	 risk	 of	 supplier	 or	 other	 counterparty	 failure,	 with	
possible	 operational	 or	 financial	 consequences	 for	 the	 Group.
Mitigation
We	 continue	 to	 focus	 on	 delivering	 quality	 products	 with	 ‘universal	
appeal’,	 at	 a	 range	 of	 price	 points	 ensuring	 value	 for	 all	 our	 customers.	
This	 is	 achieved	 through	 the	 continuous	 review	 of	 our	 key	 customer	
metrics,	 monitoring	 of	 current	 market	 trends	 and	 price	 points	 across	
competitors,	 active	 management	 of	 price	 positions,	 development	 of	
sales	 propositions	 and	 increased	 promotion	 and	 marketing	 activity.	
While	 external	 cost	 pressures	 including	 oil-related	 costs,	 commodity	
pricing	 and	 business	 rates	 affect	 our	 business,	 the	 Group	 continues	 to	
work	 hard	 to	 mitigate	 the	 impact	 of	 these	 cost	 pressures	 on	 customers	
and	 on	 our	 overall	 profitability	 through	 the	 delivery	 of	 cost	 savings.	
Sainsbury’s	 undertakes	 credit	 checks	 on	 suppliers	 and	 maintains	
regular,	 open	 dialogue	 with	 key	 suppliers	 concerning	 their	 ability	
to	 trade.

Bob	Stack
Chairman, 
Remuneration  
Committee
Remuneration report 
Dear shareholder,
Since I became Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee 
in 2005, the remuneration 
policy has gradually evolved 
alongside our business strategy. 
Throughout this process we have 
continued to place significant 
emphasis on ensuring that 
executive remuneration is 
weighted towards performance-
related elements and directed 
towards creating sustainable 
long-term shareholder value. 
During the year, the Committee took the opportunity to review the 
long-term incentive plan (‘LTIP’) framework which was originally 
implemented in 2006. The purpose of the review was to ensure that 
our performance targets retained a strong alignment with the longer 
term business plans of the Company and, in particular, to ensure that 
our growth is delivered in a profitable way. We wanted to bring in 
an additional measure so that the plan would focus on what we see 
as being the important success factors over the coming years. The 
changes made this year will also make the performance measurement 
more transparent for participants and shareholders. As part of the  
review, we consulted with our major shareholders. The dialogue 
was informative and constructive, and we have used the feedback in 
determining our final design. 
We have not made any changes to award levels as a result of the review. 
Therefore maximum opportunities under the three incentive plans for 
Executive Directors shall remain unchanged from last year.
Sainsbury’s continues to deliver good performance and this has been 
achieved despite the continued weakness within the retail sector and 
the wider economy. The vesting of this year’s cash annual bonus and the 
2009/10 long-term incentive plan is lower than the awards which vested 
last year, and this is a function of the stretching targets that were set at 
the start of the relevant performance period. The Deferred Share Award 
is our medium-term incentive plan, and the vesting outcome for 2011/12 
reflects the positive actions taken by management to build the long-
term growth of the Company. 
In order to help shareholders to understand how pay is linked 
to performance, we have included a new section in this year’s 
Remuneration Report, which summarises the payout for the Chief 
Executive from the different elements of the package as they relate 
to performance in 2011/12.
The remuneration policy for the coming year is set out in greater detail 
in the main body of the report.    Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 53  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 53
Governance
Key points include:
• 
In keeping with our long standing approach, pay awards made to  
the Executive Directors at the start of the 2012/13 financial year  
were consistent with the approach taken across the wider Company. 
Justin King’s salary was increased by 2.17 per cent.
• 
During the year the Company achieved year-on-year growth in both 
sales and profit. The outcome under the annual bonus plan reflects 
the highly stretching targets which were set at the start of the year.
• 
The maximum opportunities for Executive Directors under the Annual 
Bonus, Deferred Share Award and Long-Term Incentive Plan are 
unchanged from last year.
• 
As a result of the review of the long-term incentives and following 
shareholder consultation, the Committee has decided that for the 
2012/13 grant, awards will be based on a combination of return on 
capital employed (‘ROCE’), cumulative underlying cash flow from 
operations and relative sales performance. 
• 
These changes will focus management on efficient use of our capital 
base, generating cash flow through increased profitability and 
achieving sales growth more successfully than our peers.
• 
In recognition of the recent developments in best practice and the 
concerns of shareholders generally, we are also introducing a claw-
back provision for future long-term incentive awards. This will further 
strengthen our formal governance in line with our existing philosophy.
The remuneration policy and framework as detailed in this 
Remuneration Report provide a platform to incentivise, motivate, retain 
and reward our leadership team. We are confident that our consistent 
efforts to ensure a direct link between pay and performance in the 
areas most valued by our shareholders have significantly contributed 
to building a focused leadership team.
Bob	Stack	
Chairman, Remuneration Committee 
Summary	of	performance	for	2011/12
Under the leadership of our experienced Executive team, we continue 
to deliver strong performance relative to our peers and this has been 
achieved despite the continued weakness within the retail sector and 
the wider economy. This highlights our continued improvement in 
performance across all key areas.
The charts below demonstrate the sustained performance and the value 
that we have delivered to our shareholders over an extended period.

Chief	Executive	Pay	Summary	
In order to provide shareholders with greater clarity as to how performance is linked to pay levels, the following table shows a breakdown of 
remuneration for the Chief Executive for 2011/12 and for 2010/11.
The table shows variable remuneration elements which are linked to performance in 2011/12. Shareholders will note that the Deferred Share Award 
is subject to a further two-year deferral period from the date of the award and that one half of the Value Builder award is subject to a further one-
year deferral period.

1  Annual bonus payouts are based on profit, sales and customer-focused targets plus performance against individual objectives. 
2  The bonuses awarded to the Executive Directors for 2011/12 averaged 46 per cent of the maximum bonus opportunity, reflecting the highly stretching performance targets that were set at the start 
of the financial year.
3  The Deferred Share Award demonstrates the link between Sainsbury’s strategic goals and its incentive plan framework.
4  Awards made under the third plan cycle, covering 2011/12, recognised the progress that has been made on the annual targets that are firmly focused on building long-term, sustainable success. 
Most of the targets set were either achieved or exceeded, further contributing to the creation of shareholder value, and awards will be made to all participants at 78 per cent of the maximum 
available under the plan.
5  The fourth cycle of the Value Builder plan was based on growth in ROCE and cash flow per share, with performance measured over the three financial years to 17 March 2012. Over the period the 
Company made substantial improvements in both cash generation and the returns achieved on our assets.
 Awards vested at 43 per cent of the maximum opportunity; one half of the shares to vest become exercisable in May 2012, and the balance will be exercisable in May 2013.
Note:
 –  The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan is a dormant plan described on page 61. No matching shares vested in respect of the 2009 grant which was tested at the end of the financial year. 143,818 matching 
shares were awarded in March 2011 in respect of the 2008 grant which was tested at the end of the 2010/11 financial year.
This	report	
This report is made by the Board on the recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee. The first part of the report sets out the 
remuneration policy, while the second part details the remuneration, 
pensions and share plan interests of the Directors for the 52 weeks to 
17 March 2012. The Directors confirm that this report has been prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and reflects the provision 
of Schedule 8 of the Large & Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts & Reports) Regulations 2008. 
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) on 11 July 2012 asking them to approve this report. 
Remuneration	Committee	
The Remuneration Committee comprises Bob Stack (Chairman), 
Anna Ford and Mary Harris. Mary joined the Committee in July 2011, 
replacing Val Gooding. All members of the Committee are independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Mary Harris will become Chairman of the 
Committee when Bob Stack steps down from the Board in July 2012.
Role	and	responsibilities	of	the	Committee
The responsibilities of the Committee include: 
• 
determining and agreeing with the Board the broad remuneration 
policy for the Chairman, Executive Directors and the Operating Board 
Directors; 
• 
setting individual remuneration arrangements for the Chairman and 
Executive Directors; 
• 
recommending and monitoring the level and structure of 
remuneration for those members of senior management within the 
scope of the Committee, namely the Operating Board Directors and 
any other executive whose salary exceeds that of any Operating 
Board Director;
• 
considering the achievement of the performance conditions under 
annual bonus and long-term incentive plans; and
• 
approving the service agreements of each Executive Director, 
including termination arrangements. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s 
website (www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/governance). 
Tim Fallowfield, Company Secretary, acts as secretary to the 
Committee. David Tyler, Justin King and Gwyn Burr, Customer Service 
and Colleague Director, are invited to attend Committee meetings, in 
addition to Diana Breeze, Director of Corporate HR. The Committee 
considers their views when reviewing the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and Operating Board Directors. Individuals who attend 
Remuneration Committee meetings do not participate in discussions 
concerning their own remuneration. 
The Committee is authorised by the Board to appoint external 
advisers if it considers this beneficial. Over the course of the year, 
the Committee was supported by its appointed advisers, Deloitte LLP 
(‘Deloitte’), whose consultants attended all of the Committee meetings. 
Deloitte provided the Company with unrelated advice and consultancy 
regarding information technology, online strategy, and a range of 
taxation matters. Towers Watson provided comparative data which was 
considered by the Committee in setting remuneration levels and it also 
provided actuarial services in the year. Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) 
calculations are supplied by UBS, who provided broking and banking 
services to the Company during the year.   Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 55  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 55

Remuneration	Policy	
The Committee considers that the Remuneration Policy should drive 
performance and complement the overall strategy of the Company.  
It believes that the ongoing growth and success of the Company  
during challenging market conditions is testament to this approach.  
It is committed to ensuring that the management team is rewarded for 
continuing to deliver the Company’s growth plans and is appropriately 
aligned with the creation of long-term shareholder value.
The Company’s current arrangements, therefore, incorporate 
performance metrics which link to the business strategy, and 
specifically the five areas of focus (as described in the Business review) 
which are directed towards generating good long-term growth.
The	Company’s	Remuneration	Policy	is	as	follows:	
It remains the Committee’s intention that Directors’ remuneration 
should be competitive, both in terms of base salary and total 
remuneration. This approach is designed to promote the Company’s 
short and long-term successes through the securing of high calibre 
executive talent. This, in turn, is one of the key ways in which 
shareholder value can be further created and strengthened. 
• 
Basic salaries should be market competitive, determined by drawing 
on a range of factors. The Committee considers the individual’s 
experience, potential, performance, job size and scope, along with 
data that takes into account the remuneration of comparable 
executive roles in similar companies. The Committee also has regard 
to the external business environment and the general level of 
increases applied across the Company. 
• 
The design and scale of pension provision and other employment 
benefits should be in line with wider market practice, placing a 
particular emphasis on the retail sector. 
• 
Incentive plans should be linked to stretching performance measures 
and targets, covering a mix of financial and non-financial measures. 
The measures are reviewed and monitored to ensure that they do not 
drive unacceptable behaviours or encourage excessive risk-taking. 
Incentive plan awards are not pensionable. 
• 
A significant proportion of the total remuneration package is 
performance-related, aligning management’s and shareholders’ 
interests. Exceptional levels of performance will be rewarded with 
exceptional levels of total reward. 
• 
The Committee expects the Executive Directors and Operating Board 
Directors to acquire and maintain a shareholding in the Company 
sufficient to align their interests with those of shareholders. 
When reviewing or amending remuneration arrangements, the 
Committee considers any impact on the cost to the Company, employee 
behaviour, pay practices across the Company, stakeholders (including 
shareholders, governance bodies and employees), share dilution, best 
practice corporate governance and market competitiveness, particularly 
within the retail sector.

Cash Shares
The balance between the fixed pay (basic salary, pension and benefits) 
and variable pay (Annual Bonus, Deferred Share Award and Long-Term 
Incentive Plan) changes with performance, and the variable proportion 
of total remuneration increases significantly for increased levels of 
performance. 
Around 60 per cent of the package is delivered through variable pay at 
on-target performance and this proportion increases to around three-
quarters of the package at stretch levels of performance.
The Committee believes that it is important to align the interests of both 
management and shareholders and therefore a significant proportion of 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration is made in the form of shares. 
Overall, the Committee considers that the overall package structure 
is balanced, from the perspective of the breakdown between fixed and 
variable elements, cash and shares and the phased delivery of rewards 
over time.
The sections below describe each component of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration package.
i)	Fixed	remuneration	
Basic	salary	
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the 
Committee, taking account of a number of elements, including the 
Director’s performance, experience, responsibilities and job size and 
scope, as well as external pay data. Furthermore, the Committee 
considers such information as economic factors, remuneration trends 
and focuses in particular on the general level of salary increases 
awarded throughout the Company. The Committee uses the same 
approach when reviewing the salaries of the Operating Board Directors.    Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 57  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 57
Governance
The external pay data provided to the Committee is sourced from 
relevant roles within the UK retail sector, in companies with annual 
sales revenues over £5 billion and also in companies with a market 
capitalisation ranging from £3-£10 billion. This approach ensures that 
the most appropriate available benchmark for the Director’s specific 
position is obtained; however, in line with best practice, the Committee 
applies judgement when considering market data. 
The Committee reviewed the Executive Directors’ salaries for the start 
of the 2012/13 financial year. In the context of another good year, the 
Committee agreed salary increases for 2012/13 that were in line with the 
range of awards applied to management and non-management central 
colleagues (2 per cent). The hourly paid retail colleague award for 
2011/12 was 2.7 per cent. 
• 
An increase in Justin King’s basic salary of £20,000, from £920,000 
to £940,000. 
• 
Increases in John Rogers’ and Mike Coupe’s basic salaries of £10,000 
each, from £500,000 to £510,000 and from £565,000 to £575,000, 
respectively.
• 
In aggregate their total salaries have increased by £40,000, in line 
with the overall budget of 2 per cent of their combined 2011/12  
basic salaries.
Pensions	
The Company’s Defined Benefit Pension Plan was closed to new 
members on 31 January 2002 and none of the Executive Directors 
participates in it. 
In lieu of pension plan participation, Justin King receives a pension 
supplement of 30 per cent of salary whilst Mike Coupe receives a 
pension supplement of 25 per cent of salary.
John Rogers participates in the JS Self Invested Pension Plan, a defined 
contribution arrangement which is open to all senior management. 
In return for contributing five per cent of his salary, the Company 
contributes 12.5 per cent of his salary up to an internal earnings cap 
(£129,600 for 2011/12). He receives a pension supplement of 25 per cent 
of the pensionable salary he was paid in excess of the earnings cap.
Benefits	
Benefits for Directors include the provision of company car benefits,  
life assurance, colleague discount and private medical cover. 
ii)	Variable	remuneration	—	current	plans	
Annual	bonus	plan	
All bonus plans across the Company are aligned under a set of common 
principles. For 2011/12, Board and management plans retained the 
same key metrics based on profit and sales growth, customer-focused 
measures, plus an element for individual performance. 
Bonus awards are weighted to the achievement of profit, and it 
continues to act as the overall ‘gateway’ measure for the plan,  
reflecting the emphasis on growing profit. For Executive Directors,  
at least half of the bonus is based on profit, and the remainder is  
based on sales, customer-focused targets and the achievement of 
individual objectives. 
The customer-focused measures for 2011/12 were revised to be based 
on: (i) availability, which is measured across all stores on a regular basis 
by an independent third party, conducting random and unannounced 
store visits, and (ii) a customer service measure which is also assessed 
by an independent third party. Individual performance objectives 
are set annually for each Executive Director and are reviewed by the 
Committee. These objectives cover a variety of financial and operational 
targets that contribute to the achievement of longer-term strategic 
goals; some of these objectives relate, either directly or indirectly,  
to the Company’s values. 
The maximum cash bonus that could have been earned for 2011/12 was 
125 per cent of salary in respect of the Chief Executive and 90 per cent 
of salary in respect of the other Executive Directors. The Committee 
assessed performance against the performance targets at the start of 
the year, and for guidance, the outturn is as follows:
Profit Sales
Customer-
focused
Individual 
performance
Above target
• •
Target
•
Threshold
Below threshold •
During the year the Company achieved year-on-year growth in sales 
and profit but the sales performance was below the threshold level. 
The bonus outcome reflects the highly stretching targets which were 
set across all elements of the plan at the start of the year. Based on 
the above performance outcomes, the bonus payments for 2011/12 will 
be 55.9 per cent of salary for Justin King, 43.7 per cent of salary for 
John Rogers and 42.2 per cent of salary for Mike Coupe.
The 2011/12 bonus plan for store colleagues was based on the 
achievement of a corporate sales target as well as customer service 
targets measured in their individual stores. The Company’s performance 
has enabled around 125,000 colleagues to earn awards from a bonus 
pool totalling over £60 million. 
For 2012/13, the bonus measures will remain unchanged and the targets 
will be set to incentivise stretching year-on-year growth. The maximum 
annual bonus award opportunities will also remain unchanged at 125 
per cent of basic salary for the Chief Executive and 90 per cent of basic 
salary for the other Executive Directors.
Deferred	Share	Award	
The Deferred Share Award (‘DSA’) is intended to drive performance 
against a diverse range of business-critical financial and non-financial 
scorecard measures. These are intended to reward Directors for 
achieving the short-term objectives that will directly lead to building  
the sustainable, long-term growth of the Company. 
The DSA covers broadly the top 40 managers in the Company, including 
Executive Directors. Share-based awards are made to participants 
subject to performance against a basket of key strategic measures 
which are aligned under four broad categories: 
1.  financial performance;
2. returns to shareholders; 
3.  relative performance against peers; and 
4.  strategic goals. 
At least 50 per cent of the award will be based on the delivery of 
financial performance (e.g. profit, earnings per share and sales) and 
returns to shareholders (e.g. TSR and dividend yield). The balance will 
be based on measures which will assess the Company’s performance 
relative to its competitors (e.g. market share) as well as key strategic/
corporate goals, linked to the five areas of focus. In addition, no shares 
will be awarded unless the profit gateway target (as applied to the 
annual bonus plan) is achieved. 
Performance against the targets is measured over one financial year, 
but any shares awarded are deferred for a further two years to ensure 
that management’s interests continue to be aligned with those of 
shareholders. The shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant 
resigns or is dismissed for cause prior to their release date. Dividends 
accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares. 
When developing the DSA, the Committee gave careful consideration 
to the selection of its performance measures and targets, as well as to 
the robustness of the plan design. In reviewing the plan, the Committee 
has agreed that appropriate corporate responsibility targets would be 
included within the strategic goals category. 
During the year, the Committee conducted an interim appraisal to gauge 
the progress of performance and the plan’s effectiveness based on half 
year results.

The Company has performed well in 2011/12, and this has flowed 
through to the basket of measures that the Committee considered for 
the purposes of making awards under the DSA. Although some of the 
specific measures and targets are commercially sensitive, the sections 
below present a selection of performance highlights within each of the 
four categories. 
Financial	performance	
Underlying profit before tax improved by 7.1 per cent to £712 million. 
Underlying operating margin improved by four basis points to 3.54 
per cent, or ten basis points at constant fuel prices. Underlying basic 
earnings per share increased by 6.0 per cent to 28.1 pence.
Return	to	shareholders
The Company saw its seventh consecutive year of like-for-like sales 
growth, with like-for-like sales (including VAT, excluding fuel) of 2.1 
per cent. Our strong sales performance helped us to maintain a 
strong balance sheet, with return on capital employed of 11.1 per cent. 
This has enabled the Company to maintain a good level of returns 
to shareholders. The recommended full year dividend increased 6.6 
per cent to 16.1 pence, covered 1.75 times by underlying earnings. Our 
dividend yield and price/earnings ratio remain amongst the highest in 
the sector. TSR was assessed on both a relative and absolute basis over 
one, three and five-year periods.
Relative	performance
Our sales grew ahead of the market, with market share increasing to 
16.6 per cent despite the continuing difficult consumer environment. For 
the 46 weeks from 20 March 2011 to 4 February 2012 we outperformed 
the IGD pool by 0.6 per cent (source: IGD Market Track – in compliance 
with the Market Track 12 week exclusion rule). We grew our customer 
numbers by a further one million to 22 million per week, demonstrating 
our universal customer appeal and ability to reach more customers 
through our store opening programme and multichannel offer. We won 
the top award in the Retail Industry Awards 2011 for the second time 
in three years and for a second year running won the Convenience 
Chain of the Year award. Since the trial of Brand Match in August 2011, 
research has shown that the number of customers that agree that 
Sainsbury’s sells brands at the same price as other supermarkets has 
risen from 68 per cent to 80 per cent.
Strategic	goals	
The Company’s strategy continues to centre on our five areas of focus. 
These are underpinned by Sainsbury’s strong heritage and brand which 
consistently set it apart from major competitors. Further details on the 
corporate objectives can be found in the Business review, and details 
of the corporate responsibility commitments are summarised on  
pages 8 to 9. 
• 
We made good progress with our Great Food programme, rolling  
this out across 333 stores. We successfully re-launched our core own 
label by Sainsbury’s brand, with 3,700 products new or improved.   
We further improved our customer offer by introducing a Bakery 
College and six Food Colleges to equip our colleagues with the 
ability to deliver consistently great products to our customers, 
training 18,000 colleagues. We were proud to receive City & Guilds 
accreditation for the Colleges.
• 
Our compelling general merchandise and clothing ranges continued 
to grow significantly faster than food, driven by our focus on category 
champions and, in clothing, by the launch of a number of Gok for 
Tu ladieswear collections with the celebrity designer, Gok Wan. We 
continued to make it easier for our customers to shop for general 
merchandise by increasing our Click & Collect offer to over 900 stores 
across the country. We also continued to expand our online presence, 
with the acquisition of Global Media Vault Limited building our online 
entertainment capability.
• 
We continued the development of our multi-channel offer. Strong 
growth in the Convenience business, which now generates sales of 
£1.3 billion, was supported by the opening of a further 73 stores in the 
year, in line with our plans to open one to two stores per week. We 
were also proud to receive the Convenience Chain of the Year award 
at the 2011 Retail Industry Awards. Our online offer has continued to 
expand and grew at 20 per cent year-on-year, delivering sales of £0.8 
billion. Sainsbury’s Bank has performed strongly in the year, with 
Sainsbury’s share of underlying post tax profits up over 45 per cent.
• 
During the year, we continued to develop new businesses, including 
the launch of Sainsbury’s Energy in partnership with British Gas and 
our first hospital outpatient pharmacy at the James Cook Hospital 
in South Tees. By moving into areas that are a natural extension of 
our brand we aim to grow value based on the trust people have in 
Sainsbury’s, our colleagues and our values.
• 
Expanding and developing the store estate continued to be at the 
heart of the Company’s strategy. During the year, we added 1.4 
million sq ft of gross space achieved through the opening of 19 new 
or replacement supermarkets, the extension of 28 supermarkets and 
the opening of 73 new convenience stores. Our investments made 
over the past few years continue to deliver returns above our required 
hurdle and have helped to deliver sales growth and drive property 
value. Our return on capital employed was 11.1 per cent, a year-on-year 
movement of (2) basis points. ROCE growth was held back by the 
cumulative effect of our accelerated investment in our space growth 
programme. The Company still has a strong pipeline of sites for future 
development, both for new stores and extensions.
• 
The market value of the Company’s freehold property portfolio 
increased by £0.7 billion to £11.2 billion, as a result of £1.0 billion  
from investment and development activity offset by £0.3 billion  
from sales of properties. By taking advantage of competitive market 
pricing on these dry assets, the Company generated £83 million of 
property profits.
• 
The Company’s corporate responsibility commitments have moved 
on significantly during the year. In October, we launched a £1 billion 
plan, to ensure the Company remains at the forefront of sustainability 
between now and 2020. The Sainsbury’s 20 by 20 Sustainability 
Plan sets out 20 sustainability targets to be achieved by 2020. Our 
industry-leading approach has also been recognised through our 
inclusion in the globally respected Dow Jones Sustainability Index, for 
a number of years. We have also retained our Platinum Plus status in 
the Business in the Community Corporate Responsibility Index, the 
highest external accolade in the UK. In December 2011, we pledged 
our support for Comic Relief and Sport Relief for another six years, 
which will see the total raised by colleagues and customers pass £100 
million. This year’s Sport Relief total was £5.5 million.
Following the year-end, the Committee conducted a rigorous 
assessment of performance. Consistent with the underlying principles 
of the DSA, the Committee assessed achievements in the round, and 
also considered the manner in which these strategic goals had been 
delivered, in particular how the overall performance of the Company 
had contributed to its future, sustainable growth and success. 
The Committee agreed that for 2011/12, awards would be made at 78 
per cent of the maximum level. This translates into a share award of 98 
per cent of salary for Justin King and 70 per cent of salary for the other 
Executive Directors.
The Committee has reviewed the DSA’s performance framework for 
2012/13; the four performance categories and metrics will remain 
consistent with those agreed for 2011/12. The maximum DSA award 
opportunities will also remain unchanged at 125 per cent of basic salary 
for the Chief Executive and 90 per cent of basic salary for the other 
Executive Directors.
Long-term	Incentive	Plan	2006	
At its launch in 2006, this plan covered the Company’s core 
management from the Chief Executive to supermarket store managers. 
From 2011/12, awards have covered around 200 of the Company’s top 
leaders only, including the Executive Directors. An alternative reward 
framework was designed for supermarket store managers and other 
managers of an equivalent grade, which incentivises them against a 
range of operational and financial measures that are closely aligned  
to their roles. 
Under the plan, a core award of shares in the Company is granted 
to all participants, calculated as a percentage of their salaries and 
scaled according to grade. Vesting of core awards is dependent upon 
performance against specific measures tested at the end of a three year 
performance period. No awards vest for performance below threshold 
levels of performance and core awards can grow by up to four times at 
stretch levels of performance. There is no re-testing. The performance 
measures and the targets are common for all participants.    Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 59  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 59
Governance
The performance measures are reviewed each year by the Committee, 
before a new grant is made, to ensure that they remain relevant and 
stretching. 
Awards granted under the new framework described below are referred 
to as Future Builder awards. Awards granted between 2006 and 2011 
under the previous framework were referred to as Value Builder awards.
Future	Builder	–	review	for	2012/13	awards
During the course of 2011/12 the Remuneration Committee undertook an 
in-depth review of the performance metrics which would apply to awards 
granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan for the 2012/13 cycle. 
The previous structure had been in operation since 2006, and therefore 
the Committee considered it appropriate to review the extent to which 
the performance targets supported the corporate ambitions of the 
Company during the next phase of development. Specifically, the 
intention was to ensure that awards complement the Company’s future 
strategy as outlined in the Business review which would be achieved by 
delivering long-term sustainable performance in three key areas:
• 
Improving the returns from our existing supermarkets business  
(both food and non-food);
• 
Driving growth through value-adding new stores and extensions; and 
• 
Creating new business growth through investing further in our 
existing convenience and online channels, building our presence 
in financial services, and pursuing new opportunities, for example 
Energy and Pharmacy. 
The Committee determined that it was in the interests of both the 
Company and shareholders that the long-term incentives complement 
these strategic goals. The measures for the 2012/13 awards will focus 
on sustainable long-term growth while also improving visibility and 
transparency for both management and shareholders. As part of  
the design process the Committee consulted with major shareholders. 
The feedback received from shareholders was taken into account  
during the design process and influenced the final design. 
The review primarily focused on performance metrics and strategic 
alignment, and therefore the maximum award levels for executive 
directors remain unchanged from last year.
For 2012/13 awards, vesting will be subject to three performance 
criteria: ROCE, cumulative underlying cash flow from operations  
and relative sales performance.
Element Performance metrics
ROCE
• 
ROCE reflects the value we gain from our assets, and as such is a critical measure of the quality of our business activity and 
the efficiency of capital use, and is therefore retained from the previous structure. To increase the transparency around 
this measure and bring greater consistency with published results, we propose to adjust the definition to reflect externally 
reported ROCE more closely, by removing the effect of the Group pension scheme.
• 
In particular, an adjustment was previously made to the calculation for capital investments in the final year of the 
performance period. In line with our reported results, this adjustment will not be made in future years. Subsequently, the 
targets have been re-articulated to relate to the new definition. The Committee considers that the revised targets are of 
comparable stretch to the previous targets, taking into account the additional investment built into the business plan over 
the performance period.
Cumulative	
underlying	
cash	flow	from	
operations
• 
The definition of cash flow used under previous schemes had become highly complex and opaque for both participants and 
shareholders.
• 
Therefore, for future awards the target will be based on cumulative underlying cash flow from operations over the 
performance period after adding back net rent and cash pension costs.
• 
The Committee is of the view that this definition of cash flow provides a better measure of both cash flow and underlying 
profitability than the previous definition. In addition a cumulative target is also inherently more stretching than a point-to-
point growth measure.
Relative	sales
• 
This is an important metric used across the retail sector. Outperforming our direct peers on sales will be a key source of 
value for our shareholders, and therefore the Committee believes that this should be incentivised within the LTIP. Like-for-
like sales are also the biggest driver for profitability and returns.
• 
Since any profitable growth will primarily arise from outperforming in the UK market, it is proposed to measure sales 
performance against the Institute of Grocery Distribution (‘IGD’) Index on a like-for-like basis. The IGD Index measures 
growth in like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) across the market based on the performance of all of the Company’s key 
competitors. This is an independently audited index of sales efficiency, which is viewed as a robust reference point for 
performance across the food retail sector. To retain visibility of vesting levels, shareholders will be provided with details of 
how the Company has performed against the index at the end of the period.
• 
The growth targets have been set taking into account our current competitive position and longer term sustainable growth 
aspirations. Threshold vesting requires the Company to at least match the index over the period with full vesting requiring 
outperformance of the index. 
The relative sales objective is fully aligned with the core strategy of the 
business, and the Committee is satisfied that the presence of ROCE 
and cash flow targets will ensure management are incentivised towards 
efficient and profitable sales growth. 
The vesting of all elements of the plan will be subject to delivery of a 
‘profit gateway’. This provides consistency with our Annual Bonus and 
Deferred Share Award, and is intended to provide shareholders with 
additional comfort that the underlying profitability of the business must 
be sound for payouts to occur. For the 2012 award, no element of the 
award will vest if compound EPS growth equivalent to at least four per 
cent per annum is not achieved across the performance period.
Remuneration report continued 60	 J	Sainsbury	plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Governance
Remuneration report continued
Straight-line vesting will operate between the threshold and maximum 
targets shown above.
The Committee retains the discretion to make adjustments to the 
calculation of the performance measures (for instance for material 
acquisitions and disposals) to ensure they remain true and fair 
reflections of performance. 
The Committee considers that the stretch of the targets set for 2012/13 
awards is comparable to awards granted in previous years, and that 
delivery of stretch targets would result in significant shareholder value 
creation.
As noted above, the other key features of the plan shall remain 
unchanged. The quantum for executive directors is unchanged from last 
year. Accordingly, for 2012/13, the Chief Executive will be granted a core 
award of 55 per cent of salary. The remaining Executive Directors will 
each be granted a core award of 50 per cent of salary. The performance 
period shall continue to be measured over three financial years with half 
of the award deferred for a further year.
Claw-back
As part of the review, the Remuneration Committee was also mindful 
of recent developments in best practice. Subsequently, in order to 
strengthen our formal governance in line with our existing philosophy, 
and in recognition of shareholders’ current concerns around executive 
remuneration, the Committee has introduced a claw-back (malus) clause 
on the 2012/13 awards. This clause is intended to apply to all future 
awards under the LTIP.
The circumstances in which the clause may be invoked have been 
defined as follows: 
Financial Accounts
• 
Material mis-statement of our financial 
statements
Actions / Conduct 
of Participant
• 
Serious Reputational Damage
• 
Serious Misconduct
• 
Fraud
Should the Committee consider such events to have occurred, it will 
have discretion to: 
• 
reduce the number of shares under an unvested award; 
• 
cancel an unvested award in full; or 
• 
impose further conditions on an unvested award. 
The Committee believes that this provision is consistent with the 
principles underpinning our existing approach to governance and 
is therefore a positive development for both the Company and 
shareholders.
Previous	Long	Term	Incentive	Plan	Cycles	(‘Value	Builder’	awards)
Awards made under the plan between 2006 and 2011 were subject to 
three-year performance against two stretching co-dependent measures: 
ROCE and cash flow per share. For the 2006-2011 awards, the capital 
employed figure used to calculate ROCE was adjusted for one-off impact 
of capital spend in the year in which the calculation is made.
The performance period for the 2009/10 Value Builder grant ended in

following matrix.

11% – – 0.5 1.0 1.5
Note:
–  Full definitions of ROCE and cash flow per share can be found in the 2010/11 Annual Report  
and Accounts.
The Committee determined a final performance multiplier of 1.7 times, 
based on adjusted ROCE of 13.2 per cent and cash flow per share 
(‘CFPS’) of 9.0 per cent. This represents 43 per cent of the maximum 
award opportunity. When assessing ROCE and CFPS performance for 
the purposes of the plan, adjustments were made to take into account 
capital investment in the final year of the performance period and 
certain limited one-off investments. 
One half of the award becomes exercisable in May 2012, with the 
remaining portion exercisable in May 2013. 
The 2010/11 award will be tested for performance against the ROCE  
and CFPS targets in March 2013, and is subject to the matrix above. 
The 2011/12 award will be tested for performance against the ROCE and 
CFPS targets in March 2014. The matrix was considered and agreed by 
the Committee prior to these awards to ensure the degree of challenge 
inherent in the targets was commensurate with internal and external 
performance expectations at the time of grant, and is presented below.

Performance was assessed in May 2011 in respect of the Value Builder 
Share Plan awards granted in 2008/09.  Pre-tax adjusted ROCE of 13.4 
per cent and CFPS of 9.9 per cent were achieved over the three-year 
performance period, which gave rise to a performance multiplier of 
1.9 out of a maximum four times. This performance outcome led to 
the vesting of 48 per cent of the total award for all plan participants, 
including the Executive Directors. One half of the award became 
exercisable in May 2011, with the remaining portion exercisable  
in May 2012. The number of shares awarded from this grant cycle  
to the Executive Directors is set out on page 63.

iii)	Variable	remuneration	–	dormant	share	plan	
Deferred	Annual	Bonus	Plan	2006	
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan previously applied to the top levels of 
management, including Executive Directors. Its purpose was to incentivise 
growth in relative TSR. The plan is now dormant and the last deferral took 
place in June 2009 using the bonus awards earned for 2008/09. 
Following the year-end, performance was tested in respect of the 
deferral made in 2009 and this resulted in no matching shares vesting. 
Details of the Executive Directors’ awards under this incentive plan are 
set out in the table on page 64. 
iv)	All	employee	share	plans	
In order to encourage wider employee share ownership, the Company 
provides two all employee share plans for colleagues, namely the 
Savings Related Share Option Plan (‘SAYE’) and the All Employee Share 
Ownership Plan. Executive Directors may participate in these plans 
in the same way as all other colleagues. Justin King and John Rogers 
currently participate in both plans. Mike Coupe participates in the SAYE. 
As these are all employee plans there are no performance conditions. 
The Committee approves the adoption or amendment of these plans 
and awards to Executive Directors. 
The 2006 (five-year) SAYE reached maturity on 1 March 2012. Around 
3,300 colleagues could use their savings and a tax-free bonus to buy 
Sainsbury’s shares at a 328 pence option price. The 2008 (three-year) 
SAYE matured at the same time covering around 7,700 colleagues 
who could use their savings and a tax-free bonus to buy Sainsbury’s 
shares at a 224 pence option price. Using the market price on the date 
of the first exercise, the value of all the shares subject to the maturity 
was nearly £26.5 million. The Company currently has over 26,000 
colleagues participating in the SAYE with around 63,000 individual 
savings contracts. 
In August 2008, the Company introduced a matching element to the 
partnership element of the All Employee Share Ownership Plan on a 
‘buy four get one free’ basis. This arrangement ceased in August 2010. 
These matching shares must be held for five years to receive all of the 
relevant tax benefits and will be forfeited if the individual resigns from 
the Company within the first three years. 
Shareholding	guidelines
The Committee introduced shareholding guidelines in 2006/07 to create 
greater alignment of the Directors’ interests with those of shareholders, 
which is a key objective within the remuneration policy. The guidelines 
are as follows: Chief Executive 2.5x salary; Executive Directors: 1.5x 
salary; Operating Board Directors: 1x salary, in each case within five 
years of appointment. These guidelines were last updated in 2010/11. 
The table below sets out the Executive Directors’ shareholdings as at 
the year end on 17 March 2012.

1   The valuation is calculated against the closing mid-market share price on 17 March 2012  
of 303.0 pence.
2  The percentage of salary figures have been calculated using the salaries earned as at  
17 March 2012.
Dilution	
The Company ensures that the level of shares granted under the 
Company’s share plans and the means of satisfying such awards 
remains within best practice guidelines so that dilution from employee 
share awards does not exceed ten per cent of the Company’s issued 
share capital for all-employee share plans and five per cent in respect 
of executive share plans in any ten-year rolling period. The Company 
monitors dilution levels on a regular basis and the Committee reviews 
these at least once a year. Up to 17 March 2012, an estimated 7.8 per 
cent of the Company’s issued share capital has been allocated for 
the purposes of its all employee share plans over a ten-year period, 
including an estimated 3.7 per cent over five years in respect of its 
executive share plans.

Service	contracts	
Justin King has a service contract which can be terminated by either 
party by giving 12 months’ written notice. If his service contract is 
terminated without cause, the Company can request that he works his 
notice period or takes a period of garden leave, or can pay an amount  
in lieu of notice equal to one times basic salary for the notice period plus 
75 per cent of basic salary in lieu of all other elements of remuneration, 
except share plans. If he is dismissed within six months of a change 
of control, the above sum will become payable. The contract contains 
restrictive covenants, which continue for 12 months after termination. 
If the service contract of Mike Coupe is terminated without cause, the 
maximum payment he would receive would be equal to one times basic 
salary for the 12 month notice period plus 50 per cent of basic salary 
in lieu of all other elements of remuneration, except share plans. He 
is required to mitigate his losses and would receive phased payments, 
which would be reduced or terminated if he secured alternative 
employment during the notice period. His contract also contains 
restrictive covenants, which continue for 12 months after termination.  
It does not contain any specific provisions relating to change of control. 
In 2010, the Committee agreed that the termination provisions within 
future Executive Directors’ service agreements would state that any 
severance payments would be limited to one year’s salary and benefits, 
be made on a phased basis and be subject to mitigation. As is the 
current practice, if ‘good leaver’ status is given, long-term incentive 
awards that vest following a director’s employment termination will 
continue to be pro-rated for time and performance. Bonus awards will 
also be paid subject to time and performance for the financial year in 
which office is held if the individual is considered to be a ‘good leaver’. 
The service contract under which John Rogers was appointed as Chief 
Financial Officer follows these provisions in full; in addition, there are  
no specific terms relating to change of control.
As disclosed in last year’s report, Darren Shapland ceased to be a 
director on 13 July 2011 and was subsequently appointed to the position 
of Non-Executive Chairman of Sainsbury’s Bank for a fixed annual fee 
of £150,000 per annum plus benefits, and in this capacity earned a 
salary of £107,308 in 2011/12. Darren did not receive either a severance 
payment or an ex gratia payment as a result of the change in his 
employment status.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts became effective on the 
following dates: 
Justin King  29 March 2004 
Mike Coupe  1 August 2007
John Rogers  19 July 2010 
External	appointments	
The Company’s normal practice is that Executive Directors may take up 
one public company non-executive role outside the Company, subject 
to a consideration of the role and the time commitment. Directors are 
entitled to retain the fees earned from such appointments. Details of the 
Executive Directors’ external fees are set out on page 63. 
Chairman	
The Chairman does not have a service contract; his letter of 
appointment became effective on 1 October 2009 and he became 
Chairman on 1 November 2009. He was appointed for an initial term  
of three years, renewable on a 12-month rolling basis and thereafter  
by mutual consent. His appointment may be terminated at any time 
upon the serving of six months’ written notice by either party. 
David Tyler was appointed as Chairman on a basic fee of £450,000 
per annum. His fee was reviewed by the Remuneration Committee 
for the first time since his appointment at the half year in 2011/12 
and it was increased to £470,000 per annum. He devotes such time 
as is necessary to perform his duties. He does not participate in any 
performance-related incentive plans and he does not receive any 
benefits except for an annual medical assessment and a colleague 
discount card. 
Non-Executive	Directors
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts. They are 
appointed for an initial three-year period, which may be extended for 
a further term by mutual consent. The initial appointments and any 
subsequent re-appointments are subject to election or re-election  
by shareholders. Their appointments may be terminated by the serving 
of three months’ notice by either party. 
Non-Executive Directors receive a basic annual cash fee; additional 
fees are paid to the Senior Independent Director and to the Chairmen 
of the Audit, Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committees. 
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any performance-related 
incentive plans and receive no benefits other than a colleague  
discount card. 
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees were last increased in September 
2009; they were reviewed by a sub-committee of other members of  
the Board during 2011/12 and were increased to the following levels: 
Basic	fee	 £60,000 (from £55,000)
Senior Independent Director fee £15,000 (unchanged)
Chairman of Remuneration Committee fee £15,000 (unchanged)
Chairman of Audit Committee fee £15,000 (unchanged)
Chairman of Corporate 
Responsibility Committee fee £12,500 (from £10,000)
The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment became effective

interest has been earned on a notional fund during the year from his previous membership of the Executive Stakeholder Pension Plan. Neither Darren Shapland nor Mike Coupe are members of the 
Company’s pension plans – each received 25 per cent of basic salary as a cash pension supplement. John Rogers is a member of the Company’s JS Self Invested Pension Plan. Contributions to the 
JS Self Invested Pension Plan by the Company in 2011/12 in respect of his membership were £16,200 (2010/11 £15,450). He received a cash supplement equal to 25 per cent of the amount by which 
his salary exceeded the Company’s earnings cap (2011/12: £129,600) (2010/11:£123,600).
7 The totals for 2012 and 2011 in the case of John Rogers do not include deductions made from basic salary for Saving Money and Reducing Tax (‘SMART’) pensions.

1 The maximum share award assumes full vesting.
2 The performance conditions attaching to the award are return on capital employed and growth in cash flow per share. Further information is provided on pages 113 to 114. The performance of the 
award made in June 2008 was tested in May 2011 and a multiplier of 1.9 was achieved. The number of shares between the maximum multiplier (4.0) and the multiplier achieved have been lapsed. 
Half of the achieved award vested in May 2011 whilst the remainder of the achieved award will vest in May 2012. The number of dividend shares which have been received on vested shares was 
determined by a five-day average share price from 12 to 18 May 2011.

1 The maximum matching share award is the maximum award that would become exercisable provided that the Company achieves first position within the comparator group of Ahold, Carrefour, 
Casino, Delhaize, DSG International, Home Retail Group, Kingfisher, Marks & Spencer, Metro, Morrisons, Next and Tesco. The Company’s relative performance is determined by reference to Total 
Shareholder Return. 
Notes:
– A number of the shares deferred in June 2008 have been sold to fund the participant’s income tax and National Insurance liabilities. The remainder were released to participants on 25 March 2011.
– The performance of the awards granted in June 2008 was tested and matching shares of 0.91 times an individual’s deferral was achieved. Half of the achieved award vested in May 2011 whilst the 
remainder of the achieved award will vest in May 2012. The number of dividend shares on the first vesting was determined by a five-day average share price from 12 to 18 May 2011.
– The 2009 deferral was made on a net post tax basis.
– The exercise price is nil.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• 
state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
• 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Remuneration report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 3 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• 
the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
• 
the Directors’ report contained in the Annual Report includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.

Independent Auditors’ report to the members of J Sainsbury plc
We have audited the financial statements of J Sainsbury plc for the 
52 weeks ended 17 March 2012 which comprise the Group income 
statement, the Group and Company Statements of comprehensive 
income, the Group and Company Balance sheets, the Group and 
Company Cash flow statements, the Group and Company statements 
of changes in equity and the related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union and, as regards the Company financial statements, 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Respective	responsibilities	of	Directors	and	Auditors	
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 66, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Scope	of	the	audit	of	the	financial	statements		
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and 
the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non–
financial information in the Annual Report and Financial Statements to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion	on	financial	statements	
In our opinion: 
• 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 17 March 2012 and of the 
Group’s profit and Group’s and Company’s cash flows for the 52 weeks 
then ended;
• 
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• 
the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; 
and
• 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion: 
• 
the part of the Remuneration report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• 
the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters	on	which	we	are	required	to	report	by	exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
• 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company,  
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
• 
the Company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration 
report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns; or 
• 
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are  
not made; or 
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• 
the Directors’ statement, set out on page 37, in relation to going 
concern; 
• 
the parts of the Statement of Corporate Governance relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
• 
certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
Directors’ remuneration.

Kingdom and its registered address is 33 Holborn, London EC1N 2HT, 
United Kingdom.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 17 March 2012 (prior 
financial year 52 weeks to 19 March 2011). The consolidated financial 
statements for the 52 weeks to 17 March 2012 comprise the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) and the 
Group’s share of the post-tax results of its joint ventures.
The Group’s principal activities are grocery and related retailing.
 
2	Accounting	policies
(a)	Statement	of	compliance
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (‘IFRICs’) interpretations and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs. 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on the same 
basis and, as permitted by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, 
no income statement is presented for the Company.
(b)	Basis	of	preparation
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the 
nearest million (‘£m’) unless otherwise stated. They have been prepared 
on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, except for 
derivative financial instruments, investment properties and available-
for-sale financial assets that have been measured at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs 
requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The areas involving a 
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed 
in note 2c.

The accounting policies set out below and in note 3 have been applied 
consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements by the 
Group and the Company.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying 
a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The results 
of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date 
of acquisition, or in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of 
disposal. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group 
companies are eliminated upon consolidation.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss 
in the financial statements of the Company. 
Joint	ventures
Joint ventures are jointly controlled entities in which the Group has an 
interest. The Group’s share of the post-tax results of its joint ventures 
are included in the income statement using the equity method of 
accounting. Where the Group transacts with a joint venture, profits  
and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
joint venture.    Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 75
Financial Statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
2	Accounting	policies	continued
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Group balance sheet at 
cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of 
the entity, less any provision for impairment. 
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Company balance sheet 
at cost less any provision for impairment. 
Sainsbury’s Bank’s fees and commissions, that are not integral to 
the effective interest rate calculation, are recognised in the income 
statement as services are provided. Where in the case of insurance 
commissions the income comprises an initial commission and profit 
share both are recognised on completion of the service to the extent 
reliably measurable. Where there is a risk of potential claw-back, an 
appropriate element of the commission receivable is deferred and 
amortised over the life of the underlying loan or period of claw-back.
Investment properties held by the Group are those contained within 
its joint ventures with Land Securities Group PLC and The British Land 
Company PLC. These are properties held for capital appreciation and / 
or to earn rental income. They are initially measured at cost, including 
related transaction costs. After initial recognition at cost, they are 
carried at their fair values based on market value determined by 
professional valuers at each reporting date. The difference between 
the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its 
carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included within the income 
statement but is excluded from underlying profit in order to provide a 
clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the 
Group’s ongoing business for shareholders. 
Revenue
Revenue consists of sales through retail outlets and excludes Value 
Added Tax. Sales through retail outlets are shown net of returns, the 
cost of Nectar reward points issued and redeemed, colleague discounts, 
vouchers and sales made on an agency basis. Commission income is 
recognised in revenue based on the terms of the contract.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of goods 
and services have been passed to the buyer and it can be measured 
reliably.
The cost of Nectar points is treated as a deduction from sales and 
part of the fair value of the consideration received is deferred and 
subsequently recognised over the period that the awards are redeemed. 
The fair value of the points awarded is determined with reference to the 
fair value to the customer.
Finance	income
Finance income is recognised in the income statement for all 
instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. This calculation takes into account interest received or paid 
and fees and commissions received or paid that are integral to the yield 
as well as incremental transaction costs. 
Cost	of	sales
Cost of sales consists of all costs to the point of sale including 
warehouse and transportation costs and all the costs of operating retail 
outlets.
Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts are recognised within cost 
of sales as they are earned. The accrued value at the reporting date is 
included in prepayments and accrued income.
Property,	plant	and	equipment
Land	and	buildings
Land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any recognised provision for impairment. Properties in the course 
of construction are held at cost less any recognised provision for 
impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and 
the costs incurred attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for intended use. This includes capitalised borrowing costs.
Fixtures	and	equipment
Fixtures, equipment and vehicles are held at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable  
to bringing the asset to its working condition and its intended use.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their 
residual values, on a straight-line method, on the following bases:
• 
Freehold buildings and leasehold properties – 50 years, or the lease 
term if shorter
• 
Fixtures, equipment and vehicles – 3 to 15 years
• 
Freehold land is not depreciated
Buildings under construction are not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds 
with the asset’s carrying amount and are recognised within operating 
profit.
Intangible	assets
Pharmacy	licences
Pharmacy licences are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any recognised provision for impairment and amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the licence period of up to 15 years within cost 
of sales.
Computer	software
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
any provision for impairment. Externally acquired computer software 
and software licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their useful economic lives of five to seven years. Costs 
relating to development of computer software for internal use are 
capitalised once the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ 
are met. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs 
are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software within 
administrative expenses. 
Other
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any provision for impairment. They are amortised on 
a straight-line basis over their contractual useful economic lives within 
cost of sales.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration 
of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net 
identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset on the Group’s balance sheet in the 
year in which it arises, and is considered to have an indefinite useful 
life. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and again whenever 
indicators of impairment are detected and is carried at cost less any 
provision for impairment.
Impairment	of	non-financial	assets	
Annually and again whenever indicators of impairment are detected, 
the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, which is the 
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, 
the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit (‘CGU’) to which the asset belongs. For property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill, the CGU is deemed 
to be each trading store. For goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be each 
retail chain of stores acquired. 76	 J	Sainsbury	plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Financial Statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
2	Accounting	policies	continued
Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in 
the year in which it occurs. Where an impairment loss, other than an 
impairment loss on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in 
the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, or its original carrying 
value if lower.
Capitalisation	of	interest
Interest costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
construction of qualifying assets are capitalised to the cost of the asset, 
gross of tax relief.
Non-current	assets	held	for	sale	
Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale and stated 
at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell 
if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets held 
for sale are not depreciated.
Leased	assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases. For property 
leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to 
determine the appropriate lease classification.
Finance	leases
Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as property, 
plant and equipment and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
or the lease term, whichever is shorter. The amount capitalised is the 
lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum 
lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. 
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities net of finance 
charges. Finance costs on finance leases are charged directly to the 
income statement.
Operating	leases
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance 
sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the income statement  
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Sale	and	leaseback
A sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an 
asset and immediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering 
into a lease with the buyer. The accounting treatment of the sale and 
leaseback depends upon the substance of the transaction and whether 
or not the sale was made at the asset’s fair value. 
For sale and finance leasebacks, any apparent profit or loss from 
the sale is deferred and amortised over the lease term. For sale and 
operating leasebacks, generally the assets are sold at fair value, and 
accordingly the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately  
in the income statement.
Following initial recognition, the lease treatment is consistent with those 
principles described above.
Lease	incentives
Lease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free 
periods. Lease incentives are capitalised and spread over the period of 
the lease term.
Leases	with	predetermined	fixed	rental	increases
The Group has a number of leases with predetermined fixed rental 
increases. These rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
Operating	lease	income
Operating lease income consists of rentals from sub-tenant agreements 
and is recognised as earned.
Inventories
Inventories comprise of goods held for resale and properties held for, 
or in the course of, development and are valued on a weighted average 
cost basis and carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
includes all direct expenditure and other appropriate attributable costs 
incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Cash	and	cash	equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits, 
investments in money market funds and deposits and other short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount 
of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank 
overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of 
the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and 
cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
Current	taxation
Current tax is accounted for on the basis of tax laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax is charged or 
credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged 
to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the current tax is 
also dealt with in equity or other comprehensive income respectively. 
Deferred	taxation
Deferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences 
arising from differences between the tax base and accounting base  
of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to 
the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the 
time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. 
It is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except 
when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with 
in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, branches, and joint ventures except where 
the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation,  
and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Onerous	leases
Provisions for onerous leases, measured net of expected rental income, 
are recognised when the property leased becomes vacant and is no 
longer used in the operations of the business. Provisions for dilapidation 
costs are recognised on a lease-by-lease basis.
Employee	benefits
Pensions
The Group operates various defined benefit and defined contribution 
pension schemes for its employees. A defined benefit scheme is 
a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an 
employee will receive on retirement. A defined contribution scheme  
is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into  
a separate entity.   Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 77
Financial Statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
2	Accounting	policies	continued
In respect of the defined benefit pension scheme, the pension scheme 
surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the 
difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The defined 
benefit obligation is actuarially calculated on an annual basis using the 
projected unit credit method. Plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The income statement charge is split between an operating service 
cost and a financing charge, which is the net of interest cost on pension 
scheme liabilities and expected return on plan assets. Actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they arise, in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an 
expense as they fall due. Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet 
date are included as an accrual as at that date. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
Long	service	awards
The costs of long service awards are accrued over the period the service 
is provided by the employee.
Share-based	payments
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Directors) of 
the Group in the form of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange 
for shares, rights over shares or the value of those shares in cash terms.
For equity-settled share-based payments the fair value of the employee 
services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
shares awarded or options granted, excluding the impact of any non-
market vesting conditions. All share options are valued using an option-
pricing model (Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo). This fair value is charged 
to the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based 
payment scheme. 
For cash-settled share-based payments the fair value of the employee 
services rendered is determined at each balance sheet date and the 
charge recognised through the income statement over the vesting 
period of the share-based payment scheme, with the corresponding 
increase in accruals. 
The value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the 
remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels  
of options vesting, with the corresponding adjustments made in equity 
and accruals.
Foreign	currencies
Foreign	operations
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are 
translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates. The results of foreign 
operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for 
the year. The functional currency of the Company is sterling.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation at year-end 
exchange rates of the net investment in foreign operations, less 
exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings or forward 
contracts which are in substance part of the net investment in a foreign 
operation, are taken to equity and are reported in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Foreign	currency	transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are translated at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Financial	instruments
Financial	assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: 
at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’), loans and receivables, 
and available-for-sale (‘AFS’). AFS investments are initially measured 
at fair value including transaction costs. Financial assets held at fair 
value through profit and loss are initially recognised at fair value and 
transaction costs are expensed.
‘Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ include financial 
assets held for trading and those designated at fair value through profit 
or loss at inception. Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless 
they are accounted for as an effective hedging instrument. ‘Financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss’ are recorded at fair value, with 
any fair value gains or losses recognised in the income statement in the 
period in which they arise.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
The Group has no intention of trading these loans and receivables. 
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, 
these assets are carried at amortised cost less impairment using  
the effective interest method. Income from these financial assets  
is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised in the  
income statement.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are 
either designated in this category or not classified in any of the 
other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless 
management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of 
the balance sheet date. Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value 
plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value with the 
movements in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income 
until the financial asset is derecognised or impaired at which time the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income is recognised in the income statement. Dividends on AFS 
equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the 
entity’s right to receive payment is established. Interest on AFS debt 
instruments is recognised using the effective interest method.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash 
flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Group has 
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Trade	receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for 
impairment.
Financial	liabilities
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at 
fair value, which is generally the proceeds received, net of direct issue 
costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are held at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accrual basis 
in the income statement using the effective interest method and are 
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is 
determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-
convertible bond. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised 
cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds. 
The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the conversion option. 
This is recognised and included in shareholders’ equity, net of income 
tax effects and is not subsequently re-measured. 78	 J	Sainsbury	plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Financial Statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
2	Accounting	policies	continued
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and the equity 
components of the convertible bonds based on their carrying amounts 
at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component  
is charged directly against equity.
Trade	payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Impairment	of	financial	assets
An assessment of whether there is objective evidence of impairment 
is carried out for all financial assets or groups of financial assets 
at the balance sheet date. This assessment may be of individual 
assets (‘individual impairment’) or of a portfolio of assets (‘collective 
impairment’). A financial asset or a group of financial assets is 
considered to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of 
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the 
initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or 
events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial 
asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
For individual impairment the principal loss event is one or more missed 
payments, although other loss events can also be taken into account, 
including arrangements in place to pay less than the contractual 
payments, fraud and bankruptcy or other financial difficulty indicators. 
An assessment of collective impairment will be made of financial 
assets with similar risk characteristics. For these assets, portfolio loss 
experience is used to provide objective evidence of impairment.
Where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss exists on 
loans and receivables, impairment provisions are made to reduce the 
carrying value of financial assets to the present value of estimated 
future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective 
interest rate.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the charge to the income 
statement reflects the movement in the level of provisions made, 
together with amounts written off net of recoveries in the year.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a 
significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below 
its cost is considered in determining whether the asset is impaired. 
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the 
cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income 
statement. The cumulative loss is measured as the difference between 
the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss 
on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity 
instruments are not reversed. If, in a subsequent period, the fair  
value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases  
and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring  
after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement,  
the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Interest will continue to accrue on all financial assets, based on the 
written down balance. Interest is calculated using the rate of interest 
used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring  
the impairment loss. To the extent that a provision may be increased  
or decreased in subsequent periods, the recognition of interest will  
be based on the latest balance net of provision.
Fair	value	estimation
The methods and assumptions applied in determining the fair values  
of financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed in note 29. 
Derivative	financial	instruments	and	hedge	accounting
All derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value 
on the contract date and are also measured at fair value at subsequent 
reporting dates.
Hedge relationships are classified as cash flow hedges where the 
derivative financial instruments hedge the exchange rate risk of future 
highly probable inventory purchases denominated in foreign currency. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow 
hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the 
asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the 
derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive 
income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
Hedge relationships are classified as fair value hedges where the 
derivative financial instruments hedge the change in the fair value of 
a financial asset or liability due to movements in interest rates. The 
changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the 
income statement.
The hedged item is also adjusted for changes in fair value attributable  
to the hedged risk, with the corresponding adjustment made in the 
income statement.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents at the inception 
of the hedge, the hedging risk management strategy, the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction 
and the nature of the risks being hedged. The Group also documents  
the assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship, to show 
that the hedge has been and will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as 
finance income or costs as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained in 
equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised 
in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement 
for the period.
 
Offsetting	financial	instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported  
in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net 
basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
(c)	Judgements	and	estimates
The Group makes judgements and assumptions concerning the future 
that impact the application of policies and reported amounts. The 
resulting accounting estimates calculated using these judgements and 
assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results 
but are based on historical experience and expectations of future events. 
The judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements 
are discussed below.    Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 79

Goodwill	impairment
The Group is required to assess whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment loss, based on the recoverable amount of its CGUs. The 
recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been determined based on value 
in use calculations and these calculations require the use of estimates  
in relation to future cash flows and suitable discount rates as disclosed 
in note 12. Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates. 
Impairment	of	assets
Financial and non-financial assets are subject to impairment reviews 
based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest 
that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying value. 
Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future 
cash flows using suitable discount rates and includes management 
assumptions and estimates of future performance. 
Post-employment	benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme for its employees. The 
present value of the scheme’s liabilities recognised at the balance sheet 
date is dependent on interest rates of high quality corporate bonds. The 
net financing charge recognised in the income statement is dependent 
on the interest rate of high quality corporate bonds and an expectation 
of the weighted average returns on the assets within the scheme. Other 
key assumptions within this calculation are based on market conditions 
or estimate of future events, including mortality rates, as set out in 
note 30.
Provisions
Provisions have been made for onerous leases, dilapidations, and 
disposal costs. These provisions are estimates and the actual costs 
and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Any 
difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be 
accounted for in the period when such determination is made. Details  
of provisions are set out in note 22.
Income	taxes
The Group recognises expected liabilities for tax based on an estimation 
of the likely taxes due, which requires significant judgement as to the 
ultimate tax determination of certain items. Where the actual liability 
arising from these issues differs from these estimates, such differences 
will have an impact on income tax and deferred tax provisions in the 
period when such determination is made. Detail of the tax charge and 
deferred tax are set out in notes 8 and 21 respectively. 80	 J	Sainsbury	plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012

3	Non–GAAP	performance	measures
Certain items recognised in reported profit before tax can vary significantly from year to year and therefore create volatility in reported earnings 
which does not reflect the Group’s underlying performance. The Directors believe that the ‘underlying profit before tax’ (‘UPBT’) and ‘underlying 
diluted and basic earnings per share’ measures presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of Sainsbury’s 
ongoing business for shareholders. Underlying profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the ‘adjusted’ profit 
measures of other companies. The adjusted items are:
• 
Profit/loss on disposal of properties; 
• 
Investment property fair value movements – these reflect the difference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date 
and its carrying amount at the previous reporting date;
• 
Financing fair value movements – these are fair value gains and losses on non–derivative financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost, 
on derivatives relating to financing activities and on hedged items in fair value hedges;
• 
Impairment of goodwill;
• 
The financing element of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’; and
• 
One–off items – these are items which are material and infrequent in nature and do not relate to the Group’s underlying performance.
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax to arrive at underlying profit before tax are:

2 Financing fair value movements for the financial year comprised a £(11) million loss for the Group (2011: £10 million gain) and £(5) million loss for the joint ventures (2011: £(3) million loss).
One–off	items
The £3 million one–off item relates to the release of a provision in respect of the Office of Fair Trading dairy inquiry which was settled in full in 
October 2011. The £5 million one–off item in the prior financial year relates to the release of a disposal provision which was no longer required. 
Both of these items were initially recorded as one-off items outside underlying profit before tax.
4	Segment	reporting
The Group’s businesses are organised into three operating segments: 
• 
Retailing (Supermarkets and Convenience);
• 
Financial services (Sainsbury’s Bank joint venture); and
• 
Property investments (The British Land Company PLC joint venture and Land Securities PLC joint venture).
Management have determined the operating segments based on the information provided to the Operating Board (the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker for the Group) to make operational decisions on the management of the Group. All material operations and assets are in the UK. The business 
of the Group is not subject to highly seasonal fluctuations although there is an increase in trading in the period leading up to Christmas. 
The Group has continued to include additional voluntary disclosure analysing the Group’s Financial services and Property investment joint ventures 
into separate reportable segments.
Revenue from operating segments is measured on a basis consistent with the income statement. All revenue is generated by the sale of goods  
and services.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than  
one period. 
The Operating Board assesses the performance of all segments on the basis of underlying profit before tax. The reconciliation provided below 
reconciles underlying operating profit from each of the segments disclosed to profit before tax.   Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 81

On 23 March 2011, the Chancellor announced that the main rate of UK corporation tax would reduce from 28.0 per cent to 26.0 per cent for the 
financial year commencing 1 April 2011 and to 25.0 per cent with effect from 1 April 2012.  The change to 25.0 per cent was substantively enacted  
on 5 July 2011 and hence the effect of the change on the deferred tax balances has been included in the figures above.

In addition to this, a number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the 21 March 2012 UK Budget Statement.  
A resolution passed by Parliament on 26 March 2012 reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 24.0 per cent from 1 April 2012. Legislation to reduce 
the main rate of corporation tax from 24.0 per cent to 23.0 per cent from 1 April 2013 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2012. Further 
reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by one per cent per annum to 22.0 per cent by 1 April 2014. None of these expected rate 
reductions had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, their effect is not included in the financial statements.
The effect of a one per cent reduction in the corporation tax rate on the deferred tax balances at the balance sheet date would reduce the deferred 
tax liability by £11 million which is primarily recognised in other comprehensive income.
As part of the funding plan agreed with the Pension Scheme’s Trustees, in June 2010 Sainsbury’s established the Sainsbury’s Property Scottish 
Partnership with the Scheme and properties with a value of £757 million were transferred to the Partnership. The Government recently announced 
law changes in relation to such asset backed pension contributions. Draft legislation published in November 2011 and amended in February and March 
2012 which is expected to be included in Finance Act 2012, restricts the relief to the total amount of payments an employer makes to the pension 
scheme directly or through the Partnership. These changes have not been substantively enacted so have not been included in the figures above.

9	Earnings	per	share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts (note 25), which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the earnings attributable to the ordinary shareholders are adjusted by the interest on the convertible bonds  
(net of tax). The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. 
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary 
shares during the year and the number of shares that would be issued if all convertible bonds are assumed to be converted.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any profit or loss on disposal of properties, investment property fair value 
movements, impairment of goodwill, financing fair value movements, IAS 19 pension financing element and one–off items that are material and 
infrequent in nature. This alternative measure of earnings per share is presented to reflect the Group’s underlying trading performance.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment
In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, property, plant and equipment is only tested for impairment in the event that a triggering event is 
identified. The Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, following a triggering event, each store is a cash-generating unit 
(‘CGU’).
The recoverable amounts for the CGUs are based on value in use which is calculated on the cash flows expected to be generated by the units using 
the latest budget and forecast data, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. The key assumptions in the value in use calculation are the 
discount rate, growth rates and expected changes in margin. Changes in income and expenditure are based on past experience and expectations of 
future changes in the market. The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long–term growth rates for the UK food retail 
sector. The discount rate is based on the Group’s pre–tax weighted average cost of capital of ten per cent (2011: ten per cent).
Non-store assets are also tested for impairment in the event that a triggering event is identified. When an impairment is required, the carrying value 
of the asset is compared to its value in use using a methodology consistent with that described above.   Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 87

Interest capitalised
Interest capitalised included in additions amounted to £35 million (2011: £27 million) for the Group and £nil (2011: £nil) for the Company. 
Accumulated interest capitalised included in the cost of property, plant and equipment net of disposals amounted to £302 million (2011: £273 
million) for the Group and £nil (2011: £nil) for the Company. The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for 
capitalisation is 5.7 per cent (2011: five per cent).
Security
Property, plant and equipment of 131 (2011: 130) supermarket properties, with a net book value of £2,288 million (2011: £2,323 million) has been 
pledged as security for the long–term financing (note 20).
In addition, property, plant and equipment of a further six supermarket properties, with a net book value of £68 million (2011: £69 million) has been 
pledged as security to underpin the residual value guarantee given by the Group with regards to 16 supermarket properties sold in March 2000 and 
ten supermarket properties sold in July 2000.
On 17 June 2010 property, plant and equipment comprising eight supermarket properties, with a net book value of £167 million were transferred  
to the Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership (‘the partnership’). On 25 March 2011 a further 13 properties with a net book value of £345 million 
were transferred to the partnership (see note 30).

of stores. The value of the goodwill was tested for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount  
of each CGU to the carrying value of its goodwill. 
To calculate the CGU’s value in use, Board approved cash flows for the following financial year are assumed to inflate at the long–term average 
growth rate for the UK food retail sector and are discounted at a pre–tax rate of ten per cent (2011: ten per cent) over a 25 year period. Changes  
in income and expenditure are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. Based on the operating performance  
of the respective CGUs, no impairment loss was identified in the current financial year (2011: £nil). The valuations indicate sufficient headroom  
such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

JS Insurance Ltd 100% Isle of Man
JS Information Systems Ltd 100% England
Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Ltd 100% England
All principal operating subsidiaries operate in the countries of their registration or incorporation, and have been consolidated up to and as at 
17 March 2012. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in s410 of the Companies Act 2006 only to disclose a list comprising solely the 
principal subsidiaries. A full list of subsidiaries will be sent to Companies House with the next annual return.
During the year, a corporate simplification exercise resulted in the liquidation of a number of subsidiary companies of the Group with a carrying 
value of £56 million (2011: £nil).
During the year, a provision of £1 million was made against investments in subsidiaries where the carrying value exceeded the recoverable amount 
(2011: £4 million).
The Group has an interest in two partnerships, Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership and Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Limited Partnership, 
which are fully consolidated into these Group accounts. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the 
Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 and has therefore not appended the accounts of these qualifying partnerships to these accounts. 
Separate accounts for these partnerships are not required to be, and have not been, filed at Companies House.   Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 89

Trade receivables are non–interest bearing and are on commercial terms. Current other receivables are generally non–interest bearing, other than 
the £20 million of floating rate subordinated undated loan capital due from Sainsbury’s Bank (2011: £20 million) (note 32) and also include a fixed 
term interest–bearing deposit of £nil (2011: £40 million). The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are denominated in sterling.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk arising from its retail operations is minimal given that the customer base is large and unrelated and that the 
overwhelming majority of customer transactions are settled through cash or secure electronic means. New parties wishing to obtain credit terms 
with the Group are credit checked prior to invoices being raised and credit limits are determined on an individual basis.    Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 91

Secured	loans
Secured loans are secured on 131 (2011: 130) supermarket properties (note 11) and comprise loans from two finance companies:
• 
a fixed rate amortising loan with an outstanding principal value of £1,036 million (2011: £1,069 million) at a weighted average rate of 4.98 per cent 
stepping up to 5.36 per cent from April 2013 with an effective interest rate of 5.28 per cent and carrying amount of £1,069 million (2011: £1,087 
million) with a final repayment date of July 2018; and
• 
an inflation linked amortising loan with an outstanding principal value of £843 million (2011: £840 million) at a fixed real rate of 2.36 per cent 
where principal and interest are uplifted annually by RPI subject to a cap at five per cent and floor at nil per cent with a carrying amount of £874 
million (2011: £870 million) with a final repayment date of April 2031. 
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to convert £211 million (2011: £211 million) of the £1,036 million (2011: £1,069 million) loan due 2018 
from fixed to floating rates of interest. These transactions have been accounted for as fair value hedges (note 29). In previous years, £572 million 
of swaps accounted for as fair value hedges were de–designated from their fair value hedging relationship. The fair value adjustment of the debt 
previously hedged by these swaps will be amortised over the remaining life of the loans, resulting in an amortisation charge to the income statement 
in the current financial year of £1 million (2011: £1 million). 
In September 2011, the Group entered into inflation linked swaps to convert £250 million (2011: £nil) of the £843 million (2011: £840 million) loan due 
2031 from RPI linked interest to fixed rate interest for the period from April 2012 to April 2017. These transactions have been accounted for as cash 
flow hedges.
Bank	overdrafts
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and bear interest at a spread above bank base rate.
Bank	loan	due	2012
A £50 million loan due May 2012 at floating rates of interest subject to a cap.
Bank	loan	due	2014
A £25 million loan due July 2014 at floating rates of interest.
Bank	loans	due	2015
A £72 million loan due May 2015 at floating rates of interest; a £20 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest; a £40 million loan due 
May 2015 at floating rates of interest subject to a cap; a € 50 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest swapped into a £45 million 
floating rate loan; a US$69 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest swapped into a £44 million floating rate loan and a € 40 million 
loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest swapped into a £34 million floating rate loan.    Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 93

Bank	loans	due	2016
A €50 million loan due September 2016 at floating rates of interest. The €50 million loan has been swapped into a £44 million floating rate loan via a 
cross currency swap.
Bank	loans	due	2017
A £45 million loan due February 2017 at floating rates of interest and a US$100 million loan due March 2017 at floating rates of interest. The US$100 
million loan has been swapped into a £63 million fixed rate loan via a cross currency swap. The US$100 million loan and associated cross currency 
swap have been accounted for as a cash flow hedge with fair value movements in future interest payments deferred through the cash flow hedge 
reserve.
Convertible	bond	due	2014
In July 2009, the Group issued £190 million of unsecured convertible bonds due July 2014. The bonds pay a coupon of 4.25 per cent payable semi–
annually. Each bond is convertible into ordinary shares of J Sainsbury plc at any time up to 9 July 2014 at a current conversion price of 413.0 pence. 
The £190 million of fixed rate convertible bonds have been swapped into floating rates of interest for the period to July 2012. These transactions 
have been accounted for as fair value hedges (note 29).
The net proceeds of the convertible bond have been split into a liability component of £166 million and an equity component of £24 million.  
The equity component represents the fair value of the embedded option to convert the bond into ordinary shares of the Company.

accounted for as fair value hedges (note 29).
Borrowing	facilities
The Group maintains a £690 million syndicated revolving credit facility maturing in October 2015 for standby liquidity purposes. At 17 March 2012, 
no advance had been made under the borrowing facility (2011: £nil) and all conditions precedent had been met as at that date.
The facility incurs commitment fees at market rates and would provide funding at floating rates.

The capital redemption reserve arose on the redemption of B shares. Shareholders approved a £680 million return of share capital, by way  
of a B share scheme, at the Company’s Extraordinary General Meeting on 12 July 2004. The final redemption date for B Shares was 18 July 2007 
and all transactions relating to the B shares have now been completed.
Currency translation reserve represents the cumulative foreign exchange differences on the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign 
operations from their functional currency to the presentation currency of the parent.
The actuarial gains and losses reserve represents the actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Group. 
The available-for-sale assets reserve represents the fair value gains and losses on the available-for-sale financial assets held by the Group. 
The cash flow hedge reserve represents the cumulative effective fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges in the Group. 
The convertible bond reserve represents the equity component of the £190 million convertible bond issued in July 2009.   Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 97

28	Financial	risk	management
The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and counterparty risks.
Funding and financial risk management are managed by a central treasury department in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by 
the Board of Directors. The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance by 
identifying financial exposures and setting appropriate risk limits and controls. The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors has delegated 
responsibility for approving specific financial transactions. The Treasury Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, regularly reviews risk 
positions and monitors Treasury performance. The Group Audit Committee oversees compliance with risk management policies and reviews the 
adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Group Audit Committee is assisted by Group Internal 
Audit who regularly review the Group’s risk management controls and procedures. 
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange and commodity risks, and interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate risks. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s treasury policies, as approved by the Board. The Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
Treasury operations in respect of Sainsbury’s Bank are managed separately through Lloyds Banking Group, the Group’s joint venture partner.
Liquidity	risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due at a reasonable price.
The Group’s operational cash flow is largely stable and predictable, reflecting the low business risk profile of the food retail sector. Cash flow 
forecasts are produced regularly to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements.
The Group’s liquidity policy targets a minimum funding headroom of £300 million in excess of forecast net debt over a rolling 12 month time  
horizon. The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining a core of long-dated borrowings, pre-funding future cash flow and holding adequate 
standby liquidity.  100	J	Sainsbury	plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012

The Group’s core funding comprise two long-term loans of £1,036 million due 2018 and £843 million due 2031 both secured on property assets.  
In addition the Group has unsecured bank loans totalling £476 million with maturities ranging from 2012 to 2017, unsecured institutional loans 
totalling £23 million maturing 2015, and a public issue-convertible bond totalling £190 million maturing in July 2014. The Group has also financed 
£87 million through the hire purchase facilities in respect of movable in-store assets for various periods to 2018. 
Short term and seasonal funding is sourced from the wholesale inter-bank money market where interest is charged at various spreads above LIBOR. 
The Group maintains a £690 million syndicated revolving credit facility due October 2015 for liquidity standby purposes. Interest on drawings under 
this facility is charged at a margin over LIBOR. There are £nil drawings under the facility as at 17 March 2012 (2011: £nil drawings). 
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to 
the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the tables are the contractual undiscounted cash flows or an estimate in respect of floating 
interest rate liabilities.

Credit	risk
The Group is exposed to counterparty default or non-performance risk on its holdings of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets, 
deposits with banks, investments in marketable securities and trade receivables. 
The Group credit policy limits investments to counter parties with minimum credit ratings of A1 from Standard & Poor’s and P1 from Moody’s 
Investors Service or, in the case of sterling liquidity funds, AAAm from Standard & Poor’s or Aaa/MR1+ from Moody’s Investors Service.
The Group deposits surplus funds directly with approved banks on the wholesale inter-bank money markets or with approved money market funds 
as pooled investments. 102	J	Sainsbury	plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012

Market	risk
(a)	Currency	risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk as a result of potential movements in exchange rates impacting supplier contracts denominated in currencies 
other than pound sterling. The Group also has limited exposure in respect of recognised foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Group’s currency risk policy seeks to limit the impact of movements in exchange rates on Group income by requiring anticipated foreign 
currency cash flows primarily in US dollars and euros to be hedged. The future cash flows, which may be either contracted or un-contracted,  
are hedged between 80 per cent and 20 per cent using forward contracts and options.
The Group has limited exposure to currency risk on balances held on foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-
term timing differences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments. 
The Group considers that a ten per cent movement in exchange rates against sterling is a reasonable measure of volatility. The impacts of these 
changes in exchange rates in US dollar and euros versus sterling at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant is summarised  
in the following table:

(b)	Interest	rate	risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings and deposits. The Group’s interest rate policy seeks to minimise the cost and volatility  
of the Group’s interest expense by maintaining a diversified portfolio of fixed rate, floating rate and inflation-linked liabilities. 
(i) Fair value sensitivity for fixed rate instruments
The Group holds £1,291 million of fixed rate debt (2011: £1,259 million), of which £424 million (2011: £401 million) has been swapped into floating rate 
debt using interest rate swaps. The remaining £867 million (2011: £858 million) portion of fixed rate debt is recorded at amortised cost and a change 
in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the income statement. 
For the year, the fair value movement in the interest rate swaps has resulted in a credit to the income statement of £8 million (2011: £6 million). 
The fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate debt has resulted in a charge to the income statement of £10 million (2011: £3 million) which 
represents the ineffectiveness on the hedging relationship. 
(ii) Cash flow sensitivity for variable rate instruments
The Group holds £526 million of floating rate borrowings (2011: £686 million), comprising £485 million of floating rate swaps (2011: £461 million)  
and £41 million of floating rate debt (2011: £225 million). The Group also holds £542 million of interest bearing assets (2011: £301 million).     Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	103

The Group considers that a 100 basis point increase is a reasonable measure of volatility. The sensitivity of these balances to changes of 100 basis 
points in the floating rate at the balance sheet date on post-tax profit is shown below. Where a decrease of 100 basis points would reflect a negative

(iii) Cash flow sensitivity for inflation-linked variable instruments
The Group holds £843 million of inflation-linked debt (2011: £840 million) which is recorded at amortised cost. The Group considers that a 100 basis 
point increase is a reasonable measure of volatility. The sensitivity of this balance to changes of 100 basis points in the RPI at the balance sheet date 
on post-tax profit is shown below:

Inflation linked debt – 6 (6) 6
In September 2011, the Group entered into an inflation linked swap to convert £250 million (2011: £nil) of the £843 million (2011: £840 million) loan 
due 2031 from RPI linked to fixed rate interest for the period April 2012 to April 2017. A 100 basis points change in the RPI at the balance sheet date 
would have increased or decreased the cash flow equity reserve by £12 million (2011: £nil).
(iv) Fair value sensitivity for available-for-sale assets 
Included within available-for-sale financial assets is £146 million (2011: £140 million) relating to the Group’s beneficial interest in a property 
investment pool. The net present value of the Group’s interest in the various freehold reversions owned by the property investment pool has been 
derived by assuming a property growth rate of three per cent per annum (2011: 3.2 per cent) and a discount rate of ten per cent (2011: ten per 
cent), (see note 15). The sensitivity of this balance to changes of 0.5 per cent in the assumed rate of property rental growth and one per cent in the 
discount rate holding other assumptions constant is shown below:

Commodity	risk
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk within its commercial buying operations and with respect to its own use consumption of electricity, 
gas and fuel.
The Group’s Energy Price Risk Committee seeks to limit the impact of movements in commodity prices on Group income by requiring forecast 
purchases of power and fuel to be hedged.
The Group uses financial derivatives to hedge fuel exposures on a layered basis using contracts for difference. The Group considers a ten per cent 
movement in commodity rates a reasonable measure of volatility. A ten per cent (2011: 20 per cent) change in the fair value of the commodity price 
at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased the cash flow equity reserve by £4 million (2011: £5 million).
The Group hedges own consumption electricity and gas exposures with forward purchases under flexible purchasing arrangements with relevant 
suppliers.
The Group has also entered into several long-term fixed price power purchase agreements with independent producers. Included within derivative 
financial assets is £3 million (2011: £4 million) relating to these agreements. The Group values agreements as the net present value of fixed price 
future expected energy purchases less the market implied forward energy price discounted back at the prevailing swap rate. The Group also makes 
an assumption regarding expected energy output based on the historical performance and the producer’s estimate of expected electricity output. 
The sensitivity of this balance to changes of 20 per cent in the assumed rate of energy output and ten per cent in the implied forward energy prices 
holding other assumptions constant is shown below:

Capital	risk	management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as total equity plus net debt balances.
The Board’s objective is to safeguard the Group’s ability to remain a going concern and to maintain a strong and efficient capital base to support 
the Group’s strategic objectives and to maintain its ability to provide optimal returns for shareholders. There has been no change to capital risk 
management policies during the year. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes funding decisions based on the prevailing economic environment and has a number of tools 
available to manage capital risk. These include maintaining a diversified debt portfolio, the ability to adjust the size and timing of dividends paid  
to shareholders, to recycle capital through the sale and leaseback programme, the issue of new shares or the repurchase of shares on the open 
market to flex capital expenditure. The Board has a policy to maintain the underlying earnings cover for the ordinary dividend at a minimum of  
1.5 times. From time to time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Group’s share option 
programmes. The Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
The Board monitors a range of financial metrics including return on capital employed, gearing and fixed charge cover. A key objective of the  
Group’s capital risk management is to maintain compliance with the covenants attached to the Group’s debt. Throughout the year, the Group  
has comfortably complied with these covenants.

Foreign exchange forward contracts – cash flow hedges
At 17 March 2012, the Group held a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts with a fair value loss of £3 million (2011: £6 million) to hedge its 
future foreign currency denominated trade purchases. The Group had purchased €103 million (2010: €83 million) and sold sterling at rates ranging 
from 1.14 to 1.21 (2011: 1.13 to 1.21) with maturities from March 2012 to April 2013 (2011: March 2011 to April 2013) and purchased US$457 million (2011: 
US$463 million) and sold sterling at rates ranging from 1.52 to 1.67 (2011: 1.45 to 1.67) with maturities from March 2012 to April 2015 (2011: March 
2011 to June 2012).
At 17 March 2012, an unrealised loss of £3 million (2011: loss of £5 million) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the forward 
contracts. This loss will be transferred to the income statement over the next 38 months. During the year a debit to the income statement of  
£3 million was transferred from the cash flow hedge equity reserve and included in cost of sales (2011: debit of £8 million).
Commodity contracts – cash flow hedges
At 17 March 2012, the Group held a portfolio of commodity forward contracts with a fair value gain of £3 million (2011: £5 million) to hedge its future 
own use fuel consumption over the next 13 months.
At 17 March 2012, an unrealised gain of £3 million (2011: gain of £5 million) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of these contracts. 
This gain will be transferred to the income statement over the next 12 months.

Interest rate swaps – fair value hedge
The Group holds a portfolio of £424 million of interest rate swaps (2011: £401 million) to hedge a portion of the £1,036 million fixed rate secured 
loan due in 2018, the £190 million convertible bond due 2014, and the other loans due 2015. Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives fixed 
interest and pays floating rate interest at a fixed spread above three-month LIBOR. The notional principal amount of one of the interest rate swaps 
amortises from £211 million to £111 million from April 2016 to April 2018. 
Derivative financial instruments – fair value through profit and loss
At 17 March 2012, the Group held a portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss which convert £331 million of the Group’s 
floating rate obligations into fixed rates (2011: £331 million). Under the terms of these swaps the Group pays fixed rates of interest and receives 
three-month LIBOR for periods expiring from 19 April 2018 to 19 April 2031. Included in this portfolio is a £150 million swap under which the 
counterparty has a recurring option to cancel the swap on quarterly payment dates through to January 2031 at zero cost. 
The Group holds a portfolio of non-designated interest rate swaps which convert £391 million of fixed rate borrowings into floating rates 
(2011: £391 million). Under the terms of the swap the Group receives fixed rates of interest and pays floating rates of interest at various spreads 
above three-month LIBOR until 19 April 2018. 
Interest rate risk
Financial instruments where interest is re-priced at intervals of one year or less are classified as floating rate. Interest on financial instruments 
classified as fixed rate is fixed until maturity of the instrument. 
Foreign	currency	risk
The Group has net euro denominated trade payables of £12 million (2011: £11 million) and US dollar denominated trade payables of £11 million 
(2011: £14 million). 
Fair	value	
Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial instruments that are carried in the financial 
statements at other than fair values. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices that are available from the market on which 
the instruments are traded where available. The fair values of all other financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected 
future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The fair values of short-term deposits, trade receivables, overdrafts and payables are assumed to 
approximate to their book values, and are excluded from the analysis below.

Fair	value	measurements	recognised	in	the	Balance	sheets
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are recognised subsequent to initial recognition at fair value,  
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• 
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• 
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the  
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• 
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based  
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

30	Retirement	benefit	obligations
Retirement benefit obligations relate to a defined benefit scheme, the Sainsbury’s Pension Scheme, (the ‘Scheme’) and an unfunded pension liability 
relating to senior employees. The Scheme was closed to new employees on 31 January 2002. The assets of this scheme are held separately from the 
Group’s assets.
The Scheme was subject to a triennial actuarial valuation carried out by Towers Watson, the scheme’s independent actuaries, at March 2009  
on the projected unit basis. The results of this valuation were approved by the Scheme’s Trustees in June 2010. The retirement benefit obligations  
at 17 March 2012 have been calculated, where appropriate, on a basis consistent with this valuation. 
A triennial valuation will be carried out at March 2012 by Towers Watson, the Scheme’s independent actuaries on the projected unit basis with  
a statutory completion date of June 2013.
The unfunded pension liability is unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised 
in the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
Sainsbury’s	Property	Scottish	Limited	Partnership
Further to the funding plan agreed with the Scheme’s Trustees, on 17 June 2010 Sainsbury’s established the Sainsbury’s Property Scottish 
Partnership (the ‘Partnership’) with the Scheme. Under this arrangement, properties to a fair value of £256 million were transferred to the 
Partnership. On 25 March 2011, further properties to a fair value of £501 million were transferred to the Partnership. Both transfers were effected 
via a 30 year sale and leaseback arrangement.
The Scheme’s interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution of approximately £35 million for 20 years. These contributions will  
be in addition to the Group’s normal cash contributions paid to the Scheme annually. The properties transferred to the Partnership will revert  
to Sainsbury’s ownership in 2030 in return for a cash payment equal to the amount of any remaining funding deficit on the Scheme at that time,  
up to a maximum of £600 million. 
The Partnership is controlled by Sainsbury’s and its results are consolidated by the Group. The Group’s balance sheet, IAS 19 deficit and income 
statement are unchanged by the establishment of the Partnership. The investment held by the Scheme in the Partnership does not qualify as  
a plan asset for the purposes of the Group’s consolidated financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets.  
The value of the properties transferred to the Partnership remains included within the Group’s property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet. 
In addition, the Group retains full operational flexibility to extend, develop and substitute the properties within the Partnership.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:

The expected return on assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes. The expected 
return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking view of the financial markets (as suggested 
by the yield available) and the views of investment organisations.

Male pensioner 23.1 22.3
Female pensioner 25.6 23.9
The base mortality tables were derived by projecting forward the latest standard mortality tables (PA00 tables) in line with the base 1992 series 
improvements up to 2006, and then in line with medium cohort improvements from 2006 onwards, subject to a minimum rate of improvement  
from 2010 onwards of one per cent per annum. 
e)	Sensitivities
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by £548 million. A decrease of 0.5 per cent  
in the discount rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £614 million. 
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £408 million. A decrease of 0.5 per cent  
in the inflation rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by £389 million.
An increase of one year to the life expectancy would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £138 million.
The sensitivities are based on management’s best estimate of a reasonably anticipated change.

31	Share-based	payments	continued
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as set out below:
a)	Savings-Related	Share	Option	Scheme	(‘SAYE’)
The Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months’ continuous service. 
This is an approved HMRC Scheme and was established in 1980. Under the SAYE scheme, participants remaining in the Group’s employment at 
the end of the three-year or five-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price. 
Employees leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.
At 17 March 2012, UK employees held 22,976 five-year savings contracts (2011: 21,315) in respect of options over 22.8 million shares (2011: 20.6 
million) and 33,993 three-year savings contracts (2011: 31,420) in respect of options over 22.9 million shares (2011: 19.9 million). A reconciliation

Options granted during the year were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair 
value calculations. The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
2012 2011
Share price at grant date (pence) 298 371
Exercise price (pence) 238 297
Expected volatility – 3 year period (%) 22.4 34.3
 – 5 year period (%) 32.2 29.5
Option life – 3 year period (years) 3.2 3.2
– 5 year period (years) 5.2 5.2
Expected dividends (expressed as dividend yield %) 3.6 3.5
Risk–free interest rate – 3 year period (%) 1.3 3.2
– 5 year period (%) 2.5 4.4
Fair value per option – 3 year period (pence) 60 109
– 5 year period (pence) 85 114
The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Group’s share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, 
over the period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for management’s view of future volatility of the share price.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three or five years, as appropriate, on the assumption that 25 per cent of options  
will be cancelled over the service period as employees leave the SAYE scheme.   Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 113

b)	Executive	Share	Option	Plan	(‘ESOP’)
Under the Executive Share Option Plan, participants were granted options to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.  
The maximum annual option award was two times basic salary and the grants were agreed by the Remuneration Committee according  
to the assessed performance and potential of participants.
The exercise of options is conditional upon a performance target based on the growth in the Company’s underlying earnings per share (‘EPS’) 
relative to inflation over a three-year period. EPS is measured against a fixed starting point over the performance period beginning with the year  
in which the option was granted. To the extent that the condition is not satisfied in full after three years, it will be retested on a fixed-point basis  
over four and then five financial years. To the extent the condition is not met after five financial years, the option will lapse.
Once the options vest, participants remaining in the Group’s employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to exercise the options between 
vesting date (normally at the end of the three-year performance period) and the option expiry date, which is ten years from date of grant.
It is intended that there will be no further options granted under this plan.

c)	All-Employee	Share	Ownership	Plan
(i) In June 2003, under the All-Employee Share Ownership Plan, free shares were awarded to UK employees with more than 12 months’ continuous 
service. 0.3 million free shares (2011: 0.4 million) are being held in a trust on behalf of participants unless they are released to participants upon 
cessation of employment with the Group.
(ii) From 18 September 2008, under the Sainsbury’s share purchase plan, all employees were offered the opportunity to receive one free matching 
share for every four shares purchased through the Sainsbury’s share purchase plan. This arrangement ceased in August 2011. Under this scheme, 
232,603 matching shares are outstanding at 17 March 2012 (2011: 275,071 were outstanding). The charge under IFRS for this scheme was not 
material.
d)	Long-Term	Incentive	Plan	2006
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006, shares are conditionally awarded to the top managers in the Company. The core awards are calculated  
as a percentage of the participants’ salaries and scaled according to grades. 
The awards will vest if the threshold levels of two co-dependent performance conditions – Return on Capital Employed (‘ROCE’) and growth  
in cash flow per share, are achieved over the three-year performance period. The core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the  
level of performance. Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points.
Performance will be measured at the end of the three-year performance period. If the required level of performance has been reached, the awards 
vest and 50 per cent of the award will be released. Subject to participants remaining in employment for a further year, the balance will then be 
released no later than on the fourth anniversary of the date of award. Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire two years from  
the vesting date. Dividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.   114	 J	Sainsbury	plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012

Options to acquire the award of shares were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the 
fair value calculations. The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
 2012 2011 
Share price at grant date (pence) 355 324
Expected volatility (%) 18.4 22.8
Option life (years) 4.2 4.2
Risk-free interest rate (%) 3.3 3.7
Fair value per option (pence) 355 324
The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Group’s share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, 
over the period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for management’s view of future volatility of the share price.
In March 2011, the three year accelerated performance targets were met achieving a multiplier of 1.9 (2010: 3.2). During the year, a total number of 
6.3 million shares were granted to employees as a result of achieving the performance target and 6.2 million options were exercised. The weighted 
average share price during the year for options exercised was 326 pence (2011: 333 pence).
e)	Deferred	Annual	Bonus	Plan
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, applied to the top levels of management including Executive Directors and comprised around 40 participants in 
total. The first deferral took place in June 2007, in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 24 March 2007. The second deferral 
took place in June 2008, in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 22 March 2008. The third and final deferral took place in June 
2009, in respect to bonus awards for the financial year ended 21 March 2009.
The Plan measured the Company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance over a three-year period against a bespoke UK and European retail 
comparator group comprising: Tesco, Morrisons, DSG International, Kingfisher, Home Retail Group, Marks & Spencer, Next, Ahold, Carrefour, Casino, 
Delhaize and Metro. Alliance Boots was removed from the comparator group following its de-listing.
Up to two matched shares could be awarded for each share deferred depending on the extent to which the TSR measure was achieved. No shares 
were awarded for below median performance, and the full match only applied where the Company achieved first place within the comparator group. 
At median position the match was 0.5 shares for each deferred bonus share and the share match was pro-rated at every position between median 
and first place.   Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J	Sainsbury	plc	 115

31	Share-based	payments	continued
To the extent that the performance condition was met at the end of the three-year performance period, the matched shares would be added to the 
deferred bonus shares. The deferred bonus shares and half of the matched shares could be accessed immediately, while the remainder were held 
over for a further year. Dividends or their equivalents accrued on shares that vested.

f)	Deferred	Share	Award
The Deferred Share Award targets a diverse range of business critical financial and non-financial scorecard measures. These are intended to reward 
the top 40 managers in the Company, including Executive Directors for driving the short-term objectives that will directly lead to building the 
sustainable, long-term growth of the Company.
Share-based awards will be made to participants subject to performance against a basket of key strategic measures. At least 50 per cent of the 
award will be based on the delivery of financial performance and returns to shareholders. The balance will be based on measures which will assess 
the Company’s performance relative to its competitors as well as key strategic goals.
Performance against the target is measured over one financial year, but any shares awarded are deferred for a further two years to ensure  
that management’s interests continue to be aligned with those of shareholders. The shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant resigns  
or is dismissed for cause prior to their release date. Dividends accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.

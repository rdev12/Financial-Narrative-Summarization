Annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 March 2015
Introduction
I am pleased to present our report for the 
year ended 31 March 2015.  
Financial Overview
The business continues to develop 
successfully and for many of our KPIs in a 
way that has exceeded our expectations. 
Revenue has increased by 1% to 
£5,947,246 from £5,886,707 achieved 
last year, despite the loss of our largest 
single contract. We responded swiftly to 
the news of this loss both to reduce our 
fixed cost base and to win new contracts. 
As a result we have achieved a record profit 
before tax of £1,066,398 as against the 
previous year’s £854,905. The research 
and development investment in our travel 
tracker product attracts a tax credit in the 
UK and this has reduced the tax charge, so 
basic earnings per share show a substantial 
increase to 1.83p per share from 1.33p, 
this improvement was also assisted by the 
purchase in the year of 1,050,000 shares 
by the Employee Benefit Trust, which 
serves to reduce the number of shares in 
issue for earnings per share calculation 
purposes. 
The net assets per share continue to 
increase and are now 8.7p per share up 
from 7.6p last year. In January 2013 we 
completed the purchase of the building 
housing our Crisis Response Management 
Centre in Cape Town. The local bank loan 
to fund part of the purchase remains our 
only debt.
 
The Board are recommending a final 
dividend of 0.27p be paid in September, 
which is an increase of 17% on the 0.23p 
final dividend paid last year, and brings the 
dividend return for the year as a whole to 
0.50p as compared to 0.45p last year.
 
The share price has had a volatile year 
and was understandably depressed by 
the August news of the loss of a major 
contract. Since then we have worked 
hard to ensure that the fundamentals of 
the business remain very sound and to 
communicate the fact that the business 
still has considerable potential to develop. 
This work is beginning to be reflected in 
an improved share price, so enhancing 
shareholders overall return.
Outlook
We have worked hard to build up a 
reputation with well established clients for 
high quality work and we see future growth 
both from our existing services and also 
from the addition of other services that are 
likely to be of assistance to those clients. 
Although there are risks to any business, 
the Board feel encouraged by the way we 
have continued to progress over the last 
year, despite the loss of one of our key 
contracts which represented the realisation 
of one of the biggest risk factors that the 
business faced, and are confident of further 
progress to come. 
Staff
Our staff are absolutely crucial to the 
quality of service provided and to creating 
an environment where we can attract good 
quality people who want to come to work 
for us. The Board are most grateful to all the 
staff for their hard work and are gratified 
that so many of them are choosing to build 
their careers with the group.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
seven red24 is a crisis management assistance group that provides a range of security and 
business support services. Our business continues to enjoy four distinct streams of 
revenue: travel assistance, including accident and healthcare, special risks, consulting 
and product safety. We have developed an excellent reputation for assisting clients in 
minimising risks to their personnel, operations and profitability and this reputation 
is key to our ability to grow the business into related areas and to expanding our 
geographic coverage. 
Business model
The heart of our business operation is our 24/7 Crisis Response Management Centre 
(CRM) in Cape Town. This state of the art response centre is staffed 24 hours a day,  
365 days a year by a dedicated team of multi-lingual customer service representatives, 
regional analysts and experienced security professionals. The centre enables our experts to 
give accurate impartial, up to the minute information and advice to our clients. Across the 
group clients are offered escalating levels of assistance that are appropriate to the threat.
STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
Travel assistance
Our travel assistance service has 
been significantly enhanced by the 
investment in our travel tracker product 
which has placed it onto a new technical 
platform that will make it both easier 
to interface with new clients and with 
new travel data bases. The product was 
launched at the business travel show 
in London in February 2015 and met 
with a most encouraging response 
from FTSE350 companies and higher 
education establishments and we think 
this will help materially in ensuring that 
this revenue stream is maintained in 
2016, notwithstanding the loss of the 
major book of business from HSBC. 
The loss of the HSBC Premier and 
Advance books in the UK was 
announced last August but has only 
impacted the revenue numbers in the 
current calendar year. We have been 
working hard to diversify our revenue 
base in recent years and the numbers 
show that significant progress has been 
made. Regulatory changes in the UK 
make it unlikely that the revenues lost 
will be replaced by like for like income 
and given the relatively high fixed cost 
base that the CRM represents we 
responded quickly to the bad news to 
reduce the cost base. Unfortunately  
this could not be done without 
implementing some staff reductions, 
the cost of which was taken in the first 
half year. I am pleased to say that the 
improved level of new business means 
we are once again recruiting.
We were pleased to be awarded the title 
of Risk Management Firm of the Year, 
2015, by Finance Monthly and believe 
the year under review has seen our 
reputation continue to grow.

Special risks
Our special risks business had a busy 
year and dealt with a record number 
of kidnappings and other attempts at 
extortion – Mexico and Indonesia were 
particular trouble spots. None of these 
incidents resulted in the prolonged 
incident in the Middle East that so 
affected the 2014 numbers. We continue 
to publish our respected “Threat forecast” 
and have added new books of business 
over the year. The office we set up in 
Munich, primarily to service this unit, is 
meeting expectations and has created a 
number of promising opportunities.
Consulting and response
Throughout the year this unit has been 
busy with requests for close protection 
work and for evacuation planning 
services. In August a new Far Eastern 
client requested a large evacuation from 
Libya involving several hundred of their 
staff. This was successfully completed and 
represents our largest operation to date.
Product safety
Red24 Assist our product safety brand, 
showed an increase in revenue in the 
second half year following the launch of 
a new analytical tool and new training 
modules. This has kept our offering ahead 
of the competition and is helping to 
ensure that contracts are renewed and 
that new business is won.  
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of principal risks and 
uncertainties which could have a material 
effect on the group. Some of these risks 
and uncertainties are external to the 
group and largely outside the group’s 
control. Foremost amongst these is the 
economic environment, which remains a 
challenging one as many governments 
struggle with debt constraints. This has 
implications for the relative value of 
currencies, not least sterling, which is 
our functional and reporting currency. 
The past two years have seen significant 
growth in our dollar revenues and costs, 
and we also have a significant rand 
cost base in South Africa. The impact of 
currency movements on our earnings 
cannot be reliably forecast and remains 
an area of uncertainty, though the Board 
do seek to reduce uncertainty by using 
forward exchange contracts to purchase 
rand for the forthcoming twelve months. 
Risks and uncertainties that are largely 
within the control of the group include 
the maintenance of the group’s 
competitive position to ensure the 
achievement and collection of sufficient 
revenue to meet the group’s objectives. 
The group maintains significant cash 
reserves both to mitigate against the 
possibility of periods of reduced working 
capital and to ensure adequate working 
capital is available to meet any sudden 
increase in the level of response work 
clients may require. Internally we have 
worked hard, and with some success, 
to broaden the customer base and 
reduce dependence on key accounts. 
Other normal business risks include 
dependence on the continued availability 
of key personnel to ensure that our 
clients receive the level of service they 
are entitled to expect, and the ability of 
the group to continue to provide that 
level of service. The reputation of the 
group is critical to its continued success 
and it works hard to develop and protect 
that reputation by ensuring that it only 
associates itself with activities that are 
appropriate for a business in its sector.
Looking forward
To date the group has been able to 
expand organically by recruiting 
appropriate specialists in the desired 
fields without the need for acquisitions. 
However the Board is mindful that 
acquisition remains an additional avenue 
to growth and, particularly in overseas 
markets, may be a more effective means 
of achieving growth. To this end, in June 
2015, we announced the acquisition 
of Risq Worldwide, a Singapore based 
company specialising in corporate 
investigations, business intelligence  
and employment background screening. 
This will significantly enhance our 
business in Asia, adds a number of  
blue-chip clients and broadens our 
product offering in London. 
We have a good pipeline of new 
business, and see significant 
opportunities in Europe and in Asia. 
Whether the revenue lost can be fully 
recovered by organic growth in a single 
year remains to be seen, but we are 
pleased with the level of new business 
achieved thus far.
 
Expansion in areas outside our reporting 
currency is affected by exchange rate 
movements. Almost half our revenue is 
now denominated in US dollars, even 
where our clients are the UK arm of US 
insurers, whereas almost 50% of our 
costs are incurred in Rand. Exchange 
rate movements are influenced by many 
complex factors and whilst the Board 
continues to believe that it is neither 
practical nor desirable to hedge these 
risks fully, we have taken steps to secure 
what we believe to be a favourable 
opportunity to purchase forward 80% of 
our forecast Rand requirements for the 
coming year.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
red24
Annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 March 2015 The red24 brand and our corporate values are the key to our 
approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Our CSR 
strategy is focused on the following key issues: 
Business ethics
The Board is committed to maintaining high ethical standards 
across the group and expect the same commitment from our staff, 
customers and suppliers. Our reputation is vital to our continued 
business success and we do not tolerate any form of bribery, 
corruption or fraud. We have anti-bribery policies in place of 
which all employees are made aware when they join as well as 
through the group intranet and through training.
Employee engagement
The Board recognise that our employees are fundamental to our 
success. As a professional services business we have a highly 
skilled workforce who assist in delivering our strategic objectives. 
The Board aim to ensure that there are equal opportunities 
for all employees and that decisions affecting employees are 
taken based on merit and not on such factors as race, gender, 
nationality or religious beliefs. In South Africa there are legislative 
requirements that expect the workforce to be reflective of the 
mix of peoples in the Western Cape. The board regularly monitor 
progress towards this.
Many of the group’s employees have become shareholders 
through the share loan scheme. In 2013 an employee benefit 
trust was created. The Board have provided a loan of £125,000 
to the Trustees to acquire shares in the market and, at 31 March 
2015 the Trust held 1,050,000 shares in the Group. The Board 
intend that these shares will be used to satisfy staff share awards 
made as part of a longer term incentive scheme. The remaining 
step will be to create a new, approved, Enterprise Management 
Incentive Scheme open to all qualifying staff.
The optional defined contribution pension schemes, introduced 
in 2012, for all staff based in either South Africa or the United 
Kingdom, have been taken up 80% of our staff.
Health and safety
The Board are committed to providing a safe workplace for all 
our staff and to ensure that our services are provided in a way 
that delivers our services safely for clients and staff, including 
contractors. Responsibility for health and safety rests with the  
Chief Executive.
Sustainability
The Board monitor staffing needs to ensure that it is regularly 
reviewed and appropriate plans put in place to ensure we  
retain and develop the necessary levels of skills and take action 
where necessary.
We monitor and work to minimise our impact on the 
environment. We measure our carbon footprint and work to 
reduce it. We provide the green24 website as an open access  
one, allowing individuals and corporates to live and work in  
a more sustainable way.
Community engagement
Red24 established a charity committee in 2007, “Project Infundo” , 
which means education. Through the work of this committee 
we support educational initiatives. In Cape Town, we assist 
a disadvantaged primary school in Constantia and a teacher 
improvement programme in Khayelitsha; whilst in London we 
assist a community voluntary charity.

for good corporate governance. The company 
has complied substantially throughout 
the period with the corporate governance 
guidelines for smaller quoted companies 
issued by the Quoted Companies Alliance 
and details are provided below.
 
Application of the principles of good 
governance
The names of the directors and their 
respective responsibilities are shown 
on page 12.  At the year end, the Board 
consisted of two executive directors and two 
non-executive directors. Both non-executive 
directors are regarded as independent. 
The full Board met 12 times during the 
year (2014: 12) and receives appropriate 
information from management in advance 
of its meetings. Certain functions are 
delegated to Board Committees. 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired 
by the senior independent non-executive 
director and consists of that director, 
the other non-executive director and 
the Chairman. Its key role is to make 
recommendations to the Board, within 
agreed terms of reference, on the Company’s 
framework of executive remuneration and 
its cost and to determine on behalf of the 
Board specific remuneration packages for 
the Executive Directors.
The Audit Committee consists of the 
Chairman and the two non-executive 
directors, two of whom are Chartered 
Accountants. The Committee, which is 
chaired by the senior non-executive director, 
meets with the independent auditor to 
consider the group’s financial reporting in 
advance of its publication.
The Board considers that its structure 
is appropriate to its present stage of 
development and that both non-executive 
directors are independent of the executives 
in both character and judgement. 
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that the group maintains a 
system of internal control to provide it 
with reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of information used within the 
business and for publication and that 
assets are safeguarded.  There are inherent 
limitations in any system of internal control 
and, accordingly, even the most effective 
system can provide only reasonable, and 
not absolute, assurance with respect to the 
preparation of financial information and the 
safeguarding of assets.
The key features of the internal control 
system that operated during the year may be 
summarised as follows:
•  Board responsibility for overall strategy 
and for approving budgets, forecasts and 
plans;
•  Board and business heads participate in 
the annual strategic planning process 
which sets the framework for the budgets 
of individual business units;
•  clear lines of authority, responsibility 
and financial accountability within each 
business unit, ensuring an appropriate 
organisational structure for planning, 
executing, controlling and monitoring its 
business operations;
•  consideration and review by the Board of 
monthly management accounts which 
compare actual results with budgets and 
prior years’ results;
•  regular reporting of legal, accounting, 
human resources and health and safety 
developments and issues to the Board; 
and
•  comprehensive accounting policies and 
regular reviews of compliance with those 
policies.
The Audit Committee reviews the operation 
and effectiveness of this framework on a 
regular basis and, on behalf of the Board, 
has reviewed the half yearly report and the 
annual financial statements along with the 
nature and scope of the external audit.  
The directors consider that there have 
been no weaknesses in internal financial 
control that have resulted in any material 
losses, contingencies or uncertainties 
requiring disclosure in the group’s financial 
statements.
Relations with shareholders
The Chairman and Chief Executive make 
themselves available to major shareholders 
on request and periodically attend meetings 
with and presentations to shareholders. 
The Annual General Meeting is normally 
attended by all directors and shareholders 
are invited to ask questions during the 
meeting and to meet with directors after the 
formal proceedings have ended.
Going concern
Having made enquiries, the directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the company 
and the group as a whole will have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.  For this 
reason they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.  
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee undertakes a formal 
assessment of the external auditor’s 
independence each year which includes:
•  a review of non-audit services provided to 
the group and related fees;
•  receipt from the auditor of a written 
report detailing relationships with the 
company and any other parties that could 
affect independence or the perception of 
independence;
•  a review of the auditor’s own procedures 
for ensuring independence of the audit 
firm and partners and staff involved in the 
audit, including the regular rotation of the 
audit partner; and
•  obtaining written confirmation from 
the auditor that, in their professional 
judgement, they are independent.
An analysis of the fees payable to the 
external audit firm in respect of both audit 
and non-audit services during the year is set 
out in note 4 to the financial statements.

Directors’ benefits
None of the directors received any benefits in kind during the year 
or during the previous year, nor were any pension contributions 
made on behalf of any director in either year. On 1 August 2013 
the group introduced a three times salary death in service benefit 
scheme of which the executive directors are members.
Directors’ interests in shares and options
The interests of the directors holding office at 31 March 2015 in 
the company’s share capital, including share options and also 
including shares held by companies controlled by the directors, 
are shown in the directors’ report on page 13. 
The Board believe that the direct participation in the equity of the 
company leads to a significant reduction in staff turnover and is 
an effective method of ensuring that the longer term interests 
of staff and shareholders coincide. In 2013 the Board set up an 
Employee Benefit Trust with the intention of empowering the Trust 
to acquire shares at appropriate opportunities to satisfy future staff 
share awards. At 31 March 2015 1,050,000 shares (2014: Nil) had 
been acquired by the trust. In the coming year a new Enterprise 
Management Incentive Scheme is planned.
Executive directors, managers and staff will all be eligible to 
participate in the scheme after a minimum length of service and 
the Board envisage that the present system of discretionary cash 
bonuses will move to one where there is a short and long term 
element to the award, the former will continue to be paid in cash 
and the later by way of share options, under the EMI Scheme for 
those eligible.
The Board are pleased to note that at 31 March 2015 20 members 
of staff (2014: 33) were shareholders in the company.

Annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 March 2015 STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report 
and the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and 
company financial statements for each financial year.  The 
directors are required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock 
Exchange to prepare group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have elected under 
company law to prepare the company financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS  as adopted by the EU.
 
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted 
by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the group 
and the company and the financial performance of the group. 
The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial 
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to 
financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to 
their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and of 
the profit or loss of the group for that period. 
 
In preparing the group and company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
a.   select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
b.   make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
c.   state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs adopted by the EU;
d.   prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the group’s and 
the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the group and the company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006.  They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the group and the company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the  
red24 plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.

Annual report & accounts for the year ended 31 March 2015 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF RED24 PLC
We have audited the group and parent company financial 
statements on pages 20 to 53. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted 
by the European Union and, as regards the parent company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.     
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As more fully explained in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities on page 18, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (“APB’s”) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is 
provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.com
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion 
−   the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the group’s and of the parent’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 and 
of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
−  the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
−  the parent financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
−  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report 
and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
-   adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received by branches not visited by us: or
-  the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns: or
-  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
-  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.

From 1 April 2007, the group and company have adopted 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and the 
International Financial Report Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) 
interpretations as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) in the 
preparation of its financial statements and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical  
cost basis, except for trade investments and land and buildings  
which have been measured at fair value. 
The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis. In assessing 
whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, the directors 
have taken into account relevant available information about the 
future including profit and cash forecasts for the next two financial 
years and the assumptions on which they are based. After reviewing 
this information, the directors consider that it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial 
statements of the company and all of the entities controlled by the 
company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year. Control 
is obtained when the company has exposure or rights to the variable 
returns from the involvement in the investee entity and the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The 
acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the cash paid 
and the fair value of other assets given, equity instruments issued 
and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange of 
contracts. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed 
as incurred.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired are included in the 
consolidated income statement up to, or from, the date control 
passes. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used 
into line with those used by the group. All intra-group transactions, 
balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The company has not presented its own income statement as 
permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit  
for the year was £423,835 (2014: £809,985).
(c) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable in respect of services provided in the normal course of 
business, net of discounts, value added tax and other sales related 
taxes. Sales of services are recognised when the services have been 
provided, services invoiced in advance are treated as deferred 
income and income is accrued where services have been provided 
but not yet invoiced.
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis. Dividend 
income is accounted for when received.
(d) Cost of sales, gross profit and operating profit
Cost of sales represent the fair value of costs directly incurred in the 
supply of goods sold and services provided. Costs are recognised at 
the time when the goods have been supplied or the services have 
been provided. Costs relating to still to be provided services are 
carried forward in other receivables to the extent it is considered 
probable they will be recovered.
Gross profit is defined as revenue recognised less cost of sales.
Operating profit is arrived at after deducting all administrative 
expenses from gross profit, including restructuring and impairment 
costs, but before finance income and finance costs.
(e) Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the 
period in which they are incurred. Interest costs are accrued on a 
time basis by reference to the principal outstanding at the effective 
interest rate applicable.

(f) Taxation
The tax credit or expense represents the sum of the current tax 
expense and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statements because it excludes items of income and expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using the applicable rate for the period the taxable profits 
are earned in.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.  Deferred tax is 
measured on a non-discounted basis. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary timing differences arising on 
investments in subsidiary companies, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
(g) Intangible assets
Goodwill, being the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair  
value of net assets, including any intangible assets identified, 
acquired, is capitalised. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested at 
least annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment provisions. 
                         
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of 
impairment testing. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating 
unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, then any goodwill 
is considered to be impaired. Impairment losses recognised for 
goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined 
from value in use calculations. The group prepares cash flow forecasts 
from the most recent financial budgets approved by management. 
The cash flows are then discounted at an appropriate interest rate, 
based on the likely cost of loan capital, to determine value in use. 
Intellectual properties, including computer software licences, 
training courses, websites and trademarks are capitalised at cost and 
are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
economic lives of between one and three years. 
(h) Investment 
A trade investment is an entity over which the group does not have 
significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary, an associate nor 
a joint venture. Such investments are initially measured at fair value, 
to which transaction costs are added. Such assets are financial assets  
and any gain or loss arising on remeasurement is recognised in  
profit and loss. 
(i) Property, plant & equipment and depreciation 
Land and buildings held for use in the provision of services, or 
for administrative purposes, are initially valued at cost, including 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial measurement land and 
buildings are revalued regularly and held in the balance sheet at the 
revalued amount, being the fair value at the date of revaluation, less 
any subsequent accumulated depreciation. A gain or loss arising from 
a change in fair value is included in taken to a revaluation reserve in 
the period in which it arises.

For the year ended 31 March 2015
(i) Property, plant & equipment and depreciation (continued)
Plant and equipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and less provisions for impairment. Depreciation is provided at the 
following annual rates in order to write off each asset, on a straight-
line basis, over its estimated useful life:
Buildings 3% per annum
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 16.67% to 50% per annum
Motor vehicles 20% per annum
                    
The depreciation charge is time apportioned in the year of acquisition 
and disposal of assets. Freehold land is not depreciated.
(j) Product development
Product development is written off to the income statement as 
incurred unless the directors are satisfied as to the technical, 
commercial and financial viability of individual projects.  In this 
situation, the expenditure is deferred and amortised over the  
period during which the company is expected to benefit.
(k) Foreign currency translation
The individual financial statements of each group company are 
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the 
consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of 
each group company are expressed in sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the company, and the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, 
transactions expressed in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are translated at rates of exchange 
approximating to those ruling at the date of the transaction.  At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date. Non monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, 
and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the profit 
or loss before tax for the period.
In presenting the consolidated financial statements the assets and 
liabilities of the overseas subsidiary are translated at the rate ruling 
at the balance sheet date. The results of the overseas subsidiary have 
been translated at the average exchange rate ruling during the year. 
Differences arising on retranslation are added to or deducted from the 
group’s translation reserve. 
(l) Financial assets
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as “Loans and receivables” . These receivables are 
initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at their 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any 
provision for impairment. 
Financial assets are assessed for indications of impairment at each 
balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there 
is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the 
estimated future cash flows of the asset have been impacted. For 
trade and other receivables the carrying amount is reduced by an 
allowance reflecting the impairment. When a trade receivable is 
uncollectible it is written off against the allowance, subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the 
allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance 
are reflected in the income statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on demand 
deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.

(m) Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance 
of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is 
any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group 
after deducting all its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
The component parts of compound instruments are classified separately 
as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the 
transaction. At the date of issue the fair value of the liability is estimated 
using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar non-convertible 
instrument. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost 
basis until extinguished on conversion or upon the instrument reaching 
maturity. The equity component is determined by deducting the 
amount of the liability component from the fair value of the compound 
instrument as a whole. This is recognised in equity through other 
reserves and is not subsequently re-measured.
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of 
transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts together 
with obligations under finance leases are classified as “Borrowings” .
(n) Net cash
Net cash is defined as the excess of cash and cash equivalents  
over borrowings. 
(o) Investments
Non-current investments representing investments in subsidiary 
undertakings are valued at cost less any provision for impairment in the 
value of the investment. 
Held-for-sale investments that do not have a quoted market price are 
held at fair value, where that can be reliably measured, otherwise they 
are held at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of  
each reporting period. 
(p) Dividends
Dividend payments are recognised as liabilities once they are 
appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the company. 
(q) Share based payments
The group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain 
employees. Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is 
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
group’s estimate of options that will eventually vest. Fair value is 
measured by use of the Black Scholes model. The assumptions 
underlying the number of awards expected to vest are subsequently 
adjusted to reflect conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date.  
At the vesting date of an award, the cumulative expense is adjusted to 
take account of the awards that actually vest.
(r) Leased assets and obligations
An asset is acquired when substantially all the risks and rewards are 
transferred and is capitalised as an asset under a finance lease with the 
corresponding liability to the finance company included in trade and 
other payables.  Depreciation on assets held under finance leases is 
provided in accordance with the policy noted in (i) above.  Finance lease 
payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and 
the interest is charged to the income statement on a constant rate basis 
over the period of the agreement. Finance charges are charged directly 
to income. All other leases are operating leases.
Rentals receivable or payable under operating leases are credited or 
charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the  
lease term.
(s) Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current financial year the group has adopted the following 
improvements to IFRSs which were effective for this financial period. 
These have had no material impact on the financial statements of  
the Group:
 • IAS 27 ’Separate financial statements’;
• IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’;
• IFRS 10 ’Consolidated financial statements’;  
• IFRS 11 ’Joint arrangements’; 
• IFRS 12 ’Disclosure of interests in other entities’; 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following 
Standards and Interpretations, which have not yet been applied in these 
financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
• IAS 1 ‘Disclosure initiative’;
• IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’;
• IAS 32 ’Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities’;  
• IAS 34 ’Interim financial reporting’;
• IFRS 5 ’Discontinued operations’;
• IFRS 9 ’Financial Instruments’;          
• IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ .
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ .
The directors do not anticipate that they will have a material impact  
on the financial statements.

2  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty 
Estimates and judgements are evaluated on a continual basis and  
are based on historical experience together with expectations of 
future events believed to be reasonable at the time. In considering 
the possible impairment of intangible assets and in recognising 
deferred tax assets, estimates of future revenues are particularly 
critical. The directors have prepared forecasts of revenues and 
expenses covering the next two financial years to assist in the  
making of estimates and judgements.
In the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, which 
are described in note 1, the directors have made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements.
Critical accounting judgement - Revenue recognition
Much of the group’s revenue comes from business that relates to  
the provision of services over a period of time. Invoiced revenue  
may cover more than one accounting period and these revenues are 
time apportioned to the accounting period to which they relate and 
the obligation for future service is shown in deferred in come. Even 
after recognition as revenue on a time apportioned basis, there may 
be uncertainty as to the costs relating to these revenues for some 
time afterwards and there may remain an obligation for  
future service.  
An estimate of this obligation has been made by the directors,  
using their experience of similar contracts, and deducted from 
recognised revenue. 
Estimation uncertainty - Life of intangible assets
The group depends on its intangible assets to generate revenue 
and invests to develop and maintain its intangible assets. New 
intangible assets are recognised on the balance sheet and tested 
annually for impairment, as described further in note 14. The 
estimates supporting these impairment tests are based on future 
revenue projections and discount rates and are inherently uncertain.
 
3  Revenue and segment analysis 
Following the sale of the training business in 2013 the 
management of the group has been reorganised into a single 
operating segment. The segment recognises four streams of 
revenue each of which is supported by the Crisis Response 
Management Centre (CRM) in Cape Town. The Chief Operating 
Decision Maker which is deemed to be the group board of directors, 
receives reports of revenue and cost of sales by revenue stream 
but it is considered neither desirable nor practical to allocate the 
administrative overheads to those revenue streams. 
The following tables provide details of revenue and profit for each revenue stream:

8  Share based payments
The company has issued share options, none of which are subject 
to performance conditions, to certain directors and employees. The 
options cannot be exercised in the first three years following their 
grant and, under normal circumstances, the options lapse if an 
employee leaves the group.
On 16 April 2004, the company granted 1,595,000 options to 
subscribe for ordinary shares of 1p each under the company’s general 
share option scheme, exercisable at 18.75p per share between 16 
April 2006 and 15 April 2014, all of which have now lapsed. 
On 2 March 2010, the company granted 500,000 options to subscribe 
for ordinary shares of 1p each under the company’s executive share 
option scheme, exercisable at 8p per share between 31 March 2013 
and 31 March 2016.
 
On 8 August 2012 the company granted 750,000 options to subscribe 
for ordinary shares of 1p each under the company’s executive share 
option scheme, exercisable at 10.5p per share at any time between  
8 August 2015 and 8 August 2018.
At 31 March 2015 1,250,000 outstanding options are exercisable 
(2014: 1,562,500) at a weighted average exercise price of 9.5p 
(2014: 11.35p). 
     
The total charge recognised in administration expenses in the income 
statement from share based transactions, all equity-settled, amounted

On 31 July 2013 the group disposed of Arc Training International Limited, which carried on a security management training business. The 
disposal was made in exchange for an investment in the purchaser, Linx International Limited. On 12 August 2014 the group agree to sell this 
investment for £375,000 in three equal tranches, the first of which was completed on that day and the remaining two fall due on 12 August 2015 
and 12 August 2016. The group anticipates that both these tranches will be completed when they fall due and accordingly the investment is 
considered as an asset held for sale in these financial statements.

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, 
at acquisition, to the cash generating segments that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. At the 
date of transition to IFRS the carrying amount of goodwill had 
been allocated as security assistance £137,566 and training 
courses £120,000; the latter was disposed of during the 
previous year. 
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more 
frequently if there are indications that goodwill might 
be impaired. Charges for amortisation and impairment 
of goodwill and intellectual property are included within 
administrative expenses.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units 
are determined from value in use calculations. The group 
prepares cash flow forecasts from the most recent financial 
budgets approved by management. The cash flows are then 
discounted at an appropriate interest rate to determine value 
in use. 
The forecast cash flows for the next two years, taking forecast 
revenues, based upon historical experience, and anticipated 
expenditure are then discounted at a rate of ten percent 
per annum to arrive at a recoverable amount for each cash 
generating unit. This shows that each cash generating unit 
has a recoverable amount in excess of the carrying value of 
goodwill and that no charge for impairment in necessary.
The key assumptions are those regarding discount rate, 
growth rates, expected sales and direct costs during the 
period. Growth forecasts are based on the experience of the 
past three years. A discount rate of 10% has been applied 
based on the cost of loan capital.

The Board’s principal objective in managing its financial assets and liabilities is to ensure that the operating units have sufficient working  
capital for their day-to-day needs. Surplus cash is maintained on call deposits with the clearing bankers to the operating units, as the group  
is not yet sufficiently cash generative to warrant a separate treasury function or take advantage of greater returns that may be available from 
other sources or maturities. The group does derive income in overseas currencies, principally the US dollar, and does incur expenses in  
overseas currencies, principally the costs of its South African operation which is Rand based. 
At 31 March 2015 the group had purchased R5 million (2014: R10 million) forward for sterling at a rate of R17.90: £1 (2014: R18.09:£1)  
and R5 million (2014: Nil) forward for dollars at a rate of R11.36: $1 exercisable at any time between 1 April 2015 and 30 September 2015,  
the fair value of the financial liability is immaterial to the financial statements. No other forward contracts have been entered into to further 
hedge these exposures.

28 Financial instruments and risk summary (continued)
(b) Capital risk management
The directors consider the company’s capital comprises its share capital and reserves and bank and other loans. In general the group 
finances its operations from equity share issues and from the retention of profits. To ensure that equity markets remain open to the group 
as a source of capital, the market price of the group’s shares is regularly reviewed by the Board, to check it remains above par value. The 
group’s investment in South Africa includes the property there; this purchase was financed through a combination of retained earnings 
and locally sourced bank finance to act as a hedge against country and currency risk.
(c) Foreign currency risk and sensitivity
The group has two overseas subsidiaries whose functional currencies are Rand and another whose functional currency is US dollars.  
In addition the group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies, principally US dollars, hence exposures to exchange 
rate fluctuations arise. The carrying amount of the group’s foreign currency denominated financial assets and financial liabilities at the 
reporting date is as follows:    
Assets Liabilities
2015

2014

Dollar 881,291 923,703 72,747 60,924
Other currencies 91,004 15,119 6,621 26,969
1,517,849 1,216,626 316,012 426,387
The company does not have any exposure to foreign currencies as all its transactions are in sterling. The group’s exposure to the Rand is 
such that were the Rand to appreciate by 10% against sterling the cost of its operations in South Africa would rise by £147,905 (2014: 
£158,327), this would be mitigated by a rise in the value in the group’s Rand assets of £115,613 (2014: £78,245). The group’s exposure 
to the US dollar is such that were the dollar to depreciate by 10% against sterling profit would be reduced by £84,312 (2014: £100,275). 
The Board are aware that these are significant risks and the impact of currency movements on earnings cannot be reliably forecast and 
remains an area of uncertainty.
(d) Market risk
The group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (see section (c)) and interest rates (see 
section (g)). As explained above, the group has, for the present, accepted exposure to these risks.
(e) Liquidity risk 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which regularly reviews the short, medium and long 
term funding and liquidity requirements. As a general principle the board consider that equity remains the most appropriate source of 
funds for the business and endeavours to maintain access to equity capital markets to fund medium and long term liquidity requirements. 
However, where significant overseas investments are contemplated an evaluation of currency, country and other risk factors are taken into 
account and opportunities to finance a proportion of that investment locally will be considered. Financial assets are maintained on short 
term deposit to assist with the management of day-to-day working capital requirements.

(h) Credit risk  
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group. The group 
has a credit policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating this risk. The group’s exposure to credit risk is 
monitored on a monthly basis and remedial action taken where appropriate.
The group endeavour to ensure a spread of customers to avoid the risks associated with concentration of credit. At the balance sheet date, 
one customer accounted for 15.6% (2014: 13.9%) of the group’s trade and other receivables, no other customer accounted for more than 
10%. These receivables are within their trading terms but nonetheless present an ongoing risk. The group is endeavouring to mitigate this 
risk by gaining new customers at a faster rate than business with these two counterparties develops.
The group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on its financial assets is £4,113,623 (2014: £3,268,499). For the company its maximum 
exposure, excluding amounts due from subsidiaries, is £1,369,586 (2014: £975,386). The group does not hold any collateral against  
these financial assets. 
29 Contingent liabilities
The company has a contingent liability in respect of the value added tax of certain subsidiary companies under a group registration and 
is therefore jointly and severally liable for all the other group companies’ debt in this respect.  At 31 March 2015 the maximum potential 
liability was £90,871 (2014: £63,479).
30 Post balance sheet event
On 29 May the company contracted to acquire the entire share capital of RISQ Worldwide Holdings Pte. Limited and its wholly owned 
subsidiary RISQ Worldwide Pte. Limited, both companies are incorporated in Singapore. Completion is due on 1 July 2015 and the initial 
consideration is SGD550,000 with additional contingent consideration of up to SGD1,000,000 payable, depending on performance,  
for the years to 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2017.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Notes
1 In accordance with Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001, only those members entered on the Company’s register 
of members not later than 18:00 on 3 August 2015 or, if the meeting is 
adjourned, shareholders entered on the Company’s register of members 
not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned meeting, 
shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting.
2 If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in note 1 above, 
you are entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of 
your rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting.  
 A form of proxy is enclosed which you are invited to complete and 
return.  Completion and return of the proxy form in accordance with the 
instructions thereon will not prevent you from attending and voting at the 
Meeting, instead of your proxy, if you wish to do so.
3 A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend 
the Meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint the Chairman of 
the Meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set 
out in the notes to the proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your 
behalf at the Meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy 
(not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them.
4 You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed 
to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint more 
than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint 
more than one proxy you may photocopy the proxy from. Please indicate 
the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares in relation to which 
they are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not 
exceed the number of shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy 
instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be 
signed and should be returned in the same envelope.
5 The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy how to vote on 
each resolution or withhold their vote.
 To appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must be:
• Completed and signed;
• Sent or delivered to the Company’s registrars, Capita Asset Services   
PXS 1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU; and
• Received not later than 48 hours  before the time fixed for the Meeting at 
which the proxy is to vote.
In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy form must be executed 
under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or 
an attorney for the company.
Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the proxy form is 
signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included 
with the proxy form.
6 In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders 
purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most 
senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in 
which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of 
members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most 
senior).
7 To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment 
using the methods set out above. Note that the cut-off time for receipt 
of proxy appointments (see above) also apply in relation to amended 
instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant 
cut-off time will be disregarded.
Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would 
like to change the instructions using another hard-copy proxy form, please 
contact the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars of 34 Beckenham Road, 
Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU for details.
If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment 
received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take 
precedence.
8 In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company 
by sending a signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to 
revoke your proxy appointment to the Company’s registrars, Capita Asset 
Services PXS 1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU for details. 
In the case of a member which is a company, the revocation notice must 
be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer 
of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney 
or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a 
duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with the 
revocation notice.
The revocation notice must be received by the Company’s registrars, Capita 
Asset Services PXS 1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU no  
later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the Meeting at which the proxy  
is to vote.
Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the Meeting 
and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the Meeting  
in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
9 A vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the 
calculation of the proportion of votes for or against a resolution. 
10 Copies of the directors’ contracts of service are available for inspection at 
the Company’s registered office during normal business hours on each 
business day from the date of this notice until the day of the Annual 
General Meeting and will be at the place of the Annual General Meeting 
for one hour before, and until the conclusion of, the Meeting.

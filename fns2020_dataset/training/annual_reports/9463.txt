This is Logica
Dear Shareholder, 
This report covers my ﬁ rst 
year as Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer of Logica. It has been 
a great privilege to lead the 
dedicated and talented team 
of people at Logica.
In April 2008, we launched a three year plan, 
building on Logica’s distinctive strengths. 
We did well against our plan in 2008. We 
achieved the ﬁ nancial targets we set out to 
shareholders while strengthening our 
management capability, implementing our 
strategy, and transforming the business 
around our key European customers. We also 
put the business on a ﬁ rmer operational and 
ﬁ nancial footing, with the support of our 
shareholders. 
 During 2008 I have prioritised spending 
time with customers and launching a major 
communications programme to ensure Logica 
people everywhere understand our strategy 
and plan. As a result, customers are noticing 
a more ambitious Logica that is working well 
together across the world and is responding 
to their changing needs. We will build on this 
during 2009 to create a preference for 
working with Logica. 
 You can read more detail about Logica’s 
strengths, the plan we set out and our 
achievements in 2008 in the following pages. 
Market overview
In 2009 we will keep focused on delivering 
against our plan and making progress against 
our long term goals, while coping with a more 
difﬁ cult economic environment. European 
GDP forecasts now suggest that the IT 
services market will decline modestly in 2009, 
with more weakness expected in markets with 
a larger ﬁ nancial services and general 
industrial exposure. Public Sector, Energy and 
Utilities, and Telecoms (which collectively 
accounted for 53% of Group revenue in 2008) 
remain robust. Our broad spread across 
sectors, as well as geographies, underpins 
our conﬁ dence in our ability to perform better 
than the market in 2009.
Appetite for using blended delivery has 
increased. While there is increasing pricing 
pressure, we have been able to respond by 
offering blended delivery and agreeing more 
efﬁ cient ways of working with our clients. 
CEO’s review
Andy Green
CEO, Logica

progress of our Programme 
for Growth at:

logica.com
We are proud to work with a very broad range 
of customers across Europe. In 2008, our top 
50 customers accounted for 32% of revenue. 
As our customers reduce their number of 
suppliers, we have an opportunity to meet a 
broader range of their needs. 
Outlook for 2009
We had a strong fourth quarter order intake 
and have a good pipeline of large 
opportunities, particularly in outsourcing. This 
is driven by the investments we have made in 
sales and outsourcing. Offsetting this is a 
reduction in shorter term consulting projects. 
As a result, we expect revenue for the ﬁ rst half 
of 2009 to be in line with 2008 on a constant 
currency basis.
We are continuing to prioritise stringent 
cost management across the business and 
have already taken decisive action in early 
2009. Following lower attrition in the last 
quarter of 2008, we signiﬁ cantly slowed 
recruitment and continue to impose a 
disciplined approach to the use of 
subcontractors. Our 2009 cost savings have 
been progressively accelerated from our 
original target of £50 million in April to the £75 
million we are now projecting. We will take 
additional action in individual business units 
should demand conditions weaken further.
We are conﬁ dent that these actions should 
allow us to protect full year margins, and, 
dependent on market conditions in the 
second half of 2009, deliver our planned 
improvement of around 0.5% in adjusted 
operating margin.
Looking further ahead, our close long term 
relationships with major European customers, 
deep industry knowledge, and our innovative 
and ﬂ exible culture will provide a robust 
platform for future growth and drive long-
term, sustainable shareholder value. We aim 
to make Logica a trusted innovation partner 
for customers, a great company to work for, 
and a great company in which to invest.
We know that we rely on the goodwill of 
our customers, people and shareholders and 
I would like to thank them all for their support 
in 2008.

What makes Logica distinctive?
Business Review  Logica’s distinctive strengths
With our balanced exposure to different 
sectors and territories we are well placed 
to weather economic cycles. 
We have good exposure to defensive economic 
sectors. We are Europe’s ﬁ fth largest provider 
to the public sector. Together our Public 
Sector and Energy and Utilities revenue was 
46% in 2008. We are not overly reliant on 
speciﬁ c customers or contracts. No customer 
accounted for more than 2% of revenue 
in 2008.
We have acknowledged areas of strength 
in outsourcing and are successfully 
leveraging offshore resources into Europe. 
We are Europe’s recognised leader in 
applications management (source: PAC). We 
are leveraging our unrivalled infrastructure 
management expertise in the Nordics to win 
more business in other European territories. 
Local teams combine with Logica’s global 
delivery network to create a blended offering 
to European customers that incorporates their 
cultural and language requirements.
 For the ﬁ rst time, the number of offshore 
and nearshore resources being deployed 
on customer projects in mainland Europe 
exceeded those working in the UK.
We are committed to acting responsibly 
in the best interests of our customers 
and employees.
We are a company totally focused on 
delivering solutions that help our customers 
make the world a better place such as our 
work with emissions trading organisations 
around the world. In the long run, successful 
companies are also responsible companies; 
they attract and retain better quality people 
and they win more business.
Logica is a major European IT services 
player, both by revenue and by number of 
employees, with strong market positions 
in countries across Europe. 
With over 85% of our 40,000 employees in 
Europe we are a top-four IT services player by 
revenue in the Netherlands, France, Sweden, 
Finland and Portugal. Our scale in Europe is 
helping us to grow market share at the 
expense of smaller competitors. In 2008 we 
generated £3.6 billion in revenue, up by over 
£500 million on 2007 on a reported basis as a 
result of organic growth and European 
currency exposure.
We are close to our customers, 
understand their markets and are 
embedded in their cultures.
Our main focus is on large organisations with 
signiﬁ cant European operations. Among our 
focus accounts are many leading European 
names: including six of its top 10 utilities, 
nine out of 15 of its top banks and insurance 
companies, and ﬁ ve of its top 10 telecoms 
companies. 
 We have forged numerous longstanding 
relationships by working closely with our 
customers. Our top ﬁ ve clients in each 
industry sector have been with us for at least 
seven years; some for over 30 years.
We operate in a ﬂ exible, collaborative 
culture and create innovative, practical 
solutions tailored to customer needs. 
Our people are committed, intelligent and 
technically excellent. They work with our 
customers to build and run some of the most 
technically advanced IT applications in 
Europe including energy trading systems, 
satellite control systems and ﬁ nancial 
payments platforms.

What is our strategic plan?
In early 2008, we set out a clear plan for 
Logica over the period from 2008 to 2010.
Our three-year plan is based on a strategy 
that builds on Logica’s distinctive strengths 
with the intention of making us our customers’ 
most trusted innovation partner and delivering 
real value to our shareholders. 
 In essence, the plan will reduce our 
overhead costs and enhance our operational 
ﬂ exibility while investing in the future growth 
of the Company. Several months on, in more 
difﬁ cult economic conditions, we ﬁ rmly 
believe that this remains the right strategy 
for Logica. 
 We are integrating our assets more 
effectively by leveraging our scale and sector 
advantages and by making greater use of our 
offshore and nearshore facilities. We are 
driving down costs through increased 
efﬁ ciencies. The resulting savings, which 
we have accelerated since 2008, are being 
partly invested in customer-facing activities 
such as better account management and 
speciﬁ c high growth areas which offer good 
prospects for above-market revenue growth.
 We are adopting an organic approach, 
building on what we already have in place 
rather than depending on new acquisitions. 
We are aligning the business more directly 
with our key customers, who are, primarily, 
European governments, European-
headquartered multinationals and 
international businesses with a presence 
in Europe.
 We expect to be measured against our 
ability to increase our market share and 
deliver revenue growth    above the market 
in 2009 and 2010 and against our ability to 
deliver the cost savings that will protect 
margins and, dependent on market 
conditions, drive margin improvements. 
 This shift in focus ensures we develop 
as a distinctive European company with an 
internationally competitive cost structure 
offering real value to customers. This will 
bring tangible results over the longer term. 
Shareholders will beneﬁ t from improved 
returns as revenue growth outpaces the 
market and margins improve.

We are extending the duration of our 
already long-term relationships with 
customers, increasing customer 
satisfaction   . Strengthening our 
relationships with clients should over the 
longer term lead to revenue growth    
above the market. 
The change in the total number of people 
in our nearshore and offshore    centres.
Our clients should increasingly recognise 
us as a single company and contract with 
us as such. We should be realising the 
beneﬁ ts of operating as a single company, 
including winning more business, 
processing bids more efﬁ ciently and 
stafﬁ ng projects more rapidly. 
Our overall cost base in 2010 will reduce 
by £110 million over 2007 compared to our 
original target of £80 million  
 
. 
In 2008, organic revenue growth    was 
5%. We hired 65 salespeople, strengthened 
our outsourcing sales team, launched a 
consulting recruitment campaign and 
created a large deals team within 
Outsourcing Services. We identiﬁ ed key 
accounts, made initial investments in 
high growth areas and increased our 
high growth area pipeline. Our customer 
satisfaction    survey saw a 3% 
improvement over 2007.
At the end of 2008, we had over 5,000 
people deployed nearshore and 
offshore   , an increase of more than 
1,550 or 45% over 2007. We opened our 
second Indian centre in Chennai in 
September 2008 and had more than 900 
people in that location by the end of 2008.
In 2008, we made strong progress on 
cultural integration under a strengthened 
Executive Committee and operational 
team. We communicated extensively 
internally and launched new incentives to 
encourage people to deliver against our 
strategy. We introduced new bidding and 
resource planning tools.  
Cost savings    of £25 million delivered 
in 2008 with progress on HR and Finance 
shared service centres. Headcount 
reductions and UK property rationalisation 
are underway. Actions are in place to 
deliver future cost savings. 2008 adjusted

with expectations.

By improving cost competitiveness to 
allow us to invest in the future
In a competitive marketplace we are 
improving our customer offering, by adding 
value and lowering costs. Our increased 
operational efﬁ ciency will allow us to build 
market share whilst improving our margins. 
Margins improved this year in four out of six of 
our geographies. 
 With the creation of our outsourcing 
services business, we are also disclosing our 
outsourcing margins for the ﬁ rst time this 
year. At 6.6%, our outsourcing margins are 
only slightly below our Group margins.
 With cost rationalisation well under way, 
we have prepared a sound ﬁ nancial base to 
face adverse trading conditions. We made 
£25 million in cost savings    this year, 
ahead of our forecasts. In February 2009, 
we announced that we would accelerate our 
2009 cost savings by £25 million to £75 million 
and reinvest around £30 million of those 
savings.
 The UK business will generate the largest 
percentage of cost savings for the Group. We 
have reduced headcount and are rationalising 
our UK property portfolio, with nine buildings 
exited during 2008.
 The rationalisation and offshoring of HR 
and payroll processing is also under way. 
 Centralising procurement and streamlining 
our internal IT spend will control costs more 
effectively. We have targeted areas for 
common procurement and initiated 
discussions with suppliers. 
 By 2010 we expect to generate net savings 
(after re-investments of around £50 million) of 
around £60 million annually. This will bolster 
our operating margin and cushion the 
business against the impact of a severe 
downturn. Delivering our strategy should 
allow us to retain operating margins among 
the best of European peers.
P8
  See pages 8 to 9 for results so far, key 
metrics and what we expect beyond 2008.
As a result, we have grown our nearshore and 
offshore headcount    to over 5,000 in 2008. 
As a percentage of our workforce, this is up 
from 9% last year to 13%. Recruitment will 
continue as we extend our services and build 
capacity. In addition to centres in Bangalore 
(India) and the Philippines, we opened a new 
site in Chennai (India) in 2008 – with space 
for 1,500 people. Our centre in Morocco, 
which services our French speaking clients, 
has also grown. 
P8
  See pages 8 to 9 for results so far, key 
metrics and what we expect beyond 2008.
By developing a One Logica identity
Logica grew out of four successful businesses, 
each with its own skill sets and local identity. 
That respect for difference continues today. 
Indeed, it is one of the strengths of the Group 
that, for instance, Logica is very Finnish in 
Finland and very French in France. 
 We now also operate with the conﬁ dence 
of a truly European group, servicing our 
European customers around the world and 
operating under a single name, Logica. 
We are on a journey to strengthen the value of 
this brand across our markets. Logica today is 
cross-selling propositions and capabilities, 
drawing on its local account managers’ 
intimate knowledge of their customers.
 Building a coherent identity and operating 
efﬁ ciently as one company are interconnected 
objectives. The better we combine our 
services the more seamlessly we can 
integrate the organisation.
 We have strengthened the way we manage 
and lead the Group. We are introducing 
common tools and processes for tasks such 
as project bidding and resource planning 
which improve our customer responsiveness 
and reduce the costs of doing business 
across the Group. We expect the new 
bidding tool which is being rolled out to be 
used by over 1,500 people processing bids 
on over 36,000 projects. In 2009, we will have 
in place standardised tools for how we manage 
work processes. 
 Other initiatives are helping to bring about 
a change in culture and a stronger sense of 
shared identity. HR and ﬁ nance now report 
under a single global function. We are aligning 
top managers’ behaviour with Group 
performance through a new incentive 
scheme. We are changing the way we train 
our people by using the Logica University 
across the Group.
We are building on our distinctive 
qualities to forge a sustainable and 
proﬁ table business. 
By increasing customer focus
Logica works with a very broad range of 
customers right across Europe. There is 
great scope for developing our existing 
longstanding customer relationships by 
broadening and deepening them. In 2008, 
our top 50 customers accounted for 32% of 
revenue. As IT services customers reduce the 
number of suppliers working with them, this 
creates opportunities for us to engage more 
fully with them.
 Our customer satisfaction survey, 
involving more than 600 customers in over 
20 countries, showed increasing satisfaction 
compared to 2007. It indicated a clear 
recognition of the changes we are making to 
improve our products and services.
 In general, our customers are very happy 
with what we do for them but say that we 
could be selling our services more proactively. 
We increased our emphasis on selling in 
2008. We identiﬁ ed priority accounts, 
appointed 27 new account managers,
among 65 new salespeople, strengthened our 
outsourcing sales team, created a large deals 
team within Outsourcing Services and 
launched a consulting recruitment campaign. 
 We also invested in strengthening our 
propositions in high growth areas, which we 
expect to grow above the market. These are 
areas such as Business Intelligence, 
Intelligent Transport Solutions, Payments and 
Risk Assurance. Our effort has so far resulted 
in a doubling of our high growth area pipeline.
P8
  See pages 8 to 9 for results so far, key 
metrics and what we expect beyond 2008.
By accelerating blended delivery
We earn around 75% of our revenue in 
mainland Europe and we believe that, for 
many European customers, a blended model 
is their preferred route to deploy offshore 
resources, minimising the risk. We have 
continued to see a shift through 2008 to more 
acceptance of offshore in our markets and are 
speeding the development of our blend in 
support of that. For the ﬁ rst time, more than 
50% of resources deployed out of our 
nearshore and offshore centres are working 
with customers in mainland Europe.
 As customer focus has turned to managing 
costs, the argument that blended services 
can deliver cost reduction has gained traction. 
How are we executing our plan?
Business Review  Executing our plan 11
Do we have the right operational and 
ﬁ nancial resources to succeed?
Business Review   The right resources
Our strategy includes some restructuring to 
reduce overheads and replace legacy skills. 
We seek to utilise our offshore facilities in the 
ﬁ rst instance before recruiting or hiring 
additional subcontractors, with the choice 
dictated by local demand outlook. A net 
increase in our total employee headcount in 
2008 represented the effect of an increase in 
our offshore headcount, balanced against a 
small decrease in our onshore headcount. By 
the end of 2008, 13% of our employees were 
based in nearshore and offshore centres. 
 Our approach to resource allocation aims 
to maximise the utilisation of our existing staff 
while maintaining a reasonable level of 
subcontracting as a buffer against any future 
demand weakness. 
Enhanced ﬁ nancial position
In late 2008, we signiﬁ cantly strengthened the 
long-term ﬁ nancing of the Group.
 The severe shortage of funds in the 
debt markets made reﬁ nancing more 
challenging. Despite this, in November 2008, 
we successfully negotiated new long-term 
banking facilities of €500 million, maturing in 
2011 and 2013.
 We also placed an additional 135 million 
ordinary shares in December 2008, with gross 
proceeds amounting to around £90.5 million. 
In conjunction with this, the Board has 
reviewed Logica’s dividend policy, with 
the proposed full year dividend rebased to 
3.0p per share. The dividend is expected to 
be maintained at a level of around 3.0p for 
2009 with progressive increases in the 
dividend thereafter.
 The equity placing and dividend reduction 
reduce our reliance on debt and provide 
additional ﬂ exibility should debt markets 
remain difﬁ cult.
 We have signiﬁ cantly improved our cash 
management. In 2008, cash conversion 
was 148%. 
 The steps taken in 2008 ensure Logica 
has the appropriate ﬁ nancing in place to 
implement its strategic objectives. 
 The additional funding gives us greater 
ﬁ nancial ﬂ exibility and allows us to focus on 
improving long-term shareholder value with 
increased conﬁ dence.
Strategic focus
Communication and compensation are key 
elements to ensuring an organisation is ﬁ t 
to deliver. 
 Communication to align the entire 
organisation behind the strategy was a core 
activity during 2008. We held staff brieﬁ ngs 
to communicate our strategy and ensure that 
we put in place the means to deliver it locally. 
The message was rolled out directly by Andy 
Green to over a third of our employees. 
 Our remuneration for the senior teams has 
been reset as outlined further in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 65. 
The Partners’ Incentive Plan put in place in 
2008 identiﬁ es over 200 Partners who are 
managing the business at senior level and 
incentivises them according to Group 
performance. At other levels, our rewards and 
recognition programme has also changed.
 Employee satisfaction    improved over 
2007 as detailed on page 71, with 79% 
participating in our employee satisfaction 
survey.  
More ﬂ exibility in operational cost base 
Our business is about employing bright 
people and supplying the right ones to do the 
right things at the right time for customers.    
The single largest element of our cost base is 
employees. Around two-thirds of our cost 
base is salary related, with billable staff 
accounting for around 90% of this. 
 We deliver cost-effective services to 
customers by optimising the way we allocate 
those employees to customer projects. 
We balance the utilisation of full-time 
employees with the use of subcontractors. 
Recruitment is driven by attrition, growth and 
the need to align our skills base with changing 
customer requirements.
 We continued to manage our recruitment 
and utilisation carefully in the context of the 
economic downturn and to prioritise offshore 
and nearshore recruitment. Attrition    
remained unchanged through the ﬁ rst half of 
2008, decreasing to 13% towards the end of 
the year in the face of a more uncertain 
economic environment.
As shareholders would expect, 2008 
has been a year of transition. Signiﬁ cant 
actions during the year strengthened 
our strategic, operational and ﬁ nancial 
position. 
Strengthened management and 
leadership
Logica has a clear, transformative agenda. 
The strategy calls for decisive, concerted 
action on multiple fronts. Making that work 
depends on effective, coordinated leadership 
and strong governance. 
 Organisational changes and external 
appointments at Executive Committee level 
have clariﬁ ed responsibilities and signiﬁ cantly 
strengthened the leadership team.
 Responsibility for two of our ﬁ ve 
geographies moved to new leaders. In the 
Netherlands, ex-Atos Origin executive Wilbert 
Kieboom will head the Benelux region from 
early 2009. João Baptista joined as Chief 
Executive, International, in mid-2008, taking 
control of Logica’s operations outside its four 
main territories.
 Outsourcing Services was created as a 
new organisation with Proﬁ t and Loss 
responsibility under Jean-Marc Lazzari who 
joined from Unisys, with a goal to increase our 
growth rate in outsourcing.
 Global Operations was created to ensure 
we had the delivery capability in place in our 
nearshore and offshore locations and to 
ensure the industrialisation of our tools and 
processes. Craig Boundy joined us from 
Cable & Wireless to lead this function.
 Central Functions were given a wider remit, 
enabling us to effectively reduce our non-
sales and marketing overheads and transition 
some of our own internal functions to lower 
cost locations, with Stephen Kelly joining from 
the BBC to lead our HR function and Seamus 
Keating leading the Finance function.
 In addition, new changes below the 
Executive Committee level strengthened our 
focus, with a new Chief Information Ofﬁ cer 
(CIO), a new CEO in our Indian operations 
managing the growth of our presence there, 
and a newly created role of Global Innovation 
Director. Finally, we have appointed people to 
head up each of our large customer accounts, 
our high growth areas and consulting-led 
practices.
Ensuring the ﬂ exibility 
to improve long-term 
shareholder value 12 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008
Do we have the right strategy in 
the current market conditions?
Business Review   The right strategy
The economic environment has changed 
markedly since we set out our strategy in 
April 2008. 
We are ensuring we have the operational 
ﬂ exibility and the right ﬁ nancial resources in 
place to accommodate recessionary 
conditions.
 We continue to believe that Logica’s 
strategy is the right one. The worsening 
economic climate has, if anything, reinforced 
our determination to implement our plans. 
We are acting swiftly to implement cost 
reductions. We accelerated our cost savings 
programme in November 2008 and 
announced a further acceleration in 
February 2009.
 While the current economic climate will 
result in short-term declines in spending, 
we expect the IT services sector to 
outperform European GDP. Unlike the last 
downturn, IT spending now tends to be more 
intimately linked to the needs of business and 
plays an important role in delivering cost 
reductions. Regulatory and compliance 
demands will also increase over the next few 
years. Companies will turn to technology to 
meet those responsibilities. 
 Long-term growth in IT services will 
continue to be driven by growth in outsourcing. 
The increasing tendency for clients to transfer 
risk to fewer suppliers is delivering market 
share gains to the larger players, such as 
Logica.
 We are keeping the situation under review 
in the light of changing market conditions, 
but the core elements of our strategy remain 
unchanged. We will continue to bear down on 
costs and invest in the business to build on 
our position as a long-term trusted partner 
to customers.

How are we getting closer to customers?
Business Review  Getting closer to customers
During 2008, Logica was appointed as 
preferred outsourcing supplier to one of 
Sweden’s largest telecoms specialists. 
We also won the contract to provide an 
application project to handle all state 
administration in Finland.
 Logica has been a trusted partner for 
E.ON for more than 15 years. In 2003,
we took over support for the Company’s 
SAP-based applications. We raised its 
efﬁ ciency levels and consistently 
outperformed against tough targets. 
This led to the contract’s renewal in 2008.
 In the public sector we are trusted to 
develop and maintain sensitive information 
systems. In 2008, the UK Home Ofﬁ ce 
appointed Logica to develop, host and 
support information systems to protect 
children and vulnerable adults. 
 Following our work for the Crown 
Prosecution Services our relationship with 
the UK Ministry of Justice continues to 
strengthen. We are now delivering a secure 
performance management system for the 
Ofﬁ ce for Criminal Justice Reform which will 
improve the way the UK justice system 
operates. 
 KPN in the Netherlands is another example 
of where we continue to strengthen existing 
relationships. At the beginning of 2009,
we announced a multi-year outsourcing deal 
to manage their internal helpdesk service, 
underlining the conﬁ dence KPN has in Logica.    
During 2008, KPN awarded Logica with the 
application management of their strategic 
network information as well as outsourcing 
contracts of their HR shared services centre.
 We said we would work to get closer 
to our customers. The results so far are 
very promising and are something that the 
entire organisation is aligned to help win 
and deliver – whether they are in global 
operations trying to understand how a 
German customer might approach a 
blended delivery contract, or in outsourcing 
structuring a large project with their Nordic 
account manager colleagues.
 This is a One Logica strategy and we are 
all working together to improve our market 
share and deliver revenue growth above the 
market – at sustainable and growing margins.
We are winning consulting-led contracts 
We are also developing a more visible 
international consultancy presence to support 
our focus on more consulting-led 
transformational deals. Our pragmatic 
approach and industry awareness allows us 
to offer bespoke solutions that deliver tangible 
customer beneﬁ ts. We took on 35 senior 
consultancy leaders during 2008 and are 
winning more consulting-led projects. Our 
recent win with EADS which involved our local 
capabilities from six different countries is a 
good example of what we have achieved in 
this area.
We are winning blended delivery deals 
against our international competitors
Our understanding of local conditions has 
resulted in some important contract wins 
involving blended delivery.
 When Volvo Cars centralised its testing 
activities in Gothenburg it chose Logica to 
provide performance-testing services. 
This contract has now been renewed and 
extended to encompass comprehensive 
testing. Logica’s ability to deliver onshore 
and offshore services under its blended 
sourcing model was decisive for Volvo in 
awarding the contract.
 In Norway, Logica has signed a ﬁ ve-year 
contract to provide global Shared Services to 
StatoilHydro. With StatoilHydro seeking to 
internationalise its activities we were able to 
demonstrate that it had the global reach to 
support it in all jurisdictions. The new contract 
extends a relationship going back to 2003.
We are winning larger outsourcing deals 
and renewing major contracts
Our scale, capability and reach allow us to 
compete effectively for major opportunities 
and larger customers. A three-year 
application services contract for Michelin was 
the largest such project awarded in Europe 
this year. It builds on our close, longstanding 
relationship with the international tyremaker. 
We were also shortlisted for a major project 
with the European Space Agency and are 
expanding on our previous work with them.
 We have been winning some signiﬁ cant 
contracts in the Nordics. With our strong local 
knowledge and global capabilities we are well 
placed to assist Nordic companies as they 
seek to outsource more activities. Logica was 
the top performer in the annual Outsourcing 
Service Provider Performance Study 2008 in 
the Nordics, gaining the highest customer 
rating in six out of seven categories.
Our sales and marketing investments 
are going into areas where we believe 
market demand will be strong and where 
we can build on our technical excellence, 
innovative ideas and our deep industry 
understanding.
The real beneﬁ ts of these investments will 
obviously be seen over the longer term but 
the results so far are encouraging – like the 
300% increase in the pipeline value in the 
Nordics or the 200% increase in the number 
of deals signed with a value of over £20 million 
in 2008.
Getting the beneﬁ ts of European scale
More contracts are gravitating towards the 
larger suppliers as customers increasingly opt 
for closer relationships with fewer suppliers. 
As a major supplier in each of our four main 
territories we are beneﬁ ting from that trend. 
We believe this is contributing to a growing 
market share in a number of countries.
Pierre Audoin Consultants (PAC) assessed 
Logica at the top of its table of European 
applications management in 2008, ahead of 
Accenture, Capgemini, IBM Global Services 
and Atos Origin.
We are winning contracts in the high 
growth areas we identiﬁ ed as areas for 
investment
Even in times when overall market growth is 
modest there are areas of high growth. And 
as part of our new strategy we have identiﬁ ed 
a number of such areas and concentrated our 
investments in these. We can already see the 
result of this in a doubling of our high growth 
areas pipeline. We recently announced our 
ﬁ rst major win in the Business Intelligence 
area with Total.

is increasing pricing pressure, we have been 
able to respond by offering blended delivery 
and agreeing more efﬁ cient ways of working 
with our clients. 
 We work with a very broad range of 
customers across Europe. In 2008, our top 
50 customers accounted for 32% of revenue. 
We will continue to develop our existing 
relationships, especially with our largest 
customers. As IT services customers reduce 
the number of suppliers working with them, 
we have an opportunity to engage more fully 
with our customers. 
Progress on Programme 
for Growth
In early 2008, we set out a clear plan for 
where we expected to take the Group over the 
period from 2008 to 2010. Our three-year plan 
was based on a strategy that builds on 
Logica’s distinctive strengths with the 
intention of making us our customers’ most 
trusted innovation partner and delivering real 
value to our shareholders. We continued to 
make good progress in each of the four areas 
of our plan (Focus for Growth, Accelerate 
Blended Delivery, One Logica and 
Competitive Costs) through the fourth quarter, 
which resulted in delivery against the metrics 
and targets we set for the Group for 2008. The 
generation of cost savings is being used to 
fund reinvestment in the business, with the 
largest portion to be made to increase our 
sales and marketing capability under the 
Focus for Growth umbrella. 
Focus for Growth
Strengthening our relationships with our 
clients with improved account management 
and focusing our investments in areas where 
we expect customers to continue to spend 
resulted in signiﬁ cant new order intake in 
2008. 
 In addition to extending the Outsourcing 
Services organisation across the Group, a key 
activity in the fourth quarter was ensuring our 
large deal hub was in place to guarantee that 
the best resources are being deployed to win 
large new deals. At the end of 2008, we had 
also substantially staffed the account teams 
targeting our 57 focus accounts, having 
recruited 27 account managers. Overall, we 
strengthened our sales and marketing 
capability with the addition of 65 sales people 
during the course of 2008.
 The consulting recruitment campaign 
launched in the ﬁ rst half was slowed 
On a reported basis, Group 
revenue was up 17% to £3,588 
million (2007 actual: £3,073 
million), beneﬁ ting from both 
organic growth and currency 
effects. This represented pro 
forma growth  of 5%, which 
is ahead of our guidance. 
Orders for the year were 11% ahead of 2007 
on a pro forma basis, resulting in a book to 
bill    of 106% (2007: 100%). Adjusted operating 
proﬁ t    was £267 million (2007 actual: £208 
million), representing an adjusted operating 
margin of 7.5% (2007 actual: 6.8%). Operating 
proﬁ t of £86 million (2007 actual: £110 million) 
reﬂ ected higher exceptional items (mainly 
associated with our Programme for Growth) 
of £92 million. Basic adjusted EPS was 12.3p 
(2007 actual: 10.2p). Net cash inﬂ ow from 
trading operations was £396 million, leading 
to cash conversion    of 148%. Closing 
net debt was £438 million (£483 million at 
31 December 2007), with net debt/EBITDA 
at the end of 2008 of 1.3x. In line with the 
proposal we announced in December 2008 
to rebase the full year dividend to 3.0p, the 
proposed ﬁ nal dividend is 0.6p (2007: 3.5p).
Market overview
We had a strong fourth quarter order intake 
and we have continued to sign signiﬁ cant 
orders into the ﬁ rst quarter of 2009. Our 
increased investment in sales and marketing 
has led to the overall volume of larger 
opportunities in our pipeline increasing, 
particularly in Outsourcing Services (which 
represented 32% of revenue    in 2008). The 
UK Public Sector, Norway and Finland all had 
a particularly strong close to 2008 on orders.
 Changes to European GDP forecasts for 
2009 now suggest that the IT services market 
will decline modestly in 2009, with more 
weakness expected in markets with a larger 
ﬁ nancial services and general industrial 
exposure. Public Sector, Energy and Utilities, 
and Telecoms & Media (which collectively 
accounted for 53% of Group revenue in 2008) 
remain robust. Our broad spread across 
sectors, as well as geographies underpins our 
conﬁ dence in our ability to perform better 
than the market in 2009 despite the weakened 
environment.
 Appetite for using blended delivery has 
increased, particularly amongst our 
continental European customers. While there

  For our 2009 outlook, see the 
CEO’s review on page 3. 23
We had previously accelerated our forecast 
2009 savings to £60 million (against an initial 
target of £50 million) as we rationalise our IT 
and advance our cost savings in this area. 
Given movements in exchange rates and the 
progress we have made so far, we expect to 
be able to deliver a further £15 million, leading 
to total 2009 cost savings of £75 million, of 
which we intend to invest around £30 million 
back into the business until the economic 
climate is clearer. Similarly, we now expect 
annualised 2010 cost savings to be £110 
million (compared to £80 million previously), 
with £50 million to be reinvested.
 Total costs to achieve these cost savings 
will increase from £110 million to £145 million, 
of which £61 million are expected to be 
incurred in 2009. The increased costs are 
attributable to movements in exchange rates 
and a more cautious view on the UK 
commercial property market, and will allow 
for capacity reductions where demand has 
fallen because of the economic downturn.

common strategy, common processes and 
a common focus on our customers. Clients 
are noticing a more ambitious sales led 
organisation. They are commenting on the 
way that Logica teams around the world work 
well together and collaborate with their teams. 
  Our major initiative in the fourth quarter 
was to deﬁ ne a consistent operational model 
to which we will move during 2009. Our 
clients increasingly recognise us as a single 
company and contract with us as such. We 
are beginning to achieve the beneﬁ ts of 
operating as a single company, including 
winning more business, processing bids more 
efﬁ ciently and stafﬁ ng projects more rapidly. 
 Common tools and processes are 
improving our customer responsiveness and 
reducing the costs of doing business across 
the Group. Our new bidding tool is expected 
to be used by over 1,500 people processing 
over 36,000 bids. Our new resourcing tool will 
also create signiﬁ cant efﬁ ciencies. In 2008, 
17,300 jobs were created on our resourcing 
tool, with 40,000 online job applications 
made. In 2009, we will also have in place more 
standardised tools for how we do pieces of 
work, which will make it easier to work across 
the organisation. These changes have the 
additional beneﬁ t of allowing us to ensure 
consistency and thus manage risk effectively 
across the Group, building on our strong 
reputation for risk management. 
 We have strengthened the way we manage 
and lead the Group, with the addition of ﬁ ve 
new hires at the Executive Committee level. In 
the second half, we announced that Stephen 
Kelly would join the Group to lead the HR 
function and that Wilbert Kieboom would join 
to lead the Benelux business.
 The 2008 full year results will provide the 
basis for the ﬁ rst award under our new 
Partnership Incentive Plan to ensure 
incentives are aligned with the interests of 
shareholders. 
Competitive costs
In 2008, we delivered £25 million of cost 
savings through action to reduce non-billable 
headcount and to exit UK property. We 
reinvested £20 million of this back into the 
business, with the bulk of the investment 
supporting an acceleration of our blended 
delivery capability. 
 Restructuring costs to achieve savings 
were £84 million in 2008, as a result of 
movements in exchange rates and as we took 
a more cautious view on the UK commercial 
property market.
somewhat in the second half but we added 
some key skills in the areas of Energy and 
Utilities and Service Oriented Architecture 
(SOA). We intend to continue building up our 
consulting capability in line with a more 
cautious view of the market. Overall, we 
recruited 35 senior consultancy leaders in 
2008 against our original target of 45. We 
continue to expect to grow our consulting 
organisation in line with our plans.
 In order to maximise the value for our 
customers, we focused investments in our 13 
high growth areas, putting in place practice 
leaders and clearly deﬁ ning the value 
propositions in each area through 2008. Over 
the course of 2008, our high growth area 
pipeline more than doubled.  Among our wins 
is  our recently announced Business 
Intelligence project with Total.
Accelerate Blended Delivery
In 2008 we decreased our number of onshore 
employees whilst increasing the number of 
offshore employees. We expect this trend to 
continue in 2009 towards our goal of 8,000 
people deployed in our nearshore and 
offshore locations by the end of 2009. 
 Headcount in our nearshore and offshore 
centres increased from 3,450 in April 2008 to 
over 5,000 at the end of 2008, representing 
around 13% of our total workforce. This was a 
net addition of around 1,550 in the second 
half of the year. Our quarterly run-rate 
increased over the course of 2008, as we 
accelerated our recruitment efforts in India. 
India remains our largest centre with 3,700 
people, with our second centre in Chennai, 
which opened in September, at almost 900 
in February 2009. We are also continuing to 
grow our Moroccan capability and leverage 
this into French accounts. 
 In 2008, we saw a marked change in the 
pace at which our European customers were 
adopting offshore. For the ﬁ rst time, the 
absolute number of offshore resources being 
deployed on customer projects into mainland 
Europe exceeded those working into the UK. 
The UK has improved its ratio of offshore 
heads from 17% in April to 23% by year end 
and is well on its way to exceeding the target 
of 25% we set for 2009. The increased 
numbers of larger bids which now include an 
embedded offshore component resulted in 
37 new customer engagements in India.

Full year revenue growth was ahead of expectations at 5%, with some slowing in the second half in markets more exposed to Financial Services 
and IDT. The Nordics, the UK and the International businesses delivered the most consistent revenue growth through 2008, while France, the 
Netherlands and Germany slowed more through the second half and into the fourth quarter. In the Nordics, strength was driven by good growth in 
Norway and Finland.

At a Group level, Public Sector and Energy and Utilities continued to drive growth in 2008. In these sectors, we had revenue growth across all 
geographies except International. In IDT, a strong French performance offset weakness elsewhere. As expected, there was weaker momentum 
in the Financial Services business into the second half, with challenging markets in the UK and the Netherlands being the most signiﬁ cant 
contributors to the decline. Telecoms was stable, reﬂ ecting a mixed performance across our geographies in 2008. 25

Adjusted operating proﬁ t before exceptional items (mainly associated with the Programme for Growth) and amortisation of intangibles initially 
recognised on acquisition was £267 million. A £25 million increase in adjusted operating proﬁ t in the UK was the largest single contributor to the 
improvement in proﬁ tability.
 Adjusted operating margin was 7.5%. We saw a margin improvement in four of our six geographies, with lower margins in the Nordics and the 
Netherlands compared to last year. Margins in the Netherlands reﬂ ected a higher level of subcontracting to give greater cost structure ﬂ exibility, 
while margins in the Nordics were somewhat diluted following a signiﬁ cant component of pass through hardware revenue from infrastructure 
management projects. First half rebranding costs of £5 million were distributed among the geographies. This was offset in the second half by the 
£5 million of net cost savings from the £25 million generated by the Programme for Growth, with the majority of the cost savings (£20 million) being 
reinvested in 2008.  26 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

Operating proﬁ t was £86 million (2007: £110 million) mainly as a result of increased exceptional items associated with the Programme for Growth.
 Net exceptional items were £92 million (2007: £23 million). £84 million was associated with the Programme for Growth.  The  largest component 
of this was restructuring charges incurred for employee redundancies and exiting property leases, particularly in the UK where we initiated our 
restructuring earliest. A further £8 million relates to the WM-data integration.
 Amortisation of intangible assets from acquisitions was £89 million (2007: £75 million). The higher charge was mainly a result of movements in 
exchange rates. 27

In January 2008, we created a new Outsourcing Services division which became operational in key European geographies from Q1 2008 and was 
rolled out more widely by the end of the year.  Outsourcing Services revenue and proﬁ t will be reported from 2009. 
 Outsourcing Services represents just under a third of 2008 revenue and incorporates around 9,000 employees working in our onshore, 
nearshore and offshore centres, with operations in 16 countries around the Group.
 Applications Management represented 47% of 2008 revenue. Having seen signiﬁ cant growth in 2008, Infrastructure Management represented 
47%, with BPO at 6%. 
 Adjusted operating margin in this business reﬂ ects our strength in applications management and other value-added outsourcing, with 
Outsourcing Services margins of 6.6%. 
 Book to bill for the year was 116%. Our investment in sales and marketing has resulted in an increased order backlog in Outsourcing Services 
and a 50% increase in the pipeline since the ﬁ rst half, with a signiﬁ cant increase in the volume of opportunities with our focus accounts. At the end 
of 2008, our backlog and secured revenue covered over 80% of expected 2009 revenue. During the year, we contested more large deals, more 
than doubling the number of wins with a value of over £20 million. We have around 150 deals greater than £5 million in the current pipeline. We 
continue to expect Outsourcing Services to be the fastest growing element of our revenue going forward, rising to 35% of total revenue from the 
2008 level of 32%.  28 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

Revenue was up 7% on a pro forma basis to £1,000 million. Sweden represented 54% of our Nordic revenue in 2008 (2007: 55%). Adjusted 
operating proﬁ t was £88 million, giving an adjusted operating margin of 8.8%.
 Double digit growth in the Public Sector was driven by a strong performance in Finland as well as ongoing revenue in the defence sector in 
Sweden. In IDT, the more challenging economic environment in Sweden resulted in a slight decline over 2007. In other sectors, double digit growth 
in Utilities and Financial Services with customers such as StatoilHydro and Swedbank more than offset a continuing decline in telecoms licence 
revenue in Telecoms and Media sector. 
 Lower telecoms licence revenue did, however, have some dilutive impact on margin, when coupled with higher pass-through revenue due to 
growth in infrastructure outsourcing projects. In light of slower fourth quarter growth in the Swedish market, we have taken action to reduce 
Swedish headcount. This will provide extra protection should the economy slow further in 2009. 
 Book to bill was 112%, driven by strong order intake in Norway and Finland in the second half of the year. The momentum in these countries, 
combined with increasing numbers of larger opportunities using our blended delivery model in the applications management and infrastructure 
management areas across the Nordics, has resulted in a tripling of the pipeline in the Nordics since early 2008. 29

Revenue was up 5% on a pro forma basis to £721 million. Adjusted operating proﬁ t was £55 million, resulting in an adjusted operating margin 
of 7.6%. 
 Despite a weakening in the economic environment and our signiﬁ cant exposure to IDT customers, our French business showed good growth in 
the second half. IDT revenue was up 8% in 2008, with growth in outsourcing revenue from a signiﬁ cant contract signed with Michelin in the ﬁ rst 
half of the year.
 In Financial Services, revenue was stable with ongoing outsourcing work focused on cost reduction protecting us somewhat from the impact of 
lower spending among customers. 
 Revenue in other sectors was up 5% overall, with revenue from utilities customers within the Energy and Utilities sector remaining particularly 
strong. Public Sector revenue was also up, with strong growth in the second half of the year. Our French consulting headcount continues to 
represent the largest component of our overall consulting capability. While we saw some slowing in the number of opportunities in this area, 
consulting growth continued to be in line with overall French revenue growth in 2008.
 The improvement in adjusted operating margin was a result of increased productivity levels and cost control in business units and central 
functions, and compared well against last year when we had a signiﬁ cant one-off cost related to management changes. Our overall cost base 
beneﬁ ted from slower onshore recruitment, as we further increased our offshore and nearshore support into our French client base from Morocco 
and India.

The UK business has shown strong growth over 2007, with revenue up 7% on a pro forma basis to £710 million. Adjusted operating proﬁ t for the 
year was £55 million, resulting in a signiﬁ cant improvement in adjusted operating margin to 7.8%.
 The Public Sector, which represented 58% of revenue in 2008, was up 11% in 2008. Phasing of contracts and a weak 2007 comparative 
resulted in second half revenue up 14% in the Public Sector. 
 Energy and Utilities continued to be our second largest sector and was up 4% for the year, with second half growth slowing following a very 
strong ﬁ rst half. 
 Across the other commercial sectors, steps taken earlier in the year to diversify our customer base resulted in overall revenue growth of 2%. 
Financial Services, down 13%, continues to be our most challenging sector, reﬂ ecting a reduction in the volume of time and materials work.
 The UK business continued to deliver increased volumes of work employing resources from our nearshore and offshore centres. More than 
25% of resources being deployed onto UK contracts are expected to come from these centres in 2009.
 The strong improvement in adjusted operating margin mainly reﬂ ected a favourable comparison with 2007 when we incurred provisions relating 
to cost overruns on a UK contract. There was also some beneﬁ t from a return to stability in the commercial sectors and the Programme for Growth 
activities in the second half of the year. The reduction in ofﬁ ce space and targeted redundancies will deliver substantial savings to overhead costs, 
with a headcount reduction of approximately 200 employees and nine buildings exited through 2008. 
 Book to bill for the year was 99%. The improvements we have made in our sales and marketing capability have meant that we had good 
order intake across all sectors in 2008, including a £43 million, four-year contract with the Home Ofﬁ ce for the new Independent Safeguarding 
Authority Scheme and the Criminal Records Bureau and our win with BT earlier in the year. We enter 2009 with a signiﬁ cantly stronger pipeline 
than a year ago. 31

Revenue was up 2% on a pro forma basis to £573 million. Adjusted operating proﬁ t was £43m, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 7.5%. 
 As expected, a weaker economy and signiﬁ cant upheaval in the Financial Services sector in the Netherlands were contributors to lower 
customer spending, contributing to revenue declines in both the IDT and Financial Services sectors in 2008. These trends are expected to 
continue into 2009.  Our Public Sector, Energy and Utilities and Telecoms sectors, which accounted for approximately 51% of revenue in 2008, 
grew 12%. Public Sector showed continued strength, signing contracts with the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. Telecoms 
was also an important driver of growth, following a number of wins with KPN through the year. 
 We expect the business in the Netherlands to see particular beneﬁ t as we implement a consistent operational model across the Group. 
Lower overheads, greater centralisation of billable resources and increased use of our blended delivery model are expected to address some of 
the labour market issues and use of subcontracting which affected margin in 2008. Our success in positioning higher levels of offshore and 
nearshore resource with these clients to respond to customer cost reduction targets will be particularly important in 2009.
 Book to bill of 109% reﬂ ected good order intake in Energy and Utilities and Public Sector. We continue to expect to win more outsourcing 
business as customers continue to reduce their cost base.

employees towards the end of the ﬁ rst quarter of 2008. Adjusted operating proﬁ t was £12 million, resulting in an adjusted operating margin 
of 5.6%.
 The German business improved margins for a second consecutive year, with good growth in Energy and Utilities, IDT and Public Sector. 
Financial Services revenue decreased following the implementation of a major payments infrastructure project in 2007.

adjusted operating margin of 4%.
 Portugal accounted for approximately 26% of International revenue, with Portuguese customers remaining the largest contributor to Energy 
and Utilities revenue. Australia continued to be an important contributor to International revenue, alongside Belgium and Brazil. 
 Brazilian growth contributed to stronger Energy and Utilities revenue over last year. Financial Services was lower than 2007 following 
completion of a project in Asia.
 Restructuring in our Portuguese business, a reduction in subcontractors and improved utilisation in a number of geographies, were positive 
contributors to margin. However, improvements were partially offset by investments to support new business with European clients in North 
America and Asia.

Business Review  Financial Review
Facilities
In November 2008, Logica signed new 
long-term banking facilities of €500 million  
with maturity in 2011 and 2013, replacing 
around half of the Group’s existing facilities. 
The new ﬂ oating rate, multi currency facilities 
are provided by a group of 11 of Logica’s 
European relationships banks. The new 
facilities comprise a €200 million, 3-year 
facility, which will mature in November 2011, 
and a €300 million, 5-year revolving facility, 
which will mature in November 2013. These 
facilities replaced Logica’s existing £330 
million facility (due to mature in September 
2010) and its £150 million facility (due to 
mature in November 2010). The Group’s other 
medium-term facilities are unchanged, being 
a €348 million term loan (due to mature in 
September 2010) and a £25 million facility 
(due to expire in April 2010). The covenants 
remain the same as under the Group’s 
previous facilities. The facilities now in place 
amount to £848 million.
Dividend
The Board has reviewed Logica’s dividend 
policy as announced in December 2008. The 
Board has proposed a ﬁ nal dividend of 0.6p 
making a 2008 full year dividend of 3p per 
share, compared to a full year dividend of 
5.8p for 2007. It is expected that the 2009 
dividend will be maintained at a level of 
around 3p, with progressive increases in the 
dividend thereafter.

Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer
Share issue
On 16 December 2008, Logica plc issued 
135,000,000 ordinary shares of 10p each. 
These shares were placed with investors at a 
price of 67p per share and represented, in 
aggregate, approximately 9.2% of the current 
issued ordinary share capital. Based on the 
placing price, the gross proceeds amounted 
to £90.5 million. The proceeds from the equity 
placing were used to reduce debt.
Cash ﬂ ow and balance sheet
Net cash inﬂ ow from trading operations 
was £396 million. This is equivalent to cash 
conversion of 148%. This much improved 
cash ﬂ ow arose form better cash 
management within the business.
 Closing net debt was £438 million, 
including a £114 million increase due to 
changes in exchange rates (£483 million at 
31 December 2007), with net debt/EBITDA at 
the end of 2008 of 1.3x. We currently expect 
net debt/EBITDA to be around 1.2x at the end 
of 2009. 
Post balance sheet items 
On 21 August 2006, Logica announced a 
public offer to acquire the entire share capital 
of WM-data. At the time of the completion 
of the WM-data transaction, Logica had 
acquired 95.33% of the Company’s issued 
share capital.
 The provisional amount to be paid for 
each share and convertible bond to acquire 
the remaining 4.67% minority interest is 
SEK 26.70 plus statutory interest (2% plus 
the Swedish Central Bank’s reference rate). 
The total redemption price plus interest 
(accrued from 25 October 2006) for the 
shares is expected to amount to 
£48.4 million (SEK 602 million) and is 
being paid to minority shareholders in a 
series of payments beginning on 23 February 
2009 and is expected to complete no later 
than 10 March 2009.
 On 2 February 2009, Logica also 
announced the sale of its training subsidiary 
Integrata to the German buy-in managers 
Ingmar J. Rath, Dr Andreas Dahmen and 
Gerhard Wächter, together with Private Equity 
company Cornerstone Capital.
Employees
At 31 December 2008, we had 39,937 
employees (31 December 2007: 38,740). 
The net addition of just under 1,200 
employees reﬂ ected the net effect of 
recruiting over 8,500 new employees, 
offset against employee churn through 
annualised voluntary attrition    and actions 
taken to reduce non-billable headcount. A 
slowing of attrition through the second half 
reﬂ ected an uncertain economic environment. 
At the end of December, attrition was at 13% 
for the Group (31 December 2007: 16%). 
 In 2008 we decreased our number of 
onshore employees whilst increasing the 
number of offshore employees. We expect 
this trend to continue in 2009 towards our 
goal of 8,000 people deployed in our 
nearshore and offshore locations by the 
end of 2009. 
Taxation 
The effective tax rate, before share of 
post-tax proﬁ ts from associates, exceptional 
items, mark-to-market loss on convertible 
bonds, and amortisation of intangible assets 
initially recognised on acquisition, was 23% 
(2007: 18%). The effective tax rate for 2009 is 
expected to remain at around 23%.
 The total tax charge for the year was 
£5 million (2007: £5 million).
Acquisitions
In addition to the buy-out of the EDP minority 
interest in Edinfor for £42 million, the Group 
made a small number of acquisitions in the 
Nordic region throughout the year. The 
operations and ﬁ nancial reporting of these 
businesses have been integrated with the 
Group’s pre-existing Nordics businesses and 
are detailed in the notes to the accounts. Strong governance and 
responding to a changing 
environment remain our 
guiding principles.

Governance
Another important feature this year has been 
our determination to reﬁ nance our outstanding 
borrowings as promptly as possible, given 
the restricted availability of funds as a result 
of the credit crunch. Following our successful 
reﬁ nancing of €500 million of debt in 
November 2008, we had a dialogue with our 
largest shareholders directly in December and 
were very pleased by their positive and rapid 
response, which led to our raising £90 million 
of new equity.
At the same time, in order to underpin our 
balance sheet, we proposed a rebasing of 
the dividend to a lower level of around 3.0p 
per share for both 2008 and 2009 (compared 
to 5.8p in 2007). This will conserve around 
£56 million in cash over the course of 2009. 
We expect to return the Company to a 
progressive dividend policy thereafter. 
The AGM in April will mark the retirement 
from the Board of Non-Executive Directors 
Wim Dik and Gérard Philippot. I would like to 
thank them very much for their wise counsel 
over their many years in the Company and 
particularly for their assistance in the last 
18 months in building one united Logica. 
I am delighted that Sergio Giacoletto and 
Frédéric Rose have agreed to join the Logica 
Board to replace Wim and Gérard. These new 
Directors, whose biographies are on page 37, 
deepen our focus on our European 
geographies, customers and partners. 
They will also bring signiﬁ cant strategic and 
commercial experience to the Board based 
on many years in senior executive positions 
in innovative services businesses.
Developments in early 2009 have 
demonstrated the importance shareholders 
place on strong governance and on 
companies that continue to look ahead and 
respond to a changing environment. These 
remain our guiding principles at Logica for 
2009 and beyond.
David Tyler
Chairman
Dear Shareholder, 
2008 was a year marked with 
change, both at Logica and in 
the external environment we 
faced as a company. 
At Logica, Andy Green became CEO 
in January 2008, and has made some 
major changes to the business. He has 
introduced a new strategy for the Group, 
reinvigorated the top management team, 
enhanced the morale of our employees 
and given our customers reasons for 
additional conﬁ dence in Logica. In addition, 
ﬁ nancial performance has improved – with 
revenue growth    up 5%*, and adjusted 
operating margin    up from 6.9%* in 2007 
to 7.5% in 2008. 
 I would like to thank all our employees for 
their contribution to our progress this year.
In the face of the economic downturn, 
the IT services market is becoming tougher. 
However, we see evidence that European 
companies and governments will continue 
to need the IT skills we bring to them. 
We aim to make Logica a stronger European 
company which creates innovative and 
practical solutions tailored to the needs 
of our customers and responsive to the 
environment they face. We believe we are 
capable of competing effectively against 
any of our global peers.
We want to create a partnership style 
culture among the senior management group 
at Logica. This is designed to ensure that this 
critical group of people take full responsibility 
for running the business on behalf of shareholders 
and to align their rewards accordingly. The 
introduction of the concept of ‘Logica Partners’ 
affects both the way careers are managed 
and the way Partners are paid through a 
Partners’ Incentive Plan and a Performance 
Multiplier Plan. Out of our 40,000 employees, 
we have now chosen some 200 to be Partners 
(including 25 Managing and Executive 
Partners). They are all eligible to participate 
in the Partners’ Incentive Plan, which was 
established with effect from January 2008. 
An integral part of the Partners’ Incentive Plan 
is the Performance Multiplier Plan which will 
provide additional awards to Managing and 
Executive Partners for the achievement of 
ambitious EPS targets. We will be seeking 
formal approval for the Performance Multiplier 
Plan at the AGM in April.

Share Capital
The share capital of the Company, issued 
and unissued, consists entirely of one class 
of ordinary shares of 10p each. Each share 
ranks equally and carries the same rights to 
vote and receive dividends and other 
distributions declared, made or paid by the 
Company. No restrictions exist on the transfer 
or holding of securities in the Company under 
the Articles of Association.
 At the AGM held on 14 May 2008, the 
shareholders approved a resolution giving 
the Company authority to purchase up to 
145,883,289 of its ordinary shares. No shares 
were purchased during the year under this 
authority which will expire at the forthcoming 
AGM to be held on 30 April 2009. Accordingly, 
at the 2009 AGM, the Directors will be seeking 
to renew the authority to make market 
purchases of up to a maximum of 10% of the 
issued share capital of the Company. At the 
present time the Company has no plans to 
exercise this authority.
 The issued ordinary share capital was 
increased by 140,713,442 ordinary shares 
during the year as a result of the issue of 
135,000,000 new ordinary shares by way of 
an equity placing on 16 December 2008 and 
the issue of 5,713,442 ordinary shares on the 
exercise of options under the Company’s 
Share Plans including a small number under 
Liquidity Agreements arising out of the 
acquisition of Unilog S.A. in 2005. At 
31 December 2008 the issued ordinary share 
capital totalled 1,598,359,521 shares.
P42
  Details of shareholders with a signiﬁ cant 
and disclosable holding are set out in 
the substantial shareholdings note on 
page 42
The Company offers a number of share plans 
for its employees. The rights attached to 
ordinary shares which are the subject of 
awards within any of the Company’s share 
plans are not available until any share award 
or option granted is exercised and the shares 
are allotted or transferred to that awardee. 
The Trustee of each of the Company’s 
employee beneﬁ t trusts is obliged to act 
in the best interests of the share plans’ 
beneﬁ ciaries. At General Meetings, the 
Trustee may exercise discretion and vote in 
respect of shares held in the Trust although 
they may not always choose to do so. Where 
shares are beneﬁ cially held by an employee 
within a share plan they may direct the 
Trustee to vote on their behalf.
Principal Activities
Throughout the year, the Group was in the 
business of providing information technology 
services, concentrating on:
  the marketing, design, production, 
integration and maintenance of custom-
built software and associated hardware 
systems integration
  the outsourcing of information technology 
and business services
  consultancy, applications management 
and project management in the ﬁ eld of 
information technology
  the design, development, implementation 
and marketing of software products and 
the reusable elements of applications 
software, called systems kernels.
Results and Dividends
Consolidated revenue amounted to 
£3,588 million, compared with £3,073 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2007. The 
proﬁ t before tax was £44 million compared 
with £84 million for the year ended 31 
December 2007. The proﬁ t attributable to 
equity holders of the parent company was 
£39 million compared with £170 million for 
the previous year. Basic earnings per share 
from total operations were 2.7p (2007: 11.4p). 
Adjusted basic earnings per share from 
continuing operations were 12.3p (2007: 
10.2p). Net debt at 31 December 2008 stood 
at £438 million (2007: £483 million).
 The Directors have proposed a ﬁ nal 
dividend of 0.6p per share (2007: 3.5p per 
share) which, when taken with the interim 
dividend of 2.4p (2007: 2.3p per share) paid 
to shareholders on 17 October 2008 will 
amount to a dividend for the year of 3.0p 
(2007: 5.8p per share). If approved, the 
ﬁ nal dividend will be paid on 1 May 2009 to 
eligible shareholders on the register at close 
of business on 14 April 2009.
 In December 2008, the Board reviewed the 
Company’s dividend policy and it is now 
expected that the 2009 dividend will be 
maintained at a level of around 3.0p per share, 
with progressive increases thereafter.

Creditor Payment Policy and Practice
The Companies Act 1985 (Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 1997 (Statement of Payment 
Practice) require the Company to make a 
statement of its policy and practice on the 
payment of creditors. The Company and its 
subsidiaries seek the best possible terms 
from suppliers appropriate to their businesses 
and, in placing orders, give consideration to 
quality, delivery, price and the terms of 
payment which will be agreed with suppliers 
when the details of each transaction are 
agreed. The Company and its subsidiaries will 
continue to honour their contractual and other 
legal obligations and to pay creditors on the 
dates agreed in contract and purchase 
orders. At 31 December 2008, the number 
of days of annual purchases represented 
by year-end trade creditors for the Group 
amounted to 65 days (2007: 55 days) and 
for the Company amounted to nil days 
(2007: nil days).
Research and Development
During the year the Group invested 
£17.9 million (2007: £21.7 million) in research 
and development on software products, of 
which £10.9 million (2007: £6.7 million) 
was capitalised.
Financial Instruments
The exposure of the Group to ﬁ nancial risks 
including the use of ﬁ nancial instruments 
and policies for hedging and the exposure 
to price, credit, cash ﬂ ow and liquidity risk 
can be found in Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements.
Agreements
There are no signiﬁ cant agreements to which 
the Company is a party that take effect, alter 
or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid, other than 
one of the Group’s principal debt facilities 
where the lenders can require the repayment 
of amounts drawn down against the facility in 
the event of a change of control. There are no 
agreements between the Company and 
its Directors or employees providing for 
compensation for loss of ofﬁ ce or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Restrictions on Voting Rights
All shareholders entitled to attend and vote 
may appoint a proxy or proxies to attend, 
speak and vote in their place at General 
Meetings. A member may appoint more 
than one proxy provided that each proxy 
is appointed to exercise the rights attached 
to a different share or shares held by the 
shareholder. A proxy need not be a 
shareholder of the Company. Proxy forms 
must be received by the Company’s 
Registrars at least 48 hours before the time 
appointed for holding the meeting as set out 
in any Notices concerning a General Meeting 
or in any form or proxy sent by or on behalf 
of the Company in relation to the Meeting. 
The appointment of a proxy does not 
preclude a shareholder from attending and 
voting in person at a General Meeting. Further 
details may be found in the Notice of Meeting 
and the proxy card.
Issue of New Share Capital
In order to allot equity securities the 
Directors require express authorisation from 
shareholders. The authority can be granted 
for a period of ﬁ ve years. However, the 
Company follows best practice and seeks 
shareholder approval annually to allot the 
Company’s equity securities. 
 At the AGM held on 14 May 2008 the 
Directors were granted the authority to allot 
the Company’s unissued shares up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £48,141,485. 
This amount represented approximately one 
third of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share 
capital as at 20 March 2008. Shareholders will 
be asked to renew this authority by Ordinary 
Resolution at the AGM on 30 April 2009. 
In addition, the usual Special Resolution 
to disapply pre-emption rights will also be 
proposed subject to shareholder approval of 
the authority to allot shares referred to above.

of regular meetings between management

activities and those of other senior Group

Directors’ and Ofﬁ cers’ Insurance
The Company maintains insurance cover for 
all Directors and Ofﬁ cers of Group companies

them while acting as Directors and Ofﬁ cers.

of the Company, they are Directors or Ofﬁ cers.

Governance  Report of the Directors 43
Charity
Our staff continue to be generous in their 
support for charitable causes. The Company 
supports ‘give as you earn’ schemes to 
facilitate ﬁ nancial donations by staff via the 
payroll. In addition, the Company encourages 
staff to support charities and participate in 
local charitable events and, where possible, 
donates surplus computers to local good 
causes. When making charitable donations, 
the Company’s aim is to develop partnerships 
with national charities and non-governmental 
organisations in the countries in which it 
operates. Total UK charitable donations in 
2008 were £97,100 (2007: £95,000). Our 
community and charity policy is aimed at 
developing people in need to help them 
release their potential. Given Logica’s role in 
the knowledge economy we have chosen the 
education of people, particularly children, as 
our priority area of community work. We 
support projects that actively involve our 
employees and, where possible, make use of 
their technical knowledge and expertise. We 
also encourage our employees to raise money 
for causes that support the objective of our 
community policy.
 Further information about the Group’s 
activities in the community and charitable 
donations can be found in the Corporate 
Responsibility report on pages 68 to 71.
Political Donations and Contributions
The Company’s policy is not to make any 
donations or contributions to political parties 
or organisations and no such payments were 
made during the year. 
Future Developments

1 January 2008. This followed a 
comprehensive recruitment exercise led by 
David Tyler on behalf of the Committee, which 
also utilised the services of independent 
consultants. Both David Tyler’s and Andy 
Green’s appointments as directors were 
ratiﬁ ed by the shareholders at the 2008 AGM. 
During 2008 the Committee undertook 
exercises to ﬁ nd two new Non-Executive 
Directors for the Company. Following 
recommendations made by the Committee, 
Sergio Giacoletto was appointed to the Board 
on 24 February 2009 and Frédéric Rose will 
be appointed to the Board on 30 April 2009. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association both Sergio Giacoletto and 
Frédéric Rose will be proposed for election 
at the 2009 AGM.
 The Nominations Committee, in 
accordance with its terms of reference and 
the Company’s Articles, has proposed Noël 
Harwerth, Wolfhart Hauser and Seamus 
Keating for re-election at the 2009 AGM. 
The Board held seven scheduled meetings 
in 2008 and was available to hold additional 
meetings when circumstances required. 
During the year, 10 additional Board 
Committee meetings were held to deal with 
a variety of matters including the operation 
of the Group’s share plans, the approval of 
documentation for reﬁ nancing in November 
2008 and the approval of the Group’s 
December equity placing. The number of 
routine meetings, together with the Board’s 
ability to hold additional Committee meetings 
at short notice, is judged to be sufﬁ cient to 
discharge the Board’s duties effectively. In 
order to reﬂ ect the geographical spread of the 
Group, and to provide the Board with a higher 
level of visibility of the Group’s operations, at 
least two of these meetings are normally held 
outside the UK. In 2008, in addition to the UK, 
meetings were also held in France and India. 
In 2009, the Board is planning to hold two of 
its meetings in Germany and Sweden.
 Proposed actions are recorded in the 
Board minutes or, where appropriate, in 
relevant Committee minutes, together with 
any concerns that members of the Board may 
have regarding the running of the Company.

The Terms of Reference for the Board are available on 
the Company’s website or can be obtained from the 
Company Secretary
The Board endorses and 
supports the best practice 
guidelines contained in the 
Financial Reporting Council’s 
Combined Code (the Combined 
Code) through its commitment 
to the highest standards of 
corporate governance. 
Apart from the limited exceptions described 
below, the Board believes that the Group has 
fully complied with the Combined Code 
throughout 2008; where it has not, an 
explanation has been provided. The Company 
has complied with the listing requirements 
of the UK Listing Authority and those of the 
Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) 
in the Netherlands. Until it delisted from the 
Nordic exchange (OMX) on 30 June 2008, 
the Company also complied with the relevant 
rules and regulations of the Swedish ﬁ nancial 
supervisory authority, (Finansinspektionen).
The Board
The Board utilises a framework of prudent 
and effective controls in order to determine 
and manage the Group’s goals, together with 
the necessary strategies and policies to 
achieve these goals. The Company’s values 
and the standards set by the Board are 
upheld throughout the Group with the 
assistance of the Executive Management, 
Internal Audit, Quality Assurance and Risk 
Management functions. During 2008 the 
Board has considered reports from the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer and the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer, together with reports from heads of 
business and specialist functions.

Communication with shareholders
The Board gives a high priority to 
communication with shareholders and takes 
the opportunities afforded by the AGM and 
meetings with institutional investors to ensure 
a mutual understanding of the Company’s 
objectives and performance. In 2008, the 
Company’s Chairman and the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee held meetings 
with a number of existing and prospective 
shareholders in order to understand their 
views more fully. In addition, the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer, Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and 
the Head of Investor Relations held meetings 
with shareholders regarding the Group’s 
normal course of business. In total, during 
the year, members of the Board and Investor 
Relations met with over 300 shareholders 
or their representatives at these meetings 
and conferences. 
 All shareholders are welcomed to the AGM 
where developments in the business are 
explained and shareholders have the 
opportunity to ask questions of any of 
the Directors.
 The Company’s website www.logica.com 
provides access for all shareholders to 
information about the Company, including 
results presentations and all press releases. 
Financial reporting is presented in such a way 
as to provide a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position and 
prospects.
 The Board is made aware of shareholders’ 
views through direct feedback from face-to-
face meetings and presentations with 
institutional shareholders. If shareholders 
or investors do not wish to follow the usual 
methods of communication through the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer or 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, the Board’s Senior 
Independent Director is available to meet 
with shareholders or investors. Directors are 
regularly updated on shareholder and market 
matters through internal brieﬁ ngs and the 
provision of external analysts’ reports. The 
Company’s Investor Relations department is 
dedicated to facilitating communication with 
investors, both institutional and retail.
logica.com/investors
Further information on Investor Relations can be found 
on the Company’s website: www.logica.com/investors
Conﬂ icts of interests 
Under the Companies Act 2006, a Director 
has a statutory duty to avoid a situation where 
he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conﬂ icts, or possibly may conﬂ ict, 
with the Company’s interests. The 2006 Act 
allows Directors of public companies to 
authorise conﬂ icts or potential conﬂ icts where 
the Articles of Association contain a provision 
allowing this authorisation. Shareholders 
approved such an amendment to the 
Company’s Articles at the AGM held on 
14 May 2008.
 The Board has put in place a procedure for 
ensuring that its powers of authorisation of 
conﬂ icts of interests operate effectively.  
 Under this procedure, the Directors have 
notiﬁ ed the Company in writing of any 
potential conﬂ icts of which they are aware. 
These notiﬁ cations have been recorded by the 
Company Secretary and have been submitted 
to the Board for review and authorisation, as 
appropriate. In addition, the Company’s 
procedure requires Board members to 
provide notiﬁ cation of any subsequent 
potential conﬂ icts of interest that may arise 
and notiﬁ cation when a conﬂ ict no longer 
exists. Any changes to existing interests are 
recorded by the Company and reviewed at 
the next following Board meeting. A copy of 
the procedure document is provided to all 
new Directors and an explanation forms part 
of the Company’s induction programme for 
new Directors.
 The Board conﬁ rms that the procedure 
referred to above has operated effectively 
since its implementation.
Directors submitting themselves for 
re-election at the AGM have been subject to 
a rigorous, formal performance evaluation 
and were found to have performed effectively 
during the year. Copies of the Directors’ terms 
and conditions of appointment are available 
on request from the Company Secretary.

the Directors, including those seeking 
election and re-election at the 2009 AGM, 
can be found on pages 36 to 37
Non-Executive Directors’ Independence
The Board recognises the valuable 
contribution independent Directors can make. 
During 2008 the Board considered the 
independence of the Non-Executive Directors 
and concluded that each of the Non-
Executive Directors was independent in 
character and judgement. However, under 
the Combined Code, Gérard Philippot was 
not considered independent according to 
provision A.3.1 due to his previous executive 
position in Unilog S.A. Following Gérard’s 
forthcoming retirement as a Director at the 
Company’s 2009 AGM, the Board will be 
fully compliant with this aspect of the Code. 
The Company believes that all Non-Executive 
Directors bring relevant experience to the 
Board and make valuable contributions to 
achieving its objectives. They do not act with 
self-interest and their primary aims are to 
maximise shareholder wealth and develop 
the Company in line with its strategic goals.
 During the year, the Company believes that 
none of the Non-Executive Directors held 
signiﬁ cant commitments outside the Company 
which would interfere with their ability to 
execute their responsibilities effectively.
Governance  Corporate governance report 46 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008
Audit Committee
The composition of the Company’s Audit 
Committee and its terms of reference reﬂ ect 
the Combined Code and the Smith Guidance.
 The Committee is authorised by the Board 
to investigate any activity within its terms of 
reference and to seek any information that it 
requires from any employee of the Company 
and its subsidiaries. All employees are 
directed to cooperate with any request made 
by the Committee. The Committee has the 
right to consult the Company’s professional 
advisers or, if it is not satisﬁ ed with the advice 
received, seek further independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of its duties. 
The Committee believes that the skills, 
qualiﬁ cations and commercial experience 
of its members are appropriate for them to 
perform their duties in accordance with the 
terms of reference laid down by the Board.
 The Audit Committee, which comprises 
only independent Non-Executive Directors, 
is chaired by Roger Payne and, during 2008, 
included Angela Knight, until her retirement 
from the Board on 14 May 2008, Wim Dik and 
Wolfhart Hauser. On 24 February 2009, Sergio 
Giacoletto was also appointed as a member 
of the Committee. The Board considers Roger 
Payne to have recent and relevant ﬁ nancial 
experience following his previous role as the 
ﬁ nancial director of a former FTSE 100 listed 
company. In 2008, he met the required 
commitment for continuing professional 
development (CPD) of the Association of 
Chartered Certiﬁ ed Accountants. The 
Committee meets at least four times a year 
and any two members constitute a quorum.
 The Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
the Committee itself meet with the external 
auditors in private at least four times a year. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ cer, Deputy Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer, Head of Internal Audit and other 
appropriate specialist functional managers 
attend the scheduled meetings at the request 
of the Committee. The Chairman of the Audit 
Committee meets with the Head of Internal 
Audit in private at least four times a year.
 In order to fulﬁ l its terms of reference, the 
Committee reviews, challenges and approves, 
as the case may be, presentations or reports 
from senior management, consulting as 
necessary with the external auditors. During 
the year, the Committee had a satisfactory 
level of dialogue with the Company’s auditors. 
In 2008, the Committee speciﬁ cally considered, 
amongst other things, the following matters:
Board Performance 2008
The Board is subject to an annual performance 
review which covers the effectiveness of the 
Board, its Committees and individual 
members and takes into account factors 
such as composition, expertise, information 
ﬂ ows, roles, responsibilities and procedures. 
A full review has been conducted in line with 
this process. Each Director completed a 
comprehensive questionnaire, following 
which one-to one interviews were conducted 
by the Chairman with each Director. The 
information from the questionnaires and 
interviews were compiled into a report which 
was presented to the Board by the Chairman 
early in 2009.
 As part of this process, any director who 
has served on the Board for a period in 
excess of six years is subject to a particularly 
rigorous review.
 The performance of the Chairman was 
assessed by the Non-Executive Directors. 
The process for this was led by the Senior 
Independent Director with all Directors 
providing feedback on the Chairman’s 
performance. The results were discussed 
with the Chairman by the Senior Independent 
Director.
 During 2008, Andy Green, Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer, held one-to-one meetings with each 
of the Executive Directors to discuss their 
performance and to set targets for the year 
ahead. Each Executive Director received a 
set of objectives for the coming year which 
included objectives linked to delivery of the 
Group’s Programme for Growth.
 There are regular meetings between the 
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors 
to discuss the performance of the Company, 
together with any matters of relevance 
or concern at that time. Where appropriate, 
action is taken to address any concerns of 
the Directors.
Follow up from 2007 Board Evaluation
Following the results of the 2007 Board 
evaluation process, the actions implemented 
in 2008 included:
  the appointment of two new Non-
Executive Directors from Continental 
Europe with experience of the IT services 
industry
  holding two Board meetings outside the 
UK to allow more interaction between 
Directors and management
  increasing the opportunities for informal 
communication between Board members.
Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer
There is a clear division of responsibility 
between the running of the Board by the 
Chairman, and the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s 
responsibility for running the business. 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring the 
effectiveness of the Board and is Chairman 
of the Nominations Committee. He also liaises 
with the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer on strategic 
issues. The Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer is 
responsible for the overall management of 
the Company and for leading the Executive 
Directors and the Executive Committee.
P38
  Details of the Executive Committee 
can be found on pages 38 to 39
Induction and Training
Upon appointment, all Directors undergo 
a comprehensive induction programme, 
tailored to their individual requirements. The 
induction programme includes training on 
Directors’ duties and responsibilities, Board 
procedures and various governance-related 
issues, including conﬂ icts of interests and 
procedures for dealing in Logica plc shares. 
In addition, they meet with the heads of all the 
major business units and receive appropriate 
ongoing training and updates to improve their 
knowledge and skills to enable them to 
discharge their duties effectively. The Directors’ 
training requirements are subject to regular 
review. As part of the induction programme 
Directors also make a number of site visits. 
Members of individual Committees receive 
speciﬁ c training in connection with their duties, 
which includes attendance at seminars and 
brieﬁ ngs by external advisers where applicable. 
Board members are also invited to attend an 
annual leadership conference.
Board Support
The Company Secretary, through the 
Company Secretariat function, is responsible 
for providing administrative and logistical 
support to the Board. Advice and support 
on governance, compliance and regulatory 
matters is also provided. All Directors have 
access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and a procedure is in 
place to enable Directors to seek independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
No such advice was sought by any Director 
during the year. 
Governance  Corporate governance report 47
Internal Control
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. The Board 
delegates the responsibility for designing, 
operating and monitoring the systems of 
internal control to executive management 
in each of the business units of the Group. 
These systems are designed to manage 
and not eliminate risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material errors, losses, fraud or 
breaches of laws or regulations. 
 The Group’s systems of internal control 
cover all material controls including ﬁ nancial, 
operational and compliance as well as risk 
management systems and are in accordance 
with the Turnbull guidance and the Combined 
Code. 
 The key elements of the system of internal 
control in operation are: 
  business units operate under mandatory, 
written policies and procedures, as set 
out in the Group’s business management 
system, Cortex (see also page 66). Policies 
and procedures are kept under review by 
experienced representatives from across 
the Group. Key Group policies are then 
reviewed and approved by the Board 
  the Group’s mandatory policies include 
a Group Ethics policy and a Conﬁ dential 
Disclosure policy, the latter of which 
describes the ‘whistleblowing’ 
arrangements in operation for the Group
  the Group’s mandatory policies include 
an Authority Matrix, setting out the levels 
of authority delegated to individual Board 
members and Group senior executives on 
a wide range of matters including those 
relating to capital expenditure, property 
leases and freeholds, bids and commercial 
contracts, publicity, treasury issues, 
employment matters and legal disputes
  key strategic and operational risks are 
considered as part of the annual planning 
and budgeting process. Throughout the 
year, the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and Chief 
Finance Ofﬁ cer of each business unit 
produce written monthly reports for Group 
analysis and review. These comprise 
detailed ﬁ nancial results, forecasts, cash 
ﬂ ows and commentary on major contracts, 
covering opportunities and threats within 
the business
  the reports from the Company’s Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) regarding 
the Company’s risk management policy 
and programme of work. The Committee 
and the Board also received reports 
concerning speciﬁ c key risks identiﬁ ed 
by the RMC. In addition, the impact of 
changing legislation and regulation, 
were considered and where necessary, 
appropriate actions were taken
  the review of the ﬁ nancial position 
of the Company’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension schemes
  the annual review of the Company’s tax 
and treasury policies in accordance with 
its terms of reference
  an extensive goodwill evaluation covering 
the Group’s activities which supported the 
carrying value thereof with no impairment 
deemed necessary
  at each Audit Committee meeting, the 
Committee reviews any matters, as 
required, relating to a number of standing 
items including major acquisitions/
divestments; progress concerning actions 
taken in response to the Committee’s 
representations; relevant legal, reporting 
practice and compliance developments; 
any reports ﬁ led under the Company’s 
conﬁ dential disclosure policy and fraud 
policy; compliance with the Company’s 
code of ethical conduct, including 
‘whistleblowing’, and any other special 
investigations falling under the terms of 
reference of the Committee.

External auditors
The external auditors provide a 
supplementary, independent perspective 
on the overall integrity of those areas of the 
internal control system which they assess 
in the course of their work. Their ﬁ ndings are 
reported regularly to the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee assesses the evidence 
provided to them and seeks to ensure that 
the risk management process adequately 
addresses all of the major risks to the 
Group. To ensure auditor objectivity and 
independence there is a stringent process in 
place to approve non-audit work. Proposed 
work must be approved by the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer before being passed to the Audit 
Committee for approval. Copies of all internal 
audit reports are automatically copied to 
external auditors to ensure communication 
is both comprehensive and transparent.
P91
  Details regarding the remuneration of 
the external auditors for both audit and 
non-audit work can be found on page 91
The Board conﬁ rms that it has continued 
to review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls and risk management 
processes during 2008 and up to the date 
of this Report and that during the period, 
these reviews have covered all material 
controls, including ﬁ nancial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management 
systems. Where weaknesses have been 
identiﬁ ed or reported through the various 
mechanisms outlined above, appropriate 
corrective action is agreed and closely 
monitored.
Risk Management
The Board recognises the need to understand 
and control the variety of risks to which the 
Company is exposed. In order to address 
these challenges on behalf of the Board 
during the year, the Audit Committee oversaw 
a Risk Management Committee (RMC), 
chaired by the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, which 
exercised a framework for managing risk 
within the Group. Five practice panels 
responsible respectively for the areas of 
delivery, operations, ﬁ nance, human 
resources, and sales and marketing, 
supported the RMC. In conjunction with 
these panels, the RMC took responsibility 
for the regular evaluation of generic and 
speciﬁ c risks within the business and the 
implementation of mitigation plans to 
address them.
 The risk process identiﬁ es, evaluates and 
manages signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Group. 
Risks are assessed with reference to the 
achievement of the Group’s business 
objectives and according to current market 
and economic issues. The continuous 
monitoring of strategic and operational risks 
is the responsibility of the Board and line 
management respectively. The risk process 
has been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of this annual report.
 As referred to in the Internal Control 
section above, clearly deﬁ ned delegation 
of responsibilities and authorisation levels 
contribute to a comprehensive system which 
exists for controlling these risks and ensuring 
they are adequately addressed. Core 
operating procedures common to all areas of 
the Group are clearly documented in the 
Cortex business management system also 
referred to in the Internal Control section.
 
  the Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer conduct monthly 
business reviews of the major business 
units within the Group
  the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer and the Board carry out formal 
reviews of major bids, where opportunities 
exceed speciﬁ ed monetary values or 
risk proﬁ les
  research and development and capital 
investment programmes are subject to 
formal review, qualiﬁ cation and approval
  as part of the Executive Committee’s 
regular review of the top 10 business risks, 
proposals to improve mitigations are 
presented and discussed. For example, 
as part of the review of internal controls to 
mitigate signiﬁ cant contract risk, proposals 
have been developed and approved to 
standardise and strengthen the system for 
documenting, reviewing and approving 
client bids. This was piloted during the last 
quarter of 2008 and is in the process of 
being rolled out to all business units as a 
mandatory requirement from April 2009
  quality assurance teams are in place 
in all business units, supporting local 
management in assuring and improving 
the quality of operational delivery. These 
teams are key to the operation and 
maintenance of the ISO and other industry 
standard quality accreditations in place 
throughout the Group
  the Group’s systems of internal control 
and its internal control procedures are 
reviewed and tested on a sample basis 
by Group Internal Audit. Following the 
appointment of a new Head of Internal 
Audit in 2008 a number of initiatives are 
in progress to strengthen and widen the 
coverage of internal audit activity. The 
results of Group Internal Audit work are 
routinely reported to Group executive 
management and the Audit Committee.

Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Remuneration Committee 
is comprised of three independent 
Non-Executive Directors and meets the 
recommendations of the Combined Code.
 Noël Harwerth has been the Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee since 
November 2007. Angela Knight, the previous 
Chairman, remained as a member of the 
Committee until her retirement at the 
Company’s AGM in 2008. The Committee’s 
other members are Wolfhart Hauser and 
David Tyler. It is intended that Frédéric Rose 
will become a member of the Committee 
on 30 April 2009 and that Wolfhart Hauser 
will stand down from the Committee from 
that date.
 The Committee is authorised by the Board 
to investigate any activity within its terms of 
reference. The Committee has the right to 
appoint independent advisers and, if it is 
not satisﬁ ed with the advice received, seek 
further independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense in the furtherance 
of its duties. For the year reported, Kepler 
Associates were the principal independent 
advisers to the Committee.
 The Committee believes that the skills, 
qualiﬁ cations and commercial experience 
of its members are appropriate for them to 
perform their duties in accordance with the 
terms of reference laid down by the Board.
P52
  Details of the Committee’s main functions 
and its remuneration policies for Directors 
and senior management are set out on 
pages 52 to 53
Going concern
The Directors, having made enquiries, 
consider that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, and therefore it is appropriate to 
maintain the going concern basis in preparing 
the ﬁ nancial statements.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee, which 
comprises a majority of independent 
Non-Executive Directors, is chaired by David 
Tyler. Its members also include Wim Dik, 
Noël Harwerth, Andy Green and Roger Payne. 
Other Directors are entitled to attend at the 
invitation of the Nominations Committee. The 
Committee reviews the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience represented on 
the Board and its Committees and makes 
recommendations to the Board concerning 
any adjustments deemed to be appropriate.
 Under its terms of reference the 
Committee oversees the search and selection 
process for new Directors and aims to do 
so as recommended by the Combined 
Code. The Committee can engage external 
independent professional advisers to assist 
when seeking potential Board members. 
A shortlist of candidates will normally be 
established and selected candidates will 
be interviewed and recommended for 
consideration by the Board. 
 Other meetings are convened on an ad 
hoc basis as required.
 The Nominations Committee is also 
responsible for overseeing the Board 
appraisal process.
 The Committee was convened on two 
scheduled occasions during 2008. Two 
Committee members, both of whom must 
be independent Non-Executive Directors, 
constitute a quorum.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
the ﬁ nancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Group 
and the Parent Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
 Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial 
year. Under that law the Directors have 
prepared the Group Financial Statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union, and the Parent Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
 In preparing the Group Financial 
Statements, the Directors have also elected 
to comply with the IFRSs, issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB). The Group and Parent Company 
Financial Statements are required by law to 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and the Group and of the 
proﬁ t or loss of the Group for that period.
 In preparing those ﬁ nancial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently
  make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
  state that the Group Financial Statements 
comply with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and IFRSs issued by the 
IASB and, with regard to the Parent 
Company’s Financial Statements, that 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
The Directors conﬁ rm that they have complied 
with the above requirements in preparing the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
 The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial 
position of the Company and the Group and 
to enable them to ensure that the Financial 
Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 1985 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
 They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
 The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and ﬁ nancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
 Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are referred to on pages 36 to 37 
conﬁ rm that, to the best of their knowledge:
  the Group ﬁ nancial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial 
position and proﬁ t of the Group; and
  the Business Review and Risk Factors on 
pages 4 to 33 and pages 66 to 67 
respectively includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces. 52 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

Directors’ Remuneration Report 53
Annual bonus
The Executive Bonus Plan is designed to 
incentivise senior executives to achieve 
stretching and demanding ﬁ nancial, strategic 
and personal targets which are approved 
annually by the Remuneration Committee. In 
2008 the targets for determining the baseline 
bonus for executives at CEO/function head 
level were Group operating proﬁ t and Group 
cash ﬂ ow conversion, with each element 
given a 50% weighting.
 For executives responsible for individual 
countries or groups of countries (clusters) the 
measures and weightings used for the 
baseline bonus were 30% on Group operating 
proﬁ t, 30% on Group cash ﬂ ow conversion, 
20% cluster operating proﬁ t and 20% cluster 
cash ﬂ ow conversion. The diagram below 
shows the key elements of the 2008 bonus 
plan and demonstrates how the bonus 
amount is calculated (expressed as a 
percentage of annual base salary).
 The Strategic Performance Multiplier 
is derived as an average of the separate 
multiplier ratings given for the three 
strategic objectives of 1) off shore delivery, 
2) business development and 3) cost 
reduction.
 Speciﬁ c targets under these three 
headings were given to all participants.

4 Total bonus % payable
(capped at 125%)
The maximum bonus is 125% of annual 
base salary for superior performance. Where 
appropriate the Committee may exercise its 
discretion in determining any bonuses paid. 
A minimum of 20% of any annual bonus after 
tax must be invested in shares through the 
Executive Equity Participation Plan. 
A meaningful cross-country comparison 
of salaries with employees below senior 
executive level is not possible because the 
Group operates in many different countries. 
The Company policy is to set remuneration 
levels with reference to local market conditions 
and to take account of the treatment of staff 
and management generally to ensure an 
appropriate balance is maintained. 
 
Annual base salary
Typically salaries will be market median for 
an individual deemed to be fully effective in 
their role and who is around mid-career. 
Less experienced new appointees may be 
paid below market median while experienced 
individuals and those regarded by the 
Committee as particularly key to the future 
success of the Company may be paid a 
base salary of around upper quartile where 
appropriate. Annual base salaries are 
reviewed annually on 1 January. Following 
discussions with the Executive Committee the 
Remuneration Committee has decided there 
will be no increases in salary for members of 
the EC in 2009. The table below shows the 
base salaries for Executive Directors in 2009: 
Annual base salary
Name Salary
Andy Green £700,000
Seamus Keating £420,000
Crister Stjernfelt* £269,454
*SEK converted at a rate of 12.08.
Target levels of remuneration are 
benchmarked against similarly-sized 
suitable UK-listed companies and selected 
international sector competitors. These 
comparator companies were selected on the 
basis of size (in both ﬁ nancial terms and with 
regard to number and type of employees), 
complexity and international scope of 
operations.
  Directors’ contractual arrangements are 
in line with UK governance guidelines and 
competitive market practice
  the Committee regularly reviews its 
remuneration policy in the light of 
signiﬁ cant regulatory developments, 
market practice and shareholder feedback 
  the Committee monitors the level of 
reward to ensure that it is fair and 
proportionate in the light of performance
  shareholders will be consulted when 
material changes to the policy are 
being considered.
Details of remuneration arrangements for 
senior executives 
Key elements of remuneration
The remuneration of senior executives 
comprises a mix of ﬁ xed, variable, short- and 
long-term remuneration which is reviewed 
each year by the Committee to ensure that the 
Directors are appropriately incentivised to 
achieve the Group’s goals and objectives.
 The chart below shows that for on-target 
performance, remuneration for Executive 
Directors is weighted most heavily towards 
performance-related elements. At stretch 
levels of performance, a higher proportion of 
the package would be related to performance.
The table on page 54 summarises the key

Governance  Directors’ Remuneration Report 55
TSR measures the return on a notional 
investment in a company over a given period. 
TSR is determined by regard to an index 
measuring the growth in a company’s share 
price over a period, with the index assuming 
any dividends paid are reinvested in the 
company’s shares on a net basis on the 
ex-dividend date. TSR can be a useful 
measure of a company’s performance relative 
to others within a selected comparator group.
 The vesting schedule graphs on page 56 
show how each half of an award could vest 
at the end of the relevant three-year 
performance period under the EPS and the 
TSR performance conditions. The TSR 
comparator group for 2009 is shown below.
TSR comparator group for 2009
Accenture Infosys Technologies 
Atos Origin Indra Sistemas
Capgemini Misys
Capita Ordina
CGI Group Sage
Computer 
Sciences Corp. SAP
Dassault Systems Sopra Group
Groupe Steria TietoEnator
IBM Unisys
These companies were selected for their strong 
alignment with the Group on a number of 
criteria including: business mix, company size 
(primarily in terms of market capitalisation), 
geographic spread and TSR correlation with 
the Company. Following a review at the 
beginning of 2008 the Committee decided to 
add Accenture, Capita, Infosys Technologies 
and Unisys to the comparator group in 2008. 
Getronics, iSOFT and Xansa were removed 
because they were no longer listed 
companies. Following the acquisition of 
Electronic Data Systems (EDS) by Hewlett 
Packard (HP) in 2008, HP replaced EDS in 
the comparator group for 2008.
Awards:
  are limited to a maximum face value of 
four times annual salary
  may be exercised between the third and 
tenth anniversary of the date of the grant, 
or released immediately in the case of 
conditional shares, provided the 
performance conditions have been met.
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
In 2008 the LTIP was the primary long term 
incentive arrangement for senior executives. 
Its main features are:
  an annual award of shares will be released 
after three years provided that challenging 
performance targets have been achieved
  the maximum total market value of shares 
over which awards may be granted to any 
employee during any company ﬁ nancial 
year is 200% of their annual base salary. 
However, the Committee’s expectation is 
that no grants greater than 150% of annual 
base salary will be proposed in normal 
circumstances
  50% of each award is subject to 
achievement of EPS performance targets
  the other 50% of the award is subject to 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance relative to peers.
With the proposed introduction of the 
Company’s new Partners’ Incentive Plan and 
the Performance Multiplier Plan (detailed 
below) it is intended that after 2009 awards 
under the LTIP will not normally be made to 
participants in these plans. In 2009 an LTIP 
grant will be made as part of the transition to 
the Partners’ Incentive Plan described below.
 For 2008, the Committee decided that 
EPS and relative TSR remained appropriate 
measures of the Company’s long-term 
performance. These stretching three-year 
performance criteria also apply to the ExEPP 
and Executive Share Option Plan outlined on 
this page.
Performance conditions
The Committee sets performance conditions 
each time an award is made under the long 
term incentive plans. EPS
#
 growth and TSR 
are the two performance measures currently 
applied to the LTIP, the ExEPP and the ESOP. 
EPS
#
 growth remains substantially within the 
control of management and therefore the 
Committee continues to consider it an 
appropriate measure of the underlying 
ﬁ nancial performance of the Company.
The bonus structure for 2009 has been 
changed as follows:
  the weighting between Group and cluster 
targets was changed to 70% on Group 
performance and 30% on cluster 
performance in support of the overall 
‘One Logica’ message
  the Group cash target is now net debt to 
increase focus on this important measure 
in 2009
  cluster cash targets are based on the total 
of work in progress (WIP) and debtor days 
to provide a clear focus for management 
on these areas.
Leadership Transition Incentive
In view of the Executive Directors’ key role in 
ensuring the Group’s performance met 
market expectation during the leadership 
transition, the Committee implemented an 
additional incentive arrangement covering the 
period from August 2007 to August 2008. 
Under this arrangement, the Executive 
Directors were eligible to receive a maximum 
payment of 75% of annual base salary. One 
half of this incentive was payable on achieving 
speciﬁ ed Group targets for 2007. The other 
half was payable for achieving a satisfactory 
business performance in the ﬁ rst half of 2008. 
The target for August to December 2007 was 
not achieved and therefore the ﬁ rst half of the 
incentive was not paid. The target for January 
to June 2008 was achieved and therefore the 
second half of the incentive was paid.
Executive Equity Participation Plan 
(ExEPP)
The ExEPP allows participants to invest a 
minimum of 20% and up to a maximum of 
50% of their after-tax annual bonus payment 
in Company shares. Participation is 
compulsory for Executive Directors and EC 
members but voluntary for other senior 
managers invited to join the Plan. If they 
remain in the Group’s employment and retain 
their shares for three years, then provided 
the performance conditions are met, the 
Company will match the shares on a 
one-to-one gross-of-tax basis.
Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP)
The Company has retained a share option 
plan in particular for those circumstances 
where use of the LTIP may be inappropriate 
(for example, due to local taxation or 
securities regulations). No options were 
granted under this plan in 2008.
Governance  Directors’ Remuneration Report
#  For the performance conditions applied to the 2006 
LTIP , 2006 ExEPP , the EmEPP (before 2008) and the 
ESOP , EPS means the adjusted earnings per share 
based on net proﬁ t attributable to ordinary shareholders 
excluding exceptional items and restructuring costs 
related to acquisitions, mark-to-market gains and losses 
on convertible bonds, amortisation of intangible assets 
initially recognised in an acquisition at fair value. 56 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008
The Performance Multiplier Plan will reward 
Executive and Managing Partners if exceptional 
growth in EPS over a three-year period is 
achieved. It is linked to the Partners’ Incentive 
Plan through the annual pool allocation of 
shares. It works on a three-year cycle with 
awards granted at the end of each cycle. The 
PMP will vest in three parts, one, two and three 
years after grant. If business performance 
conditions are met, as measured by growth in 
adjusted EPS, the annual allocations will be 
equivalent to one times the PIP award if a target 
of 40% EPS growth is met and equivalent to 
two times the PIP award if a target of 80% EPS 
growth is met. Awards for performance 
between 40% and 80% are calculated on a 
straight-line basis. PMP multiplier shares are 
awarded in addition to the original annual pool 
share awards. The PMP is subject to approval 
by shareholders at the 2009 AGM. The 
Company will also seek shareholder approval 
to be able to use new issue shares for the PIP 
and the PMP at the same AGM.

Partners’ Incentive Plan and Performance 
Multiplier Plan to be introduced in 2009
Integral to the achievement of the Company’s 
strategic plan, presented to the market 
on 22 April 2008, is the leadership and 
engagement of senior executives across the 
Company to ensure they take decisions in the 
best interests of the Group as a whole.
 The Partners’ Incentive Plan (PIP) and the 
Performance Multiplier Plan (PMP), which is 
subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, 
are being introduced as part of an overall 
cultural change to support this Partnership 
ethos, to reward sustained business 
performance and to provide strong alignment 
with shareholder interests.
 There are three partnership levels, 
Executive Partner, Managing Partner 
and Partner. 
 The PIP will reward all Partners for 
sustained Group performance, measured by 
proﬁ t before tax (PBT). The key features of the 
Plan are:
  creation of an annual pool subject to a 
PBT hurdle
  once the value of the annual pool is 
established it will be divided into 100,000 
‘points’ which will be distributed to 
Partners at a pre-deﬁ ned number of points 
per participant
  The top performing 20% of Partners 
excluding Executive and Managing 
Partners will be eligible for an additional 
allocation of up to double their normal award
  awards will be made annually in the form of 
shares after the annual proﬁ ts are announced
  shares will vest after three years subject to 
a participant’s continued employment
  Executive Partners will be expected to retain 
a proportion of the shares in line with the 
share retention guidelines.

Governance  Directors’ Remuneration Report
For the performance conditions applied to the PMP , 
EPS means the adjusted earnings per share based 
on net proﬁ t attributable to ordinary shareholders 
excluding discontinued operations, exceptional items 
and restructuring costs related to acquisitions, mark-
to-market gains and losses on convertible bonds, 
amortisation of intangible assets initially recognised 
in an acquisition at fair value. 57
All-employee share plans
The Group operates three share plans to 
provide employees with the opportunity to 
acquire shares in the Company. The majority 
of employees globally can participate in at 
least one of the plans, subject to local legal 
and tax constraints. Executive Directors are 
eligible to participate in Sharesave, and 
may participate in the Employee Equity 
Partnership Plan on condition they are 
not participating in the ExEPP that year. 
US-based employees are only entitled to 
participate in the US Stock Purchase Plan.
 During 2008 a total of 8,341,215 options 
were awarded under the UK and International 
Sharesave plans, and a total of 486,747 
matching award shares under the Employee 
Equity Partnership Plan.
 The Committee decided to encourage 
greater participation by re-introducing a 20% 
discount to the market price at which 
employees may purchase options under the 
Sharesave plans and to remove the Company 
performance condition on the Employee 
Equity Partnership Plan for 2008 and 
subsequent years. In addition, certain 
employees in France may participate in Logica 
Insight and the Plan d’Epargne d’Enterprise 
(see page 115 for details of the plans).
Pensions
Pension arrangements for executives reﬂ ect 
local practice in their base country. UK-based 
executives may join the Company’s Deﬁ ned 
Contribution Pension Scheme. This is the 
UK’s main pension fund and the only scheme 
available to new UK employees. Where a 
UK-based executive wishes to change their 
pension arrangements for personal tax 
reasons, the policy is to consider alternatives, 
provided they are cost neutral to the 
Company.
 The pension allowance for the CEO is 30% 
of salary. The allowance for other UK based 
executive directors is 20% of salary (17.75% 
of salary if taken as cash). 
 Crister Stjernfelt continued to receive 
the same annual pension allowance of 
SEK1,750,000 (£144,868) as he received in 
2007, reﬂ ecting arrangements in place prior 
to the WM-data acquisition in 2006. This 
arrangement expired at the end of December 
2008. Following a review the allowance 
was reduced to SEK813,750 (£67,363) with 
effect from 1 January 2009, in line with normal 
local practice.
Beneﬁ ts
The beneﬁ ts received by the Executive 
Directors are detailed in the table below. 
Beneﬁ t entitlements are in line with normal 
practice in the UK and Sweden. 
Dilution 
Awards granted under the UK and International 
Sharesave Plans are satisﬁ ed with new issue 
shares. Options granted under the Executive 
Share Option Scheme and awards made 
under the LTIP may be satisﬁ ed either by 
shares purchased in the market by the 
Company’s offshore employee beneﬁ t trust 
or by the issue of new shares. Awards made 
under the Executive Equity Partnership Plan, 
the Executive Equity Participation Plan, the 
Partners’ Incentive Plan in 2009 and the 
Employee Equity Partnership Plan are 
satisﬁ ed by shares purchased in the market 
by the Company’s offshore employee beneﬁ t 
trust. Awards made under the US Stock 
Purchase Plan are satisﬁ ed by market 
purchase shares only. The table on page 56 
shows the Company’s current commitment to 
issue new shares in respect of its share plans 
assuming all performance conditions are met 
and all option and award holders remain in 
employment to the vesting date.

Directors’ employment contracts
Executive Directors each have a service 
agreement that continues until normal 
retirement age unless terminated by either 
party. No Executive Director’s service 
contract includes a liquidated damages clause 
and no such clause will be incorporated into 
future contracts for Executive Directors. 
Other Executive Directors’ and EC members’ 
contracts do not contain any provision for 
compensation upon termination of employment 
beyond payment in lieu of contractual notice.
Non-Executive directorships
Executive Directors may normally accept and 
maintain one non-executive appointment of 
another company, which may be a FTSE 100 
company. Such appointments can broaden 
their knowledge and experience to the 
beneﬁ t of the Company. They may normally 
retain fees as the posts entail personal 
responsibility. Andy Green was a Non-
Executive Director of NAVTEQ Inc until July 
2008. While with the Company, Jim McKenna 
was Chairman of Azzuri Communications 
Limited and Chairman of Catch22 Charity 
Limited (formerly Rainer Crime Concern). 
Details of fees received can be found in the 
report and accounts of the relevant 
companies.
Former Executive Directors
Jim McKenna
Jim McKenna served on the Board until 
30 September 2008. The following payments 
were paid to him in accordance with the terms 
of his contract of employment:
  12 months’ salary in lieu of notice 
(£455,000), and a sum, equivalent to 
12.5% of annual base pay (£56,875), as 
a contribution to the value of his beneﬁ ts
  a pro-rata bonus payment in respect of 
2008 performance under the terms of the 
2008 Executive Bonus Plan (£273,000), will 
be made in April 2009
  payment in respect of ﬁ rst half 2008 
performance under the Leadership 
incentive arrangement at £170,625, and 
a discretionary payment of £85,000 in 
recognition of his performance of the 
CEO role on an interim basis during 2007.
Jim McKenna’s company car entitlement 
continues until 30 September 2009, in line 
with the terms of his contract of employment.
 For the purposes of Group share plans, 
the Committee exercised its discretion to 
allow Jim McKenna to exercise outstanding 
grants under certain Group share plans 
(see pages 62 to 65).
 His other leaving arrangements, in respect 
of Company property, were in line with 
normal practice.
Share retention policy
Executive Directors and EC members 
receiving deferred shares through the ExEPP 
are expected to acquire and retain a 
signiﬁ cant holding in the Company under the 
share retention policy. The requirement 
is expressed as a percentage of annual base 
salary. The Committee considers salary to 
be the most appropriate reference point as 
it is less volatile than total remuneration, 
easily understood and compliance is 
easily measured.
 Following a policy review, the Committee 
decided to implement increased share 
ownership requirements from 2008 of 200% 
(CEO) and 100% (other Executive Directors) 
of annual base salary, removing the three- 
and ﬁ ve-year time limits within which a certain 
level of shareholding was to be achieved. 
Executive Directors and EC members will 
normally be expected to invest 50% of any 
annual net bonus in shares until the 
Company’s ownership requirements are met. 
The obligation to invest 20% of the net annual 
bonus in shares through the ExEPP is 
regardless of shareholding. It is anticipated 
that this will normally be achieved through 
participation in the ExEPP and LTIP. The 
requirements for Executive Directors are set 
out in the table below.

average price over three months to 31 December 
(whichever is the higher).

Governance  Directors’ Remuneration Report
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors do not have service 
contracts with the Company. They are not 
normally eligible to participate in performance 
related bonus plans, Group share plans or 
Group employee beneﬁ t arrangements. 
They are not entitled to any payments for 
loss of ofﬁ ce or any unexpired term of their 
appointment as a Non-Executive Director.
 The Chairman’s fees are determined by 
the Board upon the recommendation of the 
Committee and the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer. 
The fees of the other Non-Executive Directors 
are approved by the Executive Directors 
based upon recommendations from the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer. The 
Board has the power to award additional fees 
to Non-Executive Directors for services 
outside the scope of their ordinary duties. No 
such additional payments were made in 2008.
A review of the fees and fee structure for the 
Non-Executive Directors was undertaken 
during 2007 and revised fees were 
implemented with effect from 1 January 2008.  
Non-Executive Directors now receive a base 
fee and, additionally, a fee for every 
Committee membership. A Committee 
Chairman only receives the base fee and 
Committee Chairman fee. Part of the annual 
fee after tax is delivered in shares: £10,000 
(gross) for the Non-Executives and the 
Deputy Chairman, and £30,000 (gross) for 
the Chairman. The Non-Executives are 
encouraged to build up and retain a 
shareholding of one times annual fees 
during their tenure.

Risk factors
Governance  Risk factors
Major contract related risks The complexity, variability and duration of solution 
and service contracts all place risk management and 
control at a premium. If the Group fails to adequately 
assess its risks, implement the required controls or 
monitor its position diligently, any resulting failure 
to deliver a contract could adversely affect its 
relationship with the client and Logica’s reputation 
and ultimately affect the results of the Group.
The Group manages project and operational risk 
through the application of process, underpinned by 
a comprehensive, well proven quality management 
system detailed in Cortex. Communication, training 
and adoption of Cortex by all staff are essential.  
Feedback from audits, lessons learnt and the 
capture of revised metrics leads to updates on a 
regular basis. We are currently evaluating making 
Cortex development tools and methodologies more 
prescriptive and automating more. A review of our 
Opportunity, Bid, Delivery and Risk Management 
processes is also in progress across the Group.
Risk area Potential impact Mitigation actions

Business continuity risks associated 
with operational failure, information 
systems and data security 
Logica enjoys a leading position in many markets 
and geographies based on our domain expertise, 
repeatable and leading edge solutions and services, 
our reputation for technical excellence and reliable 
delivery, and a signiﬁ cant number of long standing 
clients. However, a failure of our systems, or a failure 
of our operational and company management 
processes, could lead to a loss of conﬁ dence in 
the Group which would undermine our market 
perception and brand.
Actions are in hand to improve our focus on customer 
satisfaction. Our account and delivery management 
processes include both active and reactive 
mechanisms. Our goal is to ensure that management 
reacts to issues before damage results. There is 
a focus on standardisation of processes, systems 
and tools across the Group aimed at improving 
operational effectiveness and resilience through 
the One Logica programme.

Business continuity risks associated 
with a pandemic, terrorist incident or 
other external event, including 
exposure to geopolitical, economic 
and social disruption, particularly in 
parts of Europe and in India
Business continuity plans are maintained and are 
being tested for range of disaster scenarios in each 
geographic location in which the Company operates. 
Lessons are learnt from incidents across the Group 
and improvements to these plans are in progress. 
The Group has also established an approach to the 
pandemic threat and monitors the World Health 
Organisation Pandemic Alert status. The Group 
adopts a balanced business and market portfolio 
to endeavour to protect itself against risks that are 
restricted to individual territories and market sectors.

Achieving the objectives set for the 
Programme for Growth
The Programme for Growth is the basis on which 
Logica expects to improve returns to shareholders. 
A programme of signiﬁ cant cost reductions is taking 
place, in order to fund a number of investments 
which will deliver revenue growth above the market. 
The key risks are delivering sufﬁ cient cost savings 
in an uncertain economic climate, ensuring that the 
investment reaches the right programmes and can be 
reduced if conditions deteriorate, achieving the right 
balance of management attention between business 
as usual and change and failing to hit externally 
reported milestones impacting our reputation with 
investors and customers.
Each work stream is sponsored by an Executive 
Committee (EC) member who is personally 
responsible to the Group Chief Executive for 
ensuring the objectives are achieved. Seamus 
Keating, CFO, oversees and manages the whole 
project. A programme plan for each work stream 
details key dates and milestones. A project manager 
leads each work stream with responsibility for 
resourcing and ensuring delivery on time and 
to budget. Progress is reviewed monthly by the 
Executive Committee. Investment levels are 
adjusted in the light of trading conditions and 
business forecasts. 

Dependence on recruitment and 
retention of suitably qualiﬁ ed personnel
The ability of the Group to meet the demands of 
the market and compete effectively with other IT 
suppliers is, to a large extent, dependent on the 
skills, experience and performance of its personnel 
and an appropriate balance of onshore, nearshore 
and offshore resources. The loss of key personnel or 
signiﬁ cant numbers of staff, or the failure to attract a 
sufﬁ cient number of suitably qualiﬁ ed and experienced 
personnel in our key onshore, near shore and offshore 
locations, could have serious consequences on the 
Group’s ability to service client contracts.
The Group has well established recruitment 
processes and adopts a range of proven methods to 
maximise key staff retention. The Group also provides 
an infrastructure which supports the development 
of its personnel through a range of structured career 
development programmes focused on each key 
competency, which include succession planning 
as well as leadership, talent management and 
personal development. 
 There is increasing concern generally about the threat 
of a continental or global inﬂ uenza or related virus 
pandemic, and the threat of a terrorist attack. An 
incident affecting a key group of staff could impact 
the operation of the Company, and in turn conﬁ dence 
in Logica’s ability to deliver. As the Group operates 
on an international basis, it is also exposed to the risk 
of political, ﬁ nancial, economic and social unrest in 
the territories in which it operates. These risks are 
generally outside the control of the Group but could 
still result in the loss of services that would prejudice 
our ability to respond to agreed service levels or fulﬁ l 
other obligations. 67
Governance  Risk factors
Achieving operational process 
excellence in our global blended 
delivery model 
The market is increasingly demanding the ability to 
deliver globally, exploiting the beneﬁ ts of our growing 
global presence. The ITIL service management 
processes currently being adopted will strengthen 
the ability of the Group to deliver services and 
application management on a global basis from any 
delivery centre. The next challenge is to develop, 
supported by tools, the industrialisation of design 
and development. Our challenge is to achieve the 
changes necessary in a sufﬁ ciently timely manner, 
and within normal business constraints.
The Group is investing in the development and 
industrialisation of our processes (known as Cortex), 
and our Management Information Systems. We 
are introducing more prescription, efﬁ ciencies and 
automation where possible. Global Operations is 
focused on improving the efﬁ ciency of our IT and 
offshore delivery processes and accelerating the 
development of our blended delivery model. 
Risk area Potential impact Mitigation actions

Regulatory compliance risks Given the enlarged group and increasing compliance, 
the Group needs to ensure that the various 
compliance risks are effectively understood and 
managed. The main risk areas are 1) data and 
information security, including Data Protection 
regulations, 2) environmental standards and 
Corporate Responsibility, and 3) global staff mobility 
issues including adherence to immigration and tax 
regulations.
Our Risk and Compliance Management processes 
have been revised. They now include pro-active 
monitoring of the complete breadth of compliance 
requirements across the individual geographies and 
regulatory domains. Formal risk assessments are 
being used to identify speciﬁ c mitigating actions 
required. Standard governance processes are being 
implemented across the Group.

Major client dependencies and regional 
market sector risks
The Group has a number of signiﬁ cant global and 
regional clients and operates in key markets in the 
main European geographies. A change in the strategy 
or in the buying pattern of a key client, or changes in 
those local markets, may affect the Group’s results. 
A more macro level change in any one market could 
also adversely affect the results of the Group, and 
this is addressed in the risk below.
As well as maintaining a geographical spread, the 
Group has a well balanced spread of business 
across market sectors and a wide range of clients. 
It manages more local regional shifts of focus and 
resource in response to country market ﬂ uctuations. 
We have identiﬁ ed 57 focus accounts from across 
the Group which are receiving particular attention 
to ensure stability, account growth and customer 
satisfaction are all achieved. In 2008, no customer 
accounted for more than 2% of revenue.

Macro economic and industry level 
trends and changes affecting the global 
competitive landscape
The Group is exposed to unrest in world market 
sectors, such as ﬁ nance, oil and gas, due to a 
range of factors largely outside of its control. Many 
market sectors in which the Group operates have 
been susceptible to rapidly changing technologies, 
regulation, variations in market economic conditions 
and ﬂ uctuations in client demand. The geographies 
we operate in have expanded in response to global 
trends, including offshoring and the changing 
economic position of India and China. The Group 
needs to be able to continue to respond and 
adapt whilst, in a timely and cost-efﬁ cient manner, 
continuing to deliver existing products and services. 
Failure to do so will be a risk to the Group’s success.
To meet market demands, the Group’s Industry 
Boards are tasked with producing innovative 
solution and service propositions, essential to both 
stimulate new client revenue opportunities and meet 
existing needs. The Programme for Growth has also 
identiﬁ ed a number of key focus areas where we see 
both market demand and particular opportunity for 
Logica in the near future. A proactive knowledge 
management programme across the Group, 
combined with increased collaborative competency 
team development, an Innovation team and the recent 
institution of Global Operations helps to ensure that 
technology advancement challenges are met.

Loss of authorisation or accreditation 
from vendors or disruption of key 
supplier relationships
A portion of the Group’s revenue is dependent on 
continued authorisation and accreditation by certain 
vendors of IT software and hardware. Without these 
service authorisations and accreditations, the Group 
may be unable to offer certain products and services. 
Failure to maintain authorisations and accreditations 
may also result in the Group failing to fulﬁ l contractual 
obligations. 
Alliance management is tasked with developing 
engagement plans with key suppliers that link Logica 
to these organisations at management levels and 
across functions, maintaining a mutually positive and 
beneﬁ cial business arrangement. 68 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

Responsibility
Our approach to CR will continue to focus 
on three main objectives:
  Respecting the environment
  Making a positive difference to the 
community
  Making Logica a great place to work.
Respecting the environment 
Logica aims to operate an environmentally 
sustainable organisation and throughout the 
year we have been increasing the ways in which 
we can minimise energy and carbon emissions.
 We have been researching ways in which 
we can reduce electricity consumption and 
reduce emissions by improving the efﬁ ciency 
of our data centres. We ran a pilot programme 
in Portugal and successfully reduced 
emissions by around 396 tonnes by 
consolidation and improvements to air 
conditioning. Cold weather can override the 
need for cooling data centres; our UK centre 
in Bridgend manages its energy consumption 
by switching off air conditioning and using 
‘free air’ cooling when outside temperatures 
reach 12 degrees. We will be building on the 
lessons learnt from these programmes to 
increase the efﬁ ciencies in our other data 
centres around our business.
 In 2008 total Group carbon emissions were 
143,819 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(tCO
2
e), primarily generated from ofﬁ ce 
equipment, building heating, cooling, car and 
air travel and data centre equipment. In our 
report this year we have improved the 
accuracy of data, collecting more usage 
information from our global ofﬁ ces. Countries 
representing 94.5% of our staff have reported 
data over 2008, which is an increase from 
66% representation in 2007. A small part of 
our CO
2
 report continues to be based upon 
estimations, surveys and extrapolations rather 
than actual data. We will strive to again 
improve quality of reporting in 2009. There is 
an increase in total emission levels from 2007 
which is primarily due to the increased 
coverage of reporting and the inclusion of 
commuting travel, district heating and rail 
travel into our ﬁ gures in line with Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol. Simultaneously, we can report 
reductions in emissions related to electricity 
and air travel, which is the result of 
environmental programmes in our countries. 
We will be using our ﬁ gures as part of our 
submission into the 2008 Carbon Disclosure 
Project.
CEO’s introduction
It’s been a year since my ﬁ rst Corporate 
Responsibility (CR) report with Logica and 
I’m delighted with the progress that has 
been made. 
I am personally passionate about promoting 
a Logica business culture where corporate 
responsibility isn’t just an addition, but an 
integral part of our business.
 We recognise we still have a way to go on 
this journey but we are ﬁ rmly committed to 
building a sustainable business at Logica. 
Our people are passionate about this and 
increasingly our customers are turning to 
us to provide them with the solutions and 
offerings that will help them to maximise 
efﬁ ciencies and to meet their own 
sustainability criteria. In an uncertain 
economic environment, becoming sustainable 
is increasingly the right thing to do: by 
reducing our exposure to volatile energy 
prices and continuing to help ourselves and 
our customers to decouple carbon from 
economic success, we are securing ourselves 
a more viable long term future.
 Since our last CR report we made 
important steps towards establishing a 
Group-wide CR programme across all parts 
of our business: we have improved the quality 
of our sustainability measures, enhanced 
the energy efﬁ ciency of our operations and 
widened our community programme. We have 
put our Corporate Responsibility agenda at 
the heart of our long term vision for the 
organisation with a view to demonstrating 
that by working closely together with our key 
stakeholders we can make a real difference 
to the world at large. 
 Please follow Logica’s corporate 
responsibility journey, including how we 
are continuing to support the 10 principles 
as a signatory to the United Nations 
Global Compact on our website: 
www.logica.com/cr

Andy Green
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer
Corporate responsibility report
In addition to looking at our own operating 
environmental impacts, we have made 
signiﬁ cant investment in developing new 
products and services that will assist our 
customers to lower their carbon footprint. 
Some of these include a web-based energy-
efﬁ ciency management system; smart 
metering to assist consumers to monitor their 
own energy consumption, wind farm control 
systems, on demand infrastructure services 
and carbon footprint measurement.
Helping our customers improve their 
environmental efﬁ ciency
As an IT services provider, we recognise that 
Corporate Responsibility isn’t only about our 
own internal business. We are continually 
looking to help our customers reduce their 
impact on the environment. In May 2008 
we implemented a European award winning 
energy efﬁ ciency management solution with 
Växjö Energi in Sweden, introducing competition 
in energy saving between customers. Our 
Total Invoice Management solution saves our 
customers 17,000 tonnes of CO
2
e every year, 
as e-invoices can save up to 75% of the CO
2
e 
emitted in the invoicing process.
 Throughout 2008 we have been successful 
in achieving external recognition for our 
environmental credentials: Logica is ranked 
as one of the UK’s Top 20 Best Green 
Companies in the Times newspaper index, 
is rated as a leader in the Climate Change 
Disclosure Leadership Index compiled by the 
Carbon Disclosure Project and is in the Top 10 
Greenest Outsource Provider worldwide, 
compiled by Black Book in a survey of 4,200 
outsourcing customers, for the second 
successive year. Logica in the Netherlands 
was also ranked number one by the Carbon 
Disclosure Project’s Leadership Index, 
for transparency and completeness of 
our submission. 70 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008
Through 2009 we will embark on a 
programme to build a clear and compelling 
brand positioning for Logica. Our intention 
is to set out clearly for our stakeholders the 
inspiring idea behind the Logica brand that 
will drive our communications, culture, 
offerings and capabilities – and then to turn 
this into reality across the business. Our 
ambition is to use this as a mechanism to 
build preference for Logica amongst our 
principal stakeholders. 
 In 2008 we held  a competition 
for all employees called ‘Storyshare’. This 
culminated in a ‘Reward and Recognition’ 
event, hosted by Logica’s CEO, Andy Green. 
The event was held to recognise those 
employees who have demonstrated the 
essential behaviours that underpin our core 
values and who prioritise the needs 
of our customers. During 2009 we are 
launching a new global recognition 
programme which will enable all managers to 
recognise and reward any individual or team 
who has demonstrated these core values.
There is still progress to make on some of 
the key indicators, but we had some notable 
successes in 2008. We are particularly 
pleased with the increasing participation in 
the annual staff survey and are taking very 
seriously the action plans that have been put 
in place based on the feedback we have 
received.

Retention and Development of our staff is a 
key strategic issue for Logica and through the 
Logica University which we launched in 2006 
as the umbrella for our international employee 
development programme, we will continue to 
develop and run our portfolio of programmes.
 E-learning is available to all staff and we 
saw a 28% increase in staff using this facility 
in 2008. 
In 2009 our priorities will be to:
  Integrate all aspects our CR programme 
across the Group so that we run one 
holistic approach to CR
  Increase the transparency in our CR. 
We will be reporting via the indices 
outlined in the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) which will be available on our 
internet from June 2009
  Implement reporting mechanisms for 
all CR activities
  Increase employee communication 
regarding our commitment to the United 
Nations Global Compact 
  Increase environmental awareness and 
action amongst our people both in the 
ofﬁ ce and at home.
Making a positive difference 
to the community
Logica believes that being active in the 
wider community is an essential part of 
our business. Given Logica’s role in the 
knowledge economy, our community activity 
focuses on educational programmes, 
particularly those targeted at young people. 
We support projects that actively involve our 
people and, where possible, make use of 
their expertise. 
 We have an established Group-wide 
community steering committee which 
regularly shares best practices from our 
community projects around the world. 
 France, India, Philippines, Netherlands 
and Portugal have developed local and/or 
international activities in line with our 
international policy. This framework enables 
countries to partake in local or global 
volunteering, fundraising or charity donations; 
appropriate to their culture and needs of staff.

Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Logica plc
We have audited the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements of Logica plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2008 which comprise 
the consolidated income statement, the 
consolidated statement of recognised income 
and expense, the consolidated balance 
sheet, the consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement 
and the related notes. These Group ﬁ nancial 
statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein.
 We have reported separately on the parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements of Logica plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2008 and on 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been 
audited.
Respective responsibilities of 
Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing 
the annual report and the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union are set out in the statement 
of directors’ responsibilities.
 Our responsibility is to audit the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). This report, including the 
opinion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body 
in accordance with Section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
 We report to you our opinion as to whether 
the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and 
fair view and whether the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the 
information given in the report of the Directors 
is consistent with the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements. The information given in the 
report of the Directors includes that speciﬁ c 
information that is cross referred from the 
Business Review section of the report of the 
Directors.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, 
we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding 
directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
 We review whether the corporate 
governance report reﬂ ects the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the 
Combined Code (2006) speciﬁ ed for our 
review by the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority, and we report if it does 
not. We are not required to consider whether 
the Board’s statements on internal control 
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures.
 We read other information contained in 
the annual report and consider whether it is 
consistent with the audited Group ﬁ nancial 
statements. The other information comprises 
only the information listed on the contents 
page under the headings This is Logica, 
Business review, Governance (excluding the 
audited parts of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report), Responsibility, Shareholder 
information and Key Performance Indicators. 
We consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the Group ﬁ nancial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other 
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to 
the amounts and disclosures in the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates 
and judgments made by the directors in the 
preparation of the Group ﬁ nancial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
 
We planned and performed our audit so as to 
obtain all the information and explanations 
which we considered necessary in order to 
provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give 
reasonable assurance that the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our 
opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true 
and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, of 
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2008 and of its proﬁ t and 
cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended;
  the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation; and
  the information given in the report of the 
Directors is consistent with the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements.

2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These consolidated ﬁ nancial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
(EU), IFRIC interpretations and those parts 
of the Companies Act 1985 (the Act) that 
remain applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRSs. 
 The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements 
have been prepared under the going concern 
basis and under the historical cost convention 
with the exception of forward contracts and 
the convertible bond which are measured at 
fair value, as disclosed in the accounting 
policies below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include 
those of the Company and all of its subsidiary 
undertakings (together, ‘the Group’), and the 
Group’s share of the results of associates and 
joint ventures. Investments in associates and 
joint ventures are accounted for using the 
equity method.
 Subsidiary undertakings are those entities 
controlled directly or indirectly by the 
Company. Control arises when the Company 
has the ability to direct the ﬁ nancial and 
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
beneﬁ ts from its activities.
 The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold 
are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the date of acquisition or up 
to the date of disposal respectively, using 
the same accounting policies as those of 
the Group. All business combinations are 
accounted for using the purchase method. 
 
On acquisition, the interest of any minority 
shareholders is stated at the minority’s 
proportion of the fair value of the assets and 
liabilities recognised. Subsequently, the 
minority interest in the consolidated balance 
sheet reﬂ ects the minority’s proportion of 
changes in the net assets of the subsidiary. 
A minority interest is not recognised in a 
subsidiary with net liabilities except to the 
extent that the minority has a binding 
obligation, and is able to make an additional 
investment, to cover cumulative losses.
 All intercompany transactions and 
balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations
Non-current assets and disposal groups are 
classiﬁ ed as held for sale in the balance sheet 
if their carrying amount will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than ongoing 
use but only if the sale is highly probable 
and is expected to complete within one year 
from the date of classiﬁ cation. Non-current 
assets and disposal groups held for sale 
are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell.
 The results of an operation that represents 
a separate major line of business and either 
has been disposed of during the year or is 
classiﬁ ed as held for sale, are classiﬁ ed as 
discontinued operations. The post-tax proﬁ t 
or loss of the discontinued operation, plus the 
post-tax gain or loss recognised on the 
measurement of the assets and liabilities 
within the disposal group at fair value less 
costs to sell, is presented as a single amount 
on the face of the income statement.
Intangible assets
All intangible assets, except goodwill, are 
stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is not amortised and is stated at 
cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s 
interest in the identiﬁ able assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities acquired in a 
business combination and the excess of the 
consideration paid for an increase in stake in 
an existing subsidiary over the share of the 
carrying value of net assets acquired. 
Development costs
Expenditure incurred in the development of 
software products or enhancements, and 
their related intellectual property rights, is 
capitalised as an intangible asset only when 
the future economic beneﬁ ts expected to 
arise are deemed probable and the costs can 
be reliably measured. Development costs not 
meeting these criteria, and all research costs, 
are expensed in the income statement as 
incurred. Capitalised development costs are 
amortised on a straight line basis over their 
useful economic lives once the related 
software product or enhancement is available 
for use.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets purchased separately, 
such as software licences that do not form 
an integral part of related hardware, are 
capitalised at cost and amortised over their 
useful economic life. Intangible assets 
acquired through a business combination are 
initially measured at fair value and amortised 
over their useful economic lives. 
 The useful economic lives of the other 
intangible assets are as follows:
 Brand names 3–5 years
 Software products 
 recognised on acquisition 3–7 years
 Purchased computer software 3 years
Customer contracts and relationships are 
amortised over their useful economic life 
which are between ﬁ ve and eight years, 
except for one contract in the International 
category which has a useful life of 10 years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. The cost 
of an item of property, plant and equipment 
comprises its purchase price and any costs 
directly attributable to bringing the asset 
into use.
 Depreciation is calculated on a straight-
line basis to write down the assets to their 
estimated residual value over their useful 
economic lives at the following annual rates:
 Furniture 10–20%
 Computer equipment 25–33%
 Partitions and ofﬁ ce equipment 10–20%
 Motor vehicles 25%
 Freehold property 2%
  Leasehold equipment 
 and plant Life of lease
The residual values and useful economic lives 
of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
annually. Freehold land and properties under 
construction are not depreciated. Borrowing 
costs related to the purchase of ﬁ xed assets 
are not capitalised.
Leases
Leases are classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nance leases 
whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are 
classiﬁ ed as operating leases.
Financial statements 78 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

2. Accounting policies
(continued)
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases are initially 
recognised as property, plant and equipment 
at an amount equal to the fair value of the 
leased assets or, if lower, the present value of 
minimum lease payments at the inception of 
the lease, and then depreciated over their 
useful economic lives. Lease payments are 
apportioned between repayment of capital 
and interest. The capital element of future 
lease payments is included in the balance 
sheet as a liability. Interest is charged to the 
income statement so as to achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability.
 Rentals payable under operating leases 
are charged to the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Operating lease incentives are recognised 
as a reduction in the rental expense over the 
lease term.
Impairment of non-current assets
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units 
for the purpose of impairment testing. The 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the goodwill relates is tested 
annually for impairment or when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that it 
might be impaired. The carrying values of 
property, plant and equipment, investments 
measured using a cost basis and intangible 
assets other than goodwill are reviewed for 
impairment only when events indicate the 
carrying value may be impaired.
 In an impairment test, the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit or asset 
is estimated to determine the extent of any 
impairment loss. The recoverable amount 
is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and the value in use to the Group. An 
impairment loss is recognised to the extent 
that the carrying value exceeds the 
recoverable amount.
 In determining a cash-generating unit’s 
or asset’s value in use, estimated future cash 
ﬂ ows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ ects 
current market assessments of the time 
value of money and risks speciﬁ c to the 
cash-generating unit or asset that have 
not already been included in the estimate 
of future cash ﬂ ows.
Inventories
Inventories represent computer equipment 
that, at the balance sheet date, had not 
yet been allocated to a speciﬁ c customer 
contract and materials, including work-in-
progress, used in document printing 
and ﬁ nishing.
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost comprises direct 
materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been 
incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Cost is 
calculated using the ﬁ rst-in-ﬁ rst-out (FIFO) 
method. Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price less costs to be 
incurred in marketing, distribution and sale.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially 
at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. 
A provision for impairment of trade 
receivables is established when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will 
probably not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. Signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial difﬁ culty 
of the debtor, probability that the debtor will 
enter bankruptcy or ﬁ nancial reorganisation 
and default or delinquency in payments are 
considered indicators that the trade 
receivable is impaired. 
 The amount of the impairment is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying value 
and the present value of estimated future 
cash ﬂ ows, discounted at the ﬁ nancial asset’s 
original effective interest rate. The carrying 
amount of the trade receivable is reduced 
through the use of a provision account and 
the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
income statement within net operating costs. 
When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the 
provision account for trade receivables. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against net operating 
costs in the income statement.
 A trade or other receivable is derecognised 
from the balance sheet when the Group 
enters into a ﬁ nancing transaction which 
transfers to a third party all signiﬁ cant rights 
or other access to beneﬁ ts relating to that 
asset and all signiﬁ cant exposures to the risks 
inherent in that asset.
 Amounts recoverable on contracts 
represent revenue which has not yet been 
invoiced to customers on ﬁ xed price 
contracts. Such amounts are separately 
disclosed within trade and other receivables. 
The valuation of amounts recoverable on 
contracts is adjusted to take up proﬁ t to date 
or foreseeable losses in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policy for proﬁ t 
recognition.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are recognised initially at 
fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Financial instruments
The following policies for ﬁ nancial instruments 
have been applied in the preparation of the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of preparation of the cash 
ﬂ ow statement, cash and cash equivalents 
include cash at bank and in hand, and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity 
period of three months or less. Bank 
overdrafts that are an integral part of a 
subsidiary’s cash management are included 
in cash and cash equivalents where they have 
a legal right of offset against positive cash 
balances, otherwise bank overdrafts are 
classiﬁ ed as borrowings in the balance sheet.
Borrowings  
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair 
value, net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated either 
at amortised cost or, if designated as such, 
at fair value through proﬁ t or loss.
 For borrowings stated at amortised cost, 
any difference between the proceeds, net of 
transaction costs, and the redemption value 
is recognised in the income statement over 
the period of the borrowings using the 
effective interest rate method.
 The Group’s euro-denominated convertible 
bonds have been designated as a ﬁ nancial 
liability at fair value through proﬁ t or loss. 
The change in the fair value of the convertible 
bonds that reﬂ ects the movement in the 
quoted market price of the convertible bonds 
is recognised in the income statement as 
either interest income or expense. The 
change in fair value relating to the movement 
of the exchange rate between the euro and 
pounds sterling is treated as a hedge of net 
investments in foreign operations (see below). 
Foreign exchange gains and losses on the 
convertible bonds are taken directly to equity 
to the extent that the hedge is effective. 
Any resulting ineffectiveness is recognised 
directly in the income statement. These were 
redeemed in September 2008.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and 
hedging activities  
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date a contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at fair value. The 
fair values of derivatives are measured using 
observable market prices or, where market 
prices are not available, by using discounted 
expected future cash ﬂ ows at prevailing 
interest and exchange rates. The gain or loss 
on re-measurement is taken to the income 
statement except where the derivative is 
part of a designated cash ﬂ ow hedge or 
a designated hedge of a net investment in 
a foreign operation. 79
Financial statements
2. Accounting policies
(continued)
The effective portion of changes in the fair 
value of derivatives that are designated and 
qualify as a cash ﬂ ow hedge of a ﬁ rm 
commitment or highly probable forecasted 
transaction are recognised directly in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion of a cash ﬂ ow hedge is recognised 
immediately within operating proﬁ t in the 
income statement.
 If the hedged item results in the 
recognition of an asset or liability, then the 
associated gains or losses on the derivative 
that had previously been recognised in equity 
are included in the measurement of the 
asset or liability at the time the asset or 
liability is recognised. For hedged items that 
do not result in the recognition of an asset 
or a liability, amounts deferred in equity 
are transferred to the income statement 
in the same period as the underlying 
transaction occurs.
 Where the Group hedges net investments 
in foreign entities through currency 
borrowings or derivative ﬁ nancial instruments, 
the gains or losses on the translation of the 
borrowings or change in fair value of the 
derivative, to the extent the hedge is effective, 
are recognised in equity. Gains and losses 
accumulated in equity are included in the 
income statement when the foreign operation 
is disposed of.
 Changes in the fair value of derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments that are not designated 
as hedging instruments or do not qualify for 
hedge accounting are recognised in the 
income statement as they arise. Changes in 
the fair value of derivatives or other hedging 
instruments transacted as hedges of ﬁ nancial 
items are recognised in ﬁ nance costs/income 
in the income statement as they arise. Any 
resulting ineffectiveness is recognised directly 
in the income statement.
Financial assets
The Group classiﬁ es its ﬁ nancial assets in 
the following categories: at fair value through 
proﬁ t or loss, loans and receivables and 
available-for-sale. The classiﬁ cation depends 
on the purpose for which the ﬁ nancial assets 
were acquired. Management determines the 
classiﬁ cation of its ﬁ nancial assets at initial 
recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁ t 
or loss
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁ t 
or loss are ﬁ nancial assets held for trading 
or designated as such on initial recognition. 
A ﬁ nancial asset is classiﬁ ed in this category 
if acquired principally for the purpose of selling 
in the short term. Financial assets at fair value 
through proﬁ t or loss are stated at fair value, 
with any resultant gain or loss recognised in 
the income statement. 
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other 
receivables that have ﬁ xed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active 
market are classiﬁ ed as loans and 
receivables. Loans and receivables are 
included in current assets, except for 
maturities greater than 12 months after the 
balance sheet date, which are classiﬁ ed as 
non-current assets. Loans and receivables 
are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment 
and are classiﬁ ed as trade and other 
receivables in the balance sheet.
Available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets
Available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets are 
non-derivative ﬁ nancial assets that are either 
designated in this category or not classiﬁ ed 
in any of the other categories. Such ﬁ nancial 
assets are included in non-current assets 
unless management intends to dispose of the 
investment within 12 months of the balance 
sheet date.
 Unlisted and listed shares held by the 
Group that are traded in an active market are 
classiﬁ ed as being available-for-sale ﬁ nancial 
assets and are stated at fair values. The fair 
values of quoted shares are based on current 
bid prices. If the market for a ﬁ nancial asset 
is not active (unlisted shares), the Group 
establishes fair value by using valuation 
techniques. These include the use of recent 
arm’s length transactions, reference to other 
instruments that are substantially the same, 
discounted cash ﬂ ow analysis and option 
pricing models. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are recognised directly 
in equity with the exception of impairment 
losses, interest calculated using the effective 
interest method and foreign exchange gains 
and losses on monetary assets, which are 
recognised directly in the income statement.
Impairment of ﬁ nancial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet 
date whether there is objective evidence that 
a ﬁ nancial asset or group of ﬁ nancial assets is 
impaired. For unlisted shares classiﬁ ed as 
available-for-sale, a signiﬁ cant prolonged 
decline in the fair value of the security below 
its cost is considered as an indicator that the 
securities are impaired. 
 If any such evidence exists for available-
for-sale ﬁ nancial assets, the cumulative loss 
– measured as the difference between the 
acquisition cost and the current fair values, 
less any impairment loss on those ﬁ nancial 
assets previously recognised in proﬁ t or loss 
– is removed from equity and recognised in 
the income statement. Impairment losses 
recognised in the income statement on 
equity instruments are not reversed through 
the income statement. The carrying amount 
of the ﬁ nancial assets is reduced by the 
impairment loss directly for all ﬁ nancial assets 
with the exception of trade receivables, where 
the carrying amount is reduced through the 
use of a provision account.
 Impairment testing of trade receivables is 
described above.
Taxation
Current tax is recognised based on the 
amounts expected to be paid or recovered 
under the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
 Deferred tax is provided in full on 
temporary differences that arise between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for ﬁ nancial reporting purposes and their 
corresponding tax bases. Deferred tax is 
recorded on all temporary differences except 
in respect of investments in subsidiaries and 
joint ventures where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary difference is controlled by 
the Group and it is probable that it will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable 
proﬁ ts will be available against which the 
asset can be offset.
 Deferred tax is measured on an 
undiscounted basis using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
 Current and deferred tax are recognised 
in the income statement, except when the tax 
relates to items charged or credited directly 
to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt 
with directly in equity.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised for restructuring 
costs when the Group has a detailed formal 
plan for the restructuring that has been 
communicated to affected employees. 
Provisions are recognised for future 
committed property lease payments when the 
Group receives no beneﬁ t from the property 
through continuing usage and future receipts 
from any sub-letting arrangements are not 
in excess of the Group’s future committed 
payments.
 Where the time value of money is material, 
provisions are measured at the present value 
of expenditures expected to be paid in 
settlement.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁ ed as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the 
issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction from the proceeds. 80 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

Foreign currencies
The presentation currency of the Group is 
pounds sterling. The Group also presents 
primary statements in euros, see pages 138 
to 140.
 Items included in the separate ﬁ nancial 
statements of Group entities are measured 
in the functional currency of each entity. 
Transactions denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional 
currency of the entity at the rates prevailing 
at the dates of the individual transactions. 
Foreign currency monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated at the rates prevailing 
at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains 
and losses arising are charged or credited to 
net operating costs or ﬁ nance costs/income 
in the income statement, as appropriate, 
except when deferred in equity as qualifying 
cash ﬂ ow hedges and qualifying net 
investment hedges.
 The income statement and balance sheet 
of foreign entities are translated into pounds 
sterling on consolidation at the average rates 
for the period and the rates prevailing at the 
balance sheet date respectively. Exchange 
gains and losses arising on the translation of 
the Group’s net investment in foreign entities, 
and of ﬁ nancial instruments designated as 
hedges of such investments, are recognised 
as a separate component of shareholders’ 
equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the 
cumulative translation differences are recycled 
to the income statement and recognised as 
part of the gain or loss on disposal.
 Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on the acquisition of a foreign entity are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the rates prevailing at 
the balance sheet date.
 The most important foreign currencies for 
the Group are the euro and the Swedish 
krona. The relevant exchange rates to pounds 
sterling were as shown below:
Government grants 
Grants related to assets are recognised 
initially as deferred income and subsequently 
credited to the income statement on the same 
basis that the related assets are depreciated. 
Grants related to income are credited to the 
income statement over the periods to match 
them with the related costs which they are 
intended to compensate.
Revenue and proﬁ t recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of 
consideration received or receivable from 
clients for goods and services provided by 
the Group, net of discounts, VAT and other 
sales-related taxes. Where the time value 
of money is material, revenue is recognised 
as the present value of the cash inﬂ ows 
expected to be received from the customer 
in settlement.
 Revenue from the sale of software 
products or hardware with no signiﬁ cant 
service obligation is recognised 100% on 
delivery. Revenue from the sale of software 
products or hardware requiring signiﬁ cant 
modiﬁ cation, integration or customisation 
is recognised using the percentage of 
completion method.
 The revenue and proﬁ t of contracts 
for the supply of professional services at 
predetermined rates is recognised as and 
when the work is performed, irrespective 
of the duration of the contract.
 The revenue and proﬁ t on ﬁ xed price 
contracts is recognised on a percentage 
of completion basis when the outcome 
of a contract can be estimated reliably. 
A contract’s outcome is deemed to be 
capable of reliable estimation at the earlier 
of six months from contract commencement 
and the date at which the contract is 50% 
complete. If a contract outcome cannot be 
estimated reliably, revenues are recognised 
equal to costs incurred, to the extent that 
costs are expected to be recovered.
 The stage of contract completion is 
determined by reference to the costs of 
professional services incurred to date as 
a proportion of the total estimated costs 
of professional services, except in rare 
circumstances when measuring the stage of 
contract completion using total contract costs 
is more representative of the work performed, 
in which case total contract costs are used. 
Where a contract contains multiple elements, 
the individual elements are accounted for 
separately where appropriate.
 Provision is made for all foreseeable future 
losses in the period in which it is identiﬁ ed.
Segment reporting
At 31 December 2008, Logica was organised 
into six geographical segments based on the 
location of assets. These segments are the 
Group’s primary reporting format for segment 
information as they represent the dominant 
source and the nature of the Group’s risks and 
returns. The Group’s secondary reporting 
format is by vertical market.
 Inter-segment sales are charged at arm’s 
length prices. Segment assets include all 
intangible assets, property, plant and 
equipment, inventories and trade and other 
receivables but exclude tax assets, derivative 
ﬁ nancial assets and cash and cash 
equivalents. Segment liabilities comprise 
mainly trade and other payables, retirement 
beneﬁ t obligations and certain borrowings 
that can be attributed to the segment but 
exclude tax liabilities, derivative ﬁ nancial 
liabilities and borrowings that are for general 
corporate purposes. Capital expenditure 
comprises additions to property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets. Total assets 
are allocated based on where the assets are 
located.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items fall within operating and 
ﬁ nancial activities of the Group but are 
identiﬁ ed as exceptional items by virtue of 
their size, nature or incidence. These items 
are disclosed in aggregate on the face of the 
income statement to aid an understanding 
of the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance.
 Transactions which may give rise to 
exceptional items are principally gains or 
losses on disposals of investments or 
subsidiaries, major restructuring programmes 
or costs of integrating acquired businesses.

Employee beneﬁ ts
Retirement beneﬁ ts
The Group operates retirement beneﬁ t plans 
of both a deﬁ ned contribution and deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t nature. Retirement beneﬁ t plans that 
are funded by the payment of insurance 
premiums are treated as deﬁ ned contribution 
plans unless the Group has an obligation 
either to pay the beneﬁ ts directly when they 
fall due or to pay further amounts if assets 
accumulated with the insurer do not cover 
all future employee beneﬁ ts. In such 
circumstances, the plan is treated as a 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan.
 The cost of deﬁ ned contribution plans is 
charged to the income statement on the basis 
of contributions payable by the Group during 
the year.
 For deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans, the deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. The retirement beneﬁ t liability 
in the balance sheet represents the present 
value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation as 
reduced by the fair value of plan assets and 
unrecognised past service cost. A retirement 
beneﬁ t asset is recognised to the extent that 
the Group can beneﬁ t from refunds or a 
reduction in future contributions.
 Insurance policies are treated as plan 
assets of a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan if the 
proceeds of the policy:
  can only be used to fund employee beneﬁ ts;
  are not available to the Group’s creditors; 
and
  either cannot be paid to the Group unless 
the proceeds represent surplus assets not 
needed to meet all the beneﬁ t obligations 
or are a reimbursement for beneﬁ ts already 
paid by the Group.
Insurance policies that do not meet the 
above criteria are treated as non-current 
investments and are held at fair value as an 
available-for-sale ﬁ nancial asset in the 
balance sheet.
 The current service cost is recognised in 
the income statement as an employee beneﬁ t 
expense. The interest cost resulting from the 
increase in the present value of the deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t obligation over time and the expected 
return on plan assets, is recognised as net 
interest expense or income. The expected 
return on plan assets is, for UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension schemes, shown net of an expected 
reduction for payments to the Pension 
Protection Fund (the ‘PPF levy’). The difference 
between the actual and expected PPF levy is 
treated as an actuarial gain or loss.
 
A past service cost is recognised immediately 
to the extent that beneﬁ ts have already 
vested, or is otherwise amortised on 
a straight-line basis over the average period 
until the beneﬁ ts vest.
 Actuarial gains and losses arising from 
experience adjustments or changes in 
actuarial assumptions are charged or credited 
in the statement of recognised income and 
expense in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payment
The cost of share-based employee 
compensation arrangements, whereby 
employees receive remuneration in the form 
of shares or share options, is recognised 
as an employee beneﬁ t expense in the 
income statement.
 The total expense to be apportioned over 
the vesting period of the beneﬁ t is determined 
by reference to the fair value at the grant 
date of the shares or share options awarded 
and the number that are expected to vest. 
The assumptions underlying the number of 
awards expected to vest are subsequently 
adjusted to reﬂ ect conditions prevailing at the 
balance sheet date. At the vesting date of an 
award, the cumulative expense is adjusted to 
take account of the awards that actually vest.
Short-term compensated absences
A liability for short-term compensated 
absences, such as holiday, is recognised for 
the amount the Group may be required to pay 
as a result of the unused entitlement that has 
accumulated at the balance sheet date.
Death-in-service beneﬁ ts
Insured death-in-service beneﬁ ts are accounted 
for as deﬁ ned contribution arrangements. 
Death-in-service beneﬁ ts for which the Group 
does not have insurance cover are accounted 
for as deﬁ ned beneﬁ t arrangements.
Employee share ownership trusts
Employee share ownership plan (ESOP) 
trusts, which purchase and hold ordinary 
shares of the Company in connection with 
certain employee share plans, are 
consolidated in the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements. Any consideration paid or 
received by ESOP trusts for the purchase or 
sale of the Company’s own shares is shown 
as a movement in shareholders’ equity.
Dividends
Dividends to the Company’s shareholders 
are recognised as a liability and deducted 
from shareholders’ equity in the period in 
which the shareholders’ right to receive 
payment is established. 
3. Adoption of new and 
revised International 
Financial Reporting 
Standards
The accounting policies adopted in these 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are 
consistent with those of the annual ﬁ nancial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 
2007, with the exception of  the following 
standards, amendments to and 
interpretations of published standards 
adopted during the year:
  IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury 
share transactions’.
  IFRIC 14, ‘IAS 19 – The limit of a deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t asset, minimum funding 
requirements and their interaction’.
The following interpretation is effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2008, but is yet to be endorsed 
by the European Union.
  IFRIC 12, ‘Service concession 
arrangements’.
The above standards, amendments to and 
interpretation of published standards had 
no material impact on the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements. 
 The following new standards, amendments 
to and interpretations have been issued but 
are not effective for 2008 and have not been 
early adopted. No signiﬁ cant impact on the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements is expected.
  IAS 1 (Amendment), ‘Presentation of 
ﬁ nancial statements’, effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009. The amendment may 
result in additional disclosure.
  IAS 23 (Amendment), ‘Borrowing costs’, 
effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2009. 
  IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’, effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009. The main impact would 
be that operating segments would be 
identiﬁ ed, and segment information 
provided, on the same basis as is used 
internally for evaluating segment 
performance and allocating resources. 
Reconciliations would be provided of total 
segment revenues, proﬁ t, assets, liabilities 
and other amounts to the corresponding 
amounts in the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements, together with an explanation 
of any differences in measurement basis. 
The Group’s operating segments are 
expected to remain unchanged on 
adoption of the interpretation. 82 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

3. Adoption of new and 
revised International 
Financial Reporting 
Standards 
(continued)
  IFRIC 13, ‘Customer loyalty programmes’, 
effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2008. Management does 
not expect this interpretation to be relevant 
to the Group.
  IAS 20 (Amendment), ‘Accounting for 
government grants and disclosure of 
government assistance’, effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009.
  IAS 16 (Amendment), ‘Property, plant 
and equipment’, effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2009.
The following new revisions and amendments 
to standards, and interpretations have been 
issued but are not effective for 2008, have yet 
to be endorsed by the European Union and 
have not been early adopted. No signiﬁ cant 
impact on the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements is expected.
  IAS 32 (Amendment), ‘Financial 
instruments: presentation’, and 
consequential amendments to IAS 1, 
‘Presentation of ﬁ nancial statements’, 
effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2009. 
  IAS 1 (Revised), ‘Presentation of 
ﬁ nancial statements’ effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2009. 
  IFRS 2 (Amendment), ‘Share-based 
payment’, effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The 
amendment to the standard limits vesting 
conditions to service conditions and 
performance conditions. The amendment 
also speciﬁ es that all cancellations, 
whether by the entity or by other parties, 
should receive the same accounting 
treatment, i.e. acceleration of the expense 
based on the grant date fair value. 
  IAS 28 (Amendment), ‘Investments in 
associates’, effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2009. The amendment to the standard 
requires that an investment in associate is 
treated as a single asset for the purposes 
of impairment testing. Any impairment is 
not allocated to speciﬁ c assets included 
within the investment, and reversals of 
impairment are recorded as an adjustment 
to the investment balance to the extent 
that the recoverable amount of the 
associate increases. 
  IAS 36 (Amendment), ‘Impairment of 
assets’, effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009. 
Where fair value less costs to sell is 
calculated on the basis of discounted cash 
ﬂ ows, disclosures equivalent to those for 
value-in-use calculation should be made. 
  IAS 38 (Amendment), ‘Intangible assets’, 
effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2009. 
  IAS 19 (Amendment), ‘Employee beneﬁ ts’, 
effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2009. 
  IAS 39 (Amendment), ‘Financial instruments: 
Recognition and measurement’, effective 
for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2009.
  IFRIC 16, ‘Hedges of a net investment 
in a foreign operation’, effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 October 2008. The interpretation clariﬁ es 
the accounting treatment in respect of 
net investment hedging, including the 
fact that net investment hedging relates 
to differences in functional currency not 
presentation currency, and hedging 
instruments may be held anywhere in the 
Group. The requirements of IAS 21, ‘The 
effects of changes in foreign exchange 
rates’, apply to the hedged item. 
The following new revisions and amendments 
to standards have been issued but are not 
effective for 2008, have yet to be endorsed 
by the European Union and have not been 
early adopted. 
  IAS 27 (Revised), ‘Consolidated and 
Separate Financial Statements’, effective 
for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 July 2009. The revised standard 
must be applied prospectively and 
requires that acquisitions and disposals 
that do not result in a change of control are 
accounted for within equity. Any difference 
between the change in the minority interest 
and the fair value of the consideration paid 
or received is recognised directly in equity 
and attributed to the owners of the parent. 
  IFRS 3 (Revised), ‘Business combinations’, 
must be applied prospectively by the 
Group from 1 January 2010. The revised 
standard requires that all acquisition-
related costs are to be expensed to the 
income statement in the period incurred. 
Furthermore, purchase accounting only 
applies at the point when control is 
achieved. This has a number of 
implications:
 –  where the acquirer has a pre-existing 
equity interest in the entity acquired and 
increases its equity interest such that 
it achieves control, it must re-measure 
its previously-held equity interest to fair 
value as at the date of obtaining control 
and recognise any resulting gain or loss 
in the income statement
 –  once control is achieved all other 
increases and decreases in ownership 
interest are treated as transactions 
among equity holders and reported 
directly within equity. Goodwill is not 
re-measured or adjusted.
  IFRS 5 (Amendment), ‘Non-current assets 
held for sale and discontinued operations’, 
effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2009. The amendment 
clariﬁ es that all of a subsidiary’s assets 
and liabilities are classiﬁ ed as held for sale 
if a partial disposal sale plan results in loss 
of control. Relevant disclosure should be 
made for this subsidiary if the deﬁ nition 
of a discontinued operation is met.  83

4. Key areas of estimation 
uncertainty
In preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements, management has to make 
judgements on how to apply the Group’s 
accounting policies and make estimates 
about the future. The critical judgements that 
have been made in arriving at the amounts 
recognised in the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements and the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty that have a signiﬁ cant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
value of assets and liabilities in the next 
ﬁ nancial year, are discussed below.
Revenue recognition
The revenue and proﬁ t of ﬁ xed price contracts 
is recognised on a percentage of completion 
basis when the outcome of a contract can be 
estimated reliably. Management exercises 
judgement in determining whether a 
contract’s outcome can be estimated reliably. 
Management also makes estimates of the 
total cost of professional services, or in some 
instances total contract costs, which are 
used in determining the value of amounts 
recoverable on contracts. Estimates are 
continually revised based on changes in the 
facts relating to each contract. The carrying 
amount of amounts recoverable on contracts 
is disclosed in Note 24.
Impairment of goodwill
The determination of whether or not goodwill 
has been impaired requires an estimate to 
be made of the value in use of the cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated. The value in use calculation 
includes estimates about the future ﬁ nancial 
performance of the cash-generating units, 
including management’s estimates of 
long-term operating margins and long-term 
growth rates. The carrying amount of goodwill 
and the key assumptions used in the 
calculation of value in use of cash-generating 
units to which goodwill is attributed are 
disclosed in Note 18. In determining the key 
assumptions, management have taken into 
consideration the current economic climate, 
the resulting impact on expected growth and 
discount rates, and the pressure this places 
on impairment calculations.
 If the estimated pre-tax discount rate 
applied to the discounted cash ﬂ ow of all 
cash-generating units were 1% higher than 
management’s estimates, the Group would 
not have recognised any goodwill impairment 
charge. If the long-term operating margin 
used in the value-in-use calculations for all 
cash-generating units were 1% lower than 
management’s estimates, the Group would 
not have recognised any goodwill impairment 
charge. If the long-term growth rate used in 
the value-in-use calculations for all cash-
generating units were 1% lower than 
management’s estimates, the Group 
would not have recognised any goodwill 
impairment charge.
Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans
The calculation of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
obligation of a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan requires 
estimation of future events, for example salary 
and pension increases, inﬂ ation and mortality 
rates. In the event that future experience does 
not bear out the estimates made in previous 
years, an adjustment will be made to the 
plan’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation in future 
periods which could have a material effect on 
the Group. The carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities relating to deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans, 
together with the key assumptions used in the 
calculation of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligations 
relating to those plans and sensitivity to those 
key assumptions are disclosed in Note 39.
Income taxes 
In recognising income tax assets and 
liabilities, management makes estimates 
of the likely outcome of decisions by tax 
authorities on transactions and events whose 
treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. 
Where the ﬁ nal outcome of such matters is 
different, or expected to be different, from 
previous assessments made by management, 
a change to the carrying value of income tax 
assets and liabilities will be recorded in the 
period in which such a determination is made. 
The carrying values of income tax assets and 
liabilities are disclosed separately in the 
consolidated balance sheet.
 If the actual ﬁ nal outcome on the 
judgement areas were to differ by 10% from 
management’s estimates, the Group would 
need to:
  increase the income and deferred tax 
liability by £10.6 million if unfavourable; or
  decrease the income and deferred tax 
liability by £7.6 million if favourable.
5. Restatement of balance 
sheet at 31 December 2007
Following the provisions of IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’ which permit the Group 12 
months to ﬁ nalise the fair values of the net 
assets acquired, the provisional fair values for 
the Medici Data Oy and the Karttakone Oy 
acquisitions (acquired 29 November 2007 and 
31 October 2007, respectively) were ﬁ nalised. 
As a result the fair value of net assets 
acquired increased by £3.6 million and the 
goodwill decreased by the same amount, 
compared to the amounts previously reported 
at 31 December 2007. Further details are 
provided at Note 37. 84 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

6. Segment information
At 31 December 2008, Logica was organised into six geographical segments based on the location of assets. These segments are the Group’s 
primary reporting format for segment information as they represent the dominant source and the nature of the Group’s risks and returns. 
Primary basis – geographical segments
Segment revenue and proﬁ t after tax under the primary reporting format are disclosed in the table below.

9. Adjusted operating proﬁ t
Adjusted operating proﬁ t excludes the results of discontinued operations, exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets initially 
recognised at fair value in a business combination, whenever such items occur. Adjusted operating proﬁ t is not deﬁ ned under IFRS and has been 
shown as the Directors consider this to be helpful for a better understanding of the performance of the Group’s underlying business. It may not 
be comparable with similarly titled proﬁ t measurements reported by other companies and is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, 
IFRS measures of proﬁ t.

The effective tax rate on continuing operations for the year, before the share of post-tax proﬁ ts from associates, exceptional items, mark-to-market 
loss on convertible bonds, and amortisation of intangible assets initially recognised on acquisition, was 22.5% (2007: 17.6%), of which a charge of 
£2.2 million (2007: £0.4 million credit) related to the United Kingdom. The effective tax rate for 2008 was higher than 2007 due to the use of 
signiﬁ cant unrecognised losses brought forward in 2007.
 The effective tax rate on exceptional items was 19.0% (2007: 9.5%) and the effective tax rate on amortisation of intangible assets initially 
recognised on acquisition was 31.5% (2007: 32.4%).

16. Dividends
The Directors are proposing a ﬁ nal dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2008 of 0.60p per share, which would reduce shareholders’ 
funds by approximately £9.5 million. The proposed dividend is subject to approval at the AGM on 30 April 2009 and has not been recognised as a 
liability in these ﬁ nancial statements. The ﬁ nal dividend will be paid on 1 May 2009 to shareholders listed on the share register on 14 April 2009.

Adjusted earnings per share, both basic and diluted, have been shown as the Directors consider this to be helpful for a better understanding 
of the performance of the Group’s underlying business. The earnings measure used in adjusted earnings per share excludes, whenever such 
items occur: the results of discontinued operations; exceptional items; mark-to-market gains or losses on ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities 
designated at fair value through proﬁ t or loss; and amortisation of intangible assets initially recognised at fair value in a business combination. 
All items adjusted are net of tax where applicable.
 The weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by employee share ownership plan (ESOP) trusts, which are treated as cancelled. 
 The convertible bonds were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended 
31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 as they were anti-dilutive; however, the convertible bonds were dilutive for the purposes of 
calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007. 
 The impact of the charge for share-based payments was to reduce adjusted basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2008 
by 0.7p per share (2007: 0.6p per share).

Goodwill impairment tests
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to one or more cash-generating units (CGUs). CGUs represent the operations of a 
country or, in more where appropriate, divisions within a country. The size of the CGU therefore varies, but is never larger than a reportable 
segment. The following table shows the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date by geographical business segment: 96 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

 An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or CGU to their recoverable amount. Where the 
recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of 
goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. At 30 September 2008, the recoverable amounts of 
CGUs were determined from value in use calculations. 
 During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting (2007: £nil).
 In all cases the approved budget for the following ﬁ nancial year formed the basis for the cash ﬂ ow projections for a CGU. The cash ﬂ ow 
projections in the four ﬁ nancial years following the budget year reﬂ ected management’s expectations of the medium-term operating performance 
of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
 The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth 
rate of net operating cash ﬂ ows. 
 The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet 
date and the risks speciﬁ c to the CGU. In determining the discount rate, management have applied an adjustment for risk of such companies 
relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies. The discount rates applied to 
the CGUs were in the range of 8.1% (2007: 9.5%) to 15.2% (2007: 15.4%). 
 The discount rates applied to the most signiﬁ cant CGUs were as follows:
        2008 2007
        % %
Nordics*       8.8 9.9
France        11.3 12.3
United Kingdom*       10.9 12.6
* Weighted average discount rate applied to CGUs in the Nordics and the United Kingdom.
The long-term operating margin assumed for a CGU’s operation is primarily based on past performance. The long-term operating margin refers to 
the margin on adjusted operating proﬁ t as described in Note 9. For those CGUs for which management has strong reason to believe that past 
operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins, expected future improvements from sustainable operating cost savings are also 
included in management’s assessment of the long-term operating margin. In such cases, these expected improvements exclude activities that 
would be deﬁ ned as restructuring and are independent of technological change or evolution in best practices that the Group could not predict or 
inﬂ uence. The long-term operating margins applied to CGUs were in the range of 6.0% (2007: 6.0%) to 10.0% (2007: 10.0%). 
 The long-term operating margins assumed for the most signiﬁ cant CGUs were as follows:
        2008 2007
        % %
Nordics*       10.0 10.0
France        10.0 10.0
United Kingdom*       10.0 10.0
* Long-term operating margin applied is the weighted average of the individual CGUs in the Nordics and the United Kingdom. 97
Financial statements
18. Goodwill
(continued)
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash ﬂ ows are assumed equal to the long-term growth rate in the Gross Domestic Product of the country 
in which the CGUs’ operations are undertaken, and were in the range of 1.9% (2007: 1.7%) to 5.1% (2007: 5.0%). 
 The long-term growth rates of net operating cash ﬂ ows assumed for the most signiﬁ cant CGUs were as follows:
        2008 2007
        % %
Nordics       2.5 2.5
France        3.0 3.1
United Kingdom       2.4 2.4
Where there is a reasonable possibility of a change to any key assumption, a sensitivity analysis has been prepared. In no instance does such a 
change result in an impairment charge.

The Group’s credit risk on trade and other receivables is primarily attributable to trade receivables and amounts recoverable on contracts. 
The Group has no signiﬁ cant concentrations of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated counterparties. The Directors 
estimate that the carrying value of ﬁ nancial assets within trade and other receivables approximated their fair value.
 The Group believes the carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other receivables by geographical location gives a fair presentation of the

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of 
the individual debtors. The Directors believe that there is no further provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. 
 The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in net operating costs in the income statement (Note 7). 
Unwind of discount is included in ﬁ nance costs in the income statement (Note 11). Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally 
written off, when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
 At 31 December 2008, trade receivables of £8.5 million (2007: £6.9 million) were either partially or fully impaired. The ageing of these receivables 
was as follows: 
        2008 2007

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivables mentioned above. The Group held no 
collateral as security.

Bank loans
At 31 December 2008, the Group had the following unsecured principal bank facilities:
  a €500 million multi-currency bank facility. The facility consists of a €200 million term loan maturing 26 November 2011 and a €300 million 
syndicated revolving credit facility maturing on 26 November 2013. At 31 December 2008, €200 million (£194.2 million) was drawn down under 
the facility (2007: nil) paying interest at an average rate of 6.744% (2007: nil); 
  a €348 million (£337.9 million) term loan maturing on 19 September 2010. At 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007, the term loan was 
drawn down in full paying interest at an average rate of 5.60% (2007: 4.97%); 
The obligations of the borrowers under the €500 million facility and the €348 million bank loan are guaranteed by the principal UK and Dutch 
trading subsidiaries, Logica UK Limited and Logica Nederland B.V. 
 At 31 December 2007 £25.0 million was drawn down under the £330 million multi-currency, syndicated revolving credit facility maturing on 
19 September 2010. This facility was cancelled and drawings were repaid in full on 5 December 2008. At 31 December 2007, SEK650 million 
(£50.5 million) was drawn on the £150 million syndicated revolving credit facility maturing on 19 November 2008. This facility was cancelled and 
drawings were repaid in full on 5 December 2008.
Convertible bonds
The €303.4 million convertible bond matured on 19 September 2008 and was repaid in full at par value. No bonds had been either converted 
or redeemed prior to maturity, (2007: nil). 
 The convertible bonds bore a ﬁ xed coupon rate of 2.875% per annum, payable annually in arrears, and were issued at par value of 
€303.4 million on 19 September 2003. Each €1,000 principal amount of a bond was convertible into one 2.875% exchangeable redeemable 
preference share of the issuer, Logica (Jersey) Limited, with paid-up value of €1,000 that would, in turn, have been exchangeable immediately 
for ordinary shares of Logica plc.
Finance lease obligations
The minimum lease payments under ﬁ nance leases, and their present value, fell due as follows:

26. Borrowings
(continued)
All borrowings
Bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes and other borrowings bear ﬂ oating rates of interest based on LIBOR or foreign equivalents appropriate to 
the country in which the borrowing is incurred, and thus expose the Group to cash ﬂ ow interest rate risk. The ﬁ nance lease obligations bear ﬁ xed 
rates of interest and therefore expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
 All borrowings are denominated in the borrowing entity’s functional currency except for certain amounts drawn down under the revolving credit 
facility and term loans. Borrowings not denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing company are designated as hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations (see Note 27) and therefore only expose the Group to income statement foreign currency risk to the extent that 
the hedge is ineffective. 
 The Directors have estimated the fair value of the Group’s borrowings as follows:
        2008 2007
        £’m £’m
Bank overdrafts       5.4 9.1
Bank loans       548.5 354.7

Convertible bonds       – 220.0
Other borrowings       3.6 0.9
        564.8 591.7
Fair value has been estimated by discounting the cash ﬂ ows relating to borrowings at the market rate at the balance sheet date or, for the quoted 
instruments, by reference to the prevailing market price and exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Financial risk management
The multinational nature of the Group’s operations and their ﬁ nancing exposes it to a variety of ﬁ nancial risks. The principal risks that the 
Group is exposed to are capital risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s policies with respect 
to managing those risks in both the current and prior year are set out below. The Group does not undertake any trading or speculative activity 
in ﬁ nancial instruments. 
 The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding and foreign exchange management. The Group’s treasury 
function operates within policies and procedures that are formally approved by the Board, which include strict controls on the use of ﬁ nancial 
instruments in managing the Group’s risks. The policies provide written principles on net debt management, currency mix of debt, central funding 
liquidity, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, bonds and guarantees, and cash investment and counterparty limits. Compliance with key policies 
and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a regular basis.
Capital risk management
The Group’s policy on capital structure is to keep the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation below a target 
level reviewed by the Board. The target is comfortably below the covenants contained within the Group’s banking facilities. 105

27. Financial instruments

Foreign exchange risk
The Group has operations in many countries worldwide, exposing the Group to foreign exchange risk on the translation of the income statement 
and balance sheet of foreign operations into pounds sterling. Operations are also subject to foreign exchange risk from committed transactions 
denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and, once recognised, the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets 
and liabilities.
 The translation of the balance sheets of overseas operations has been partially hedged by managing the currency mix of the Group’s 
borrowings. The Group used euro and Swedish krona borrowings to hedge the balance sheet translation of operations with the euro and Swedish 
krona as their functional currency. The Group does not hedge the foreign exchange risk relating to the translation of the income statements of 
overseas operations.
 To mitigate foreign exchange risk arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency, assets and 
liabilities not denominated in the functional currencies are hedged economically by means of forward contracts. The Group has not applied hedge 
accounting to these contracts. The Group treasury’s risk management policy requires all companies in the Group to hedge their material assets 
and liability exposures in full by using forward contracts. Additionally, where material, the Group hedges its contracted future project cash ﬂ ows in 
foreign currencies by using forward contracts. Group treasury is the only entity in the Group allowed to transact external foreign exchange 
contracts with banks. To ensure compliance with the above policy, subsidiaries will use Group treasury as an internal bank, hedging their material 
foreign exchange exposures on an inter-company basis. These exposures are then aggregated and netted in Group treasury and the overall 
position hedged externally. 
 The foreign exchange exposures for the most signiﬁ cant foreign currencies reported to Group treasury and the related hedging of those 
exposures against UK pounds at 31 December were as follows:
        2008
       €’m US$’m SEK’m
Reported exposure      (207.5) 49.9 137.1
Forward contracts      207.5 (49.9) (137.1)
        2007
       €’m US$’m SEK’m
Reported exposure      (284.8) 45.4 828.0
Forward contracts      285.1 (45.3) (827.8)
Positive amounts represented an asset or a forward purchase, whereas negative amounts represented a liability or forward sale.
 At 31 December 2008, if the Euro, US Dollar and Swedish Krona had strengthened by 10% against UK Sterling with all other variables held 
constant, post-tax proﬁ t and equity for the year would have been higher/(lower), as follows:
      2008 2007
      Proﬁ t   Proﬁ t
      & Loss Equity & Loss Equity
      £’m £’m £’m £’m
Euro     (1.4) (33.0) (2.1) (22.0)
US dollar     (0.1) – (0.3) –
Swedish krona     0.4 (31.8) – (28.9)
If these currencies had weakened by 10%, the opposite would be true.
 The movement in post tax proﬁ t is as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona 
denominated derivatives used to hedge contracted project future cashﬂ ows.
 The movement on equity is mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses/gains on translation of borrowings and derivatives designated as net 
investment hedges.
 The above impact on equity of movements in exchange rates does not include the change in value of the underlying investments denominated 
in foreign currency which are being hedged.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to fund its operations through a mixture of retained earnings, equity and debt. Careful consideration is given to the 
appropriate split of debt and equity to ensure acceptable levels of liquidity and interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is then further managed by 
hedging a portion of the Group’s ﬂ oating rate borrowings at ﬁ xed rates of interest. At 31 December 2008, the Group had £80.0 million (2007: 
£224.2 million) of ﬁ xed rate borrowings out of total borrowings of £565.0 million (2007: £591.9 million).
 If interest rates on ﬂ oating rate euro, Swedish krona and UK pound-denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher during the 
12 months ended 31 December 2008 and 2007, with all other variables held constant, post-tax proﬁ t would have been lower as a result of higher 
interest expense on those borrowings, as follows:

Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain sufﬁ cient headroom to meet its foreseeable ﬁ nancing requirements. Substantial committed facilities are maintained 
with a syndicate of leading international banks. At 31 December 2008, the Group had committed bank facilities of £848.3 million (2007: £735.9 million) of 
which £532.0 million (2007: £331.4 million) had been drawn down, giving headroom of £316.3 million (2007: £404.5 million). The highest amount drawn 
down on these facilities during 2008 was £759.1 million (2007: £636.2 million). 
 The table below analyses the Group’s ﬁ nancial liabilities and net-settled derivative ﬁ nancial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based 
on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted 
cash ﬂ ows and include both interest and principal cash ﬂ ows. The adjustment column represents the possible future cash ﬂ ows attributable to the 
instrument included in the maturity analysis which are not included in the carrying amount of the ﬁ nancial liability on the balance sheet. Except for 
bank loans, the convertible bonds and ﬁ nance lease obligations, balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of 
discounting is not signiﬁ cant.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
On 1 January 2008, the Group had euro and Swedish krona borrowings which it had designated as a hedge of the net investment in its 
subsidiaries in eurozone countries and Sweden. The designated borrowings comprised the 2.875% 2008 convertible bonds until repayment, the 
SEK 650 million bank loan and forward contracts, and the Swedish krona drawn down under the Group’s £150 million old revolving credit facility 
and Euros drawn down under the Group’s new €500 million facility. The fair value of the designated euro borrowings at 31 December 2008 was 
£200.9 million (2007: £220.0 million) and that of the Swedish krona borrowings/forward contracts was £19.7 million (2007: £52.1 million).
 The foreign exchange loss of £111.0 million relating to these borrowings in the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: £27.9 million) has been 
recognised directly in the translation reserve. There was no hedging ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in the year ended 
31 December 2008 (2007: £nil). This foreign exchange loss was offset by the rise in value in pounds sterling terms, of the Group’s net assets in 
Eurozone countries and Sweden.
Cash ﬂ ow hedges
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the Group had no derivative instruments that were part of a cash ﬂ ow hedge relationship.

Vacant properties
At 31 December 2008, provisions for vacant properties represented residual lease commitments, together with associated outgoings, for the 
remaining period on certain property leases, after taking into account sub-tenant arrangements. The property costs provided for are mainly 
related to properties located in the United Kingdom and Sweden. At 31 December 2008, non-current vacant property provisions amounted to 
£31.7 million of which £29.5 million was payable within ﬁ ve years and the balance thereafter.
Restructuring
At 31 December 2008, the restructuring provision mainly related to the restructuring of the businesses following the outcome of the Group’s 
business review announced 22 April 2008. The restructuring programme comprised property rationalisation, a reduction in headcount and other 
measures to reduce the cost base. Where appropriate, provisions arising from the property rationalisation are categorised as vacant property. 
At 31 December 2008, £21.0 million of the restructuring provision was payable within one year, £3.3 million between one and two years. 
Other
At 31 December 2008, the other provisions related to the value of legal claims brought by ex-employees and to other ongoing legal matters. 
At 31 December 2008, £3.2 million of the other provision was payable within one year, with the remaining balance payable between two and 
ﬁ ve years. 108 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and the Group intends to settle the balances on 
a net basis. An analysis of the deferred tax balances for ﬁ nancial reporting purposes is shown in the table below:
        2008 2007
        £’m £’m
Deferred tax assets       59.1 54.5
Deferred tax liabilities       (119.3) (126.2)
        (60.2) (71.7)
At 31 December 2008, the Group had unused tax losses of £318.8 million (2007: £245.6 million) available for offset against future taxable proﬁ ts 
for which no deferred tax asset had been recognised. At 31 December 2008, £112.9 million (2007: £82.6 million) of the unused losses are subject 
to time expiry rules and will expire in full on or before 31 December 2022.
 No deferred tax liability was recognised in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as the 
Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. The Group estimated that tax of £43.5 million (2007: £62.7 million) would arise in respect of remitting all earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries to the United Kingdom to the extent legally possible.

regarding merger relief.
 The Company has one class of authorised and issued share capital, comprising ordinary shares of 10p each. Subject to the Company’s Articles 
of Association and applicable law, the Company’s ordinary shares confer on the holder: the right to receive notice of and vote at general meetings 
of the Company; the right to receive any surplus assets on a winding-up of the Company; and an entitlement to receive any dividend declared on 
ordinary shares.

Treasury shares
As at 31 December 2007 Logica plc held shares in three discretionary trusts. During the current year they have been consolidated into one trust 
– the Logica ESOP Trust. The trust was set up for the beneﬁ t of Logica employees. The trust purchases the Company’s shares in the market for 
use in connection with the Group’s employee share plans. The amount shown in the treasury shares reserve at 31 December 2008, which related 
solely to shares purchased and disposed of by the trusts, would be deducted in determining the amount the Company had available for 
distribution at that date.
 At 31 December 2008, the employee trust owned 13,659,965 ordinary shares (2007: 14,575,290) with a nominal value of £1.4 million (2007: 
£1.5 million). The trustees of the Logica ESOP Trust have agreed to waive the right to future dividends on ordinary shares held by the trusts 
except for a nominal amount. At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the nominal amount payable to both trusts was 0.001p per share. 
Translation reserve
The translation reserve represented the accumulated exchange differences arising from the following sources:
  the impact of the translation of the income statement and net assets of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than pounds sterling; 
  exchange differences recycled on disposal of foreign operations;
  exchange differences arising on the translation of net investments in a foreign operation where any subsidiary of the Group may have a 
receivable from or a payable to a foreign operation and settlement is neither planned nor likely; and
  exchange differences arising on hedging instruments that are designated hedges of a net investment in foreign operations, net of tax 
where applicable.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve was a non-distributable reserve and contained the nominal value of the shares re-purchased and cancelled.

(continued)
Merger reserve
The merger reserve represented the excess of the fair value over the nominal value of shares issued by the company to acquire at least 90% equity 
interest in an acquiree company. A purchaser company acquiring at least 90% equity interest in an acquiree company under an arrangement, 
which provides for the allotment of equity shares by the purchaser in return for the equity interest in the acquiree must apply Section 131 of the 
Act. When applicable, the section required that the premium on the issue of equity shares by the purchaser company be disregarded. Accordingly, 
the Company did not record a premium on the shares it issued but recognised a merger reserve in the consolidated balance sheet. During the year 
the Group issued 135 million shares which led to an increase in the merger reserve of £75.9 million. This was net of expenses of £1.0 million.

Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts      121.5 99.6
The Group’s credit risk on cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts is limited because the counterparties are well-established banks with high 
credit ratings. Included in cash at bank and in hand were overdrafts that were part of cash pooling arrangements for which a legal right of off-set 
existed against positive cash balances that were of an equal or greater amount at the balance sheet date.
 The Directors estimate that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximated their fair value.
 The Group’s policy for cash investments requires that cash and deposits only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum A1/P1 
short-term rating and A- equivalent long-term credit rating. The reference to ratings must include at least one from either Standard & Poor’s or 
Moody’s. Cash and deposits are limited to £25 million per bank where the bank has a minimum AA- rating and £10 million per bank where the bank 
is rated A or A-. No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance 
by any of these counterparties.
36. Disposals
The Group completed the sale of certain non-core businesses during the year, as described below. The aggregate net assets of these businesses, 
which are not individually signiﬁ cant, at their date of disposal are analysed below:

37. Acquisitions
On 15 February 2008, Energias de Portugal S.A. (EDP) notiﬁ ed the Group of its exercise of the EDP Put Option, under the terms of the shareholders’ 
agreement entered into between EDP and Logica on 20 April 2005. On 7 March 2008 the Group acquired the remaining 40% interest in the equity 
shares of Edinfor-Sistemas Informáticos S.A. paying consideration of £42.1 million, which resulted in additional goodwill of £23.8 million. The assets 
represented by the minority interest are included within the fair value table below at the amounts previously reported.
 During the year, the Group made several acquisitions of small businesses in the Nordics, for a total consideration of £5.4 million.
The fair values of the identiﬁ able assets and liabilities acquired in all acquisitions were as follows:

Factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill of £25.9 million on acquisitions during the year were: anticipated revenue and cost synergies 
with existing operations in Norway, Finland and Portugal; the value of the workforce in place and the anticipated proﬁ ts from winning business in 
the future from new rather than existing customers. 113

Pro forma ﬁ nancial information
The acquired businesses contributed to the Group revenues of £5.6 million and a net loss of £0.9 million in the year ended 31 December 2008. 
If the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the ﬁ nancial period, the Group’s pro forma revenue and net proﬁ t for the 12 months ended 
31 December 2008 would have been £3,594.6 million and £39.5 million respectively.
38. Share-based payment
Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements 
The Group operates the following equity-settled share-based payment arrangements: the Restricted Stock Award (RSA), the Logica Partnership 
Incentive Plan (PIP), the Logica Performance Multiplier Plan (PMP), the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the Sharesave Plan, the Executive Equity 
Participation Plan 2006 (ExEPP 2006), the Employee Equity Partnership Plan (EmEPP) and the Executive Share Option Plan 2006 (ESOP 2006) and 
two further plans, the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and the Executive Equity Partnership Plan (ExEPP). Under the latter two plans, no 
further grants will be made as their 10-year award cycle has come to an end, but under which executives still have current awards. A summary of 
the main terms of the arrangements is given below, with particular reference to the terms of those grants for which a share-based payment 
expense has been recognised.
Restricted Stock Award
On commencement of employment, in compensation for forfeited incentives, Andy Green received a restricted share award of 2,110,967 ordinary 
shares to vest over a period of four consecutive years from commencement of employment. The number of shares that vest at each tranche will be 
increased by reference to dividends paid on shares between the grant date and the vesting date. The shares are released in tranches at the end of 
March in each of the four years and vest immediately provided he is still employed by the Group on the vesting date. The ﬁ rst tranche was granted 
in February 2008 and vested in March 2008.
Partnership Incentive Plan
The PIP is a discretionary beneﬁ t offered by the Group for the beneﬁ t of its senior employees. The value of the award is based on an ‘annual pool’ 
determined by the reference to proﬁ t performance. Selected employees (‘Partners’) are awarded point allocations in connection with a ‘pool year’, 
these points are then converted into conditional awards of deferred ‘free’ shares following the determination of the annual pool. The annual pool is 
determined by the level of proﬁ t before tax achieved. The conditional awards will vest three years from grant subject to continued employment but 
are not subject to further performance conditions. Although this plan was not formally approved until February 2009 it had been communicated to 
those likely to participate in the scheme in September 2008 and the ﬁ rst ‘pool year’ has been communicated as the year ended 31 December 
2008. As a result there is a share based payment expense in respect of this plan in 2008 despite the fact that no awards have yet been granted. 
This plan is ultimately expected to replace the LTIP. 114 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008
Financial statements
38. Share-based payment
(continued)
Performance Multiplier Plan
The PMP is also a discretionary beneﬁ t offered by the Group to its most senior employees. The PMP has the potential to reward the most senior 
employees with an additional award of up to twice the number of deferred shares awarded under the PIP. PMP awards will ordinarily vest at the 
same time as the deferred share awards granted under the PIP (i.e. three years from grant) subject to continued employment and to the extent that 
the performance conditions attached to the awards have been achieved. The PMP is conditional on a measure of EPS performance. The PMP has 
been communicated as at 31 December 2008 – so although there has yet to be a grant there is a share-based payment expense in respect of this 
plan in 2008. The PMP is subject to the approval of shareholders at the AGM.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP is a discretionary beneﬁ t offered by the Group for the beneﬁ t of its senior employees, as well as to staff with high potential or to recognise 
signiﬁ cant achievements. An award under the LTIP may be granted as a conditional allocation, a nil (or nominal) cost option with a short exercise 
window or as forfeitable shares. Cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards may also be granted or cash-based payments 
may be used to satisfy an award originally made in shares (either in whole or part), although the Remuneration Committee does not currently 
intend to do so. The maximum market value of ordinary shares in the Company subject to LTIP awards granted to any employee in any ﬁ nancial 
year will not exceed 200% of that employee’s base salary. The intention initially is not to exceed 150% of salary.
 The performance condition attached to one half of an award will require annual earnings per share growth to exceed the growth in the Retail 
Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum over three ﬁ nancial years for between 30% and 100% of this half of the award to vest (i.e. between 
15% and 50% of the total award). The performance condition attached to the other half of an award will measure the Total Shareholder Return 
performance (TSR) of Logica over a single three-year performance period against a number of other companies. 30% of this half of the award will 
vest if the Company is ranked in the median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of this half of the award vesting if Logica is at or 
above the upper quartile. The Remuneration Committee intends to review the performance conditions each year to ensure that they remain 
suitable and reﬂ ect the ongoing market.
Sharesave Plan
The Group operates a savings-related share option plan under which employees enter into a savings contract with a ﬁ nancial institution to pay 
a ﬁ xed monthly sum for either a three-year or, for grants before 4 October 2002, ﬁ ve-year period. The price at which share options are granted 
is the mid-market price of a Logica share on the business day prior to the invitation to apply to join the plan to which a discount of 20% has been 
applied. The aggregate exercise price payable is equal to the expected proceeds on maturity of the savings contract. Share options may be 
exercised within six months of the vesting date. There are no performance conditions attached to Sharesave Plan options.
 On 3 April 2008 573,218 SAYE contracts granted in 2006 and 2007 were cancelled and replaced with an equivalent number of options with a 
grant date of 3 April 2008.  Under IFRS2, the incremental increase in fair values as a result of a modiﬁ cation, is expensed from the point of 
modiﬁ cation to vesting date. The modiﬁ cation of the grants for 2006 and 2007 has led to an incremental increase in fair values of £0.2 million 
measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
Equity Participation/Partnership Plans
The Group operates an equity participation plan for senior executives (the ExEPP 2006) and in certain countries an equity partnership plan open to 
all employees (the EmEPP). The terms of both plans are similar. Under the equity participation/partnership plans, employees make an investment 
in the Company’s shares, subject to ﬁ nancial limits, which must be maintained over a three-year vesting period. Shares will under the Executive 
Equity Partnership and Participation Employee Equity Partnership plans for all grants prior to 2008 if a performance condition is met and the 
participant is still employed at the vesting date. 
 Under the ExEPP 2006, senior executives, in any one year, may invest in shares up to a maximum of 50% of net bonus paid. These lodged 
shares will be matched on a 1:1 (gross basis) (the Matching Award). Matching Award shares will be released as soon as practicable after the third 
anniversary of the award, subject to the stretching performance conditions having been met. The performance conditions in respect of the ExEPP 
2006 have the same criteria as the Company’s LTIP performance conditions described above.  
 Awards made in 2008 under the Employee Equity Partnership Plan do not carry a performance condition. Awards of a matching number of 
shares are made at nil cost to employees and are exercisable for up to seven years after the vesting date, after which the award will lapse. 
 Although no further awards will be made under the ExEPP there remain outstanding awards which have yet to reach their third anniversary. 
This plan was operated for senior executives as an equity-based investment plan subject to ﬁ nancial limits and the investment being maintained 
over a three-year vesting period. Vesting will occur for those executives employed at the vesting date subject to a performance condition based 
on growth in the Group’s earnings per share exceeding the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum.
Executive Share Option Plan 2006
At the Company’s AGM in 2006 shareholders approved the implementation of the ESOP 2006. This plan has been introduced to allow awards to 
be made to senior executives working in jurisdictions where it would be inappropriate to make an award under the LTIP. It is anticipated that 
performance conditions attached to any ESOP 2006 awards will have the same criteria as the LTIP noted above. As yet, no awards have been 
made under this plan. 115

(continued)
Executive Share Option Scheme
No new option grants will be made under the ESOS, although options made under previous grants to senior executives and managers across the 
Group remain outstanding. Options are normally exercisable between three and 10 years following grant, provided that a performance condition, 
speciﬁ ed at the date of grant, has been satisﬁ ed. Typically, growth in the Group’s earnings per share over the relevant three-year performance 
period is required to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 21% for the performance condition to be met. 
ESOS option grants prior to 2005 have a maximum seven-year exercise period, while the exercise period for option grants in 2005 and 2006 is four 
years. Retesting of performance conditions may be carried out twice for ESOS options granted in 2003 but only once for options granted in 2004. 
No retesting is permitted for grants awarded in 2005 and 2006.
 The exercise price of ESOS options is generally at least equal to the closing mid-market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant, 
although the pricing mechanism varies slightly for grants to French employees.
US Stock Purchase Plan
US-based employees are eligible to participate in a tax-favourable share purchase plan. They may save up to a maximum of $2,000 per annum, 
the savings being used to buy shares at quarterly intervals. Logica North America contributes an additional 15% to the amount saved per 
employee. US-based employees are not eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan or the EmEPP.
Unilog Management Incentive
On 10 January 2006, 1,790,000 options were granted for exercise in two equal tranches to ﬁ ve former Unilog managers. This was a one-off share 
award. For 1,100,000 conditional award shares the ﬁ rst half of the award vested in full following the achievement of the performance condition and 
the resulting shares have been released. The ﬁ rst tranche of the remaining 690,000 conditional award shares vested subject to the achievement of 
individually set performance targets and have been released.
 The second tranches of the full award achieved their performance targets and were transferred to participants during 2008.
Unilog Plan
Following the acquisition of Unilog on 13 January 2006, the Company entered into liquidity agreements with the majority of the option holders in 
Unilog. Under the liquidity agreement, outstanding options in Unilog will, upon exercise, be converted into shares in Logica plc, using a transfer 
ratio of 31.97 Logica plc shares for every one Unilog share. 
 Under IFRS 2, any amendment of the original terms and conditions of share options is deﬁ ned as a modiﬁ cation and the portion of the original 
fair value charge not yet expensed should continue to be accrued over the period from modiﬁ cation to the vesting date. If the modiﬁ cation 
increases the fair value of the options, the difference between the fair value of the original options and the modiﬁ ed options, both measured as at 
the date of modiﬁ cation, should be expensed over the period from modiﬁ cation to the vesting date. The incremental increase in fair value after the 
modiﬁ cation to be expensed in the period up to the vesting date was £4.2 million. The date of modiﬁ cation was 6 April 2006.
 The calculation of the £4.2 million modiﬁ cation charge was made in two stages. First the fair value of the options (prior to modiﬁ cation) was 
recalculated as at the date of modiﬁ cation, using the assumptions prevailing on that date, i.e. 6 April 2006. The fair value of the options was 
measured using the intrinsic value of the options (the share price at acquisition of €73 less the exercise price of each option). Stage two of the 
calculation was to fair-value the options directly after 6 April 2006 using the Black-Scholes model. The difference between the two calculations 
represents the incremental increase in fair value of £4.2 million to be expensed from 6 April 2006 to the vesting date.
 The share price, exercise price and fair value of the original Unilog options in the table above have been translated into sterling using the 
exchange rate at the date of acquisition of €1.46 to £1. The share price, exercise price and fair value of the original Unilog options at the date of 
modiﬁ cation have been translated into sterling using the exchange rate at the date of modiﬁ cation of €1.43 to £1.
Insight (formerly Unilog plan)
Managers in France who are eligible to participate in the Insight fund could annually choose to invest all or part of their bonus into this fund. Logica 
France contributes 50% of the bonus invested by the employee to a maximum of €4,000 per annum. The Insight fund currently invests 100% of its 
capital in Logica shares and is managed by an external fund manager appointed by Logica France. 
French Savings Plan
A Plan d’Epargne d’Enterprise (P.E.E.) is operated for those employees in France not covered by the Insight plan above. There is a maximum 
individual investment amount per year, to which Logica adds an amount equivalent to the amount of employer’s national insurance saved. 
The funds are invested for a period of ﬁ ve years and are exempt from tax. The funds are managed by CIC Bank and are invested in shares. 116 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

The fair values of LTIP and RSA grants were measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the fair value of Sharesave Plan options was 
measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of share awards under the Equity Participation/Partnership Plans were 
measured at the market share price at the date of grant reduced for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period, for which 
award holders have no entitlement. The fair values of the share awards under the PIP and PMP were measured as the market share price at 
31 December 2008 as the actual grant will not occur until 2009. 
 Expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over a period commensurate with the expected 
life of the share option. The period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 was excluded as management believe it represented a period of high share 
price volatility which is unlikely to be repeated in the future. 118 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008

38. Share-based payment
(continued)
Share awards under the Equity Participation/Partnership Plans are assumed to be exercised on the vesting date. Sharesave options are assumed 
to be exercised three months after the vesting date, the mid-point of the contractual exercise period.
 At the date of grant, it is assumed that performance conditions will be met in full. Adjustments are made subsequently, where necessary, to 
reﬂ ect updated assessments of whether performance conditions will be met and the ﬁ nal determination on the vesting date. The share-based 
payment expense also takes account of expected forfeiture from the balance sheet date to the end of the vesting period following cessation of 
employment. A weighted average forfeiture rate of 9% per annum was assumed for calculating the share-based payment expense for the year 
ended 31 December 2008 (2007: 9%). 
 For exercises prior to the vesting date, the additional expense between the calculation date and the vesting date is immediately charged to the 
income statement.
 The Group recognised a total expense in respect of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements of £10.2 million (2007: £9.7 million 
including a Telecoms Products charge of £0.6 million).
Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements
The Group does not operate separate cash-settled share-based payments arrangements; however, social security obligations arising on share 
option and share award plans are treated as such an arrangement for accounting purposes. The liability for cash-settled share-based social 
security payments at 31 December 2008 was £1.4 million (2007: £1.2 million). The movement in the liability resulted in an expense for the year 
ended 31 December 2008 of £0.2 million (2007: income of £0.6 million).
39. Retirement beneﬁ t schemes
Deﬁ ned contribution schemes
The Group operates a number of voluntary pension schemes of the deﬁ ned contribution type in the UK and overseas, under which contributions 
are paid by Group undertakings. In some countries, contributions are made into state pension schemes. The pension cost charge for deﬁ ned 
contribution schemes amounted to £112.7 million (2007: £99.2 million including a Telecoms Products charge of £1.6 million).
 In Sweden, the Group contributed to the Alecta SE pension scheme which is a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme. This pension scheme was 
classiﬁ ed as a deﬁ ned contribution scheme as it is a multi-employer plan and sufﬁ cient information is not available to bifurcate the assets of the 
plan between the various employers. Any surplus or deﬁ cit in the plan will affect the amount of future contributions payable. Alecta used a 
collective funding ratio to determine the surplus or deﬁ cit in the pension scheme. The collective funding is the difference between Alecta’s assets 
and the commitments to the policyholders and insured individuals. The collective solvency is normally allowed to vary between 125% and 155%, 
with the target being 140%. At the end of 31 December 2008, Alecta’s collective funding ratio was 112%. In order to restore the level of collective 
solvency the board of Alecta decided in October 2008 that the company would go back to charging full pension premiums in 2009. In 2008, lower 
rates than normal had been charged due to the high level of collective solvency in previous years. Contributions for 2009 for the Group have been 
estimated at £6.0 million.
Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes
In addition, the Group operates deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes primarily for the beneﬁ t of employees in the UK and the Netherlands, with smaller 
schemes in other European countries and the US. Deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes are usually funded by contributions from the employing companies, 
and in some cases also employees, to meet the costs, at rates assessed by the actuary or insurer of each scheme, in regular funding reviews. 
The schemes’ assets are held in funds separate from those of the Group. Scheme beneﬁ ts typically provide for a pension in retirement based 
on years of qualifying service and ﬁ nal pensionable salary.
 The most recent valuations of plan assets, reimbursement rights and deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligations were carried out at 31 December 2007 by 
qualiﬁ ed actuaries. The present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation, and the related current and past service cost, were measured using the 
projected unit credit method.
 The weighted average principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows:

Inﬂ ation (%)     3.0 3.40 1.9 2.30
The Group’s principal deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes are in the UK and in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands the mortality tables used for the year 
ended 31 December 2008 were the GBM/V 0005 tables + ageing trend (2007: GBM/V 9500 tables + ageing trend). In the UK the mortality 
assumption used was 100% PNXA00 (year of birth) with future improvements in line with the long cohort projections and a minimum rate of future 
improvement of 1% (2007: PXA92 with improvements in line with the medium cohort projections). 119

The expected rates of return on government bonds and corporate bonds is determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date for 
bonds of a similar term to those held as plan assets. The expected rate of return on equities is determined by reference to real historical equity 
market returns. The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is calculated as a weighted average of the expected rates of return of individual 
asset classes. The weighted average is calculated by reference to the amount in each class of plan assets at the balance sheet date. Plan assets 
in overseas schemes include ordinary shares of the Company with a fair value of £0.9 million at 31 December 2008 (2007: £1.5 million) but do not 
include any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.

The Group’s subsidiaries and the Company are currently, and may be from time to time, involved in a number of legal proceedings including 
inquiries from or discussions with governmental and taxation authorities. Whilst the outcome of current outstanding actions and claims remains 
uncertain, it is expected that they will be resolved without a material impact on the Group’s ﬁ nancial position.

ﬁ nancial statements of Logica plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2008 which 
comprise the balance sheet and the related 
notes. These parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein. We have 
also audited the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.
 We have reported separately on the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements of Logica plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2008.
Respective responsibilities of Directors 
and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing 
the annual report, the report of the 
Remuneration Committee and the parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) 
are set out in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities.
 Our responsibility is to audit the parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of 
the report of the Remuneration Committee to 
be audited in accordance with relevant legal 
and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
This report, including the opinion, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s 
members as a body in accordance with 
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and 
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this 
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose 
hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
 We report to you our opinion as to whether 
the parent Company ﬁ nancial statements give 
a true and fair view and whether the parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements and the part 
of the report of the Remuneration Committee 
to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you whether in our opinion 
the information given in the report of Directors 
is consistent with the parent Company 
ﬁ nancial statements. The information given in 
the report of Directors includes that speciﬁ c 
information that is cross-referred from 
the Business Review section of the report 
of the Directors.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, 
the Company has not kept proper accounting 
records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law 
regarding directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
 We read other information contained in 
the annual report and consider whether it is 
consistent with the audited parent Company 
ﬁ nancial statements. The other information 
comprises only the information listed on the 
contents page under the headings This is 
Logica, Business review, Governance 
(excluding the audited parts of the Directors’ 
remuneration report), Responsibility, 
Shareholder information and Key 
Performance Indicators. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other 
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to 
the amounts and disclosures in the parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited. It also includes an assessment 
of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments 
made by the Directors in the preparation of 
the parent Company ﬁ nancial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
 We planned and performed our audit so as 
to obtain all the information and explanations 
which we considered necessary in order to 
provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give 
reasonable assurance that the parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements and the part 
of the report of the Remuneration Committee 
to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
other irregularity or error. In forming our 
opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in 
the parent Company ﬁ nancial statements and 
the part of the report of the Remuneration 
Committee to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the parent Company ﬁ nancial statements 
give a true and fair view, in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2008;
  the parent Company ﬁ nancial statements 
and the part of the report of the 
Remuneration Committee to be audited 
have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; 
and
  the information given in the report of 
Directors is consistent with the parent 
Company ﬁ nancial statements.

Employee beneﬁ ts
Retirement beneﬁ ts
The Company participates in retirement 
beneﬁ t plans of a deﬁ ned contribution nature. 
The cost of deﬁ ned contribution plans is 
charged to the proﬁ t and loss account on 
the basis of contributions payable by the 
Company during the year.
Share-based payment
The cost of share-based employee 
compensation arrangements, whereby 
employees receive remuneration in the form 
of shares or share options, is recognised as 
an employee beneﬁ t expense in the proﬁ t and 
loss account.
 The total expense to be apportioned over 
the vesting period of the beneﬁ t is determined 
by reference to the fair value at the grant 
date of the shares or share options awarded 
and the number that are expected to vest. 
The assumptions underlying the number of 
awards expected to vest are subsequently 
adjusted to reﬂ ect conditions prevailing at the 
balance sheet date. At the vesting date of an 
award, the cumulative expense is adjusted to 
take account of the awards that actually vest.
Other employee beneﬁ ts
A liability for other employee beneﬁ ts, such 
as paid holiday, is recognised for the amount 
the Company may be required to pay as a 
result of the unused entitlement that has 
accumulated at the balance sheet date.
Employee share ownership trusts
Employee share ownership plan (ESOP) 
trusts, which purchase and hold ordinary 
shares of the Company in connection with 
certain employee share plans, are included 
in the Company ﬁ nancial statements. Any 
consideration paid or received by ESOP trusts 
for the purchase or sale of the Company’s 
own shares is shown as a movement in 
shareholders’ equity.
Dividends
Dividends to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognised as a liability and deducted from 
shareholders’ equity in the period in which 
the shareholders’ right to receive payment 
is established.
II. Proﬁ t attributable to 
the Company
As permitted by Section 230 of the 
Companies Act 1985, no separate proﬁ t 
and loss account is presented in respect 
of the Company. The proﬁ t for the ﬁ nancial 
year for the Company was £153.5 million 
(2007: £296.6 million), which included a 
foreign exchange gain of £2.3 million 
(2007: £0.1 million).  
cash in hand and deposits denominated in 
foreign currencies.
Debtors
Debtors are stated at amounts receivable less 
any provision for recoverability. A trade or 
other receivable is derecognised from the 
balance sheet when the Company enters into 
a ﬁ nancing transaction which transfers to a 
third party all signiﬁ cant rights or other access 
to beneﬁ ts relating to that asset, and all 
signiﬁ cant exposures to the risks inherent in 
that asset.
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair 
value, net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated either 
at amortised cost or, if designated as such, 
at fair value through proﬁ t or loss. For 
borrowings stated at amortised cost, any 
difference between the proceeds, net of 
transaction costs, and the redemption value 
is recognised in the proﬁ t and loss account 
over the period of the borrowings using the 
effective interest rate method.
Taxation
Corporation tax is payable on taxable proﬁ ts 
at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, 
under the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
 Deferred tax is recognised to take account 
of timing differences between the treatment 
of transactions for ﬁ nancial reporting 
purposes and their treatment for tax 
purposes. A deferred tax asset is only 
recognised when it is regarded as more 
likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable proﬁ ts from which the future reversal 
of the underlying timing differences can 
be deducted.
 Deferred tax is measured at the average 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
periods in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-
discounted basis.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company is 
pounds sterling. Transactions denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency of the Company at the 
rates prevailing at the dates of the individual 
transactions. Foreign currency monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated at the 
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange gains and losses arising are 
charged or credited to the proﬁ t and loss 
account within net operating costs.
I. Accounting policies
The following are the principal accounting 
policies of the Company which have been 
applied consistently throughout the year and 
the preceding year.
Basis of accounting
The Company ﬁ nancial statements have 
been prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK 
accounting standards. The Company has 
taken advantage of an exemption available 
in FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements’ and has 
not prepared a cash ﬂ ow statement.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted 
for at cost. Such investments include both 
investments in shares issued by the 
subsidiary and other parent entity interests 
that in substance form part of the parent 
entity’s investment in the subsidiary. These 
include investments in the form of loans which 
have no ﬁ xed repayment terms and which 
have been provided to subsidiaries as an 
additional source of long-term capital. 
Trade amounts receivable from subsidiaries 
in the normal course of business and other 
amounts advanced on commercial terms 
and conditions are included in debtors.
 Investments in subsidiaries in the 
Company’s balance sheet are held at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Investments in subsidiaries held-for-sale are 
accounted for at fair value in accordance with 
FRS 26. Any difference arising on revaluation 
of investments is recognised directly in other 
reserves.
Financial instruments
The Company has taken advantage of the 
exemptions available in Financial Reporting 
Standard (FRS) 25 para 3(c)(b) and FRS 29 
para 2(d) not to disclose any information 
relating to ﬁ nancial instruments as the 
Company’s ﬁ nancial statements are included 
in publicly available consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements.
 The following policies for ﬁ nancial 
instruments have been applied in the 
preparation of the Company’s ﬁ nancial 
statements: 
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash in hand and deposits repayable on 
demand with any qualifying ﬁ nancial 
institution, less overdrafts from any qualifying 
ﬁ nancial institution repayable on demand. 
Deposits are repayable on demand if they can 
be withdrawn at any time without notice and 
without penalty or if a maturity or period of 
notice of not more than 24 hours or one 
working day has been agreed. Cash includes

funds by approximately £9.5 million. The proposed dividend is subject to approval at the AGM on 30 April 2009 and has not been recognised as a 
liability in these ﬁ nancial statements. The ﬁ nal dividend will be paid on 1 May 2009 to shareholders listed on the share register on 14 April 2009. 
The amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders were as follows:

nominal amount. At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the nominal amount payable to both trusts was 0.001p per share. Waiver of dividends payable 
during the year amounted to £0.8 million (2007: £0.9 million). The market value of the shares owned by employee trusts, based on the mid-market 
price at 31 December 2008 was £9.4 million (2007: £17.2 million).

(continued)
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve was a non-distributable reserve and contained the nominal value of the shares re-purchased and cancelled.
Treasury shares
As at 31 December 2007 Logica plc held shares in three discretionary trusts. During the current year they have been consolidated into one trust 
– the Logica ESOP Trust. The trust was set up for the beneﬁ t of Logica employees. The trust purchases the Company’s shares in the market for 
use in connection with the Group’s employee share plans. The amount shown in the treasury shares reserve at 31 December 2008, which related 
solely to shares purchased and disposed of by the trusts, would be deducted in determining the amount the Company had available for 
distribution at that date.
Special reserve
The special reserve represented the reduction of the share premium account following the High Court’s agreement in 1988 and during the year the 
adjustment to fair value of the investment in subsidiary held for disposal.

XII. Share-based payment
Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements 
The Group operates the following equity-settled share-based payment arrangements: the Restricted Stock Award (RSA), the Logica Partnership 
Incentive Plan (PIP), the Logica Performance Multiplier Plan (PMP), the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the Sharesave Plan, the Executive Equity 
Participation Plan 2006 (ExEPP 2006), the Employee Equity Partnership Plan (EmEPP) and the Executive Share Option Plan 2006 (ESOP 2006) and 
two further plans, the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and the Executive Equity Partnership Plan (ExEPP). Under the latter two plans, no 
further grants will be made as their 10-year award cycle has come to an end, but under which executives still have current awards. A summary 
of the main terms of the arrangements is given below, with particular reference to the terms of those grants for which a share-based payment 
expense has been recognised.
Restricted Stock Award
On commencement of employment, in compensation for forfeited incentives, Andy Green received a restricted share award of 2,110,967 ordinary 
shares to vest over a period of four consecutive years from commencement of employment. The number of shares that vest at each tranche will be 
increased by reference to dividends paid on shares between the grant date and the vesting date. The shares are released in tranches at the end of 
March in each of the four years and vest immediately provided he is still employed by the Group on the vesting date. The ﬁ rst tranche was granted 
in February 2008 and vested in March 2008.
Partnership Incentive Plan
The PIP is a discretionary beneﬁ t offered by the Group for the beneﬁ t of its senior employees. The value of the award is based on an ‘annual pool’ 
determined by the reference to proﬁ t performance. Selected employees (‘Partners’) are awarded point allocations in connection with a ‘pool year’, 
these points are then converted into conditional awards of deferred ‘free’ shares following the determination of the annual pool. The annual pool is 
determined by the level of proﬁ t before tax achieved. The conditional awards will vest three years from grant subject to continued employment but 
are not subject to performance conditions. Although this plan was not formally approved until February 2009 it had been communicated to those 
likely to participate in the scheme in September 2008 and the ﬁ rst ‘pool year’ has been communicated as the year ended 31 December 2008. As a 
result there is a share-based payment expense in respect of this plan in 2008 despite the fact that no awards have yet been granted. This plan is 
ultimately expected to replace the LTIP.
Financial statements 133
XII. Share-based payment
(continued) 
Performance Multiplier Plan
The PMP is also a discretionary beneﬁ t offered by the Group to its most senior employees. The PMP has the potential to reward the most senior 
employees with an additional award of up to twice the number of deferred shares awarded under the PIP. PMP awards will ordinarily vest at the 
same time as the deferred share awards granted under the PIP (i.e. three years from grant) subject to continued employment and to the extent that 
the performance conditions attached to the awards have been achieved. The PMP is conditional on a measure of EPS performance. The PMP has 
been communicated as at 31 December 2008 so although there has yet to be a grant there is a share-based payment expense in respect of this 
plan in 2008. The PMP is subject to the approval of the shareholders at the AGM.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP is a discretionary beneﬁ t offered by the Group for the beneﬁ t of its senior employees, as well as to staff with high potential or to recognise 
signiﬁ cant achievements. An award under the LTIP may be granted as a conditional allocation, a nil (or nominal) cost option with a short exercise 
window or as forfeitable shares. Cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards may also be granted or cash-based payments 
may be used to satisfy an award originally made in shares (either in whole or part), although the Remuneration Committee does not currently 
intend to do so. The maximum market value of ordinary shares in the Company subject to LTIP awards granted to any employee in any ﬁ nancial 
year will not exceed 200% of that employee’s base salary. The intention initially is not to exceed 150% of salary.
 The performance condition attached to one half of an award will require annual earnings per share growth to exceed the growth in the Retail 
Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum over three ﬁ nancial years for between 30% and 100% of this half of the award to vest (i.e. between 
15% and 50% of the total award). The performance condition attached to the other half of an award will measure the Total Shareholder Return 
performance (TSR) of Logica over a single three-year performance period against a number of other companies. 30% of this half of the award will 
vest if the Company is ranked in the median at the end of the performance period, with 100% of this half of the award vesting if Logica is at or 
above the upper quartile. The Remuneration Committee intends to review the performance conditions each year to ensure that they remain 
suitable and reﬂ ect the ongoing market.
Sharesave Plan
The Group operates a savings-related share option plan under which employees enter into a savings contract with a ﬁ nancial institution to pay 
a ﬁ xed monthly sum for either a three-year or, for grants before 4 October 2002, ﬁ ve-year period. The price at which share options are granted 
is the mid-market price of a Logica share on the business day prior to the invitation to apply to join the plan to which a discount of 20% has been 
applied. The aggregate exercise price payable is equal to the expected proceeds on maturity of the savings contract. Share options may be 
exercised within six months of the vesting date. There are no performance conditions attached to Sharesave Plan options.
Equity Participation/Partnership Plans
The Group operates an equity participation plan for senior executives (the ExEPP 2006) and in certain countries an equity partnership plan open to 
all employees (the EmEPP). The terms of both plans are similar. Under the equity participation/partnership plans, employees make an investment 
in the Company’s shares, subject to ﬁ nancial limits, which must be maintained over a three-year vesting period. Shares will under the Executive 
Equity Partnership and Participation Employee Equity Partnership plans for all grants prior to 2008 if a performance condition is met and the 
participant is still employed at the vesting date. 
 Under the ExEPP 2006, senior executives, in any one year, may invest in shares up to a maximum of 50% of net bonus paid. These lodged 
shares will be matched on a 1:1 (gross basis) (the Matching Award). Matching Award shares will be released as soon as practicable after the third 
anniversary of the award, subject to the stretching performance conditions having been met. The performance conditions in respect of the ExEPP 
2006 have the same criteria as the Company’s LTIP performance conditions described above.  
 Awards made in 2008 under the Employee Equity Partnership Plan do not carry a performance condition. Awards of a matching number of 
shares are made at nil cost to employees and are exercisable for up to seven years after the vesting date, after which the award will lapse. 
 Although no further awards will be made under the ExEPP there remain outstanding awards which have yet to reach their third anniversary. 
This plan was operated for senior executives as an equity-based investment plan subject to ﬁ nancial limits and the investment being maintained 
over a three-year vesting period. Vesting will occur for those executives employed at the vesting date subject to a performance condition based 
on growth in the Group’s earnings per share exceeding the growth in the Retail Price Index by between 3% and 7% per annum.
Executive Share Option Plan 2006
At the Company’s AGM in 2006 shareholders approved the implementation of the ESOP 2006. This plan has been introduced to allow awards to 
be made to senior executives working in jurisdictions where it would be inappropriate to make an award under the LTIP. It is anticipated that 
performance conditions attached to any ESOP 2006 awards will have the same criteria as the LTIP noted above. As yet, no awards have been 
made under this plan.
Executive Share Option Scheme
No new option grants will be made under the ESOS, although options made under previous grants to senior executives and managers across the 
Group remain outstanding. Options are normally exercisable between three and 10 years following grant, provided that a performance condition, 
speciﬁ ed at the date of grant, has been satisﬁ ed. Typically, growth in the Group’s earnings per share over the relevant three-year performance 
period is required to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 21% for the performance condition to be met.
Financial statements 134 Logica Annual report and accounts 2008
XII. Share-based payment
(continued) 
ESOS option grants prior to 2005 have a maximum seven-year exercise period, while the exercise period for option grants in 2005 and 2006 is four 
years. Retesting of performance conditions may be carried out twice for ESOS options granted in 2003 but only once for options granted in 2004. 
No retesting is permitted for grants awarded in 2005 and 2006.
 The exercise price of ESOS options is generally at least equal to the closing mid-market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant, 
although the pricing mechanism varies slightly for grants to French employees.

no entitlement. The fair values of the share awards under the PIP and PMP were measured as the market share price at 31 December 2008 as the 
actual grant will not occur until 2009. 
 Expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over a period commensurate with the expected 
life of the share option. The period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 was excluded as management believe it represented a period of high share 
price volatility which is unlikely to be repeated in the future.
 Share awards under the Equity Participation Plan are assumed to be exercised on the vesting date. Sharesave options are assumed to be 
exercised three months after the vesting date, the mid-point of the contractual exercise period.
 At the date of grant, it is assumed that performance conditions will be met in full. Adjustments are made subsequently, where necessary, to 
reﬂ ect updated assessments of whether performance conditions will be met and the ﬁ nal determination on the vesting date. The share-based 
payment expense also takes account of expected forfeiture from the balance sheet date to the end of the vesting period following cessation of 
employment. A weighted average forfeiture rate of 9% per annum was assumed for calculating the share-based payment expense for the year 
ended 31 December 2008 (2007: 9%). 
 For exercises prior to the vesting date, the additional expense between the calculation date and the vesting date is immediately charged to the 
income statement.
 The Company recognised a total expense in respect of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements of £2.3 million in the year ended 
31 December 2008 (2007: £0.9 million).

XII. Share-based payment 
(continued) 
Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements
The Company does not operate separate cash-settled share-based payments arrangements, however, social security obligations arising on share 
option and share award plans are treated as such an arrangement for accounting purposes. The liability for cash-settled share-based social 
security payments at 31 December 2008 was £0.3 million (2007: £0.1 million). The movement in the liability resulted in a charge for the year ended 
31 December 2008 of £0.2 million (2007: income of £0.3 million).
XIII. Contingent liabilities
The Group’s subsidiaries and the Company are currently, and may be from time to time, involved in a number of legal proceedings including 
inquiries from or discussions with governmental and taxation authorities. Whilst the outcome of current outstanding actions and claims remains 
uncertain, it is expected that they will be resolved without a material impact on the Group’s ﬁ nancial position. The Company has guaranteed 
certain contracts in the normal course of business and bank borrowings of its subsidiaries.
XIV. Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8 ‘Related Party Transactions’ from disclosing transactions with other members of 
the Group headed by Logica plc. Transactions with the Directors of the Company are disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 
52 to 65. There were no other related party transactions during the current or prior year.

Euro translation of selected ﬁ nancial information
The Group has presented a translation of the consolidated income statement, balance sheet and cash ﬂ ow statement into euros to assist users 
of the ﬁ nancial statements more familiar with that currency. The income statement and cash ﬂ ow statement in euros have been calculated by 
converting the sterling ﬁ gures to euros at an average rate of €1.25 to £1 (2007: €1.46 to £1). The balance sheet has been calculated by converting 
the sterling ﬁ gures to euros at the closing rate of €1.03 to £1 (2007: €1.36 to £1).

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Group Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs )
Balanced market sector proﬁ le
Revenue for each market sector (Financial Services, 
Energy and Utilities, Telecoms and Media, Industry, 
Distribution and Transport (IDT), Public Sector) as a 
percentage of Group revenue.
A balanced market sector proﬁ le (with a goal that 
no sector accounts for less than 10% or more than 
30%) ensures that Group revenue and proﬁ t is 
less susceptible to any one segment. A sizeable 
revenue base in each sector also justiﬁ es continuing 
investment in domain expertise which differentiates 
Logica versus its peers, winning business and 
underpinning proﬁ tability.
Title Deﬁ nition Rationale

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS)
Net earnings attributable to equity holders of the 
parent company excluding, whenever such items 
occur, the result of discontinued operations, 
exceptional items, mark-to-market gains and losses 
on ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities designated 
at fair value through proﬁ t or loss, and amortisation 
of intangible assets initially recognised at fair value in 
a business combination, net of tax where applicable, 
divided by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding in the period.
EPS is an important measure for shareholders of the 
earnings generated by the business, after the effect 
of interest and tax.

Book to bill
Orders booked in a period divided by revenues in 
the period. This has been reported for the ﬁ rst time 
through 2008 across all of Logica’s businesses.
Provides visibility of future revenue. A book to bill 
above 100% means that the Company continues to 
build good order pipeline for future delivery. Our goal 
for 2009 is to supplement this information with order 
backlog which will provide a consolidated view of 
future orders.

Pro forma revenue growth
Percentage growth in revenue in the current year 
compared to revenues on a like-for-like basis in 
the previous year, for example, taking into account 
the impact of acquisitions, divestments and 
currency movements.
Provides a measure of our ability to grow revenue. 
This demonstrates our ability to take advantage 
of market growth, to use scale to generate market 
share and to leverage our global delivery capability 
to expand revenue.

Percentage of revenue from 
outsourcing
Revenue from outsourcing contracts as a percentage 
of Group revenue.
Longer term value-added outsourcing contracts 
represent a more predictable revenue stream, 
assuming good project and risk management. The 
investment in outsourcing announced in 2008 is 
aimed at growing revenue from outsourcing faster 
than overall Group revenue growth. Our goal is 
to grow revenue from outsourcing to 35% of total 
revenue (from the 2007 level of 32%).

Cash conversion
The net cash inﬂ ow from trading operations divided 
by adjusted operating proﬁ t (see adjusted operating 
margin KPI).
A measure of the ability to generate cash from 
operations. The ability to convert proﬁ t to cash is 
based on an internal discipline of focus on cash and 
the strength of the internal collections mechanism, 
and is a proxy for strength of relationships with 
customers. Cash conversion is an important 
component of free cash ﬂ ow and therefore an 
important determinant of the Company’s ability 
to repay its debt.

Adjusted operating margin
Adjusted operating proﬁ t as a percentage of revenue. 
Adjusted operating proﬁ t is operating proﬁ t excluding 
the results of discontinued operations, exceptional 
items and amortisation of intangible assets initially 
recognised at fair value in a business combination, 
whenever such items occur.
This measure is used to compare quality of 
earnings with those of our peers and to determine 
performance against our Programme for Growth 
targets (see pages 8 to 9) and medium-term strategic 
objectives of delivering sustainable double digit 
adjusted operating margin.
 145
The Board’s annual review resulted in the 
removal of one indicator and three additions 
to better align the KPIs with Logica’s three 
year plan (Programme for Growth) set out in 
April 2008. 
 The removal of the KPI related to 
a ‘balanced business proﬁ le with four 
signiﬁ cant European proﬁ t generators’ 
reﬂ ects the fact that the goal of having four 
proﬁ t generating geographies was achieved 
in late 2006.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Title Deﬁ nition Rationale
Employee attrition
Annualised voluntary attrition measured by number 
of voluntary leavers as a percentage of the total 
employee population. There will always be a natural 
level of voluntary attrition due to people retiring, 
decisions to change careers and a competitive 
marketplace.
Retention of employees, alongside ongoing training 
and development, allows us to ensure that we are 
maintaining and upgrading the domain expertise 
which is a key differentiator for Logica. It is also 
a measure of our managers’ ability to retain their 
employees in a market where there is signiﬁ cant 
movement of employees, particularly when the 
market is buoyant. In a slowing market, slowing 
attrition can be an important indicator of employees’ 
concern about job security. 

Employee satisfaction
A weighted mean score for key questions in the 
annual Logica employee survey. 2008 was the ﬁ rst 
year in which the survey was conducted across the 
whole Group. As such, this is the ﬁ rst year for which 
the reporting reﬂ ects the full Group.
Assuming the response rate remains unchanged, 
the weighted mean score is a measure of overall 
staff ‘engagement’ with Logica and the change in 
satisfaction from year to year.

Nearshore and offshore headcount
(NEW)
The headcount based in Logica’s nearshore and 
offshore centres which, at the end of 2007, were: 
India, Philippines, Malaysia, Morocco, Central and 
Eastern Europe.
A key component of the Programme for Growth is 
to respond more rapidly to a globalising industry by 
accelerating blended delivery. We aim to have 8,000 
employees in our nearshore and offshore centres 
by the end of 2009 (from a base of 3,450 at the end 
of 2007).

Cost savings reinvested 
in future growth
(NEW)
A programme of signiﬁ cant cost reductions is taking 
place, in order to fund a number of investments which 
will deliver sustainable revenue growth (for more 
details of cost savings and reinvestments, see 
pages 7 to 9).
The Programme for Growth is currently aiming to 
deliver annualised savings of £110 million (up from 
our original target of £80 million) with £50 million 
of those cost savings being invested in increased 
sales and marketing expense by 2010 to deliver 
more sustainable long-term revenue growth and 
an improvement in adjusted operating margin. 
This metric is closely linked to metrics on pro forma 
revenue growth and adjusted operating margin.

The additions of ‘nearshore and offshore 
headcount’, ‘customer satisfaction’ and 
‘cost savings reinvested in future growth’ 
reﬂ ect new metrics being used alongside 
our existing KPIs to assess the progress of 
the Programme for Growth (see page 8 for 
more Programme for Growth metrics).
Customer satisfaction 
(NEW)
A weighted mean score for key questions in the 
revised annual Logica customer survey.
Customer satisfaction is a key objective. The 
weighted mean score is a measure of the overall 
effectiveness of our engagement with our customers 
and the change in satisfaction from year to year.

11 Annual Report 2013 We are pleased to report on good 
operational and financial performance 
for 2013.
The results reflect a growing momentum across the Group, driven by organic growth as well 
as the acquisition of PEG, the New York City based baseball practice, in late 2012. Overall 
trading conditions in North American baseball and sports marketing, the mainstay of the 
Group’s business, continue to be positive. 
These factors enabled the Group to consolidate on its strong position in the baseball 
sector where it climbed to number 1 rank in total clients, increasing the total client roster of 
professional baseball players to 249, up from 173 in the previous year.
The total overall client base of TLA increased by 16% to 440 compared with 2012 and 
the Group’s activities cover a variety of major international sports including baseball, golf, 
basketball, American football and Olympic athletes.
The Group’s reported results do not include an item of revenue within our baseball 
division, invoiced in December 2013, as the amounts have not yet been recovered from the 
client. In March 2014 the Group commenced proceedings to recover fees of $1.6 million it 
believes are due. Given the uncertainty around the eventual timing and outcome of that 
process, no revenue has been included in the 2013 results. Inclusion of these amounts in 
the year end 31 December 2013, assuming a full recovery, would have resulted in Headline 
EBITDA of $8.7 million and revenue of $20.2 million.
Total long-term contracted revenues rose 45% to $58 million (2012: $41 million) providing 
excellent forward revenue visibility. Both the US baseball market and the wider sports 
marketing industry globally have continued to enjoy excellent long-term fundamentals. 
This provided a positive backdrop for the Group last year and supports the Group’s future 
prospects. 
Market opportunity and strategy
According to industry estimates, the overall US sports market is worth approximately $48 
billion per annum, with the key segments of sponsorship and media rights worth over $9 
billion and $12 billion per annum respectively. These segments are forecast to grow faster 
than the overall US sports market at 6.3% and 7.8% per annum against growth of 4.7% for 
the overall market.

Baseball, which currently accounts for 70% of our revenue, is a huge industry and 
highly profitable at MLB club level. It has historically proven to be recession resistant, is 
well regulated with a defined salary and career structure for its players, and has also grown 
steadily. Total MLB revenues have increased from approximately $4.5 billion in 2010 to $8.3 
billion in 2013, reflecting rising gate receipts and national, international and local media 
rights fees. 
To put the size of the baseball market into context, the aggregate MLB revenues 
amounted to more than $30 billion over the past four years compared with $13.5 billion for 
the Premier League and $8 billion for the four year Olympic cycle to London 2012. In addition, 
the agreement over a new media broadcasting rights deal from 2014 will significantly 
increase the revenue to MLB and MLB players over the next eight years. 
TLA’s strategy remains to expand our activities in a range of major sports in North 
America and other key regions where the core sports at the heart of our business have 
value. While our focus will be on organic growth, the Group will also look for acquisition 
opportunities that allow us to consolidate and widen our position within our target markets. 
People
In order to support the Group’s expansion, we continue to invest in staff, including several 
senior level hires within the operating businesses such as a head of media consulting. We also 
appointed Don Malter as our new Chief Financial Officer on 17 September 2013. 
Outlook
Following significant investment in people and resources, TLA has established a solid 
foundation to implement the Group’s growth strategy and take advantage of excellent sports 
market fundamentals. We will continue to seek selective talent and business acquisitions  
to enhance our service offering and geographic reach, to ensure we service our growing  
client base. 
Excellent progress has also been made in broadening the revenue base through the launch 
of new proprietary sports events, which will make a small contribution from this year and are 
expected to grow over the long term.
We got into our stride in 2013, resulting in strong revenue growth, achieving the leading 
position in baseball representation and a rapidly expanding client list and sports marketing 
business. The Group’s first quarter revenues are up on the same period last year and the trading 
momentum remains encouraging across all activities. The outlook for 2014 is positive given the 
new long-term media and broadcasting rights in baseball and our developing events business. 
The business of sports is currently benefitting from excellent long-term fundamentals. With 
good trading momentum and the US baseball industry set to reap higher media rights revenues 
from this year, we look to deliver solid growth for the year, underpinned by excellent forward 
revenue visibility. As a result, the Board looks to the future with confidence. This has enabled 
the Group to continue our progressive dividend policy, with a 17% increase in the dividend per 
share in 2014.

progress in 2013 with both increasing 
their revenues and operating profits 
compared with 2012.
The move from our multiple offices in New York City into a single location at Times Square in 
June 2013 has completed the integration of the business. 
Baseball representation
The baseball representation business, which derives revenues through long term 
relationships with many established and young players, had a solid year. Revenues increased 
by 30% to $13.1 million in 2013 (2012: $10.1 million), reflecting like for like organic growth of 
2% and the first full year contribution from PEG. Based in New York City, PEG is particularly 
strong in representing Spanish-speaking players of Latin American origin. 
A total of $150 million worth of contracts were signed on behalf of clients during the 2013 
off-season (2012: $210 million). This was lower than 2012 due to fewer contracts requiring 
negotiation for 2013. 76 new baseball players were added to the client list in 2013 bringing 
the total baseball client list to 249 (2012: 173)
The roster of potential new stars also continued to grow with 190 Minor League Baseball 
clients (2012: 117) of which 19 (2012: 18) were called up to major league teams thereby 
starting their initial three year service period. This will enable us to negotiate future 
contracts on their behalf at higher market related salaries on which TLA will start to earn 
fees in the coming years. 
Looking ahead, a new eight-year TV rights contract for MLB commences with the 2014 
baseball season, which will substantially increase MLB revenue. The agreement, worth $12.4 
billion over eight years to MLB, represents an increase of more than 100% in annual rights 
fees to MLB compared with previous years. As a result, many player contracts have been 
structured to match this revenue profile, with lower salaries in 2013 and then increases in 
future years. This will clearly benefit our clients and therefore the Group in 2014 
and beyond.
As set out in the Group’s half-year results, the Draft (the mechanism for appropriating 
young players to teams) did not produce the revenues that we expected. This was caused by

Sports marketing 
The Sports Marketing division continued to grow with revenues increasing 10% to $5.5 million 
(2012: $5.0 million). We now have 12 PGA clients (2012:13), including some of Golf’s hottest 
young talents evidenced by two Tour wins and 25 top 10 PGA TOUR finishes in 2013, with a 
further three wins in 2014. 
PGA TOUR revenues rose in 2012 to a record high of $1.1 billion, highlighted by a nine-year 
television deal, which commenced in 2011 and averages $800 million per annum. These 
markets are key drivers for the growth of TLA’s Sports Marketing Division as they underpin 
marketing spend and increase our ability to secure sponsorship opportunities for our clients.
Talent marketing continued to perform well in commercially promoting its clients, 
securing sponsorship deals for clients with such companies as GEICO, Under Armour, Adidas 
and Web.com, as well as advising Izod and Samsung with their golf brand activation at the 
Masters and the US Open. We also secured our first National Basketball Association client, 
Trey Burke. 
Coaching and broadcasting continues to grow. We now have the leading NCAA basketball 
coaching business, increasing our client base by 15% and increasing our representation of 
coaches with teams in the 2013 NCAA Champions Tournament by 38%. In broadcasting we 
have grown our representation by 17.6% to 40 clients (2012: 34), who include Jay Onrait and 
Dan O’Toole, the new hosts of Fox Sports 1.
We have added new service offerings to the Sports Marketing business by internally 
developing our ability to advise rights holders and teams on their media value rights. We 
expect to see both the events and the media rights consulting businesses contribute further 
during 2014 and provide growth to TLA in the future.
At the end of 2013 we opened an office in Melbourne to pursue the strong sports 
marketing and event opportunities that exist in the Australasian market. The opportunity in 
this market is borne out by the fact that the first MLB games of the 2014 season were played 
in Sydney in late March 2014, with other opportunities of a similar nature, currently live and 
moving to contract.
New revenue streams
We created and delivered our first event around the MLB All-Star baseball game, which took 
place in July 2013, and followed this up with a similar event around NFL’s Super Bowl in 
January 2014. We also created a larger two-day event called “Baseball City”, which took place 
in Phoenix in March 2014 and was timed to align with fans that attended baseball spring 
training. The event was successful and made a small profit.
Since the year-end, we have been appointed by the National Hockey League (NHL), to 
promote and sell its digital content in the Australian market.

NFL broadcasting  This review covers the year ended 31 December 2013. For this period the Group reported a 
statutory profit before tax of $0.1 million (2012: loss of $0.1 million). The performance at 
the operating level, before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional charges 
showed an Headline EBITDA of $7.3 million (2012: $6.6 million).
Headline results
 w Cash balances as at 31 December 2013 of $4.4 million (2012: $4.1 million) and net debt of 
$5.8 million (2012: $3.9m).
 w The Group’s reported results do not include an item of revenue within our baseball 
division, invoiced in December 2013, as the amounts have not yet been recovered from 
the client. In March 2014 the Group commenced proceedings to recover fees of $1.6 
million it believes are due, triggered by services provided to a client in the year ended 31 
December 2013 and prior years. In April 2014 the case was assigned for arbitration which 
is the normal route for fee recovery in the industry. Given the uncertainty around the 
eventual timing and outcome of that process, no revenue has been included in the 2013 
results, although costs of the action to date have been expensed as incurred. The finally 
determined income will therefore be reflected as and when the cash is received. Inclusion 
of these amounts in the year end 31 December 2013, assuming a full recovery through the 
arbitration process or otherwise, would have resulted in Headline EBITDA of $8.7 million 
and revenue of $20.2 million.

amortisation of acquired intangibles. The 2013 period includes a full year contribution from 
PEG, compared to 60 days in 2012 which produced a $0.5 million loss.
Trading for the year ended 31 December 2013 showed revenue of $5.5 million, Headline 
EBITDA of $2.5 million and operating profit of $1.3 million. The reduction in EBITDA margin 
reflects investment in additional people to establish the events and media businesses within 
the division. 
20 TLA Worldwide PLC    Cash flow and Banking Arrangements
Cash generated from operating activities for the year ended 31 December 2013 was  
$3.3 million (December 2012: $2.4 million). Cash as at 31 December 2013 was $4.4 million  
(2012: $4.1 million) and net debt was $6.0 million (2011: $3.9m). 
The Group has an outstanding term loan of $7.0 million and a revolver facility of $7.0 
million of which $3.4 million was drawn as at 31 December 2013. This was a new $15 million 
banking facility arranged in January 2013 with SunTrust Bank for a term of five years to 
January 2018. We have reduced the interest margin by 1%, the full benefit of which will not 
be seen until our hedge against future interest rate increases unwinds. 
Cash earn-outs payments due for 2014 total $2.99 million. $1.03 million has so far been 
paid. The balance will be paid the first half of 2014.
Dividends
The board proposes a final dividend of 0.7 pence per share (2012: 0.6 pence) payable on 11 July 
2014 to shareholders on the register at 30 May 2014. The ex-dividend date is 28 May 2014.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The management of the Group and the execution of the Group’s strategies are subject to a 
number of risks. The key business risk affecting the Group are shown below:
r i s k m a n ag e m e n t The significant risks that the Group faces have been considered and policies have been 
implemented to best deal with each risk. The four most significant risks are considered to 
be liquidity, finance cost risk, customer relationship risk and management risk. The Group 
is significantly based in the US and reports in US dollars and so direct exposure to exchange 
risk is considered to be minimal.
l i q u i d i t y r i s k The year-end net debt was $6.0 million (2012: $3.9 million) which consisted of $7.0 million 
of interest bearing loans and a $3.4 million revolver (2012: $8.0 million of interest bearing 
loans). Both of these facilities do not mature until January 2018. The Group revolving facility 
is for a total of $7.0 million and the Group had cash of $4.4 million as at the year-end. The 
Group’s cash and net debt position is continually monitored.

final dividend of 0.7

21 Annual Report 2013 f i n a n c e r i s k c o st The Group pays finance costs on its bank facilities. These facilities finance costs are a variable 
cost linked to LIBOR plus a margin. Interest rates are managed through an interest rate swap. 
The average finance cost on the facilities for the Group in 2013 was 4.5% (2012: 5.5%)
c u sto m e r r e l at i o n s h i p s r i s k The Group has commercial relationships with 440 clients. Attrition rates are low and 
relationships are strong. In the case of baseball contracts, any revenues negotiated by the 
Group survive the termination of relationship with a client. No client accounts for more than 
6% of revenue (2012: 8%).
m a n ag e m e n t It’s likely that changes to members of the senior management team would impact on the 
Group’s ability to perform to the expectations within its strategy. The Board ensures that the 
management team is appropriately rewarded for its efforts and that succession planning is 
considered. In the case of vendor management they are incentivised through the ability to 
achieve future earn out payments.

on page 28, the necessary disclosure of the directors’ 
remuneration earned in respect of the financial year by

appropriate to provide the following information to 
shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of:
 w Andrew Wilson (chairman)
 w Keith Sadler
 w Bart Campbell
The Code recommends that a remuneration committee 
should be comprised of entirely independent non-

to a major shareholder, and Bart Campbell, due to his 
shareholding in the Company and his influence in its 
formation, are not independent under the Code. The

The Group’s policy on remuneration for the current 
period and, so far as is practicable for subsequent

Committee believes that it should retain the flexibility

policy in subsequent years will be detailed in future 
reports on remuneration. The Group must ensure that 
its remuneration arrangement attract and retain people 
of the right calibre in order to ensure corporate success 
and to enhance shareholder value. Its overall approach is 
to attract, develop, motivate and retain talented people 
at all levels, by paying competitive salaries and benefits 
to all staff and encouraging its staff to hold shares in the 
group. Pay levels are set to take account of contribution 
and individual performance, wage levels elsewhere in the 
Group and with reference to relevant market information.

them the opportunity to increase their earnings by linking 
pay to achieving business and individual targets.

effective way of strengthening employees’ involvement 
in the development of the business and bringing together 
their interest and those of shareholders and as such

Head men's basketball coach, 
University of Notre Dame Directors’ 
responsibilities 
statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year . Under that law the 
directors are required to prepare the group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under company law the directors must 
not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company 
and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
 w select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 w make judgments and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 w state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
 w prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
 w properly select and apply accounting policies;
 w present information, including accounting policies, in 
a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; 
 w provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance; and
 w make an assessment of the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 w the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole;

By order of the Board
40 TLA Worldwide PLC    Independent auditor’s 
report to the members 
of TLA Worldwide PLC
We have audited the group financial statements of TLA 
Worldwide plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 
which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance 
Sheet, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Group Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 
1 to 27. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of 
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the group financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
 w give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of its profit for the 
year then ended;
 w have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and
 w have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

47 Annual Report 2013 Principal  
accounting policies
General information 
TLA Worldwide PLC (the “Company”) is incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The Company 
and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) principal 
activities are set out as part of the business review on 
pages 18 to 22. These financial statements are presented 
in US Dollars because that is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Group operates. 
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED 
STANDARDS
The following IFRIC interpretations and amendments to 
existing standards and new standards have been adopted 
in the current year but have not impacted the reporting 
results of the financial position:
IAS 12 Income taxes (amended) – deferred tax: 
recovery of underlying assets
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: Transfers of 
Financial Assets 
At the date of authorization of these financial 
statements, the following standards and interpretations 
which have not been applied in these financial statements 
were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had 
not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 1 (Amended) Severe Hyperinflation and Removal 
of Fixed Dates for First Time Adopters
IFRS 7 (Amended) Financial instruments: Disclosures: 
enhancing disclosures about offsetting financial 
assets and financial liabilities and disclosures 
about the initial application of 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 10 C onsolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IAS 1 (amended) Presentation of Items of Other 
Comprehensive Income
IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits 
IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures
IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a 
Surface Mine
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these 
standards and interpretations in future periods will have 
no material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group. The accounting policies set out below have, unless 
otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application 
of these accounting policies that have a significant effect 
on the consolidated financial statements together with 
estimates with significant risk of material adjustment in 
the next year are discussed in note 25.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the forecasts for the year 
ending 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015. The 
Directors consider the forecasts to be prudent and have 
assessed the impact on the Group’s cash flow, facilities 
and headroom within its banking covenants. Further, the 
Directors have assessed the future funding requirements 
of the Group, including the scheduled payments of 
deferred consideration for acquisitions, and compared the 
level of the borrowing facilities. 
Based on this work, the Directors are satisfied that 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future despite current 
economic uncertainty. For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
48 TLA Worldwide PLC    Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). The financial statements have also 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by 
the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for the revaluation of financial 
instruments. Historical cost is generally based on the  
fair value of the consideration given in exchange for  
the assets. The principal accounting policies are set  
out below:
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate 
the financial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up 
to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where 
the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their 
fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any 
deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values 
of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on 
acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the 
period of acquisition. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed 
of during the year are included in the consolidated 
income statement from the effective date of acquisition 
or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies 
used into line with those used by the group. All intra-
group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted 
for using the acquisition method. The consideration for 
each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued 
by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss 
as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition 
includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-
date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values 
are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where 
they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see 
below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of 
contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability 
are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. 
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration 
classified as equity are not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, 
the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired 
entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date 
(i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting 
gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts 
arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the 
acquisition date that have previously been recognised in 
other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or 
loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that 
interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 3(2008) are recognised at their 
fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
 w deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or 
assets related to employee benefit arrangements 
are recognised and measured in accordance with 
IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits 
respectively;
 w liabilities or equity instruments related to the 
replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-
based payment awards are measured in accordance 
with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
 w assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as 
held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current 
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are 
measured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is 
incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which 
the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional 
amounts for the items for which the accounting is 
incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period (see below), or additional 
assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new 
information obtained about facts and circumstances that 
existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would 
have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date 
of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete 
information about facts and circumstances that existed 
as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of 
one year.
Revenue
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and comprises amounts billed to 
clients in respect of fees earned and commission-based 
income, together with fees earned from the provision of 
support services to other agents and is stated exclusive 
of any relevant sales taxes. Revenue is recognised in line 
with the provision of relevant services under the terms 
of the contract, provided that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount 
49 Annual Report 2013 of revenue can be measured reliably.
All revenue is earned from talent representation, and 
can be split into three revenue streams:
1) Representation revenue
Representation revenue is generated from a commission 
paid as a percentage of a player’s base salary. Base 
salaries are fees payable by baseball clubs to their 
players. These fees are contractual obligations made 
by the club to pay the player for a specific number of 
seasons. Revenue is recognised at the point the player 
becomes contractually obliged to pay commission to the 
Group.
2) Signing bonuses
Signing bonuses are amounts payable by the clubs to 
the player for signing a contract. The Group earns a 
commission based on a percentage of the signing bonus. 
Commission revenue is recognised when the player 
receives the signing bonus from the relevant baseball 
club, at which point the player becomes contractually 
obliged to pay commission to the Group.
3) Endorsement revenue
Endorsement revenue is generated from commission 
calculated as a percentage of fees earned by clients for 
guest appearances, wearing of certain attire or other 
sponsorship deals. Revenue is recognised based on the 
terms of the individual contracts, in the period that the 
associated fees are earned by the player
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes commission-based staff costs, 
including salaries, bonuses and social security costs, and 
expenses reimbursed to commission-based agents.
Property, plant and equipment
The fixtures and fittings are stated at cost. Depreciation is 
computed on the straight-line method using an estimated 
useful life ranging from three to fifteen years. Repairs and 
maintenance are charged to expense in the year incurred, 
major improvements and new assets are capitalized and 
depreciated using an estimated useful life ranging from 
three to five years. The estimated useful lives are as 
follows:
 w Fixtures and fittings – 3 to 5 years  
It is assumed that all assets will be used until the end of 
their useful life.
Intangible assets and goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised 
as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the 
acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of 
the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair 
value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest 
(if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair 
value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the 
sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value 
of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less 
than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss 
is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets 
of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of 
each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of 
goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or 
loss on disposal.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination 
whose fair values can be reliably measure are separated 
from goodwill and amortised based on the future 
cashflows attributable to the individual assets.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and 
goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at 
each balance sheet date. Other intangibles assets are 
amortised from the date they are available for use. The 
estimated useful lives are as follows:
 w Client contracts – over life of the contract
 w Customer relationships – 6–8 years
Impairment
For goodwill that has an indefinite useful life the 
recoverable amount is estimated annually. For other 
assets the recoverable amount is only estimated when 
there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use.
Impairment losses recognized in respect of cash-
generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating 
unit and then to reduce the carrying amount of other 
assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating 
unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that 
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the 
cash flow from other assets or group of assets. Details of 
which are set out in note 10. 
50 TLA Worldwide PLC    Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit 
for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as 
reported in the income statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible 
in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax 
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a 
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to 
be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except when it relates 
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate 
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each group 
company are presented in the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which it operates (its functional 
currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial 
statements, the results and financial position of each 
group company are expressed in US Dollars which is 
the presentation currency for the consolidated financial 
statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual 
companies, transactions in currencies other than the 
entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are 
recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the 
dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was 
determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in 
the period in which they arise except for:
 w exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings 
relating to assets under construction for future 
productive use, which are included in the cost of those 
assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to 
interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;
 w exchange differences on monetary items receivable 
from or payable to a foreign operation for which 
settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur 
(therefore forming part of the net investment in the 
foreign operation), which are recognised initially in 
other comprehensive income and reclassified from 
equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal 
of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial 
statements, the assets and liabilities of the group’s 
foreign operations are translated at exchange rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense 
items are translated at the average exchange rates for 
the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly 
during that period, in which case the exchange rates at 
the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences 
arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-
controlling interests as appropriate). 
Translation differences on non-monetary financial 
assets and liabilities are reported as part of the fair value 
gain or loss. Translation differences on non- monetary 
financial assets, such as investments in equity securities 
classified as available for sale, are included in the fair 
value reserve in equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the 
closing rate.
51 Annual Report 2013 Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded 
at an amount and the amount of the proceeds received 
net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis 
in the Consolidated income statement using the effective 
interest rate method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not 
settled in the period in which they arose. 
Finance costs
Finance costs of financial liabilities are recognised in the 
income statement over the term of such instruments at a 
constant rate of the carrying amount.
Operating leases
Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are not transferred to the Group are treated 
as operating leases. Rentals under operating leases are 
charged to the income statement on a straight line basis 
over the period of the lease.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and 
demand deposits and other short term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on 
a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial 
asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of 
the financial asset within the timeframe established by 
the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair 
value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial 
assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, 
which are initially measured at fair value. 
Financial assets are classified into the following 
specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair value through 
profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘held-to-maturity’ investments, 
‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets and ‘loans and 
receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and 
purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the 
time of initial recognition.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. 
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective 
interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed 
for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. 
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that, as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial 
asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment 
have been affected. 
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified 
as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value 
of the security below its cost is considered to be objective 
evidence of impairment. 
For all other financial assets, including redeemable 
notes classified as AFS and finance lease receivables, 
objective evidence of impairment could include:
 w significant financial difficulty of the issuer or 
counterparty; or
 w default or delinquency in interest or principal 
payments; or
 w it becoming probable that the borrower will enter 
bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade 
receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired 
individually are, in addition, assessed for impairment on 
a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for 
a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the 
number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the 
average credit period of 60 days, as well as observable 
changes in national or local economic conditions that 
correlate with default on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the 
amount of the impairment is the differences between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial 
asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is 
reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial 
assets with the exception of trade receivables, where 
the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an 
allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance 
account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against the allowance account. 
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account 
are recognised in profit or loss.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either 
financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the 
substance of the contractual arrangement. 
52 TLA Worldwide PLC    EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting 
all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group 
are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial 
liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FVTPL 
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when 
the financial liability is either held for trading or it is 
designated as at FVTPL. 
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
 w it has been incurred principally for the purpose of 
repurchasing it in the near term; or
 w on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of 
identified financial instruments that the Group 
manages together and has a recent actual pattern of 
short-term profit-taking; or 
 w it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as 
a hedging instrument. 
A financial liability other than a financial liability held 
for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial 
recognition if:
 w such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a 
measurement or recognition inconsistency that would 
otherwise arise; or 
 w the financial liability forms part of a group of financial 
assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed 
and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, 
in accordance with the Group’s documented risk 
management or investment strategy, and information 
about the grouping is provided internally on that 
basis; or
 w it forms part of a contract containing one or 
more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement permits 
the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be 
designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, 
with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss 
recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid 
on the financial liability and is included in the ‘other gains 
and losses’ line item in the income statement. Fair value is 
determined in the manner described in note 26. 
OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are 
initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with 
interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability 
and of allocating interest expense over the relevant 
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash payments through 
the expected life of the financial liability, or, where 
appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount 
on initial recognition.
DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and 
only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or they expire.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group enters into a interest rate swaps to manage its 
exposure to interest rate, The Group holds. Further details 
of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 17.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value 
at the date a derivative contract is entered into and 
are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at 
each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as 
a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair 
value is recognised as a financial liability. A derivative is 
presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability 
if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled 
within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as 
current assets or current liabilities.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are 
stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a 
trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment 
is under contract whose terms require the delivery of 
the investment within the timeframe established by the 
market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, 
including transaction costs. Investments are classified 
either as available for sale, and are measured at 
subsequent reporting dates at fair value, or at amortised 
cost, where no fair value is readily determinable.
Gains and losses on available for sale financial assets 
arising from changes in fair value are recognized directly 
in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined 
to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is included in the net 
profit or loss for the period.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at 
their nominal value.
53 Annual Report 2013  Notes Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements
1. Segmental analysis
The Group reports its business activities in two areas: 
Baseball Representation and Sports Marketing. 
Unallocated represents the Group’s costs as a public 
company, along with intragroup transactions, and 
exceptional items (see note 4). The Group derives its 
revenues in the United States of America.
Baseball Representation – primarily assists the on 
field activities of baseball players, including all aspects  
of a player’s contract negotiation.
Sports Marketing – primarily assists the off-field 
actives of athletes; it represents broadcasters and 
coaches in respect of their contract negotiations; 
manages and produces events, primarily in sports; 
 and media consultancy.
All of the Group’s revenue arises through the 
rendering of services. In the year ended 31 December 
2013, there were no clients who generated in excess of  
10 percent of total revenue (2012: none).
56 TLA Worldwide PLC    The accounting policies of the reportable segments are 
the same as the Group’s accounting policies described the 
principal accounting policies. Segment profit represents 
the profit earned by each segment, central administration 
costs including directors’ salaries, exceptional, acquisition 
and finance costs, and income tax expense. This is the 
measure reported to the Group’s Chief Executive for 
the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of 
segment performance.

61 Annual Report 2013 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or 
more frequently if there are indications that goodwill 
might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of all three CGUs are 
determined from value in use calculations. The key 
assumptions for the value in use calculations are those 
regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected 
changes to contractual revenue and direct costs during 
the period. 
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax 
rates that reflect current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The unit cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate of 11.5% (2011: 11.5%) which the Directors 
believe adequately reflects current market assessment 
in respect of both the time value of money and the risk 
specific to each CGU. This discount factor was considered 
to be appropriate for all the units, given their geography 
and market sector. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the 
impairment test of each CGUs carrying value. A decline of 
15% to cash flows, or an increase in the discount rate to 
17% would result in the carrying value of goodwill being 
reduced to its recoverable amount.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived 
from the most recent financial budgets approved by 
management for the next five years and extrapolates cash 
flows for the following five years based on an estimated 
growth rate of 0% (2012: 0%). This rate does not exceed 
the average long-term growth rate for the relevant 
markets.
As a consequence the Directors do not consider any 
need for impairment to Goodwill as at 31 December 2013.

63 Annual Report 2013 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the 
Group considers any change in the credit quality of the 
trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted 
up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit 
risk is limited due to the customer base being large and 
unrelated.
The Directors have considered the material receivables 
that are past due dates with senior management directly 
responsible for those relationships. On the basis of these 
discussions and the credit control procedures in place the 
directors consider that these receivables are recoverable. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade 
and other receivables is approximately equal to their  
fair value.
14. Trade and other payables
Amounts payable to providers of services and accruals 
principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade 
purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit period 
taken for trade purchases is 27 days (2012: 23 days). 
For most suppliers no interest is charged on the trade 
payables for the first 30 days from the date of the 
invoice. Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding 
balances at various interest rates. The Group has financial 
risk management policies in place to ensure that all 
payables are paid within the pre-agreed credit terms.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of 
trade payables approximates to their fair value.
15. Borrowings
All borrowings are denominated in US dollars. The other 
principal features of the Company’s borrowings are as 
follows:
 w interest is charged at 2.25% above US LIBOR;
 w the facilities is secured against trade receivables and 
contracted revenue;
 w the loan repayments are made quarterly plus a final 
bullet repayment over the life of the loan; and
 w the facilities are renewable in January 2018.
16. Derivative financial instruments
On 16 December 2011 the Group entered into an interest 
rate swap of 5.22% for the period 8 December 2011 to 2 
December 2016 for $10 million of its borrowings.
The swap is designated a hedge of the interest rate 
expenses relating to the Group loans. The contract was 
marked to market on 31 December 2013 and had a fair 
value liability of $63,000 (31 December 2012: $129,000).

Interest Rate Swap 63 129
64 TLA Worldwide PLC    The interest rate swap’s contractual maturity is summarised below:
17. Deferred consideration
Under the terms of the acquisition agreements in relation to Agency, Legacy, and PEG the Company has obligations to 
the vendors of those businesses as set out below:
In addition to the liabilities detailed above an additional 
$12,177,000 (2012: $12,177,000) consideration payable in 
shares. $3,898,063 is due for issue on 17 April 2014 and 
$6,967,937 is due for issue on 8 June 2014. The balance  
of $1,311,300 will be issued on the request of the vendors 
of PEG. These shares are not contingent on any future 
event and are therefore considered an equity item  
(see note 20). 
The cash deferred consideration requires the 
conversion into cash of the EBIT underlying the earn-out 
payment prior to its payment date. To the extent this  
this has not achieved the earn-out is reduced by the  
cash shortfall. 
The Group has estimated the fair value of this liability 
based on the anticipated future EBIT of each underlying 
business. This value has then been discounted back to 
present value using the Group’s borrowing rate of 5.22%. 
The Group has the option to settle 30% of the 
$5,021,000 payable to PEG in shares in TLA (NY) Inc. In 
accordance with the terms of the exchange Agreement, 
these shares can be exchanged for Ordinary Shares in the 
capital of TLA Worldwide plc at any time at the option of 
the vendors. These payments are made annually for the 
next five years.

65 Annual Report 2013 18. Operating Leases
The Group’s future minimum operating lease payments are as follows:
The above represents a number of office premises. During the year $0.8 million (2012: $0.4 million) was recognised as 
an expense in the income statement. 
19. Share capital
The issued share capital of the Company and the changes during the year can be summarised as follows:
The Group settled fees in respect of International Sports 
Pty Limited supplying a director’s services. On 28 May 
2013 98,259 were issued at a price of 22.90p and on 4 
November 2013 78,040 where issued at a price of 28.83p. 
These shares held a total nominal value of £3,527 ($5,456) 
with a premium of $64,384.
The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which 
carry no right to fixed income.
20. Equity
The Share Premium arises from capital raised through the 
issue of ordinary shares to the extent that the nominal 
value is exceeded by the proceeds of the issue.
Shares to be issued reflect deferred consideration 
payable in respect to acquisitions made in the period. 
This issue is not contingent on any future event and is 
therefore considered an equity item (see note 17).

67 Annual Report 2013 25. Critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial information in conformity 
with IFRS requires the Group to make certain judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. These estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and 
other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates under different 
assumptions or conditions.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period 
or in the period of the revision and future periods if 
the revision affects both current and future periods. 
The Directors consider that the most significant area of 
accounting estimate relates to trade receivables, where 
clients have not settled in accordance with standard 
terms and conditions, and, the Directors have evaluated 
each balance receivable and made provisions for doubtful 
debts where appropriate, in accordance with experience 
of the normal basis on which such balances are settled.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING THE 
GROUP’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following are the critical judgements, apart from 
those involving estimations (which are dealt with 
separately below), that the directors have made in the 
process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in financial statements.
Impairment of goodwill
The carrying amount of goodwill is $29.0 million. 
The directors are confident that the carrying amount 
of goodwill is fairly stated, and have carried out an 
impairment review (note 10).
Other intangible assets
The valuation of client relationships and client contracts 
is based on key assumptions, which the Directors have 
assessed, and are satisfied that the carrying value of 
these assets is fairly stated (see note 11). An impairment 
review has been carried out.
Fair value on acquisition
On acquisition management are required by IFRS3 to 
assess the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. 
These assets and liabilities are often held at historical 
cost, which in some instances does not equal fair value.
The Directors have assessed the fair value of assets 
and liabilities in respect of the acquisition of the trade 
and certain assets.
Deferred consideration
The Directors have provided an estimate of the amount 
payable in respect of deferred contingent consideration. 
The valuation of this liability is based on future earnings 
of each acquired business. Management apply judgement 
in estimating the anticipated future cash flows and 
subsequent amounts payable. See note 18.
Recognition of revenue
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and comprises amounts billed to 
clients in respect of fees earned and commission-based 
income and is stated exclusive of any relevant sales taxes. 
Revenue is recognised on an accruals basis in line with 
the provision of relevant services under the terms of the 
contract, provided that it is probable that the economic 
benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue 
can be measured reliably.
Trade receivables 
The Group’s customers include athletes, talent and large 
corporations. Whilst dependant on it most high profile 
clients the board believe that it has structures in place 
to mitigate the risk of non-payment. In addition the 
regulatory framework around Major League Baseball in 
particular underpins this confidence. Historically there 
have been few instances of non-payment with late payers 
settling outstanding balances in an acceptable time 
frame. The enlarged group has over 440 clients which 
spread the risk going forward. It is a focus of the Board to 
closely monitor receivables as part of its KPIs.
26. Financial risk management 
objectives
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities 
in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns 
while maximising the return to shareholders through the 
optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s 
overall strategy remains unchanged from 2012.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net 
debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 16 
after deducting cash and cash equivalents, and equity 
attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed 
in note 21. The Group is not subject to any externally 
imposed capital requirements. Debt is defined as 
long- and short-term borrowings (excluding derivatives) 
as detailed in note 16. Equity includes all capital and 
reserves of the Group that are managed as capital.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods 
adopted (including the criteria for recognition, the basis 
of measurement and the bases for recognition of income 
and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial 
liability and equity instrument are disclosed within the 
principal accounting policies section of this report.
68 TLA Worldwide PLC    CATEGORIES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial liabilities and assets included in the balance sheet are as follows:
All of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, excluding 
derivative financial instruments, are held at amortised 
cost. The directors are of the opinion that there is no 
material difference between the book value and the fair 
value of any of these assets or liabilities.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES
The Group’s international operations expose it to a 
number of risks that include the effect of changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates, credit, and interest 
rates. As the majority of income and expenditure is in 
USD the main exchange risk is translational in effect to 
the earnings and dividends granted, when related to the 
share price in GBP. The Group holds external credit, which 
is discussed below.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its activities through a mixture of 
retained cash, operating cash flow, bank debt and equity 
finance. The Group monitors its exposure to interest 
rate risk in association with the bank debt and when 
investing its cash resources and has taken the decision 
to fix its rates at 5.22% for a period of five years on 16 
December 2012. Given this interest rate swap, interest 
rate fluctuations are not currently seen as sensitivity.
Credit risk
The Group’s customers include athletes, talent and large 
corporations. Whilst dependant on it most high profile 
clients the board believe that it has structures in place 
to mitigate the risk of non-payment. In addition the 
regulatory framework around Major League Baseball in 
particular underpins this confidence. Historically there 
have been few instances of non-payment with late payers 
settling outstanding balances in an acceptable time 
frame. 
The enlarged group has over 440 clients which spread 
the risk going forward. It is a focus of the Board to closely 
monitor receivables as part of its KPIs.
Liquidity risk
The Group has continued to maintain positive cash 
resources well above working capital requirements, 
providing a strong balance sheet visible to the Group’s 
customer base, but also ensuring sufficient available 
funds for operations, potential expansion or the potential 
financing of small acquisitions.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining 
contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial 
liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The tables have 
been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of 
financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the 
Group can be required to pay.

27. Share based payments 
EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE OPTION SCHEME
In December 2013 the Company entered into a Long Term 
Incentive Scheme (“LTIP”) for certain employees of the 
Group. The LTIP is split into three tranches, exercisable 
when the share price reaches £0.40, £0.50 and £0.60 for a 
three month period respectively. 
The vesting period is five years from the Company’s 
IPO date of 8 December 2011. If the awards remain 
unexercised after this period the options expire. Options 
are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the 
options vest. 
Details of the share options outstanding during the 
year are as follows.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2013 had a 
weighted average exercise price of £0.46 and a weighted 
average remaining contractual life of 3 year. All options 
were granted on 19 December 2013. The aggregate of 
the estimated fair values of the options granted on those 
dates is $0.4 million. The inputs into the Black-Scholes 
model are as follows:
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the 
historical volatility of the group’s share price over the 
previous 3 years. The expected life used in the model has 
been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for 
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, 
and behavioural considerations.
The group recognised total expenses of $nil (2012: 
$Nil) related to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions.

1. Accounting policies 
BASIS OF PREPARATION
These financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting 
standards and have been prepared under the historical 
costs conventions and compliance with UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Standards.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 
2006, the Company has elected not to present its own 
profit and loss account for the year. The Company’s profit 
and loss account was approved by the Board on 29 April 
2014. The Company reported a loss for the year ended 31 
December 2013 of $2.8 million. The principal accounting 
policies of the Company are set out below. 
INVESTMENTS
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost, less provision 
for impairment.
CLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL 
INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY
Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated 
as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to 
the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
 w They include no contractual obligations upon the 
Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or 
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with 
another party under conditions that are potentially 
unfavourable to the Company; and
 w Where the instrument will or may be settled in the 
Company’s equity instruments, it is either a non-
derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable 
number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a 
derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging

Fibernet operates a niche strategy
We provide high value voice and
data networking services on long
term contacts within and between
the premises of our customers and
their customers. We are distinguished
by our capability , our focus, the quality
of our customers and the quality of
the business we do with them.
Our specialist customer teams
are best considered as integrators
that own a customisable national
network rather than as a smaller
version of an incumbent operator .
Our flexibility , willingness and
responsiveness together with our
specialisation in advanced
technologies helps our customers
differentiate their own services.
The underground routes our fibre
optic networks follow allow us to target
the largest and most demanding
businesses in the UK. With nearly
100 UK points of presence and
reaching more than 50 towns and
cities the national network routes
provide a hugely powerful conduit
for information destined to travel
between the headquarters, branch
and retail premises of our customers.
Our London metropolitan
network is one of the most pervasive
in the city , taking us within economic
reach of many of the major data
centres and headquarters operations
we look to serve. We have further
metropolitan networks in all major
UK cities, designed to take us as
close as possible to customers who
are headquartered regionally . It is
the close proximity of our network to
our target customers that enables us
to provide more cost effective services
than many of our competitors.
Our London and Frankfurt
metropolitan networks are also
home to our “Carrier Ring” services
– probably the busiest telecoms
hubs in Europe.
Many customers also appreciate
our willingness to upgrade and
integrate their local area network
technologies into a single, managed,
national network service.

How we operate
We focus on two markets
Our Enterprise customers are
typically the largest commercial
organisations in the UK. We focus
upon those with multiple premises
and a need to continually move very
large quantities of information within
and between them. Such organisations
are typically not prepared to accept
“off the shelf” service.
Our Service Provider customers
are typically other telecoms operators,
ISPs or integrators, who can benefit
from extremely high service levels,
the geographic reach of our network,
the capacity it has available, and the
technologies that distinguish it.
We focus on accommodating
individual customer needs by
designing and building “Bespoke”
services. Our services must dovetail
precisely with equipment they plan
to retain and provide clearly visible
advantages over services we plan
to replace.
The services below provide
a snapshot of some of the main
applications that drove our business
growth in 2004.
Enterprise Customers
Business Continuity:
Orders for TANet Optical services
represented more than £35m TCV
over the last 2 years.
With a TANet Optical Service, the
largest commercial organisations
are able to confirm that their business
continuity obligations may be met by
ensuring that failures at main
processing centres can be recovered
without pause at geographically
separate backup centres.
Server Consolidation:
T ANet Ethernet services deliver 5 times
more bandwith for the same price.
Fibernet’s Ethersphere service
makes it sensible for large organisations
to relocate branch office “server”
computers back to a central location.
As well as seeing strong customer
growth in this area in 2004 it was also
rewarding to be recognised as the
“European Ethernet Service Provider
of the Y ear” by international standards
group The Metro Ethernet Forum.
Voice and data convergence:
Voice over IP (VoIP) brings many
benefits to corporate customers.
It is widely considered inevitable that
over time all current generation PBX
(switchboard) systems will migrate to
VoIP . Fibernet’s 2nd generation MPLS
IPVPN service has supported not
only encouraging growth in the number
of Enterprise customers but also a
successful new resale initiative.
Non-geographic call management:
TANet Callchoice
Callchoice has been well received
by large contact centres, including
a major new Retail customer signing,
demanding improved customer
experience, lower costs and more
effective call management for their
inbound telephony services.
Service Provider Customers
National Access:
Many ISPs and Voice operators
provide service on a national basis,
yet do not own national network
assets of their own. Fibernet provide
a fast and cost effective alternative to
“self building” national infrastructure.
Our investment in a DSL and PPC
(wholesale leased line interconnects
with BT) infrastructure in 2003 has
led to several major customer signings
in 2004. During the year , our new
Ethersphere services have hosted
an almost wholesale migration by
ISPs from older SDH technology to
this newer , more cost effective service.
Our TANet Optical services have
also seen significant new orders
from Integrators like IBM and Fujitsu.
Interconnect:
Membership of Fibernet’s Carrier
Rings grew by 20% in 2004.
Membership of Fibernet’s London
and Frankfurt Carrier Rings grew by
20% and broke through the 100 barrier
in 2004. It currently stands at 105
international telecoms operators
who exchange in excess of 25 billion
minutes of voice calls with each other
annually . 2004 also saw the introduction
of the Fibernet sponsored “Carrier
Exchange Club” – a bi-annual “trading
floor” event designed to encourage
further business between members.

  Chairman’s Statement

I am pleased to report another year 
of progress for the Company.
Revenues increased year on year by
16 per cent from £36.3m to £42.2m.
Gross margins before exceptional
items* improved year on year from
26.6 per cent to 35.3 per cent.
Administrative expenses before
exceptional items* were contained 
to a 5 per cent increase. Losses 
from continuing operations before
exceptional items* have progressively
improved from £13.8m in the year 
to August 2002 to £10.2m in the 
year to August 2003 and £5.7m in the
year ended August 2004. The loss for
the financial year including exceptional
items was £5.1m as compared to
£5.0m in the prior period.
The strength of Fibernet’s core
business continues to be that existing
and new customer revenues are
derived from long-term (typically 3-7
years) contracts with predominantly
blue chip organisations in both our
Enterprise and Service Provider target
markets. Revenue is recognised
evenly over the contract period.
During the year ended August 2004,
we signed a further £53.6m of such
new contracts. These new contract
wins are in addition to the positive
effects of contract renewals with
existing customers. The value of our
long-term contracted revenue as at
31 August 2004 was £120.9m, an
increase of £23.1m over the prior
period figure of £97.8m.
EBITDA** before exceptional items
increased to £12.6m for the current
year as compared to £7.3m in the prior
period. We finished the year with a cash
balance of £15.7m as compared to
£24.9m for the prior period. We have
adequate cash headroom to execute
our current business plan.
We have achieved significant
progress during 2004. We continue to
focus on niche markets where we can
demonstrate clear competitive strength.
We have the financial resources
needed to continue to execute this
strategy and are optimistic for the future.
Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale
Chairman
13 October 2004
* Exceptional items are detailed
in note 3.
** EBITDA is reconciled to operating
loss in note 7.
Revenues increased by 1 6%,
gross margins improved
to 35.3%.
We have achieved significant
progress during 2004.
  2004 has been a year of significant
achievement for Fibernet.
Our continued focus on winning new
customers, maintaining a high rate
of renewals, cash management and
cost control has delivered a strong
performance. In the year to August
2003 we reduced losses before
exceptional items* through cost
reduction measures. In the year to
August 2004 we have reduced such
losses* further through revenue growth
and gross margin improvement.
We have focused on signing new
business across a broader range 
of vertical markets with both existing
and new services.
As the positive effect of the
sustained high levels of new
contracts signed and installed over
the last two years is now being felt,
I am pleased to report an increase
in revenues for the year from £36.3m
to £42.2m. Combined with our close
control of costs, this has reduced
our loss for the financial year before
exceptional items* from £10.2m in
2003 to £5.7m in 2004. EBITDA**
before exceptional items rose from
£7.3m in 2003 to £12.6m this year .
The loss for the financial year
including exceptional items was
£5.1m as compared to £5.0m in
the prior period.
Chief Executive’s Review
An increase in revenue,
combined with our close
control of costs has greatly
improved our bottom line
performance.
Losses before exceptional
items have reduced from
£10.2m in 2003 to £5.7m
in 2004.
4 The total value of new contracts
signed in the year was £53.6m. Whilst
this was below the £58.0m achieved in
2003, the annual revenue contribution
of the 2004 orders shows an increase
on 2003 attributable to marginally
lower average contract lengths. The
important figure of total long-term
contracted revenues of the business
rose significantly from £97.8m at the
end of 2003 to £120.9m at the 2004
year end.
The renewal of customer contracts
nearing expiry has also gone to plan
during the year both with the expected
number of re-signings and their actual
revenue value. The fact that we are
able to achieve these renewal levels is
not only a result of our competitiveness
but also a testament to the high quality
of service and the close relationships
that we keep with our customers.
Cash reserves at the end of the year
were as expected at £15.7m compared
with £24.9m a year ago and £20.5m 
at the half year . Our operating 
cash flow improved from £9.0m to
£12.2m during the period and capital
expenditure was £15.8m. It continues
to be the case that the majority of
capital expenditure is related to the
acquisition of new customers.
Against a continuing background
of relative uncertainty in the general
telecommunications market, I believe
that Fibernet’s continued focus on its
market niche has produced a very
satisfactory result for the year .
Looking forward, we continue 
to expect a return to a position 
of sustainable profitability in the
medium-term with losses reducing
further in the year to August 2005.
We have made an encouraging start
to 2005 with significant contracts signed
from customers in the Banking and
Pharmaceuticals sectors and our
underlying contract renewal rate is as
expected. However , it should be noted
that one of our larger customer contracts
is due for renewal in the year ahead
and our current expectation is that this
renewal will be significantly lower than
the normal renewal rate; being due to
exceptional changes in the customer’s
own business. This being the case, the
rate of improvement would slow for the
second half of the year ahead.
* Exceptional items are detailed 
in note 3.
** EBITDA is reconciled to operating
loss in note 7.

During the year we were successful
in signing new contracts with many
corporates including Deloitte, Royal Bank
of Scotland and Co-Operative Financial
Services and I am pleased to report
strong rates of contract renewals with
customers including Goldman Sachs
and Standard Chartered Bank.
The services we provide to these
markets continue to be dominated 
by combined data, voice and video
transfer between the major centres 
of our customers. We have also signed
increasing numbers of contracts for
services that are designed to facilitate
the efficient storage and retrieval of
data. Fibernet is particularly well
placed in this part of the market, both
with a long experience in the area 
and also assisted by our Advanced
T echnology Partnership with Cisco
Systems for supply of the specialised
optical networking components that
are required to provide the service 
to the customer .
It has been pleasing to see the
take up of the new services that we
developed last year including our
Callchoice product and the expanded
TANet Access portfolio which allows
us to serve not only the high
speed/head office requirements of
our customers, but also, their branch
offices and retail outlets.
Customers and Markets
It is our enduring ability to provide
innovative, reliable and cost effective
services to our Enterprise and Service
Provider customers that provides us
with our competitiveness. However,
what sets us apart is the bespoke
nature of the way we design, install and
care for the service that our customers
use. Crucially , this also extends to the
commercial and contractual matters
and provides for flexibility over the life
of the relationship.
Our Service Provider market has
continued to develop well during the
year . Significant new contract wins
include Energis, AT&T and Fujitsu.
Renewals of contracts in the period
include Pipex and PSInet. The London
and Frankfurt Carrier Rings (LCR and
FCR) have continued to perform well
and membership numbers are at
record levels.
Our Enterprise market, as ever , is
characterised by longer sales cycles
and installation lead times than our
Service Provider market but continues
to provide a positive balance in terms
of longer-term contract lengths.
In 2004 we have continued to see
our sales develop well both in terms 
of our traditional Financial Services
markets and also Retail, Manufacturing
and Facilities Management /Outsourcing.
Chief Executive’s Review continued
“The new network increases performance
and resilience, thus reducing costs
and improving efficiency”.
Peter Shepherd
Head of IT
Nottingham Building Society
Bespoke Managed Solutions –
Nottingham Building Society
Fibernet consultants designed
a bespoke managed IP virtual private
network (IP VPN), spanning over
30 branch offices based in the East
Midlands, South Y orkshire and London
for Nottingham Building Society .
Now live, the managed wide area
network links the Society’s main city
offices, disaster recovery site and 33
branch offices via Fibernet’s national
fibre optic network, providing a
complete managed IP VPN service.
This flexible solution provides 
any-to-any connectivity for all offices
and branches without having to route
all communications through the central
head office. It enables the building
Society to greatly improve inter-office
communications and customer
service, eliminating performance
bottlenecks and providing a network
suitable for future applications.
Customer service is keynote to
Nottingham Building Society’s ethos,
so dual connectivity has been provided
to every location to ensure high
availability of the service. The
bespoke design also enables the
society to implement IP T elephony . Innovative, reliable and cost
effective service provides our
competitiveness.
What sets us apart is the
bespoke way we deliver them.
“Our ISO9001:2000 accreditation
provides customers like Nottingham
Building Society with an initial indication 
of our commitment to service excellence.
The real proof of the pudding however
is the extremely high rates of service
contract renewals that we get”.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
“In an intensively competitive market,
staff retention, motivation and skills

Fibernet’ s Commitment to staff
Managerial development 
100% of line management staff
have commenced an ongoing
management skills development
programme.
Technical skills development
13% of all staff have studied for and
passed external technical exams 
in the last year .
We were confirmed this year as 
a Cisco Silver Partner , recertified 
as a Cisco Powered Network partner
and a Cisco Advanced T echnology
Partner in two disciplines.
Individual skills development 
All staff now participate in personal
skills development programs.
10% of all staff were promoted into
more demanding roles.
Quality process improvement
All offices are now ISO9001:2000
certified.
New automated workflow processes
improve customer service and staff
effectiveness.
Working environment improvement
Refurbishment of satellite offices
complete.
“Green” recycling policies extended
to all offices. 9
It has been pleasing to see
the take up of new services.
We now have products that
occupy all positions of the
market lifecycle.
Company Operations
2004 has been a year of considerable
progress on internal matters.
We have further developed and
expanded the underlying infrastructure
of the network to handle an ever
increasing customer demand for
bandwidth and new features.
Our MIS and IT department have
produced and launched enhanced
extranet facilities during the year to
customers who require online facilities
from us for order management and
service reporting. I expect that this
will be accelerated in 2005.
Fibernet’s own internal systems
and procedures across all departments
and offices have continued to progress
both to improve our efficiency and to
accommodate the continuing growth
in the business. We are now ISO9001:
2000 accredited throughout the 
entire Group.
Our network and the people that
operate it have provided our customers
with industry leading levels of care
and reliability . As a testament to this,
we have won “Best Carrier” at the
Internet Services Provider (ISPA)
awards and also the Metro Ethernet
Forum’s “Best European Ethernet
Service Provider of 2004” award.`
Product Development
We have continued our focus on
developing new services that both
complement the existing ones and
require levels of capital and marketing
expenditure that can be recovered
relatively quickly .
These include the provision 
of wholesale Internet access for 
our largest Enterprise Customers,
advanced telephony services using
the internet protocol (IP), and new
entry levels of membership for the
London and Frankfurt Carrier Rings.
In addition, we have strengthened
our supplier base to include a key
agreement with Huawei T echnologies
that will provide us with very cost
effective access to a broader range 
of networking electronics and
associated facilities.
As we continue to add new services
to our portfolios, (and within our niche)
we move ever closer to our long-term
goal of providing a total “end to end”
networking service for our customers.
We now have products which occupy
all positions of the market lifecycle
thereby maintaining a good balance
of emerging, new and mature streams
of income from our customers. 10

11 Financial Director’s Review
Revenues grew by 16% to £42.2m
in 2004 as compared to £36.3m in the
prior period. We saw a significant
upturn in reported revenues in the
second half of this year. Second half
year revenues were £23.8m compared
to £18.4m in the first half year.
During the year we signed £53.6m of
new customer contracts. Fibernet
continues to operate a prudent policy
in that we do not recognise revenues
from service contracts until the service
is fully installed. Many of these new
orders are for complex services with
large enterprise and service provider
customers. Given that such services
take a significant time to install, many
orders signed in the year have yet to have
an impact on our reported revenues.
We have again achieved good
contract renewals with existing
customers. Given the long-term nature
of customer contracts, only a proportion
of existing revenues come up for renewal
in a financial year .
1 6
%
Increase in revenues
12 During the year we signed a WAN
product contract with a major customer
for a total value of £4.3m. Revenue
recognition against this contract is
on a percentage completion basis.
Out of the total contract value of £4.3m,
£3.0m of revenue has been recognised
in the current year . T otal product sales
of £3.2m in the current year compare
to £2.6m for the prior period.
Gross profit for the full year , excluding
exceptional items* was £14.9m or
35.3% of revenues as compared the
prior year number of £9.7m or 26.6%.
Administrative expenses before
exceptional items* increased 5.1%
year on year driven predominantly by
additional staff costs to support the
growth of the business.
During the year , we concluded our
exit from France at lower costs than
expected generating a gain of £0.2m.
In addition, we utilised previously
impaired equipment to the value
of £0.5m. Both benefits are shown
in the profit and loss account as
exceptional items.
Earnings before exceptional items,
interest, taxation, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA**) increased 
to £12.6m for the group. Including
exceptional items, EBITDA increased
to £13.3m.
Profitability
The positive impacts of the above
achievements combined to reduce
our full year loss, excluding exceptional
items*, to £5.7m as compared to the
prior period loss of £10.2m. Including
exceptional items the net reported
losses were £5.0m. The prior period
result contained £5.2m of exceptional
benefits, notably arising from a rates
rebate and the write back of previous
impairment reserves.
13
Earnings per share and dividends
The loss per share was 8.2p as compared
with a loss of 8.1p last year . The Board
is currently unable to recommend the
payment of a dividend.
Taxation
No tax was payable in the period and
the group has significant tax losses
carried forward. During the period we
agreed and closed the tax computations
with the Inland Revenue for the period
to August 2001.
Cash flow, capital spending
and gearing
At the year-end, our cash balance
stands at £15.7m, a reduction of £9.2m
on the prior year . Capital expenditure
for the year was £15.8m as compared
to £14.2m in the prior period. The vast
majority of capital expenditure relates
to the cost of attaching new customers
to our existing network.
No funds were raised in the period
and the group has sufficient resources
for its stated plans.
Treasury
The Group’s treasury policies aim to
manage the financial risks that arise
from trading in a number of foreign
currencies and also to maximise the
interest income on cash deposits.
The Group places all sterling and
foreign currency cash balances not
immediately required on short-term
deposit. An external treasury manager
is utilised to assist in obtaining an
acceptable risk/return balance on excess
deposits. The Group does not intend to
speculate with financial instruments.
During the year we signed £53.5m
of new customer contracts.
Many orders have yet to have 
an impact on reported revenues.

Financial Director’s Review continued
Outlook
We have achieved a good level of new
order intake and existing customer
contract renewals over the past two
years. Both factors have contributed
to the revenue growth in the current
year 2004. With momentum now
established, service contract revenues
are again expected to increase in the
year ahead.
We have maintained a firm control
of administrative expenses and we
will continue to do so in the year ahead.
Cost increases are expected but of a
similar magnitude to the current year ,
again driven by new hires to support
the expected growth of the business.
The vast majority of our staff, including
main Board Directors, received a
base salary review of 2.5% effective
1st September 2004.
Whilst our cash balance is
expected to reduce next year , we still
have adequate cash headroom to
execute our business plan. With EBITDA
increasing, we are moving closer to
a position of achieving free cash flow
positive after capital spend.
Our key financial goal is to return to
a position of sustained profitability within
the medium term. We are demonstrating
clear progress towards our goal.

Return on Capital Investment 
The vast majority of capital expenditure
is driven by the requirements of attaching
new customers to our existing network
infrastructure. Such incremental
expenditure is always recovered over
the term of the initial customer contract.
Fibernet rarely invests in speculative
infrastructure build.
One exception of note was the
decision last year to acquire 220Km
of ducting in and around the city of
London. The duct was acquired for
£0.9m and trebled the reach of our
metropolitan network. The fibre routes
pass many buildings in our target markets
and were purchased to widen the market
opportunity for our Enterprise storage
and business continuity services.
Since the purchase, we have already
signed contracts in excess of £5.5m
that utilise this asset. As with the
majority of our products and services,
the service levels required are of such
a magnitude that they can only be
provided using owned assets over
which we have direct control of the
complete end to end solution.
“Our cautious approach to expenditure
and our careful qualification of customers’
needs and opportunity ensures that
we can provide not only reliable but
also very cost effective solutions.
The breadth, depth and cost profile
of our network infrastructure is a key
differentiator in winning new business.”

Remuneration Report
Introduction
The Company complies with the relevant conditions of the 2003 Combined Code on Corporate Governance relating 
to Directors’ remuneration as published by the London Stock Exchange and the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002.
The Regulations require the Auditors to report to the Company’s members on the “auditable part” of the Director’s
Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the regulations). The report has therefore been divided 
into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee at any time when Directors’ remuneration was considered were 
K C M Innes Ker (Committee Chairman), E R C Chovil and D Wolfson. The Committee’s role is to set levels of remuneration 
to attract and retain Executive Directors and members of the Senior Management T eam (Group Operating Board) 
and, in doing this, takes into account the level of remuneration throughout the Group and the T elecommunications
industry generally .
No Director plays a part in any discussions about his own remuneration.
The Committee consulted with Charles McGregor (Chief Executive) and Nick Bray (Financial Director), with regard 
to the remuneration and beneﬁts offered to senior executives during the year .
In addition, wholly independent advice on share schemes was received from PricewaterhouseCoopers who provided 
no other services to the Company during the year .
Remuneration policy
The policy of the Committee is to reward senior executives competitively , enabling the Company to recruit, motivate and
retain executives of the highest calibre, whilst avoiding paying excess remuneration. Further details of the remuneration
policy followed by the Committee are set out below . In conjunction with its remuneration consultants, the Committee
considers the remuneration practices adopted by a group of like companies that, in the opinion of the Committee,
face similar remuneration issues to the Company .
It is the aim of the Committee to encourage and reward high performance. It is the opinion of the Committee that
Shareholders’ interests are best served by setting a moderate level of ﬁxed pay while providing competitive potential
levels of total remuneration through short and longer-term incentive arrangements which require the satisfaction 
of challenging performance conditions. Therefore, a signiﬁcant proportion of executive remuneration is performance
linked as shown below .

Basic salaries, pensions and other beneﬁts
Basic salaries are established by those prevailing in the market generally for Executive Directors and Senior Managers of
comparable status, skills and responsibility in comparable industries. Salaries are reviewed on an annual basis and changes
are generally implemented with effect from 1 September each year . Charles McGregor , Nick Bray and Anthony Frewer
received a 2.5 per cent increase to basic salary effective from 1 September 2004 taking basic salaries for the year ahead to
£195,058, £141,834 and £128,125 respectively . Effective 1 March 2004, Anthony Frewer received a basic salary increase of
13.6 per cent from £110,000 to £125,000. This increase reﬂects his additional responsibilities on promotion to the Plc Board.
For Executive Directors and Senior Managers of the Group, pension contributions are paid into individual money purchase
schemes at a rate of 5 per cent of gross basic salary .
In addition to basic salary and pension the other beneﬁts included in the remuneration package are the provision 
of a car or car allowance, fuel, permanent health insurance and death in service cover .
Annual bonus
The Company operates an annual bonus scheme providing Executive Directors and Senior Managers with an opportunity
to earn a cash reward based on the achievement of annual targets. Should targets not be achieved then no bonus is payable.
Similarly , should targets be exceeded then bonus payments can be increased up to a maximum limit.
For the year ended 31 August 2004, the Remuneration Committee established a performance bonus scheme for
Executive Directors and Senior Managers based on achievement of a signiﬁcant reduction in the underlying Group loss.
Superior performance in the period resulted in an increased award being earned. The maximum bonus for the year ended
31 August 2004 was 80 per cent for Charles McGregor and 50 per cent for Nick Bray and Anthony Frewer . Amounts earned
were 48 per cent for Charles McGregor and 30 per cent for Nick Bray and Anthony Frewer .
For the ﬁnancial year ending 31 August 2005, the plan will again focus on the net proﬁtability of the Group. For Executive
Directors, the maximum bonus for the ﬁnancial year ending 31 August 2005 is 100 per cent of salary for Charles McGregor
and 85 per cent for Nick Bray and Anthony Frewer . The upper earnings limits of the Executive Directors were adjusted
following a review of comparable compensation packages in the sector and would only be earned on the achievement 
of outstanding performance.
Long Term Incentive Plans
The Company has operated both Executive and Save As Y ou Earn (SA YE) share option schemes. Executive share options
have been granted on a phased basis, at market value at the day of grant, and are exercisable only after documented
performance criteria concerning turnover growth and relative share price performance are met. No Executive options
were granted in the period.
The performance conditions for previous option grants related to both share price performance of the Company
compared with the FTSE 250 index and a substantial increase in the turnover of the Group as reported in the published
ﬁnancial statements. The relative share price performance criterion provided an alignment of the executive’s interests
with those of the Shareholders while the requirement for increased turnover provided a focus on the key ﬁnancial metrics
for the Company .
During the year ended August 2003, the Committee reviewed the long-term incentive arrangements and proposed that
the annual award of Executive options be replaced by a new plan – the Fibernet 2003 Long T erm Incentive Plan. This plan
was approved by Shareholders at the AGM on 17 December 2003.
The Fibernet 2003 Long T erm Incentive Plan introduced the concept of annual awards of shares to Executive Directors,
Senior Managers and other key staff. Shares awarded will only vest after a three-year period on condition that stringent
performance conditions have been achieved. The maximum award is over shares having a value at grant equivalent to
100 per cent of basic salary for Executive Directors and some Senior Managers. Vesting of the 2003 award is only triggered if,
over the ﬁrst three-year performance period, cumulative audited proﬁtability (before non-operating exceptional items)
exceeds target proﬁtability (which is ﬁxed at the time the awards are made) with a further requirement for a positive
earnings per share for the year ending 31 August 2006. 40 per cent of an award will vest for target performance,
with full vesting for outstanding proﬁt achievement. Vesting between 40 per cent and 100 per cent of the award 
is on a straight-line basis by reference to cumulative proﬁtability .
  22
Remuneration Report continued
Awards were made to Executive Directors on the above basis on 18 December 2003 as disclosed on page 24 of this report.
At the time of introduction of the plan, it was expected that the awards made would be satisﬁed by the purchase of
shares in the market place, such shares being held in an Employee Beneﬁt T rust. However , following the introduction of
UITF 38 relating to the purchase and sale of own shares, and having taking appropriate advice, it has been determined
that such awards should be satisﬁed from the issue of shares by the Company . Currently the total awards of executive
share scheme options since the inception of all plans, including the ﬁrst LTIP award made on 18 December 2003 are
within the 5 per cent in ten years Association of British Insurers (“ ABI”) dilution limit guidelines included in the existing
scheme rules. However , to continue with the LTIP awards, shareholder approval is being sought for the Company to grant
discretionary awards up to 10 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company in any ten year period being the ABI
guidelines for all award schemes. This request is made as resolution 11 on page 54.
Should this resolution be passed, the Company intends to continue with annual LTIP awards that fully align the interests 
of Executives and Senior Managers with those of the Shareholders in line with the framework of the 2003 issue as
outlined above.
The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Company’s Inland Revenue approved Savings Related
Share Option (SA YE) scheme. Grants of SA YE schemes are made at discounts of up to 20 per cent of the market price
and are not subject to performance criteria. SA YE options are made available to all UK employees.

Corporate Governance
Introduction
This statement, together with the Remuneration Report on pages 20 to 24, considers how the principles of good governance
as set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code for Corporate Governance issued by the London Stock Exchange in June 1998
(‘the Code’) have been applied by the Company .
Throughout the year ended 31 August 2004 the Company has been in compliance with the code set out in section 1 
of the Combined Code of Corporate Governance.
Directors
The Board comprises three Executive Directors (C S McGregor , N P S Bray and A P Frewer) and three independent 
Non-Executive Directors (D Wolfson, K C M Innes Ker and E R C Chovil). None of the Directors has served more than
three years without being submitted for re-election.
The Board, which meets at least 12 times a year , is responsible for the overall strategy and ﬁnancial performance of the
Group and has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its sole approval. Each Board meeting is preceded by a clear
agenda and with the relevant information needed to reach informed decisions at those meetings. All Directors are aware
of their right to seek independent advice and to seek advice of the Company Secretary if required.
The Board is committed to ensuring that there continues to be a clear balance of authority and decision making in its activities.
The Chairman of the Board is D Wolfson and the senior independent Non-Executive Director is K C M Innes Ker .
The Board has continued to operate its Audit and Remuneration Committees which solely comprise the Non-Executive
Directors. The Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee are chaired by E R C Chovil and K C M Innes Ker respectively.
Since there are only six Directors and as permitted by the Code, the Board have not established a nomination committee.
Any future appointments, which can be proposed by any Director , will be discussed by the full Board.
The Group Operating Board comprises the three Executive Directors of the Company , together with Senior Managers 
of the Company .
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee reviews annually the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and the Executive
Directors are responsible for the remuneration packages of the Non-Executive Directors. The Remuneration Report 
on pages 20 to 24 contains a detailed description of remuneration and applicable policies.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company encourages the participation of both institutional and private investors. Collective and individual presentations
to institutional investors are held regularly and tours of the Group’s Network Operations Centre are also conducted.
Communication with private individuals is maintained both through the Annual General Meeting and the ‘News Direct’
service available to investors on the Company’s website (www .ﬁbernet.co.uk). The Annual and Interim Reports are the
principal vehicles of communication, but the Company also issues two quarterly updates and a statement following the
AGM to ensure Shareholders are kept up to date.
The Company makes a presentation to Shareholders at its AGM and all Directors are available to answer questions that
arise. Any resolutions are voted on separately and proxy votes announced.
  Corporate Governance continued
Maintenance of a sound system of internal control
The Board has responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such controls
are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk that business objectives will not be met and can only provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has applied Principle D.2 of the Combined Code on internal control in accordance with the guidance 
on internal controls contained in the publication ‘Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’
(‘the T urnbull Report’) issued in September 1999.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group has been in place
throughout the year and up to the date of the Annual Report and accords with the provisions of the T urnbull Report.
The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
A risk management process is operated by the Group, under which the risks of not achieving their business objectives
are identiﬁed by members of the Group Operating Board. Those risks are documented in a Signiﬁcant Risk Evaluation
register which evaluates the likelihood and impact of the risks occurring. Individual members of the Group Operating
Board are allocated responsibility for managing those risks and ensuring adequate internal controls exist for that purpose,
and that weaknesses are promptly remedied.
During the year the Directors reviewed the need for an internal audit function and decided that taking account of the
current size and nature of the Group’s operations an internal audit function was not required. The Directors will formally
evaluate the need to supplement the existing controls with an internal audit function on an annual basis. The Board has
performed a speciﬁc assessment for the purpose of this Annual Report. This assessment considers all signiﬁcant aspects
of internal control arising during the period covered by the Report. The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging
its review responsibilities.
The Group operates a management structure with established responsibilities, clear delegated authorities and reporting
lines to the Board. Budgets are set annually and detailed performance against those budgets is evaluated monthly .
All capital expenditure and major purchases are subject to appropriate authorisation processes. The overall control
environment continues to be enhanced by ongoing Information T echnology systems enhancements, integration 
and implementations.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Financial statements, including adoption of going concern basis
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently; make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and state whether applicable
accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
ﬁnancial statements.
Other matters
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and Group and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for the system of internal control safeguarding the assets of the
Company and Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Fibernet Group Plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Fibernet Group Plc for the year ended 31 August 2004 which comprise the proﬁt
and loss account, the balance sheets, the cash ﬂow statement, the statement of total recognised gains and losses, and the
related notes 1 to 30. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have
also audited the information in the part of the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body , in accordance with section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law , we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body , for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As described in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Company’s Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. They are also
responsible for the preparation of the other information contained in the Annual Report including the Directors’ remuneration
report. Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as
having been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not
consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and transactions with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions 
of the Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority , and we report if
it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls,
or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Directors’ report and the other information contained in the Annual Report for the above year as described 
in the contents section including the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report and consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements
and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment 
of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and 
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company and the Group, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
28 29
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 August 2004
and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the ﬁnancial statements and part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the
previous year , is set out below .
a) Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom accounting standards.
b) Basis of consolidation
The ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial statements of Fibernet Group Plc and all its subsidiary undertakings
made up to 31 August 2004. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the period from or to the
date on which control passed. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
No proﬁt and loss account is presented for the Company as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The Company’s retained proﬁt for the year is disclosed in note 20.
c) T urnover
T urnover is stated as the amounts receivable (net of sales taxes) for the sale of networking services and products.
T urnover arising from service contracts is recognised evenly over the life of each contract, regardless of the payment
proﬁle. T urnover from long-term leases is accounted for according to note 1(d) below .
T urnover applicable to long-term contracts represents the value of work completed during the year , calculated with
reference to the total expected value of the contract.
d) Sales of long-term leases of telecommunications infrastructure and capacity
T urnover from long-term leases of telecommunications infrastructure and capacity is accounted for in accordance with
UITF 36 ‘Contracts for sale of capacity’.
e) Intangible ﬁxed assets – goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value
of the consideration given over the fair value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and written
off on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which is ﬁve years. Provision is made for any impairment.
f) Intangible ﬁxed assets – licences
Licence costs are stated at cost, less amortisation and any provision for impairment in value. They are written off commencing
upon network activation, on a straight-line basis over ﬁve to 15 years.
g) Tangible ﬁxed assets and depreciation
T angible ﬁxed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided
on leasehold improvements, motor vehicles, plant and equipment, ofﬁce furniture and computers to write off their cost,
less estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is provided on the
Group’s telecommunications network assets, commencing on activation, to write off their cost, less estimated residual
value, on a straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the minimum period of related customer
service contracts. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Leasehold improvements The shorter of 5 years and lease term
T elecommunications network 5 to 20 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Plant and equipment 5 years
Computers 5 years
Ofﬁce furniture 5 years
  35
1 Accounting policies continued
h) Investments in subsidiary undertakings
The Company’s investments in its subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
i) Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is arrived at on a ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out basis and includes
freight and duty for equipment purchased from overseas. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less
further costs expected to completion and disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items 
where appropriate.
Proﬁt is recognised on long-term contracts by reference to an assessment of the outcome and the proportion 
of work completed.
j) Leases and hire purchase contracts
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and leases which result in the transfer of substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership (ﬁnance leases) are capitalised as tangible ﬁxed assets at the estimated present value of underlying
lease payments and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Obligations under such
agreements are included in creditors, net of ﬁnance charges allocated to future periods. The ﬁnance element of the
rental payments is charged to the proﬁt and loss account over the period of each hire purchase contract or lease so as 
to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding balance of the net obligation in each period. Rentals
paid under other leases (operating leases) are charged against income on a straight-line basis over each lease term.
k) Foreign currency
T ransactions during the year have been converted at the rate ruling when each transaction occurred. Any exchange
gains or losses arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction are included within the
proﬁt and loss account. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at
the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or , if matched by forward exchange contracts, the contracted rates.
The results of overseas subsidiaries are converted at the average rates of exchange during the year and their balance
sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets
and results of overseas subsidiaries, and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Group’s
investment in such operations, are dealt with through reserves. All other exchange differences are included in the proﬁt
and loss account.
l) Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the
future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable proﬁts
and its results as stated in the ﬁnancial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in
periods different from those in which they are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁts from which the future
reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
  36
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
1 Accounting policies continued
l) Taxation continued
Deferred tax is not recognised when ﬁxed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding
agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the ﬁnancial
statements. Neither is deferred tax recognised when ﬁxed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable
gain will be rolled over , being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the
balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings 
in future has been entered into by the subsidiary .
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax is not discounted.
m) Deferred income
Amounts receivable under maintenance and service contracts are credited to deferred income and released to the proﬁt
and loss account on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contracts.
n) Pensions costs
The Group has not contracted out of the state pension arrangements. Additional beneﬁts for employees are provided 
by a deﬁned contribution Group pension scheme and by individual deﬁned contribution schemes with the costs being
met in full by the Group and charged to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred.
2 T urnover and geographical segment analysis
All of the Group’s turnover and loss on ordinary activities before taxation arose from its principal activity . The Directors
consider that the Group has only one class of business. However , additional analysis is provided in respect of turnover
and EBITDA, as the Directors believe it to be informative.
The analysis of turnover in this note refers to three types of sale. These are described as follows:
Service contracts – relates to revenue from Wide Area Network (WAN) contracts and from Local Area Network (LAN)
maintenance contacts.
LAN products – relates to sale and installation of LAN equipment.
WAN products – represents sales of telecommunications infrastructure.

3 Exceptional items continued
Network rates rebate
During the prior year the Group successfully appealed the business rates assessment on its national ﬁbre optic network.
The exceptional gain represents the rebates obtained in respect of prior years. The reduction in respect of the year
ended 31 August 2003 was an additional £1,500,000 and is included in cost of sales for that year .
DSL operations
During the prior year the Group launched a new UK national Partial Private Circuit (PPC) product. For many applications
this product effectively replaces the Group’s Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) product, resulting in a signiﬁcant reduction 
in the expected demand for DSL services. Accordingly the Group reviewed its DSL operations and identiﬁed a number 
of onerous commitments in respect of circuit rentals and other supplier commitments, relating to unproﬁtable DSL points
of presence (POPs). Provision has been made for the anticipated closure costs for those POPs. Fixed assets relating 
to those POPs have also been impaired in full.
Impairment of tangible ﬁxed assets – other
In accordance with accounting standards the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its ﬁxed assets. During the
prior year a small element of the network was identiﬁed for which no future use is anticipated. Accordingly this asset was
impaired in full resulting in an exceptional cost of £323,000.
Adjustment to proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets in respect of release from obligations under IRU contracts
During the prior year two IRU contracts were terminated, one due to the customer going into liquidation, the other due 
to the customer no longer requiring the service. As a result the Group has been relieved from future obligations in respect
of these contracts and has released the associated provisions. The gain represents the result of writing off all assets and
liabilities held in respect of these contracts that are no longer required.
Gain on termination of operations
During 2002 the Group discontinued its national network operations in France and Germany . The exceptional gains 
in 2004 and 2003 arise due to the actual costs of terminating the activities being less than those provided by £188,000
(2003: £749,000) and as the result of the reversal of the impairment recorded in 2002 in respect of certain
telecommunications equipment. This impairment reversal gives rise to an exceptional gain of £459,000 (2003: £2,769,000)
and relates to equipment that has been redeployed within the Group.

The Group operates Inland Revenue approved Save as Y our Earn and employee share option schemes and has taken
advantage of the exemption given in UITF Abstract 17 ‘Employee share schemes’ from recognising a charge in the proﬁt
and loss account for the discount on the options.
Remuneration paid to Directors is disclosed in the Remuneration report on pages 20 to 24 which forms part of these
ﬁnancial statements.
9 Loss per share
Loss per share is based on the loss for the ﬁnancial year of £5,066,000 (2003: £4,994,000) and on the weighted average
number of 10p ordinary shares in issue during the year to 31 August 2004 of 61,594,085 (2003: 61,558,761).
Financial Reporting Standard 14 requires presentation of diluted earnings per share when a company could be called
upon to issue shares that would decrease net proﬁt or increase net loss per share. For a loss making ﬁnancial period where
there are outstanding share options, diluted loss per share would be increased by the exercise of out-of-the-money options.
Since it seems inappropriate to assume that option holders would act irrationally , and since there are no other diluting items,
diluted loss per share equals basic loss per share.

There is also a potential deferred tax asset relating to the losses of the German subsidiary , Fibernet GmbH, of £56,981,000.
As only a relatively small element of the German activities are continuing, the losses are unlikely ever to be used and hence
are more akin to a permanent tax difference for the Group. Consequently the tax effect of these losses has not been
included within the table of potential deferred tax assets. The Group has not recognised its deferred tax assets due 
to the uncertainty as to their recoverability .

27 Financial instruments
1) Overview
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise ﬁnance leases and cash, and various items, such as trade debtors and 
trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these ﬁnancial instruments is to fund the
Group’s operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review , the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁnancial instruments shall 
be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below . These policies
are periodically reviewed in line with changes to the Group’s ﬁnancial circumstances.
As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 13 ‘Derivatives and other ﬁnancial instruments’ (“FRS 13”), short-term debtors
and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than the currency disclosures.
i) Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁnances its operations through a mixture of ﬁnance leases, operating cash ﬂows and share issues. The Group
had a net debt position at the year end. The Group does not consider that its current exposure to movements in interest
rates is sufﬁcient to necessitate hedging.
ii) Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to ensure adequate funding for its operations. The Group considers that it has sufﬁcient funding
for its short and medium-term funding requirements.
iii) Foreign currency risk
The Group’s operations are principally Sterling based. During the year the major exposure was in respect of the translation
of the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries.
The UK operations involve certain purchases denominated in US Dollars and in Euros. The Group’s policy has been 
to settle these liabilities at the prevailing spot rate. This policy is periodically reviewed in line with changes in exchange
rates and expectations of future foreign currency transactions.

There is no material difference between the fair and book values of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. Fair value
is the amount at which a ﬁnancial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between willing and
informed parties, other than a forced liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest. Where possible market values are
used to determine fair values.
v) Currency exposure
The following table shows the Group’s exposure to monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the local
currency of the operating companies involved. Such monetary assets and liabilities can cause foreign exchange gains
and losses, which are taken to the proﬁt and loss account in the year in which they arise.

Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting
1 Any member entitled to attend and vote at the above meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and,
on a poll, to vote in his stead. A proxy need not be a member of the Company .
2 Any form of proxy and power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certiﬁed or ofﬁce
copy of such power or authority , in order to be valid, must reach the Company’s Registrars not less than 48 hours before
the time of the meeting. Completion and return of the form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting
at the meeting.
3 Persuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001, only those members registered in the
register of members of the Company at 2pm on 19 December 2004 are entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in
respect of the number of ordinary shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries in the register made
after that time shall be disregarded in determining the right to attend and vote at the meeting.
4 Copies of service contracts between the Directors and the Company or any subsidiary of the Company , and the
register of Directors’ shareholdings and transactions will be available for inspection at the registered ofﬁce of the
Company during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excluded) from the date of this
notice until the date of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes
prior to and until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting.
5 The LTIP and the Approved, Unapproved and Savings Related Schemes currently provide that commitments to issue
new shares to satisfy awards made under them or any other discretionary employees’ share scheme in the preceding 
ten (or , in the case of the Savings Related Scheme any other employees’ share scheme in the preceding ﬁve) year period
cannot exceed more than 5 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital at that time. Additionally , the LTIP and the
Approved, Unapproved and Savings Related Schemes provide that commitments to issue new shares to satisfy awards
made under them or any other employees’ share scheme in the preceding ten year period cannot exceed more than 
10 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital at that time.
T o enable the Company to continue to be able to incentivise executives and key employees via share awards and/or options,
Shareholder approval is being sought for the 5 per cent in 10 (or , in the case of the Savings Related Scheme, 5) year limit
to be removed from each set of rules.
The Company is currently unable to purchase shares in the market to satisfy employee share awards or options since
the introduction of Urgent Issues T ask Force Abstract 38 (UITF 38) on “ Accounting for ESOP T rusts”, which requires
companies to deduct any contributions made to an employee beneﬁt trust (EBT) for the purpose of the purchase of
shares from distributable reserves.
Awards made under the LTIP and options granted under the Approved, Unapproved and Savings Related Schemes will
remain subject to the existing provision that commitments to issue new shares to satisfy awards made/options granted
under them or any other employees’ share scheme (whether or not discretionary) made in the preceding ten year period
cannot exceed more than 10 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital at that time.
The Company anticipates that the level of awards to be made in 2004 will be broadly similar to levels in previous years.
The levels of awards will be reviewed annually to take into account available headroom under the 10 per cent in ten 
years limit and the ability of the Company in the future to buy shares from the market. Additionally , all awards will continue 
to be subject to stringent performance conditions based on the Company’s key ﬁnancial metrics.
The changes to the LTIP numbered 11.1 to 11.6 are required to ensure that this year’s awards may be made under the
LTIP following the AGM, assuming that Shareholders approve the amendment of the rules.

UK London
Frankfurt
Fibernet operates a niche strategy
We provide high value voice and
data networking services on long
term contacts within and between
the premises of our customers and
their customers. We are distinguished
by our capability , our focus, the quality
of our customers and the quality of
the business we do with them.
Our specialist customer teams
are best considered as integrators
that own a customisable national
network rather than as a smaller
version of an incumbent operator .
Our flexibility , willingness and
responsiveness together with our
specialisation in advanced
technologies helps our customers
differentiate their own services.
The underground routes our fibre
optic networks follow allow us to target
the largest and most demanding
businesses in the UK. With nearly
100 UK points of presence and
reaching more than 50 towns and
cities the national network routes
provide a hugely powerful conduit
for information destined to travel
between the headquarters, branch
and retail premises of our customers.
Our London metropolitan
network is one of the most pervasive
in the city , taking us within economic
reach of many of the major data
centres and headquarters operations
we look to serve. We have further
metropolitan networks in all major
UK cities, designed to take us as
close as possible to customers who
are headquartered regionally . It is
the close proximity of our network to
our target customers that enables us
to provide more cost effective services
than many of our competitors.
Our London and Frankfurt
metropolitan networks are also
home to our “Carrier Ring” services
– probably the busiest telecoms
hubs in Europe.
Many customers also appreciate
our willingness to upgrade and
integrate their local area network
technologies into a single, managed,
national network service.

How we operate
We focus on two markets
Our Enterprise customers are
typically the largest commercial
organisations in the UK. We focus
upon those with multiple premises
and a need to continually move very
large quantities of information within
and between them. Such organisations
are typically not prepared to accept
“off the shelf” service.
Our Service Provider customers
are typically other telecoms operators,
ISPs or integrators, who can benefit
from extremely high service levels,
the geographic reach of our network,
the capacity it has available, and the
technologies that distinguish it.
We focus on accommodating
individual customer needs by
designing and building “Bespoke”
services. Our services must dovetail
precisely with equipment they plan
to retain and provide clearly visible
advantages over services we plan
to replace.
The services below provide
a snapshot of some of the main
applications that drove our business
growth in 2004.
Enterprise Customers
Business Continuity:
Orders for TANet Optical services
represented more than £35m TCV
over the last 2 years.
With a TANet Optical Service, the
largest commercial organisations
are able to confirm that their business
continuity obligations may be met by
ensuring that failures at main
processing centres can be recovered
without pause at geographically
separate backup centres.
Server Consolidation:
T ANet Ethernet services deliver 5 times
more bandwith for the same price.
Fibernet’s Ethersphere service
makes it sensible for large organisations
to relocate branch office “server”
computers back to a central location.
As well as seeing strong customer
growth in this area in 2004 it was also
rewarding to be recognised as the
“European Ethernet Service Provider
of the Y ear” by international standards
group The Metro Ethernet Forum.
Voice and data convergence:
Voice over IP (VoIP) brings many
benefits to corporate customers.
It is widely considered inevitable that
over time all current generation PBX
(switchboard) systems will migrate to
VoIP . Fibernet’s 2nd generation MPLS
IPVPN service has supported not
only encouraging growth in the number
of Enterprise customers but also a
successful new resale initiative.
Non-geographic call management:
TANet Callchoice
Callchoice has been well received
by large contact centres, including
a major new Retail customer signing,
demanding improved customer
experience, lower costs and more
effective call management for their
inbound telephony services.
Service Provider Customers
National Access:
Many ISPs and Voice operators
provide service on a national basis,
yet do not own national network
assets of their own. Fibernet provide
a fast and cost effective alternative to
“self building” national infrastructure.
Our investment in a DSL and PPC
(wholesale leased line interconnects
with BT) infrastructure in 2003 has
led to several major customer signings
in 2004. During the year , our new
Ethersphere services have hosted
an almost wholesale migration by
ISPs from older SDH technology to
this newer , more cost effective service.
Our TANet Optical services have
also seen significant new orders
from Integrators like IBM and Fujitsu.
Interconnect:
Membership of Fibernet’s Carrier
Rings grew by 20% in 2004.
Membership of Fibernet’s London
and Frankfurt Carrier Rings grew by
20% and broke through the 100 barrier
in 2004. It currently stands at 105
international telecoms operators
who exchange in excess of 25 billion
minutes of voice calls with each other
annually . 2004 also saw the introduction
of the Fibernet sponsored “Carrier
Exchange Club” – a bi-annual “trading
floor” event designed to encourage
further business between members.

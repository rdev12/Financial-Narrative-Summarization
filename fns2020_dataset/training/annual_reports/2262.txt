01 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
Cautionary statement
The report and accounts includes ‘forward-looking information’ within the meaning of section 27A of the US Securities Act 
of 1933 (the ‘Securities Act’), as amended, and section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ‘Exchange Act’),
as amended. Certain sections of this annual report including, without limitation, those concerning (i) the company’s strategies,
(ii) the company’s research and product development, and information technology, (iii) the company’s investments,
(iv) commencement of operations of new plants and other facilities, (v) the company’s restructuring plan, (vi) efficiencies,
including cost savings, for the company resulting from business reviews and reorganisations, (vii) management’s view of 
the general development and competition in the economies and markets in which it does, or plans to do, business,
(viii) management’s view of the competitiveness of its products and services, and (ix) the company’s liquidity, capital resources
and capital expenditure, contain certain forward-looking statements concerning the company’s operation, economic
performance and financial condition.Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct.Accordingly,
results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes
in economic conditions, continued downturn in the semiconductor industry, success of business and operating initiatives and
restructuring objectives, changes in the regulatory environment, outcome of litigation, other government actions, natural
phenomena such as floods and earthquakes, customer strategies and stability, and fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.

4 Last year I stated your board’s commitment to a strategy of delivering
superior returns for shareholders based on sustained growth in earnings
and improvements in capital efficiency.This requires increasing the scale
and scope of BOC while continuously improving the efficiency and
productivity of capital and other resources.
Consistent strategy
Y our company reviews and tests its strategy thoroughly each year.
The requirements and expectations of shareholders are compared 
with objective analysis of what the business can and should deliver.
This combination of top-down expectations with bottom-up capabilities
gives a rigorous framework for debate.When T ony Isaac and his
management team have completed their work, the board reviews 
and tests it in detail. Last year I described the forward programme for
BOC’s management and staff as ambitious and the board is pleased 
with the progress being made.
Within the corporate strategy each line of business and the specialist
businesses have their own strategies.The clarity of direction this gives is 
of great assistance to your board in overseeing proposed acquisitions,
strategic moves and the general progress of efficiency initiatives.
Last year I included two graphs looking at BOC’s financial
performance over the two-year period since the bid lapsed.The same
graphs are reproduced here, updated with this year’s data.The first 
shows total shareholder returns relative to all FTSE100 companies to 
30 September this year.The second compares BOC’s performance with 
its main global gases competitors.They again show your company’s strong
performance compared with other UK companies and the competitive
challenge presented by its global peers.
Dividends
In 2003 BOC paid a first interim dividend of 15.5p per share in February
and a second interim dividend of 23.5p per share in August.The total of
39p was an increase of 2.6 per cent on the year before.This year, in line
with its established policy, the board again proposes a first interim dividend
for 2004 of 15.5p.Any increase will be reflected in the second interim
dividend announced with our half year results.
Corporate governance
Y our company has been at the forefront when it comes to 
implementing best practice in corporate governance and financial 
matters. Its implementation last year of the new accounting standard
FRS19 and the full implementation of FRS17 well in advance of this being
required, is an indication of an open and transparent culture.This year in
the UK we had the recommendations from the Higgs and Smith reviews
that were subsequently incorporated in a modified form into a new
Combined Code. BOC contributed fully to the consultation phase of the
Higgs review and I believe the end result strengthens corporate
governance in an effective way.Y our company is substantially complying
with the revised Combined Code this year, ahead of it being required.
Corporate social responsibility
BOC consistently takes an ethical view of its responsibilities in pursuing
profitable business. Leadership comes from T ony Isaac and the senior
management team. BOC is also a very practical organisation, preferring 
to implement, test and refine what it does before making claims in the
wider world.This year BOC developed and launched its Code of
Conduct.There were many existing policies, but the Code of Conduct
process brought these into one programme together with new and
amended policies.The code energised the whole of the company during
its development and roll out.
04 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
“Our strategy is to 
deliver superior returns”
Chairman’s statement It is more important to be socially responsible than to seek out awards 
for social responsibility. It happens that others have given recognition to
BOC’s achievements in this area. For instance, in the UK last year BOC’s
environmental performance was ranked by Business in the Environment 
in the top 25 per cent of FTSE companies participating in its survey; the
investment community voting in Investor Relations magazine ranked BOC
in the top five of FTSE100 companies for the best practice of corporate
responsibility; and Gist, our logistics business, won the Motor Transport
magazine’s environmental award. In South Africa,Afrox’s community
involvement programme is used by the United Nations as a global case
study of how an employee-driven, sustainable social development
programme should work.
Board of directors
This year I was delighted to welcome John Bevan and Andrew Bonfield 
to your board. John is chief executive of Process Gas Solutions and,
being an Australian, adds yet another nationality to what is an already 
very diverse board.Andrew brings his financial experience and knowledge 
of international business to our discussions. I would also like to
congratulate two of my board colleagues who have been honoured 
this year: Sir Christopher O’Donnell received his knighthood in the
Queen’s birthday honours list while Dr ‘Raj’ Rajagopal was awarded 
the Sir Eric Mensforth International Manufacturing Gold Medal by 
the Institution of Electrical Engineers and subsequently was elected a 
Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.
During the year Göran Lundberg and Dick Grant stepped down
from the board.We wish them both well for the future. Göran was
replaced by Sir Christopher as senior independent director and by 
Julie Baddeley as chairman of the remuneration committee.
Thank you
The board would like to thank all BOC’s people around the world for
their efforts in what have been testing economic conditions.We would
also like to thank all BOC’s customers, with whom we seek a mutually
prosperous future. By recruiting, training and retaining the best employees
we will continue to deliver high standards of service to our customers.
This is the basis of BOC’s strength and will be the means by which we will
deliver the returns expected by you, our shareholders. I thank you for your
continued support.

FTSE100 BOC performed well in 2003, although many of the world’s 
leading industrial countries remained in the economic doldrums.
The semiconductor industry, the key to BOC Edwards’ profitability,
showed only limited signs of recovery following a prolonged downturn.
Financial overview
In managing our business we use financial results excluding exceptional
items, referred to as ‘adjusted’, and at constant currencies as the best 
way to report results and to reflect the nature of our business.
Exceptional items are exactly that, one-off events that would distort the
figures if not reported separately, while constant currencies show best 
how we are doing in our local markets.The products and services we 
sell and their associated costs are largely contained in the 50 or so
countries where we operate; we export relatively little. Currencies have 
an effect when we translate our turnover and profit into pounds sterling.
We could have a bumper year, improving our business and market
position around the world, yet we could report reduced turnover and
profit if the pound was strong. Conversely, a weak pound could at face
value disguise poor performance.
On this basis, we increased turnover this year by nine per cent,
the result of actions over recent years to grow in existing markets 
and enter new ones.Adjusted operating profit rose by one per cent.
This improved performance was not reflected in adjusted profit before
tax, which declined by four per cent because of a lower net pension 
credit largely resulting from lower equity valuations. Comments below 
on business performance are also given on this basis.
Since announcing our preliminary results on 13 November 2003 
The BOCGroup Cash Balance Retirement Plan in the US has reached
agreement in principle to settle an action against it for US$69 million.
This was shown as a contingent liability in the preliminary results 
when we stated that the potential liability could reach US$116 million.
The award will be paid out of the assets of the Plan but under UK
accounting principles the payment has been recognised as a charge in 
the profit and loss account. Our statutory results include exceptional items
and comparisons with the previous year reflect changes in the relative
value of currencies. On this basis, we increased turnover by eight per cent
and operating profit by three per cent. Profit before tax increased by 
five per cent.
Operating cash flow was eight per cent lower than last year.
There were a number of reasons for this: BOC Edwards contributed 
less cash; currency changes had a negative impact; and, having merged 
our gases business in Japan with part of Air Liquide Japan, BOC no 
longer consolidates the cash flow from the combined operation,
receiving a dividend instead.We also resumed cash contributions to 
the UK pensions scheme.
This year
We entered the year having just merged our plant building business 
with Linde Engineering in the US to form Linde BOC Process Plants LLC.
This combination guarantees us access to world-class technology and 
it is working well, delivering the capability and the cost savings we had
predicted.We were also at various stages of finalising four more strategic
ventures.Three were acquisitions: Praxair’s Polish industrial gases business,
Air Products’ Canadian packaged gas business and Environmental
Management Corporation, a privately held US water services company.
The fourth was the merger I referred to above, the combination of 
our OSK business in Japan with part of Air Liquide Japan to create 
Japan Air Gases.
The Polish and Canadian acquisitions are in important markets for us
and they strengthen our positions there. In both cases they give us better
national coverage and add to the range of products and services we can
offer our customers. Environmental Management Corporation manages
water and wastewater treatment facilities for industrial and municipal
customers around the US; BOC has a strong industrial customer base and
it is a natural extension to manage the water cycle for such customers.
The emphasis now, as it is with all our recent acquisitions, is to achieve 
the growth and profit forecasts that were the reasons for making the
acquisitions in the first place.All three are well on the way to doing that.
The reasons for forming Japan Air Gases were different. Japanese
growth has been disappointingly low in recent years and the combined
business promised to be more efficient with a lower cost base. Cost savings
at the rate of Japanese Y en 5 billion a year are confidently predicted by the
end of next year and a revitalised business is showing signs of growth.
Chief executive’s review
06 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
“Concentrating on 
safety, performance
and profitable growth” In recent years we have reviewed all our investments, seeking to add to
our capability where we could grow profitably and finding other solutions
for assets that either fit less well strategically or have not delivered the
returns we expect.
Our businesses are performing well
Our three lines of business – Process Gas Solutions, Industrial and Special
Products and BOC Edwards – produce 85 per cent of BOC’s turnover
and 88 per cent of its adjusted operating profit.The rest comes from our
two specialist businesses,Afrox hospitals and Gist.The line of business
structure remains unique in the industrial gases industry and is a major
competitive advantage for us.We continue to work hard at delivering
exemplary customer service and this has enabled us to grow our top line
sales, to obtain order renewals and to gain acceptance for price increases.
Process Gas Solutions (PGS) serves our larger customers. Many of
them operate on a global scale and we invest wherever they require
industrial gases. PGS did well last year, growing turnover by eight per cent
and adjusted operating profit by three per cent. Most of the growth 
came from acquisitions and new liquefied gases business. Shortly after the 
year ended we announced further investments in China totalling over 
US$100 million.
Industrial and Special Products, centred on our cylinder business,
increased its turnover by nine per cent, but good profit performance in
most countries was undermined by a weak result in the US, leading to a
decline in adjusted operating profit of three per cent.
BOC Edwards has performed well considering the prolonged
downturn of the semiconductor industry. It has paid close attention to its
cost base, matching it closely to demand.Turnover was £684.1 million with
adjusted operating profit £18.5 million.
Afrox hospitals and Gist delivered particularly good results.
Afrox hospitals grew turnover by 16 per cent and adjusted operating
profit by 31 per cent. Gist delivered increases of ten per cent and 
13 per cent respectively.African Oxygen Limited, the majority shareholder
in Afrox Healthcare Limited, announced in July 2003 that it was conducting
a strategic review of the hospitals business. On 17 November it
announced that, subject to conditions, it had agreed to sell its entire
holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium of Black Economic
Empowerment investors.
Each year I make the point that while financial performance is
important, it is not our only measure of success. I make no apologies for
stating that safety remains our highest priority. No manager can be content
if anyone is hurt in the process of doing business, but I also believe that
safe operations reduce business risk and contribute eventually to improved
profits.We are concentrating on changing the behaviour of everyone in
BOC to make sure that safety really does come first.
This year we developed our Code of Conduct, based on important
social, environmental and good governance business principles.
People throughout BOC helped prepare it and we are in the process 
of communicating it to everyone in BOC. It states clearly what we 
expect to ensure we meet our legal and ethical obligations; to make 
sure we always do the right thing.Y ou will find a copy on our website,
www.boc.com. I think you will agree it is something we can be proud 
of and I can assure you we are implementing it in an effective and 
practical way.
I thank all the employees of BOC for their efforts this year. I thank
our customers for doing business with us and our suppliers for their
contribution. I thank you, our shareholders, for your support through
difficult economic times.We will continue to strive to deliver attractive
returns on your investment.

Introduction
The BOC Group began its business life over 100 years ago as the Brin’s Oxygen Company . The company was
incorporated in England in 1886 and adopted its present name on 1 March 1982.
A technology to extract oxygen from the air in commercial quantities had just been developed and in 1886 the
Brin brothers started production at a factory in W estminster , London. T wo uses had already been found for oxygen.
One was to intensify limelight, which was then used in theatres. The other was to assist patients’breathing during and
after surgery . New technology was soon developed that allowed air to be separated into all its major components –
nitrogen, oxygen and argon. By 1960, industrial gases were in widespread use and BOC’s business was firmly
established. T onnage plants were supplying steelworks with oxygen and the customer base had been broadened to
extend from metal cutting and welding to food and medicine. The business had also spread overseas with subsidiaries
or associated companies as far away as Australia and South Africa. During the 1980s, BOC’s South African subsidiary
began to invest in private hospitals. This diversification was the basis of the current Afrox hospitals segment.
BOC acquired the vacuum equipment company Edwards High Vacuum International Limited in 1968 and this
formed the basis of what was to become the BOC Edwards line of business today .
The BOC Distribution Services business (now called Gist) was first established in 1970, initially providing a
chilled food distribution service for Marks & Spencer and relying upon distribution skills and liquid nitrogen chilling
technology , acquired as a result of BOC’s involvement in gases.
In 1978, BOC completed the acquisition of Airco Inc in America, a predominantly gases business that doubled
the Group’s size and brought BOC for the first time into the US gases market. In the period from 1970 to 1990 
The BOC Group significantly increased its presence in the Asia/Pacific region through participation in several joint
ventures or associated companies. BOC established strong market positions in Thailand, Indonesia, T aiwan, the
Philippines, China and Korea.
An investment in 1982 gave BOC effective management control of the Japanese gases company Osaka Sanso
Kogyo KK (OSK). Conversion of loan stock and subsequent purchases of shares raised BOC’s holding in OSK to 
97 per cent. In September 2002 BOC and Air Liquide announced a conditional agreement to merge their industrial
and medical gases businesses in Japan. The merger became effective in January 2003 and BOC’s subsidiary in Japan
has retained a 45 per cent interest in the combined company called Japan Air Gases Limited. In the period from 1998
to 2001 , BOC increased investments in its gases companies in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines by acquiring the
interests of joint venture partners or minority shareholders.
The BOC Group has an international portfolio of companies operating as three lines of business. These are
Process Gas Solutions (PGS), Industrial and Special Products (ISP) and BOC Edwards. In addition there are two
separately managed specialist businesses, Afrox hospitals and Gist. Operating results are reported separately for
these five segments.
The main exports of the Group in 2003 were special products from the UK and vacuum equipment and
semiconductor manufacturing equipment from the UK, the US and Japan. T rade between Group undertakings is
conducted at fair market prices.
Although BOC Process Plants was combined with Linde Engineering in the US with effect from September
2002, BOC retains an interest in the manufacture of industrial gas equipment though its Cryostar business based in
France. Cryostar makes specialist cryogenic pumps and expansion turbines that are used by most manufacturers of
industrial gas plant. Over the last two years Cryostar has also developed a strong position in the market for shipboard
compressors and heat exchangers used aboard liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers. Management believes that
Cryostar is the leading manufacturer of its product range worldwide.

The BOC Group contributes to the economies of some 50 countries throughout the world. The US is the largest
single source of sales revenue for the Group’s products and services, followed by the UK. Other major geographic
areas for the Group are Australia, South Africa, Japan and other markets in the Asia/Pacific region. The business
therefore operates from a broad geographical base with local manufacturing in most of the key overseas markets. 15 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003

The UK accounts for the largest part of the Group’s activities in Europe but BOC has significant gases subsidiaries in
Ireland and Poland, vacuum products manufacturing in France and a pharmaceutical packaging machinery operation
in the Netherlands.
Gist, BOC’s supply chain solutions business, operates principally in the UK but also has operations in 
other countries.
Subsidiaries in the US are engaged in the Group’s three lines of business. The Group’s other principal
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in the Americas are located in Canada, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile 
and Mexico.
The largest Group subsidiary in Africa is African Oxygen Limited (Afrox), a South African public company in
which the Group owns 56 per cent of the equity . The largest shareholder , other than BOC, holds less than 15 per cent
of the equity . Afrox, primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products
within the PGS and ISP lines of business. Afrox also has interests in private hospitals, clinics and other health care
services in southern Africa, primarily through its 69 per cent holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited.
There are other Group or Afrox subsidiary companies in Africa located in Botswana, Kenya, Malawi,
Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. These companies are engaged primarily in 
the manufacture and/or sale of products in the ISP line of business.
BOC has businesses in most of the Asia/Pacific markets, including Japan, Korea, Thailand, T aiwan, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, China, the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, the
Group’s business is conducted by BOC Limited. This company , as well as its subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates,
is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products in the PGS and ISP lines of business. BOC participates in the
liquefied petroleum gas market in Australia through a 50 per cent shareholding in Elgas Limited. Elsewhere in the
Pacific region, the Group conducts its business through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies.
Management organisation
BOC’s management structure is based on three global lines of business and two specialist businesses. Each line of
business serves a clearly defined type of customer and each pursues its own strategy for growth and performance at
a local level. The organisation is designed to maximise BOC’s global as well as local strengths. The lines of business
have global responsibility to set strategy and prioritise investment. They include operational business units and these
local units are responsible to the Group chief executive for delivering financial, safety and operational performance.
The business units contribute to the development of the strategies of the lines of business and customise and
implement them in local markets. The business unit heads collaborate in order to share best practice and to maximise
growth and profit opportunities wherever they may appear .
Process Gas Solutions (PGS) manages all aspects of BOC’s business with customers requiring bulk supplies of
industrial gases from on-site plants or by pipeline as well as deliveries of liquefied gases. T ypical customers are found 
in the oil and chemicals, food and beverage, metals, and glass sectors all round the world. Marketing, business
development and the execution of investments to provide customer specific solutions for the supply of industrial
gases are handled by Process Systems, which forms part of PGS. Until 2002, Process Plants, another unit forming
part of PGS, was responsible for supplying air separation technology within the Group with plants of its own design 
or acquired from alliance partners and others. In March 2002 BOC announced plans to merge its Process Plants
operations with Linde Engineering in the US to form a new company , Linde BOC Process Plants LLC.
The transaction was completed just before the end of 2002. BOC owns 30 per cent of the combined company 
and Linde Engineering has become the principal supplier of industrial gases plant to BOC worldwide.
Industrial and Special Products (ISP) covers BOC’s business with customers in the fabrication, medical and
leisure sectors as well as the special products and liquefied petroleum gases businesses. Group profile continued
16 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
BOC Edwards embraces all aspects of business with semiconductor industry customers worldwide including the 
supply of bulk gases and electronic materials, vacuum and abatement technology , chemical management systems and
semiconductor -related services. BOC Edwards also serves general vacuum markets around the globe and manufactures
pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging machinery .
The segment reporting as Afrox hospitals operates through Afrox Healthcare Limited, which is quoted 
on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It owns and manages private hospitals and clinics in southern Africa.
Additional services include a direct medicines service for chronic medication, occupational health services, nursing
training, pharmacy management and laboratory services. BOC’s majority-owned subsidiary , African Oxygen Limited
(Afrox), holds 69 per cent of Afrox Healthcare Limited (AHealth). In July 2003 Afrox announced that it was in the
process of considering its strategic options with regard to its shareholding in AHealth. On 17 November 2003, Afrox
announced that it had agreed to sell its entire holding in AHealth to a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment
investors. The sale remains subject to certain conditions including clearance from the relevant competition and other
regulatory authorities.
During 2001 , BOC Distribution Services was re-named Gist to reflect the changing nature of its business.
Gist operates as a separate business unit outside the lines of business structure. It remains focused on developing
business with major customers, including Marks & Spencer , and has developed capability in supply chain consultancy ,
managed solutions, and electronic commerce fulfilment services.
Corporate development 
Over the last three years BOC has continued to invest in its core businesses at the same time as divesting assets and
businesses that were no longer consistent with its strategy .
In 2001 BOC assumed full ownership of two south American hydrogen plants. BOC purchased the interests
from Foster Wheeler Power Systems in joint ventures already operating in Chile and Venezuela.
As a result of a successful tender offer , BOC increased its shareholding in Osaka Sanso Kogyo KK (OSK) in Japan
from approximately 55 per cent to over 93 per cent with effect from 8 May 2001 . The holding was further increased
during 2002 to 97 per cent. In September 2002 BOC and Air Liquide announced a conditional agreement to merge
their industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan. The merger became effective in January 2003 and BOC’s subsidiary
in Japan has retained a 45 per cent interest in the combined company called Japan Air Gases Limited. In June 2001 , BOC
increased its holding in Thai Industrial Gases Public Company Limited (TIG) from approximately 60 per cent to over 
90 per cent and launched a tender offer for the outstanding shares leading to 99 per cent ownership.
In October 2001 BOC Edwards agreed terms for the acquisition of the vacuum and pressure business of the
Smiths Group. These businesses are located in the UK, north America and continental Europe and typically serve
customers in the metallurgy , water treatment, food, power and chemical industries.
Hydromatix and Semco were also acquired during 2002 with the intention of positioning BOC Edwards in
those market segments expected to deliver the fastest growth. These two companies, based in the US, are involved
principally in semiconductor wet processing technology including chemical blending delivery and collection systems 
as well as liquid waste abatement systems.
BOC Edwards sold its glass coating business, based in the US, in April 2002 but retained its T emescal business
that supplies technology for compound semiconductor manufacturing.
The acquisition of the turbomolecular pumps business from Seiko Instruments Inc in Japan was announced 
in February 2002 and completed in March 2002 with the principal objective of enhancing the ability of BOC Edwards 
to develop vacuum sub-systems to satisfy the growing trend to on-tool pumping in the semiconductor industry .
In April 2002 BOC purchased Matheson Gas Products Canada Inc, thereby adding an important special
products capability to BOC’s Industrial and Special Products range in Canada.
In May 2002 BOC acquired Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited (UGP), in Thailand.
UGP is a leading supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and packaged ammonia in the industrial and special
products markets.
In March 2002 BOC announced plans to merge its Process Plants operations with Linde Engineering in 
the US to form a new company , Linde BOC Process Plants LLC. The transaction was completed at the end of
September 2002. BOC owns 30 per cent of the combined company and Linde Engineering has become the 
principal supplier of industrial gases plant to BOC worldwide.
BOC’s associated company in Malaysia acquired 35.6 per cent of the gases company Nissan Industrial 
Oxygen Inc (NIOI) in March 2002 and increased its holding to 100 per cent in September 2002 following a 
tender offer . Each of BOC’s three lines of business has absorbed a part of NIOI.
At the end of August 2002, BOC announced an agreement to purchase Praxair’s Polish gases business.
The transaction was completed at the end of January 2003 following approval by the Polish competition authority .
The business acquired includes a high proportion of industrial and special products sales.
In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation (EMC), a privately owned water
services company based in St Louis, Missouri. EMC manages water and wastewater treatment facilities for both
industrial and local municipal customers around the US. EMC forms part of the PGS line of business, which intends 
to expand the range of solutions offered to its industrial customer base.
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake, T exas, from Celanese.
Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the Celanese chemical
facility at Clear Lake.
In March 2003 BOC announced an agreement to purchase the Canadian packaged gas and related welding
equipment business of Air Products. The acquisition was completed in April 2003 following approval from the
Canadian regulatory authority . 17 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
Industrial gases 
The BOC Group is one of the major producers of industrial gases in the world. Its products include the atmospheric
gases (nitrogen, oxygen and argon) produced by air separation plants as well as hydrogen, carbon monoxide and
syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) made by technologies including steam-reforming or partial
oxidation of hydrocarbons. The Group also markets carbon dioxide, helium and liquefied petroleum gas. These are
generally derived as by-products from chemical processes or from natural sources and are also purchased from
other producers. In addition, the Group markets dissolved acetylene and a wide range of special gases, medical gases,
gas mixtures and gaseous chemicals.
Industry structure and consolidation The industrial gases business is capital-intensive, with increasing demand,
together with economies of scale, leading to the need for large production units and distribution networks.
The need for fixed asset investments, the trend towards global customers and the benefits from the transfer of
applications technology worldwide have resulted in the business being handled by a relatively small number of
companies internationally .
One or more other major international producers compete in each of the industrial gases markets served by
the Group, and in many of the markets there are smaller local producers as well. International competitors include
Air Liquide, Praxair , Air Products and Chemicals, Linde, Messer , Airgas and Nippon Sanso. The world market for
gases and related products is estimated to be over £20 billion a year .
On 13 July 1999 the board of The BOC Group agreed the terms of a pre-conditional cash offer at £14.60 per
share to be made jointly by Air Liquide and Air Products. Making the offer was conditional upon those companies
obtaining satisfactory regulatory clearances in Europe, Canada and the US by 13 March 2000. Following an extension
to the pre-conditional offer period to conclude discussions with the Federal T rade Commission (FTC) in the US, the
bidders allowed the offer to lapse on 10 May 2000.
Principal industrial gas products Nitrogen possesses two key characteristics that make it the world’s most widely
used and versatile industrial gas. Nitrogen is almost inert and when liquefied it is intensely cold. This makes liquid
nitrogen a highly effective, versatile and non-polluting agent for freezing and chilling.
Under normal conditions nitrogen is chemically inactive. This makes it an important purging and blanketing gas 
in the chemical and refining industry as well as in the electronics industry .
Oxygen, in contrast to nitrogen, is useful for its reactivity . It supports combustion and it supports life. Oxygen has
been used in welding and medicine for over 100 years and in steel production since the 1950s.
Iron and steel producers use oxygen to accelerate melting and to improve metal quality during the refining
process. It is also used by the oil and chemicals industries and many others for a variety of oxidation processes.
Mixed with fuel gases, oxygen provides a heat source for many welding, cutting and metal fabrication processes.
Argon makes up less than one per cent of the atmosphere but it is the most abundant truly inert gas. It is used 
to provide a shielding atmosphere in welding, metal fabrication, aluminium processing, microelectronics, glass
coating, advanced ceramics and other industrial processes. It is also used in the steel industry , principally in the
production of stainless steel.
Hydrogen is typically produced by steam reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas, petroleum gas, or liquid
or solid hydrocarbon feedstocks. Hydrogen may also be recovered from by-products purchased by BOC from
external suppliers. Hydrogen is used primarily in the oil and chemicals industries for applications aimed at upgrading
crude oil through hydrocracking to form lighter fractions and to remove sulphur in the production of cleaner fuels.
The chemicals industry also uses hydrogen where it is required as an active ingredient in many large-scale processes.
Helium is extracted from natural gas deposits. Only a few sources in the world contain a sufficient proportion 
of helium to justify its separation. The Group’s supplies now come from the US, Poland and Russia and are secured 
by long-term contracts. In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the output from a new helium
extraction facility to be constructed in Qatar . Deliveries from this new source are expected to begin in July 2005.
Because of its high value, helium is the only major industrial gas to be extensively traded internationally . Helium is used
in welding, leak detection, hospital MRI scanners and increasingly in the production of optical fibres. Helium gas
mixtures are used in balloons.
Carbon dioxide supplied by BOC is obtained as a by-product from other companies’manufacturing processes,
from natural sources or recovered in the generation process for hydrogen or syngas and put to constructive use.
Solid carbon dioxide is, like liquid nitrogen, used for chilling and freezing in the food industry . As a gas it is used to
carbonate and dispense beverages of all kinds.
Acetylene is normally supplied in cylinders and used together with oxygen in metal cutting and welding applications.
BOC is a major manufacturer of dissolved acetylene.
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a fuel gas with a wide variety of domestic, industrial and transport applications.
BOC is a major distributor of LPG in South Africa and Thailand, and its joint venture company Elgas Limited is a major
distributor in Australia. BOC has smaller market positions in several other countries. Group profile continued
18 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
Production of industrial gases Oxygen was first extracted from the atmosphere by a chemical process. This was
superseded over 80 years ago by the cryogenic (low temperature) process involving the liquefaction and distillation
of air . The cryogenic process is still by far the most widely used, but non-cryogenic techniques (pressure swing
adsorption and membrane diffusion), which were first developed during the 1970s, are becoming increasingly
significant for smaller or less demanding on-site applications.
Cryogenic air separation is a mature and stable technology , although incremental technical advances are still
yielding improvements in capital cost, operating cost, ease of operation and reliability . The only significant ‘raw
material’, apart from the air itself, is electricity , which is used in large quantities to drive compressors, pumps and
other equipment. The production process in modern air separation plants is highly automated, and remote
operation of BOC’s plants from control centres is becoming increasingly common.
The production of hydrogen and syngas uses steam reforming or partial oxidation of hydrocarbon feedstocks
such as natural gas, petroleum or coal to separate the hydrogen and carbon compounds. The choice of feedstock is
related to their prices in local markets.
Distribution of industrial gases Industrial gases may be supplied to customers in a variety of ways;through pipelines
from on-site or nearby cryogenic or non-cryogenic plants, by deliveries of liquefied gases in road or rail tankers, in
portable cryogenic containers or in cylinders (also called compressed or packaged gases).
Distribution is an important competitive factor in the industrial gases business and the methods of distribution
vary according to the nature of the products themselves and the customer’s volume requirements. Most gases have to
be stored and distributed either under great pressure, which requires them to be carried in heavy and bulky cylinders,
or at extremely low temperatures in specially insulated tankers, which limits how far they can be transported before
carriage costs become unacceptable. Pipeline delivery involves high capital costs and the routing is inflexible. As a
result, there is little international trade in industrial gases. Production has to occur in or near the market being served
and there is a trend towards production at customers’own sites.
Business segments 
The BOC Group reports financial results for the three lines of business and for Afrox hospitals and Gist separately .
Process Gas Solutions (PGS)
This line of business covers BOC’s business with larger -scale industrial customers worldwide, typically in the oil and
chemicals, food and beverage, metals, and glass sectors. Gases and services are supplied as part of customer -specific
solutions that create the most value for customers at the lowest cost to BOC. These range from supply by pipeline
or from dedicated on-site plants to the largest users, to supply by road tanker in liquefied form to others.
T onnage (pipeline) customers are usually supplied on the basis of long-term contracts, typically containing a
fixed facility charge together with a variable charge for product supplied in excess of a set minimum quantity .
Revenues from these contracts thus have a measure of stability with respect to changes in demand for product.
T onnage plants are often built to produce merchant gases in addition to those required by the tonnage customer and
these gases can be sold to other customers. The BOC Group has substantial positions in the tonnage markets of the
UK, the US, Australia, South Africa and Asia as well as in some smaller markets. The products supplied to tonnage
customers have traditionally been the atmospheric gases oxygen, nitrogen and argon. More recently , hydrogen and
syngas are becoming significant tonnage products as are associated utilities including steam and power .
The delivery of liquefied gases by road or rail to the customer’s site is normally limited by transport costs to a
radius of about 200 miles. Product for this market is supplied either from merchant plants or from tonnage plants
incorporating liquefiers. Larger users are typically supplied with product in liquid form delivered in cryogenic tankers
into special storage vessels installed at customer premises. T ankers and vessels are often BOC Group owned.
Liquefied gases are usually supplied on the basis of contracts with terms of one to five years. Revenues are generally
based upon the actual quantity of gas consumed, with an additional fixed charge for the use of storage equipment.
The growth of sales and profit in this line of business is driven by investment in new production facilities.
Such investment is predominantly the result of opportunities to satisfy long-term supply contracts with one or 
more heavy industrial customers for each plant.
Marketing, business development and the execution of investments to provide customer -specific solutions for
the supply of industrial gases are handled by Process Systems, which forms part of PGS. 19 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
Business development During the early part of 2001 , BOC reached full commercial operation of an integrated
refinery and merchant gases facility in Brisbane, Australia, significantly ahead of schedule. The facility supplies
hydrogen, using partial oxidation technology , for BP’s mild hydrocracker and has an air separation complex supplying
oxygen to help upgrade the capacity of the refinery’s catalytic cracker unit. In addition the facility produces oxygen,
nitrogen, argon, hydrogen and carbon dioxide for BOC’s merchant market, replacing and increasing capacity over
previous and less-efficient production facilities.
In 2001 , BOC took full ownership of two hydrogen joint ventures already operating at refineries in Chile 
and Venezuela. This was done by purchasing the interests of the other partner , Foster Wheeler Power Systems.
BOC started the supply of up to 800 tonnes per day of oxygen to Mitsubishi Materials’copper and electrical
component recycling facility at Onahama, Japan in 2001 .
A number of hydrogen supply plants were completed during 2001 , including those supplying Dow Corning and
Roche in the UK.
A plant to supply OneSteel at Whyalla in South Australia was commissioned in November 2001 also replacing
and increasing capacity over previous and less efficient merchant plants in Adelaide. Shortly afterwards in January
2002 a new plant began supplying Huntsman on T eesside in the UK with hydrogen to be used for the production 
of aniline.
In April 2002, BOC established a joint venture in Nanjing with Y angtze Petrochemical Corporation (YPC),
which is a subsidiary of Sinopec, China’s leading petrochemical company . BOC purchased existing air separation
assets with effect from May 2002 and construction of new air separation capacity is underway . BOC’s joint venture
will be a supplier to a new BASF and YPC joint venture plant also under construction and scheduled to begin
production in 2004. Additional liquefaction capacity was added to the existing air separation facility during 2003.
These investments give BOC a strategic position as a key supplier in the Nanjing area, which is being developed
through foreign investment as a leading centre for chemical production in China.
In the US a new plant began to supply WCI Steel in Ohio in May 2002 and a plant at Midland, North Carolina,
began production in June 2002.
In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation (EMC), a privately owned water
services company based in St Louis, Missouri. EMC manages water and wastewater treatment facilities for both
industrial and local municipal customers around the US. EMC’s management services extend to steam systems,
cold and chilled water systems and wastewater treatment. Customers include small to medium municipalities and
industrial customers, many of which are in the food sector . EMC forms part of the PGS line of business and BOC’s
strategy is to expand the range of solutions offered to its industrial customer base.
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake, T exas, from Celanese.
Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the Celanese chemical
facility at Clear Lake. The Celanese facility is located on the Houston ship canal, and includes a world scale vinyl acetate
monomer plant and the world’s largest acetic acid plant. These require large quantities of oxygen and nitrogen as well
as carbon monoxide.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide (HyCO) plant supplying the Thai Polycarbonate Company for the
manufacture of plastic resins began production in 2003 and in August 2003, BOC announced that a new plant at
Rayong would double its carbon dioxide capacity in Thailand before the end of calendar 2003. The plant will supply
the local poultry and prawn industries as well as providing carbonation gas to the beverage industry .
In October 2003, BOC commissioned a new hydrogen plant supplying Citgo’s oil refinery at Lemont, Illinois.
The hydrogen will be used in the removal of sulphur to produce clean fuels.
Industrial and Special Products (ISP) 
Gases for cutting and welding, hospitality , laboratory applications and a variety of medical purposes are mainly
distributed under pressure in cylinders. The ISP line of business covers products and services provided to this section
of the market together with sales of packaged chemicals and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Customers are typically
in the fabrication, engineering, automotive, refrigeration, hospitality or medical sectors. The customer base is
therefore broad and varied. The number of separate customers served by ISP is much greater than the other two
lines of business and the quality of service is often the key factor in securing existing or obtaining new customers.
In order to raise service standards at the same time as reducing costs, national customer service centres have been
successfully established in all the major markets.
In addition to supplying gases, BOC also supplies a range of associated equipment in many of its major markets.
This includes cutting and welding products and, in some markets, associated safety equipment. Group profile continued
20 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
BOC has devoted considerable attention over the last three years to understand the requirements of different types
of customer in its major markets and to provide the required service at an appropriate price. Such customer
segmentation programmes have been implemented in the UK, South Africa, Australia, Asia, Latin America and are 
in progress elsewhere.
The cutting and welding applications are a relatively mature part of the industrial gases business and growth
opportunities are principally in other segments of the market such as medical applications, packaged chemicals,
hospitality and services. BOC is pursuing these opportunities by the development of new products, packages and
services as well as by marketing initiatives to take advantage of BOC’s global capabilities by introducing existing
products to new regions. Electronic commerce has also become an important tool for sustaining and growing sales
by making it easier for customers to manage their business with BOC as a supplier .
BOC is a leading supplier of helium and has liquid helium distribution centres, or transfills, in many markets
around the world. With 42 helium transfills worldwide, management believes that this is the largest global network of
its kind. Helium has a broad range of applications, including medical imaging and welding, and is vital to the production
of optical fibres, semiconductors and special alloys. It is also used for leak detection, underwater breathing mixtures
and lifting.
Business development In April 2002, BOC acquired Matheson Gas Products Canada Inc, one of Canada’s leading
providers of special gases and equipment. Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited (UGP), a leading
distributor of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and ammonia in Thailand, was acquired in May 2002. BOC’s associated
company in Malaysia acquired 35.6 per cent of the gases company Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc (NIOI) in March 2002
and, following a tender offer , increased its holding to 100 per cent in September 2002. At the end of August 2002,
BOC announced an agreement to purchase Praxair’s Polish gases business. The transaction was completed in January
2003 following approval by the Polish competition authority . The business acquired includes a high proportion of
industrial and special products sales.
During 2002, BOC continued its global roll-out of a light-weight medical cylinder with an integrated valve and
regulator for homecare patients and emergency services. Heliox, a helium and oxygen mixture formulated to ease
the respiratory effort associated with airway obstruction, was launched in the UK.
Capacity at BOC’s Otis, Kansas, helium plant was expanded in 2002 to match market demands. In addition,
BOC has access to helium produced by other US plants, as well as to product from Poland and Russia. In 2003 BOC
and KRIO, a division of the Polish Oil and Gas Company , entered into a new helium supply agreement. BOC will
purchase for export all of KRIO’s helium that is not sold to its domestic customers in Poland. BOC has been KRIO’s
sole customer for bulk liquid helium since the original agreement was signed in 1972. In June 2003, BOC announced an
agreement to obtain half the output from a new helium extraction facility to be constructed in Qatar . Deliveries from
this new source are expected to begin in July 2005.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems use liquid helium to cool superconducting magnets. BOC provides
helium as well as a liquid nitrogen filling service to meet MRI operators’total requirements. In 2002, ISP signed a
major helium supply scheme with Oxford Magnet T echnology in the UK.
BOC continued to invest in refrigerant filling facilities during 2002 and in 2003 new filling facilities were installed in
Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines. Each of these was built to a standardised global design. BOC now supplies
refrigerants in 19 countries compared with six countries in 1999. In June 2003, BOC announced a global alliance with
Hudson T echnologies to promote technology for cleaning and recycling used refrigerants.
Significant progress in developing web-based customer portals was made in 2002. Amongst others, ISP launched
customer portals in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Thousands of customers are now able to access detailed
material on BOC’s product service offers, manage and settle their accounts and place orders on-line.
BOC acquired the Canadian packaged gas and related welding equipment business of Air Products in April 2003. 21 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
BOC Edwards
This line of business specialises in gases, services and equipment for the semiconductor industry as well as vacuum
products for a range of other industries. It is organised into four customer -facing divisions for sales and marketing and
into four manufacturing divisions. The customer -facing divisions are Asia/Pacific, Japan, the US and Europe and the
manufacturing divisions are Vacuum and Exhaust Management, Chemical Management, Bulk Gases and Electronic
Materials. Kachina (semiconductor process tool component management service), Coating T echnology and
Pharmaceutical Systems were managed separately in the period 2001 to 2003. The major markets for BOC
Edwards’products are in Asia, north America and Europe.
Management believes that BOC Edwards has a unique position as a fully integrated supplier of gases, vacuum,
chemical, slurry and exhaust management products, as well as services to the global semiconductor industry and is a
leader in the design and manufacture of vacuum pumps, instrumentation and systems for both general vacuum and
semiconductor applications.
The vacuum and exhaust product ranges are manufactured or assembled primarily in the UK, with additional
manufacturing and assembly in the US, Japan and Korea. They include vacuum pumps, coating systems, exhaust
management systems, temperature control systems and heat exchangers, instrumentation and controls, vacuum
accessories and leak-detection equipment. The range also includes specially designed systems for specific applications,
depending on customer requirements.
In addition to the semiconductor industry , the leading customers are in the chemicals, scientific instruments and
other industries, as well as in educational and research establishments. General vacuum products are sold to such
customers by a separate sales force.
Chemical Management Division specialises in the design, manufacture and installation of the systems used to
deliver liquid process chemicals, including planarisation slurries to the point of use within semiconductor fabrication
facilities. BOC Edwards’chemical management products are manufactured mainly in the US, while electronic
materials plants are located in the US and in Asia.
BOC Edwards’service facilities, including plants for cleaning semiconductor process tool parts, are located near
concentrations of semiconductor fabrication facilities around the world.
T echnology is important to maintain a competitive edge in this business, and considerable resources are
committed to enable the business to address new applications and markets. A new exhaust management laboratory
was opened in Japan during 2001 . Over 250 staff are employed in development project teams worldwide.
The Group’s vacuum products are sold directly by Group companies to end users and also through distributors
and agents. Management believes that the Group is a leading manufacturer of the types of vacuum products that it
makes and provides. The business is highly competitive, with product design and quality , leading to the lowest cost of
ownership, being very significant factors.
Sales opportunities for much of BOC Edwards’semiconductor equipment business are dependent upon capital
investment by the semiconductor industry . Management believes that semiconductor production remains on a 
long-term growth trend but capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers has been subject to sharp variations
for a number of reasons, some of which arise from advances in technology .
The products of BOC Edwards Pharmaceutical Systems are tailored specifically to individual customer
requirements in the pharmaceutical industry and are used mainly for injectable products. Freeze-drying systems are
made in T onawanda, New Y ork, US. Filling, sterilising and packaging lines for the pharmaceutical industry are made at
Dongen in the Netherlands.
Business development In the period 2001 to 2003, new ranges of dry pumps for the semiconductor industry were
introduced as well as a comprehensive new range of exhaust management products. These new products meet the
needs of new 300mm wafer and flat panel manufacturing facilities.
A new range of turbomolecular pumps and an innovative dry pump were introduced for scientific customers 
as well as new dry pumps for industrial customers over the same period. New single axis on-tool pumps for
semiconductor manufacturing and a range of liquid ring pumps for industrial applications were introduced in 2003.
During 2003, an enhanced range of gases and vacuum products for lithography was offered to semiconductor
manufacturers. Narrower line widths are requiring new technology including a supercritical carbon dioxide process
for wafer cleaning.
In July 2000, BOC Edwards acquired Kachina Semiconductor Services, a US company specialising in the 
cleaning of process tool chamber parts. In the same year a new facility and divisional headquarters was established in 
Phoenix, Arizona, followed by a new facility in Portland, Oregon. Additional facilities were opened in France and
China during 2002. 22 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
Production of nitrogen trifluoride gas (NF
3
) for the semiconductor industry was started at a plant in South Africa
during 2000 and production capacity was further increased during 2003. This product is an important etchant that is
also used for in-position cleaning of semiconductor process equipment.
In September 2001 , BOC acquired Fluorogas Limited, a UK based company with expertise in the development
and operation of low pressure on-site fluorine generators. The acquisition was made to assist in BOC Edwards’
development of alternative cleaning systems for semiconductor process tool chambers. As a result of a jury verdict
against Fluorogas Limited in a US litigation action, Fluorogas Limited was placed in administration. Further details 
of the litigation are given in the financial review on page 50.
During 2001 , a decision was taken to concentrate electronic materials production into fewer locations and 
to close some existing facilities in the UK and the US to increase efficiency and reduce costs. These closures were
completed in 2002.
In October 2001 BOC Edwards agreed terms for the acquisition of the vacuum and pressure business of 
the Smiths Group. These businesses are located in the UK, north America and continental Europe and typically 
serve customers in the metallurgy , water treatment, food, power and chemicals industries rather than
semiconductor manufacturing.
The acquisition of the turbomolecular pumps business from Seiko Instruments Inc in Japan was completed in
March 2002 with the principal objective of enhancing the ability of BOC Edwards to develop vacuum sub-systems 
to satisfy the growing trend to on-tool pumping in the semiconductor industry .
Hydromatix and Semco were also acquired during 2002 with the intention of positioning BOC Edwards in
those market segments expected to deliver the fastest growth. These two companies, based in the US, are involved
principally in semiconductor wet processing technology including chemical blending delivery and collection systems 
as well as liquid waste abatement systems.
BOC Edwards sold its glass coating business, based in the US, in April 2002 but retained its T emescal business
that supplies technology for compound semiconductor manufacturing.
Afrox hospitals
Afrox Healthcare Limited owns 63 hospitals and clinics and has a minority interest in a further seven hospitals
managed by others. In addition it also manages the Lifecare group of chronic-care hospitals. In addition to hospitals
and clinics, which are the core business, Afrox Healthcare Limited also includes Afrox Healthcare Services, which
facilitates a direct medicines service for chronic medication, and provides occupational health services, nursing
training and laboratory services. Management believes that Afrox Healthcare Limited is the leading provider of
private health care in southern Africa.
During 2000, African Oxygen Limited (Afrox) increased its holding of Afrox Healthcare Limited to 82 per cent.
During 2001 , the 55 per cent interest in Lifecare Special Health previously held by Afrox was bought by Afrox
Healthcare Limited.
In January and July 2002, Afrox sold parts of its holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited but retains a 69 per cent
interest. This disposal was in accordance with the terms of the transaction between Afrox and PresMed that took
place in 1999.
In July 2003 Afrox announced that it was in the process of considering its strategic options with regard to 
its shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited. On 17 November 2003, Afrox announced that it had agreed to sell 
its entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment investors.
The sale remains subject to certain conditions including clearance from the relevant competition and other
regulatory authorities.
Gist (formerly BOC Distribution Services)
Gist is a provider of specialist supply chain solutions. The name Gist was adopted during 2001 to reflect both the
continuing focus on supply chain operations and an increased emphasis on supply chain consulting, managed solutions
and logistics support to e-fulfilment opportunities. This realignment of the business followed a planned withdrawal
from most non-Marks & Spencer primary temperature controlled operations in the period 1999 to 2000.
High quality supply chain operations remain at the core of the business. Gist manages a range of supply chains
on behalf of retailers, mainly in the UK, as well as some overseas. For over 30 years Gist has been the largest supply
chain provider for Marks & Spencer . Gist currently handles all of its UK food distribution and the consolidation and
dispatch of all overseas shipments to subsidiaries and franchised operations.
During 2003, Gist ceased to operate general merchandise logistics and garment stockholding operations on
behalf of Marks & Spencer .
Gist has provided supply chain consultancy services to major supermarket and catalogue retailers in the UK and
demonstrated its capabilities in managing international supply chains. In addition an on-line wholesaling operation has
extended the range of Gist’s skills offered externally .
Group profile continued 23 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
At 30 September 2003 the Group had 44,507 employees (2002:46,280 employees, 2001:43,171 employees).
Employees of the company and its subsidiaries were located as follows:
Europe 12,353
Americas 7,451
Africa 17,138
Asia/Pacific 7,565
The employee base was very stable and unplanned turnover was low during the year . BOC was successful at
retaining the organisation’s core skills and capabilities and, as a result, continues to be able to meet its business,
customer service and health and safety targets. BOC’s capability review and succession planning processes highlight
that it has solid capability in most areas and adequate succession depth to meet both its technical and leadership
requirements. Plans to strengthen this capability further are progressing well.
Employee satisfaction and commitment
Levels of employee satisfaction and commitment are generally high. Progress continues to be made in achieving a
culture of accountability , collaboration, transparency and stretch, known as ACTS in BOC. The ACTS principles
provide a framework that enables employees to evaluate and critique how they deal with each other as well as how
they work with customers, suppliers and the community . Business units continue to work on improvement areas
identified as a result of the 2002 Employee Survey . Progress will be measured through a follow-up survey .
Employment policies and Code of Conduct
The BOC Group takes its responsibilities as a global organisation seriously . It is committed to fostering a workplace
that is safe and environmentally sound. It will always act in line with all applicable laws, regulations and industry
standards. It expects people to respect confidential information and company time and assets. It believes in open and
honest communication, fair treatment and equal opportunities. It opposes public corruption, anti-competitive
behaviour and insider trading, and it supports the fundamental principles of good governance and human rights.
The company is a signatory of the UN Global Compact and subscribes to its nine principles of human rights.
These principles represent minimum standards for BOC and in many of the areas covered, existing standards exceed
those set out in the Global Compact.
During the year , BOC launched a global Code of Conduct, a framework of legal and ethical standards for all
BOC people to work and live by . This is an important programme that draws together and builds on many existing
standards and processes in BOC.
The code is supported by a number of processes. BOC has introduced a confidential helpline to deal with
questions in every country where it operates. It has translated the standards into key languages. It is also making sure
everyone has access to appropriate training and guidance.
In addition to the Code of Conduct, BOC provides guidance and leading-edge human resources policies 
to support BOC people in their day-to-day activities and long-term career planning. These are aligned to a set 
of corporate values and principles. The heart of this approach is the recognition that the energy and application 
of individuals and teams throughout the organisation will determine competitive advantage in today’s complex 
global market.
BOC’s employment policies are designed to underpin the Group’s operating requirements and growth strategies.
The human resources units implementing these policies are close to the business units in each geography and, as far as
practicable, Group policies are adapted to meet local requirements.
Communication and involvement
BOC places a high priority on two-way communications with its people. The primary communication channels are
within the business units, where local managers work with their people and two-way communication is most achievable.
The Group also uses a number of formal and informal communication channels to share information and to
shape behaviour . In addition to traditional media such as videos, magazines, newsletters and briefing packs, BOC has
continued to invest in e-mail and web-based communications technologies to ensure that consistent and coherent
messages are conveyed speedily to its people around the world.
The Group actively searches for ways to involve employees in shaping the future. It is common to find teams 
of people meeting to review or jointly create processes, systems or strategies. A variety of employee structures 
exist for these purposes, including peer groups, special interest groups, teams of excellence and quality teams.
Multi-disciplinary and cross-geographic groups of employees regularly meet, either face-to-face, or by using 
tele-, video- and web-based meeting technologies which have been installed for these purposes.
Resourcing,training and development
Resourcing, training and development programmes are designed to ensure that the Group has a pool of well-qualified,
gifted individuals able to meet day-to-day operational needs and plans for the future.
BOC conducts a robust annual process to assess the strengths and weaknesses of its units.
It is committed to providing its people with opportunities to develop and grow, but also to bring new blood into
the organisation through targeted external recruitment. A global, web-based recruiting platform is being rolled out
globally to supplement other recruitment channels.
BOC continued to place great emphasis on personal and career development over the past year . Employees are
encouraged to be proactive about their future careers and development opportunities. The aim is for all employees
to have regular discussions with their managers regarding their aspirations, prospects and development needs.
These result in the formulation of an individual development plan, which is an agreed course of action to meet
employees’needs as well as the needs of the organisation.
Employees 24 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
BOC offers many opportunities for career and personal development. Employee development takes the form of 
on-the-job coaching and training, development projects, secondments, e-learning, as well as more traditional
classroom-based training.
In addition to the development that takes place to achieve current job effectiveness of all employees, high
potential employees are identified and developed with future roles in mind. Lead is an ambitious executive
development programme for high potential senior managers, facilitated by world class external providers as well 
as senior BOC executives. It is customised for BOC and is comprehensive in its scope. The programme offers a
tailored curriculum and is designed to equip the participants with the broad range of skills and experiences they 
will need to be successful leaders within the Group. T o date, over 100 senior leaders have had the opportunity 
to participate in Lead programmes.
During the past year , a new leadership development programme, iLead, has been designed and developed for
high potential middle managers. It is the intention to run iLead programmes in each BOC region, each year . Lead and
iLead augment many other management development initiatives, which are provided to supervisors and managers
around the world.
BOC believes that how its employees work is as important as what they produce, which is why it has
concentrated on the behaviours associated with accountability , collaboration, transparency and stretch – the ACTS
cultural principles. Accountability comes through people knowing what they are accountable for and being
empowered to deliver . Collaboration is about drawing on the rich diversity of styles, talents and skills across the
Group to maximise achievements. BOC values transparency because of the belief that visible problems can be solved
and that informed people make better decisions. Finally , stretch advocates continually pushing the boundaries of
performance. BOC has created a set of leadership competency models, which are aligned to ACTS. All recruitment,
development, recognition and enhancement processes are being aligned to this comprehensive and unified BOC
view of leadership and management.
Reward and recognition
An organisation that aspires to excellence must recognise and reward the achievement of excellence. The Group
continues to refine the key value drivers of its business units and to ensure it can reward and recognise outstanding
individual and team performance in the fulfilment of business goals. Programmes to achieve this are cascaded
throughout the organisation to heighten focus on effective performance at all levels.
The Group continues to move towards a total reward system that allows people to structure their remuneration
and benefits to suit their individual needs. Senior executives’remuneration is linked to a Group-wide variable
compensation plan, which is described in the report on remuneration on page 60.
Retirement benefit plans
BOC considers it important that its people provide for their retirement, and fully supports their efforts in this regard.
Around the world, the Group provides opportunities for people to participate in retirement programmes tailored 
to suit local conditions. Just as important, the board’s pensions committee takes prudent steps to monitor and control
Group-wide retirement benefit plans with local managers being responsible for safeguarding the security of each
retirement plan that they sponsor .
During the year , BOC closed its UK defined benefit pension schemes to new members and replaced them with
a new defined contribution plan.
The financial position of the Group’s main pension funds is detailed in note 8 to the financial statements.
Diversity
As one of the UK’s few truly global companies, BOC highly values the rich diversity of its people. While the Group
consistently champions a set of unifying values and principles, they are not imposed regardless of local sensibilities.
Rather , the Group strives to build on the qualities inherent in its global environment by encouraging people 
with different views, styles and approaches. Wherever in the world it operates, BOC is committed to maintaining 
a workplace free from discrimination for reasons of race, creed, culture, nationality , religion, gender , sexual
orientation, age or marital status.
Disability is not considered a barrier to employment and, as far as local conditions allow, employees are selected
on the basis of their ability to perform the job. Further necessary training is arranged, taking account of their particular
needs and the resources required to meet them.
Employee share schemes
Many BOC employees in the UK and some other countries have built up an equity interest in the Group’s business
through employee share schemes. Options may be granted at a discount to the market price at the date of grant.
The term of options granted could be from three to seven years and any option is conditional on a commitment by
the individual to make regular savings from pay that are then held by an independent organisation to purchase shares
at the end of the option period. The exercise of options under these schemes can be satisfied by the issue of new
shares or the transfer of existing shares.
Employees continued 25 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
BOC is committed to excellence in safety , health and environmental management. Each employee is expected to
comply with all external regulations and the Group’s global Code of Conduct. BOC’s commitment is best illustrated
by the breadth of measures taken to equip employees with the appropriate safeguards, tools and training.
This year , BOC launched and implemented its Code of Conduct. The code sets out the values and standards
which guide the way BOC businesses around the world conduct themselves. The legal, ethical and corporate
responsibility dimensions of safety , health, environment and quality (SHEQ) management are key features of the
code’s programme of communication, training, adherence, checks and audits. The code also ensures that SHEQ
issues are managed consistently across all countries and businesses.
A dedicated SHEQ department ensures that the Group has a deliverable policy , is proactive in its risk
assessment and professional in its remediation.
BOC has well-established programmes governing SHEQ performance. These standards, procedures and tools
are firmly embedded by the Group’s global integrated management systems and standards (IMSS) database.
IMSS disseminates the Group’s SHEQ policies through the BOC intranet, outlining the minimum standards and
actions needed to align with or conform to ISO 9000 (quality assurance), ISO 14001 (environment) and ISO 18001
(health and safety) management systems as well as the international safety rating systems (ISRS).
The management of safety and environmental performance is measured in the same way as are other key
business indicators. BOC has improved efficiency with more recycling, better energy conservation and less raw
materials waste from the Group’s production and distribution processes.
Safety
BOC manufactures and distributes some products that are potentially hazardous, being stored at very low
temperature or under pressure, with some exhibiting toxic or flammable properties. BOC is committed to practising
and communicating safe operations around the world as part of its product stewardship process. It is as important for
the Group to transmit safe working methodologies to customers and suppliers as it is to have clear , entrenched and
measurable performance standards practised by all BOC plants, depots and distributors.
Each business unit has a safety function, reporting to the business unit’s executive and to the Group SHEQ
function through a peer group network. This ensures that global best practice and the functional requirements of 
the business are always at the forefront of management thinking.
Controlling process-related risks is of the utmost importance. Any incidents that do occur are thoroughly
investigated and the lessons learned are applied throughout the organisation to minimise the likelihood of recurrence.
Safety lessons are shared throughout the gases industry and BOC continues to participate fully in the development
and application of industry-wide codes.
In 2001 , BOC instigated a five-year plan to halve the Group’s accident rate. Five-year strategies were developed
across all business units to enable safety objectives to be achieved. The main items underpinning the strategy are
implementing, communicating, measuring and reporting best practice as well as standardising worldwide competency
levels, training and increasing focus on safety behaviours.
The competence and training of BOC employees is continually improving as the Group’s IMSS package is rolled
out globally . BOC’s senior executives have committed to achieve agreed safety training competencies. This process is
being cascaded throughout the organisation.
As part of its five-year strategy , BOC has started to implement a process focusing on safety behaviours to
improve and sustain performance across the organisation. This process combines visible leadership, a binding safety
policy , an integrated organisation for managing safety across the Group, a system of behavioural safety assessments
and the use of positive leading indicators such as training and the clearance of corrective action to ensure the
achievement of safety goals.
This year , the Group safety function changed the basis of its incident reporting. Incident reports have been
extended to include recent mergers and acquisitions and all joint ventures. The graph figures detailing BOC’s safety
performance for 2003 are on this basis but it is not possible to rebase the preceding years.
It is with great sadness that the Group reported four employee fatalities this year . This is a matter of intense regret.
None of the fatalities was process related. One employee died in Thailand after a roadside incident. One died in 
Chile when he fell from a warehouse roof. One died in South Africa when his tanker hit some debris on the road.
One died in the UK in a road traffic accident.
A great deal of effort has been made to improve safety performance with increased scrutiny and implementation 
of rigorous procedures, including new Group and business unit safety processes. As in every year , BOC takes steps to
prevent and address the underlying causes of serious incidents as well as to ensure employee security in the workplace.
The Group uses four principal indicators to provide a consistent measure of its workplace and vehicle safety
performance. These are:
• Lost workday case rate (L WCR) per 200,000 hours. This includes all accidents resulting in the loss of one
complete day of work, according to best international practice. Many companies only report cases resulting in
three or more lost workdays as deemed reportable under RIDDOR regulations.
•T otal recordable case rate (TRCR) per 200,000 hours. This includes all L WCRs and medical treatment cases.
•Passenger car avoidable accident rate (PCAAR) per million miles.
•Truck avoidable accident rate (T AAR) per million miles.

Occupational health and hygiene
BOC requires its businesses around the world to manage employee health activities in accordance with local laws and
regulations and according to BOC’s own codes of practice. The Group’s occupational health and hygiene (OHH)
function continues to provide a global service, striving to eradicate the organisation’s work-related health hazards.
It also ensures that those who travel internationally on Group business are properly protected against disease and
that the medical requirements of visas and work permits are met.
Access to global guidance on OHH, together with manuals, training videos and safety data sheets, is available
through local and global SHEQ functions and on a dedicated intranet site.
The OHH function carries out reviews in all business units and regions to provide information and guidance on
the main health issues that exist in BOC operations globally and how best these potential hazards may be minimised
or eliminated. This is achieved by providing best practice standards and guidance to local SHEQ personnel who then
implement policies as necessary . Adverse employee health effects are monitored through occupational health checks
around the world. Some checks are managed internally and others are out-sourced to professional occupational
health providers. Voluntary well-person and routine yearly medical examinations are conducted to monitor the
health of employees.
The main potential health issues that exist in BOC operations differ across business units. In the gases businesses,
the main potential health issues are:exposure to noise from gas compression activities and from cylinder handling;
potential exposure to some gases filled into cylinders;potential exposure to chemicals used in metal cleaning;vehicle
maintenance and painting operations;and ergonomic and manual handling risks, particularly associated with cylinders.
OHH programmes have been developed to deal with these issues and are applied across the Group through
local initiatives and the SHEQ integrated management system. BOC programmes include:an education programme 
to raise awareness of the effects of noise;a manual handling training video;a legionella control programme for water
systems such as cooling towers on sites;a programme for the assessment of display screen equipment to minimise
ergonomic health risks;a chemical assessment and management programme and specific work to reduce the use of
chemical solvents.
The environment
Although classified in the chemicals sector , BOC does not have the same direct or significant environmental issues to
deal with as traditional chemicals manufacturers. The nature of BOC’s activities and the type of chemicals handled are
quite different. However , in line with other industries, BOC is committed to the conscientious stewardship of its
products and services.
Management of environmental issues that are relevant to the Group’s businesses are overseen by the SHEQ
department operating at a global and local business unit level. Group environmental strategies continue to help to
improve business performance in sites across the world. Many BOC business units have programmes to achieve 
ISO 14001 environmental certification.
In 2003, KPMG (a professional services firm) reviewed BOC’s integrated management system and standards
(IMSS) to assess whether IMSS environmental documentation conforms to the requirements of ISO 14001 for
environmental management systems. KPMG concluded that IMSS documentation complies in all material respects
with the standard. As a result, KPMG provided BOC with an assurance statement which can be seen on
www.boc.com Assurance by an independent auditor is an important indicator , showing that BOC takes
environmental management seriously and has robust sustainability systems. If a BOC business can demonstrate that it
has implemented the requirements of IMSS it can also show that it adheres to ISO 14001 without having to undergo
ISO certification for all sites.
The SHEQ department continues to pursue a programme to integrate environmental goals into the
organisation’s management performance contracts and develop global best operating practices. BOC’s global
environment working group this year developed an improved annual environmental survey . This new web-based
platform will be used to develop action plans and report performance on-line. Web-based management systems will
contribute to significant efficiency enhancements in the future. For example, introduction of a new control system
that enables a nitrogen liquefaction unit to be started remotely at BOC’s Midland site in the US will lead to energy
savings of some US$1 million per annum.
BOC has operated a comprehensive environmental survey programme of its sites for more than ten years.
The annual survey highlights issues relevant to the business and assesses how well they are being managed. Objectives
for improved performance remain an integral part of business performance contracts.
The transport of product by road has a potentially significant environmental impact. BOC operates its vehicle fleet
to the highest environmental standards. Gist, the Group’s distribution and supply chain business, won the environment
award at the 2003 Motor T ransport Awards in London. Environmentally focused initiatives ranged from development
of innovative vehicle design and use, such as noise minimisation equipment and new exhaust treatments, pallet
recycling, waste reduction and various site-specific initiatives. For example, Gist and Marks & Spencer are co-operating
to recycle 3.5 million food distribution trays.
The use of energy in BOC operations is an area of constant focus. Over the last three years, Process Gas
Solutions operations have focused on plant and distribution efficiency improvements, resulting in more than one
thousand projects that will deliver significant annual savings.
BOC’s commitment to environmental stewardship and partnership is shown in its approach to new plants,
facilities and services. For example, BOC and Hudson T echnologies signed a global alliance to promote technology
that cleans and reclaims refrigerants. The technology will improve plant efficiency leading to greater energy savings 
for customers and environmental benefits from reduced carbon dioxide emissions.
Selecting the right supplier for BOC is fundamental to conducting business effectively and ethically .
Throughout its businesses, BOC has adopted the SESP A
TM
process for supplier evaluation, selection and performance
appraisal, together with a new ethical purchasing policy implemented by the supply management function.

Environmental, safety and social considerations are key SESP A
TM
and supply management standards. BOC also 
uses a best practice guide to define supplier safety , health and environmental requirements. This looks for positive
environmental attributes such as ongoing environmental performance, awards, legal action and proactivity .
BOC aims to comply fully with all material environmental laws and regulations. BOC received one
administrative fine in the US of US$1 ,500 in 2003. This related to the late submission of paperwork to a local
regulatory authority . No prosecutions for breach of any environmental regulation were incurred and BOC was
compliant with external standards, but not all businesses complied fully with all internal codes or practices.
Where this is the case, it has responded with measures to abate and prevent future occurances as part of the
Group’s programme of continuous improvement.
The US Environmental Protection Agency has named The BOC Group Inc as a potentially responsible party for
clean-up costs at a number of hazardous waste sites. Although liability for the remediation of such sites may be legally
imposed without regard to the quantity of waste contributed, based upon the information available management
believes that it is unlikely that any costs incurred will have a significant impact on the financial position of the Group.
BOC continues to contribute technology and processes to meet the environmental needs of customers who 
are striving to improve their own environmental performance. The increase in the demands set by environmental
legislation also presents BOC with a number of potential business opportunities. BOC’s eco-efficiency technologies
include the Vitox oxygen injection system, which improves water quality and can, for instance, help fish farmers
improve production rates. BOC has also patented systems to recover carbon dioxide from other companies’
productive processes and put it to constructive use. For example, reclaimed carbon dioxide is infused in drip-irrigation
water or used to enrich atmospheres to enhance crop growth. The glass and metals industries use BOC’s oxy-fuel
burners to increase the efficiency of combustion, using less fuel and reducing polluting emissions.
BOC installed some of its new BOC low emission swirl (LES) oxy-fuel burner systems at a Johnson Matthey
precious metals refinery in the UK this year . The oxy-fuel burners improve emission performance and operational
efficiency.
BOC and Maxon Corporation jointly developed a new combustion technology , known as the oxy-therm 
low emission flat flame (LEFF) burner , that helps glass manufacturers to reduce energy costs and increase yield.
BOC put itself at the forefront of the UK double glazing industry’s drive to combat global warming with a
scheme to reduce heat loss through windows and cut carbon dioxide emissions. BOC also launched safety
workshops for UK refrigerant gas users.
The Group continues to develop technology that is more energy efficient, which helps to support customers and
partners meet their carbon dioxide emission reduction commitments under the Kyoto protocol on climate change.
BOC’s Hartford air separation plant in Illinois received the Compressed Gas Association’s 2003 award for
environmental excellence. This was the result of the plant’s efforts to reduce power consumption by 320 kilowatts 
per hour while avoiding the use of ozone depleting substances.
The Group continues to work actively with its stakeholders – customers, suppliers, employees, local
communities and governments – to ensure environmental issues are approached responsibly and supported actively .
BOC sponsored the third BOC environment award at the UK’s Institute of Chemical Engineers’annual award
ceremony in July . The award was given to Dow Corning for an environmental management system that saved the
company £8 million in the last two years. BOC was also awarded a special Green Ribbon award in recognition of 
its outstanding contribution to sustaining, protecting and enhancing the environment in New Zealand.
Underlining the Group’s adherence to sound, internationally attested environmental practices, BOC is a
signatory to the UN’s Global Compact in support of human rights, labour and environmental principles.
The continuing importance of global compliance, corporate social responsibility and sustainability amongst the
Group’s wider stakeholders means that BOC has continued to review and adapt its business practices appropriately
by strengthening policies, training and implementation programmes and processes. This has been further enhanced
by including environmental concerns in the Group’s Code of Conduct. In the Americas, BOC supports the chemical
industry’s Responsible Care programme. BOC’s Colombian business reached its third year of active support for
cleaner production with 22 other companies in the north Aburra valley . BOC continues to participate 
in the Business in the Environment survey for the UK. This year the Group improved its overall survey score achieving
88 per cent against 76 per cent in 2002, taking BOC into the top 25 per cent of FTSE companies participating in 
its survey .
BOC Edwards also became a signatory to Global Care, a semiconductor industry initiative designed to establish
a framework where members can strengthen their commitments to the environment, health and safety .
The BOC Foundation for the Environment
The UK-based BOC Foundation for the Environment, which was established with an initial injection of £1 million in
1990, has so far supported nearly 120 projects. This year the company contributed £180,000 to Foundation projects.
Since the Foundation’s inception BOC has donated £3.7 million. The Foundation concentrates its funds on projects
that improve air and water quality . Air is important to BOC because it is the source of BOC’s raw materials:oxygen,
nitrogen and argon. Water is both an essential part of many of BOC’s production processes and a growing 
market opportunity .
The Foundation wants to make a practical contribution. It encourages those with good scientific ideas who 
need financial help to turn academic or early results into workable environmental solutions. It expects the projects it
supports to make a measurable difference within a few years and to benefit the community as a whole, not just the
recipient of the grant. The Foundation has worked in partnership with government departments, local authorities,
environmental charities and commercial organisations.

Research and development
Research and development (R&D) is conducted around the world with key sites located in north America, the UK 
and Japan. The Group T echnical Center (GTC) in Murray Hill, New Jersey , is a primary R&D location for market
applications for Process Gas Solutions and for electronic materials for BOC Edwards.
Process Gas Solutions delivers technology through internal development, the formation of alliances and
partnerships with universities and customers, licensing or acquisition of technologies from third parties and by
participating in technology-based ventures. BOC now has access through Linde BOC Process Plants to much
broader technology and product offerings, especially in hydrogen and syngas. The development of ceramic-based
technologies for the production of hydrogen and syngas continues.
BOC has acquired proven technology from Eco-Snow for precision cleaning using carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) snow.
It also recently acquired ultra violet/ozone-based technology from RGF Environmental to provide additional food
safety solutions by preventing the growth of listeria and extending product shelf life.
BOC joined Sumitomo Electric Industries and Intermagnetics General Corporation to demonstrate high
temperature superconducting cable technology in Albany , New Y ork with substantial government and state funding.
The European Union is funding further development, with other companies and universities, into ceramic-based 
oxygen separation to enhance CO 2 sequestration.
BOC’s investments in hydrogen energy include vehicle fuelling demonstrations, very high pressure gaseous
hydrogen fuelling stations and participation in Chrysalix, a hydrogen energy venture capital fund.
Industrial and Special Products has developed the LASOX laser cutting technology jointly with partners.
Through internal developments and participation in ventures it has invested in new opportunities in the medical
sector . It has also used advanced techniques to drive operational and distribution efficiencies.
BOC Edwards uses joint development agreements with original equipment manufacturers and end users, along
with guidance from the International T echnology Roadmap for Semiconductors (SIA), to prioritise its investments in
semiconductor technology . Programmes draw on a combination of BOC technologies in gases, vacuum, purification,
delivery and systemisation. An example is supercritical CO 2
technology for cleaning wafers with small features.
A new reconfigurable control system for chemical dispense equipment dramatically reduces set-up time, and
allows for easy and flexible process changes. Enhancements have also been made to slurry delivery , including point 
of use delivery .
An important development area is high capacity abatement technology for flat panel applications. The Zenith
line of integrated pumping and abatement systems are smaller and give reduced cost of ownership for customers in
both silicon and compound semiconductor facilities.
BOC Edwards continues to focus on products for sub-90 nanometre integrated circuit fabrication. Pumping
systems designed for 300mm fabs form the basis for a range of solutions for flat panel manufacturers, including the
latest generation 7 factories in Asia and Japan.
BOC Edwards’advanced systems for copper technology include flexible, high accuracy blending technology 
for chemicals and chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) slurries, along with novel technology to address the
waste generated by these advanced processes. Load cell technology increases blend accuracy , improves control 
over slurry distribution to the CMP tools and enhances equipment stability .
Patented metal removal technologies are being applied to the treatment of electro-less plating bath waste
streams. Similarly , copper CMP slurry waste streams can now be abated using a process which removes copper 
from a stream of suspended solids without removing the solids.
Development programmes continue on materials designed to meet increasing purity requirements for 
the storage and delivery of gases and liquids. In situ sensors have been introduced for enhancing manufacturing
productivity in semiconductor fabs.
Continuing work with a leading manufacturer of lithography tools aims to solve vacuum problems for 
extreme ultraviolet lithography tools, projected to be needed for sub-45 nanometre integrated circuit technology .
Development continues on ultra-pure gas systems for 157 nanometre lithography tools.
Pumps have been developed with improved hydrogen performance for key applications in the dielectric
deposition market. Development continues on low noise and vibration pumps, and to improve motors and 
drive mechanisms. For the scientific sector , the range of pumps has been expanded to bring dry pumping technology
to the life sciences, primarily users of mass spectrometry .
Kachina’s technology has developed from high purity cleaning of semiconductor chamber parts to the broader
requirement of providing technology-based solutions that reduce the cost of ownership of the customer’s operations.
BOC Edwards Pharmaceutical Systems continues to focus on developments in automated handling systems for
aseptic packaging, driven by the industry’s increasing requirement to separate potent drugs from human operators;
and in-line product inspection, which is now receiving the support of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Process
Analytical T echnology initiative. Its most recent inspection product uses nuclear magnetic resonance to weigh the
contents of vials in high-speed motion down a packaging line.
T otal R&D expenditure in 2003 was £39.9 million, compared with £47.0 million in 2002 and £59.7 million in 2001 .
Information technology
The number of countries running the SAP business computing system grew again this year when the system was
further extended to the Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special Products business units in the US, Canada
and Poland. Deployment throughout BOC Edwards worldwide also began. The global data centre, which provides a
central facility for managing all SAP transactions from around the world, continued to function well. A fully-equipped
back-up centre was established capable of instantaneous operation in the event of a failure.
The Webcentric project in the south Pacific demonstrated the feasibility of running all office-based software on
remote computers, accessed by users as and when needed from simple terminals on their desktops. A number of
new technologies were also deployed to support improved business processes and to offer competitive advantage in
some key markets.
Research, development and information technology 29 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
This document contains certain forward-looking statements which involve risk and uncertainty as they relate to
future events and circumstances. The following risk factors, as well as those discussed on pages 47 and 48 of 
the financial review, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these 
forward-looking statements:
BOC is affected by the semiconductor business cycle
Manufacturers of semiconductors represent BOC Edwards’major customer base, and BOC Edwards’profitability 
is directly linked to the demand of these manufacturers for vacuum equipment, services and industrial gases.
The semiconductor industry has experienced significant growth over the long term, but is cyclical in nature. Owing to
reduced demand from end users of technology products and excess supply of semiconductors, the semiconductor
industry continues to experience a severe downturn, which negatively impacts the demand for BOC Edwards’
products and services. A delay in the recovery of the semiconductor industry , or a further downturn in that industry ,
could continue to adversely impact BOC’s financial results.
Acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits and synergies
BOC has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years as part of its growth strategy . While BOC will have
identified expected synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities prior to acquisition and integration of acquired
entities, these benefits may not be achieved owing to, among other things:
• delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;
• higher than expected costs or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;
• diversion of the attention and resources of BOC’s management;
• inability to retain key employees in acquired companies;
• inability to retain key customers;and
• assumption of liabilities unrecognised in due diligence.
The growth of BOC’ s gases business will depend on the ability to win and execute large projects profitably
BOC, through its Process Gas Solutions line of business, has a strategy for growth that requires significant investment
each year to serve key customers in different geographies. Failure to execute projects successfully for these
customers will impact PGS’s ability to win new projects from these customers, and therefore may impact BOC’s
future financial results. The specific risks associated with major projects include:
• failure to complete the project on time owing to unforeseen construction problems (which may require BOC 
to pay penalties under the terms of the customer contract);
• failure of the plant to deliver the contracted volumes and quantities of product required by the customer because
of design errors or errors in manufacturing or construction (which may require BOC to pay penalties under the
terms of the customer contract);and
• inability to operate the plant at costs assumed in BOC’s financial evaluation of the project.
The safety of BOC’ s operations is critical to success
Industrial gases are hazardous substances and BOC recognises that managing safety in operations, transportation 
and products is critical to achieve growth and financial results. Failure to maintain high levels of safety can result in a
number of negative outcomes, including:
• exclusion from certain market sectors deemed important for future development of the business (such as
medical gases);
• damage to reputation;
•fines and penalties for breaches of safety laws;and
• liability payments and costs to employees or third parties arising from injury or damage.
BOC operates in over 50 different countries and is therefore exposed to economic,political and business risks
associated with international operations
BOC’s overall success as a business with global operations depends, in part, upon its ability to succeed in differing
economic, political and business conditions. BOC encounters different legal and regulatory requirements in
numerous jurisdictions. These include taxation laws, environmental regulations, regulations concerning operational
standards and competition laws. BOC is also confronted by political risks such as the expropriation of assets and the
inability to export currency . The business risks and challenges faced in each geography include the need to manage
credit risks of local customers, appointing and retaining key staff, general economic conditions locally and currency
fluctuation. Recognition of changing market conditions in local geographies is critical to BOC’s long-term success.
In addition, BOC’s operations are exposed to varying degrees of natural catastrophe risk, such as earthquake and
flood, as well as security risk, in the different countries in which BOC operates.
BOC relies on development of,or access to,technology to support business growth 
BOC’s success is dependent in part on its continued investment in technology to develop new products and services
across all businesses, new applications for existing products or to design effective means for producing industrial
gases. Failure to access or develop technology or anticipate, manage or adopt technological changes in operations or
product applications on a timely basis could have a material impact on BOC’s future results. For example, the rapid
development of technology in the semiconductor sector requires BOC Edwards to be aware of changes in customer
technology requirements and to introduce new products to meet those requirements in a timely manner . Failure to
do so could result in reduced market share and profitability .
Risk factors BOC operates in a highly competitive environment
The industrial gases market is very competitive, with several large competitors and a significant number of smaller local
competitors in different territories. Although the current trend in the industry is to seek price increases for industrial
gases, the industry has experienced falling prices in some previous years. There is no guarantee that the current trend 
will continue and there is a risk that competitors will seek to maintain or increase market shares by reducing prices.
These price reductions would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows.
Recognising and anticipating changes in the manufacturing economy is key to BOC’ s success
BOC’s industrial gas businesses serve a wide range of manufacturing customers in major geographies such as the US,
UK, Japan and Australia. This is particularly true of the Industrial and Special Products line of business which provides
products and services to customers involved in the welding and cutting of metal, the largest source of revenue for 
this division. As customers in these traditional manufacturing-based economies seek to move their manufacturing
operations to lower cost territories in, for example, Asia and Latin America, the risk arises that BOC’s operations 
in the major geographies will have lower growth opportunities. Failure to recognise these trends and manage the
consequences, through the development of alternative markets and/or meeting demand in higher growth territories,
could have a negative impact on future Group results.
BOC’ s success depends to a significant extent on its key personnel and employees
BOC’s performance depends on the skills and efforts of its employees and management team across all of its
businesses. BOC recognises that failure to attract new talent and retain existing expertise, knowledge and skills 
in operations, products and infrastructure areas such as information technology could have a negative impact on
revenues and profits. In addition, the success of BOC’s acquisitions may depend, in part, on BOC’s ability to retain
management personnel of acquired companies.
Litigation may have an adverse impact on financial results
The global nature of BOC’s business exposes it to the potential for litigation from third parties. From time to time
BOC is involved in lawsuits in the US, as well as other geographies, resulting from current and past operations 
or products. The outcome of these lawsuits may result in damages and awards which could have a material impact 
on BOC’s profitability , its business operations or financial condition. Details of current litigation where claims for
damages in large amounts have been asserted are provided in the financial review on pages 49 and 50.
Increased energy costs could reduce profitability
The production of industrial gases requires significant amounts of electrical energy . Energy costs are a key component
of the cost of manufacturing industrial gases, and increases in these costs can impact profitability if they cannot be
passed on to customers. Accurately predicting trends in energy costs is difficult to achieve as energy costs are to a large
extent subject to factors beyond the company’s control – for example, political conditions in oil producing regions.
BOC also operates large fleets of commercial vehicles in certain major geographies. An increase in energy costs
associated with the use of these commercial vehicles may negatively impact profit levels.
Ineffective implementation of computer software systems 
The introduction of software to improve efficiency and effectiveness of various business processes is an important
contributor to BOC’s growth strategy . Failure to design, select appropriate suppliers or implement such systems
effectively could result in unplanned costs or reduced levels of customer satisfaction which could adversely affect
Group results.
Risk factors continued

Introduction
The Group’s results are prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and comply with 
UK Companies Act requirements. While the UK GAAP reporting basis provides the core information for users of
this report and accounts to understand the financial performance of the Group, management believes that users will
be assisted in understanding the performance relative to previous periods by presenting the results in an alternative
manner . This presentation isolates the impact of currency movements from year to year and eliminates the impact of
exceptional or non-recurring items. It is also the basis used by management to review performance of the business
and is a component of variable compensation plans. The elements of this alternative presentation are described in
more detail below.
Impact of currency movements
The Group has operations in some 50 countries around the world and the majority of its profit is generated outside
the UK. Results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange against sterling for the year .
Changes in such rates from year to year can significantly affect the Group’s results when these are presented in
pounds sterling. In some cases, such changes may make it difficult to understand underlying business performance
trends without providing additional information. For example, the average value of the South African rand to 
pounds sterling changed by 15 per cent in 2003 compared with 2002. When looking at the financial performance 
of the Afrox hospitals business segment in 2003, it is therefore important to highlight this currency impact to users 
of the information.
Consequently , management has for many years monitored business performance on a ‘constant currency’basis.
This basis eliminates the impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas businesses
into sterling by retranslating the results of the comparative year at the rates of exchange used in the current year . This is
the basis for all internal management reporting throughout the year .
In this operating review, the comparison of financial performance between years may in places be referred to as
on this ‘constant currency’basis. Comments on all segmental performance are on a constant currency basis.

Exceptional or non-recurring items
Management believes that to present the results of the Group in the most meaningful way , items of an exceptional 
nature should be separately identified and disclosed. This enables users of the information to have a better understanding
of underlying business performance. Examples of such items in 2003 include a litigation settlement expense, the costs of
the business initiative programme announced in August 2001 , other restructuring programmes and charges relating to
the integration of OSK (BOC’s gases business in Japan) and part of the Air Liquide business in Japan to form Japan Air
Gases. Additionally in 2002 there were charges in connection with the formation of the Linde BOC Process Plants
business and a write-down in the value of the net assets of OSK ahead of the merger with part of Air Liquide Japan.
Exceptional items include those items classified as both operating and non-operating under UK GAAP .

The review of results excluding exceptional items is part of the normal internal management reporting process.
The growth in operating profit excluding exceptional items is also one of the measures used in the variable element 
of the senior management compensation scheme.
Further information regarding the business initiative programme, which is now largely complete, as well as the
other exceptional items is given in the financial review on page 46. An analysis of all operating and non-operating
exceptional items is given in note 2 b) to the financial statements on page 83.
In this review, the adjustments to eliminate exceptional items have been made to operating profit (both Group
and by segment), profit before tax and earnings per share. Exceptional items are commented on in the Group results
section as well as in the individual business segments to which they relate. A reconciliation of these adjusted items to
the equivalent UK GAAP measure is shown in the profit and loss account on page 72. When any results or measures
used in this review have been adjusted to exclude exceptional items, they are referred to as ‘adjusted’.
Within the individual business segments of the operating review, operating exceptional items are commented 
on separately . Comments on other aspects of financial trends and performance are based on adjusted operating profit.
This provides more meaningful comment on underlying business performance.

This review also presents return on capital employed (ROCE) and adjusted return on capital employed. Adjusted return
on capital employed removes exceptional items from the measure of operating profit used in the calculation. Adjusted
return on capital employed is used by management for reasons similar to those described above.
A reconciliation of these two measures is shown below.

The Group commentary in this review also comments on free cash flow. Free cash flow is a measure often referred
to by BOC management and other users of financial information to highlight the cash flow available from underlying
ongoing business operations before acquisition and disposal activity . Whether or not this remains positive over time 
is an indicator that dividends to shareholders are being paid out of cash generated by existing Group businesses.
As such it is a useful additional measure of financial performance.
A reconciliation of this measure to the nearest equivalent UK GAAP measure, net cash flow, is shown below.

Group
Turnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was £4,323.2 million in 2003, up eight per cent
compared with £4,017.9 million in 2002. Operating profit was £438.6 million, up three per cent compared with 
£425.6 million in 2002. After charging operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling £67.0 million and net
interest and other financing items of £86.7 million, profit before tax was £351 .9 million, up five per cent compared with
£335.3 million in 2002. Earnings per share were 44.5p, up seven per cent compared with 41 .4p in 2002. Excluding the
exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was £505.6 million, adjusted profit before tax was 
£418.9 million and adjusted earnings per share were 52.9p.
Comparisons with 2002 are affected by exchange rate movements. For the currencies that principally affect the
Group’s results, movements in the Australian dollar and the South African rand were favourable and movements in
the US dollar and Japanese yen were adverse. If the results of a year ago had been translated at the rates applied to
this year , turnover would have been reduced by £39.0 million. There would have been an increase in operating profit
of £0.8 million and adjusted operating profit would have been unchanged. Adjusted profit before tax would have
been £5.3 million higher and adjusted earnings per share would have been increased by 0.3p.
The table set out below summarises results reported both under UK GAAP and as adjusted. Results for 2002
are shown both as reported in that year and on a constant currency basis.

Exceptional items in 2003 amounted to a charge of £67.0 million. The charge comprises £43.2 million for a litigation
settlement, costs of £15.5 million for completion of restructuring programmes and £8.3 million relating to the
integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan.
Exceptional items in 2002 included restructuring charges of £47.2 million and a £21 .3 million charge relating to
the closure of facilities in connection with the combination of BOC Process Plants with Linde Engineering in the US.
An exceptional charge of £21 .2 million was made to write down the value of OSK, BOC’s gases business in Japan, in
advance of the then proposed merger of OSK with part of Air Liquide Japan.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2003 was 12.5 per cent. Return on capital
employed for the year to 30 September 2003 was 10.8 per cent. Free cash flow (as defined on page 32) remained
positive and was £141 .8 million in 2003. Net cash flow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and
including exceptional cash items, was £6.3 million in 2003. A reconciliation of these measures is shown on page 32.
A first interim dividend for 2003 of 15.5p per share was paid in February 2003 and a second interim dividend 
of 23.5p per share was paid in August 2003. In aggregate this was a 2.6 per cent increase over the annual dividend 
of the previous year . A first interim dividend for 2004 of 15.5 p per share has been declared for payment in 
February 2004.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries (including interest capitalised) was £281 .2 million in 2003, compared with 
£354.3 million in 2002. Capital expenditure by joint ventures and associates was £81 .4 million in 2003, of which 
the BOC share was £36.1 million. Equivalent expenditure in 2002 was £74.2 million, of which the BOC share was 
£34.5 million. The Group also made acquisitions of businesses of £135.5 million in 2003 and proceeds from disposals
were £3.9 million. Equivalent items in 2002 were £207.3 million and £10.6 million respectively .

Increased turnover resulted from generally firm price trends as well as revenues from acquisitions and new plants
serving chemical industry customers. The additional revenues came principally from BOC’s joint venture with
Y angtze Petrochemical Corporation (YPC) at Nanjing, China, from a new hydrogen and carbon monoxide (HyCO)
plant at Map T a Phut, Thailand and from the acquisitions of a partial oxydation syngas plant at Clear Lake, T exas, and
the US water services company , Environmental Management Corporation.
Improved adjusted operating profit was also a result of operational efficiency gains. The closure of facilities in
connection with the combination of BOC’s Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US led to lower
costs towards the end of 2002 and there was a full year of savings in 2003. There were also further cost reductions
arising from continued progress in delivery scheduling and remote plant operation.

As in 2002, economic uncertainties constrained the authorisation of investment projects by customers during 
the year . A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide (HyCO) plant serving Citgo’s oil refinery at Lemont in Illinois came
into production in October 2003 and a new air separation plant is under construction in Nanjing. When completed 
in 2004 this will supply industrial gases to nearby chemical facilities being completed by a joint venture company
established between BASF of Germany and the Chinese chemical company YPC.
Operating exceptional items in 2003 were for the completion of restructuring programmes, including those
that were part of the programme announced in August 2001 . Additionally , there were charges relating to the
integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
Europe Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in the UK and in Poland but declined slightly in Ireland.
A full year of revenues from the plant commissioned in January 2002 to supply hydrogen to Huntsman on T eesside
and from the T eesside pipeline system acquired in July 2002 were contributors to increased turnover in the UK.
Despite continued weakness in UK manufacturing, sales volumes increased in the merchant market for liquefied
gases and prices were also slightly firmer . The key factors behind the increase in adjusted operating profit were lower
costs in 2003 as a result of restructuring and a charge of £3.6 million in 2002 for an asset write down and debt
provision after a steel customer went into receivership.
The relocation of some customers and a general decline in manufacturing activity led to lower sales volumes and
adjusted operating profit in Ireland. As in the UK, the trend of selling prices remained positive and marginally ahead 
of inflation.
Business in Poland benefited from stable economic conditions in anticipation of joining the European Union 
in 2004. The acquisition of the business of Praxair Polska took effect in February 2003 and added additional air
separation capacity as well as BOC’s first source of carbon dioxide in the region.
Cryostar is BOC’s engineering company based in France, manufacturing cryogenic pumps, expansion turbines
and compressors for a variety of industrial gas applications and for marine liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers.
Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003 as a result of strong demand for industrial gas applications 
in China and for shipboard expansion units on LNG tankers.
North America Despite a small increase in turnover , adjusted operating profit in 2003 was at a similar level to 2002.
Selling price trends were favourable – particularly in the second half of the year – and were sufficient to offset cost
inflation. Sales volumes were lower as a result of general weakness in manufacturing industries and some business 
was lost early in 2003 as customers changed to alternative supplies. At the same time, a significant volume of new
liquefied gas business was obtained, mainly in the closing months of the year .
Steel industry customers that had benefited from US tariff protection in the previous year faced renewed
competitive pressure in 2003. Some customers are operating under chapter 11 creditor protection.
Carbon dioxide for beverage applications continued to be in strong demand. During 2003 BOC improved
analytical capabilities to upgrade product quality assurance for its Premier Beverage carbon dioxide service to the soft
drinks industry .
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake, T exas, from Celanese.
Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the Celanese chemical
facility at Clear Lake. The Celanese facility is located on the Houston ship canal, and includes a world scale vinyl acetate
monomer plant and the world’s largest acetic acid plant. These require large quantities of oxygen and nitrogen as well
as carbon monoxide.
A new HyCO plant serving Citgo’s oil refinery at Lemont in Illinois began production in October 2003.
This further expands BOC’s hydrogen business with a variety of petroleum and chemical industry customers around
the world.
Latin America Turnover increased significantly , although growth was held back by a general strike in Venezuela in 
the period December 2002 to February 2003. This inevitably affected customers’requirements for industrial gases.
Adjusted operating profit also increased because of better sales volumes especially in Chile and Brazil and because 
of selling price increases that generally exceeded local rates of inflation.
BOC’s joint venture company in Mexico supplying high-pressure pure nitrogen to Pemex for pressurising its
Cantarell oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico performed steadily throughout the year .
In September 2003, a new 200 tonnes-a-day air separation unit was commissioned in Santiago to supply oxygen
for leaching copper ores. Another plant is due to begin production in 2004 and will supply oxygen for CST , a steel
producer in Brazil.
Africa Both turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003. Sales volumes were broadly similar but selling
prices were higher and cost controls also contributed to better margins. The focus of business development was on
the use of gases in mineral processes in the extraction of precious metals.
JapanThe combination of BOC’s and Air Liquide’s industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan took effect from
January 2003. Until then the results of OSK, BOC’s gases business in Japan, were consolidated as a subsidiary .
Subsequently BOC has accounted for its share of turnover and profit of the merged company , Japan Air Gases, on 
an equity basis. This distorts the comparison of turnover and profit between 2003 and earlier years for BOC’s three
lines of business. On the respective bases used in each year , there was an increase in both turnover and adjusted
operating profit for PGS in Japan for 2003.
The integration process that began in 2003 made good progress. The two organisations have been successfully
integrated in the key areas and the number of branch offices has been reduced. Cryogenic equipment manufacturing
has also been integrated into a single location. As a result of the merger , management remains confident of achieving
cost savings at the annual rate of some Japanese yen 5 billion by the end of 2004. 35 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
North Asia Turnover and adjusted operating profit were up significantly in 2003. Margins improved as a result of
better operational efficiency coupled with some price increases.
Turnover gains were largely as a result of growth in north China but there was also growth in mainland south China,
Korea and T aiwan. T urnover was down in Hong Kong as some customers relocated production to mainland China.
Underlying growth of adjusted operating profit in south China was further boosted by additional profit arising from the
renegotiation of a power supply contract. Results in north China benefited from the addition for a full year of the joint
venture begun in May 2002 serving the petrochemical industry in Nanjing. Further liquefaction capacity was added to
its existing air separation plant during 2003 to serve the local merchant market. Results also benefited from strong
growth in the steel industry as a result of increasing local demand.
In October 2003 BOC announced that its joint venture with the T aiyuan Iron and Steel Corporation (TISCO),
was to build two new air separation units (ASUs) to supply a total of 2,700 tonnes a day of oxygen to TISCO’s plant 
in Shanxi province in north-central China. The new ASUs are expected to come on stream at the end of 2005.
TISCO is the largest stainless steel producer in China and has been selected by the central government as one of 
two stainless steel development centres. Further investments at BOC’s subsidiaries at Suzhou near Shanghai and
plans to add some 400 tonnes a day of capacity at its associated company Pearl River Gases in southern China were
also announced.
A new air separation plant is already under construction for BOC’s joint venture in Nanjing. When completed 
in 2004 this plant will supply gases to the BASF and Y angtze Petrochemical Company (YPC) joint venture chemical
facility under construction nearby .
South East Asia Economic growth was generally buoyant across the region but Singapore continued to be affected by
the migration of electronics and other industries to lower cost countries in Asia. The outbreak of the SARS infection
also curtailed travel and affected business activity . Economic trends in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia were favourable.
In aggregate, both turnover and adjusted operating profit increased across the region. Margins improved as a
result of operational efficiency gains. Prices were held down by competitive pressures in Malaysia and Thailand but
improved in Indonesia and the Philippines. T onnage volumes increased in Malaysia as a result of sales to the steel
industry and growing demand from the electronics assembly and food-freezing industries. T urnover was also boosted
by a full year contribution from Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc (NIOI) which became fully owned by BOC’s associated
company in Malaysia during September 2002.
Increased turnover in Thailand was based on better underlying demand as well as increased production. A new
hydrogen and carbon monoxide (HyCO) plant began production at Map T a Phut during 2003 and carbon dioxide
capacity was doubled with the addition of a new 300 tonnes-a-day plant at Rayong to serve food and beverage
customers.
Underlying trends were favourable in both Indonesia and the Philippines but results in the Philippines were
adversely affected by the closure of a customer’s plant.
South Asia Economic growth in India led to better sales of liquefied gases in the merchant market and sustained
demand from the steel industry . A new 225 tonnes-a-day oxygen plant was commissioned in the last quarter of the
year for the T ata Iron and Steel Company , BOC’s principal tonnage customer in the region.
During the early part of 2004, a new plant should begin to supply beverage industry customers in Pakistan with
carbon dioxide.
South Pacific Turnover and adjusted operating profit were slightly higher than a year ago despite adverse business
trends in some Australian industries. The strengthening of the Australian dollar in 2003 had a negative impact on the
important minerals sector , which responded by restructuring. There was also an adverse effect on the food industry .
Volumes of liquefied gas sales in the merchant market were therefore lower .
The Australian steel industry was somewhat less affected and a low cost base enabled it to remain globally
competitive. T onnage volumes increased in 2003. New business has been obtained with BHP in New South Wales.
In January 2003 BOC commenced supplying additional oxygen and nitrogen, following a process upgrade to BOC’s
Port Kembla facility.
Improved operational efficiencies helped to improve margins in the merchant market. Centralised plant
operation was further extended during 2003 to the control of plants in New Zealand from an operations centre in
Australia. Prices were raised in the merchant market and further increases will be required in 2004 to offset increased
electricity costs that have resulted from the further rationalisation of generating capacity ownership.
Process systems During 2003 BOC continued to benefit from lower costs arising from the combination of its
Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US to form the new company , Linde BOC Process Plants LLC,
based in T ulsa, Oklahoma. This transaction was completed at the end of September 2002, making Linde Engineering
the principal supplier of BOC’s industrial gas plants worldwide with access to Linde’s global technical capabilities in air
separation, hydrogen production and other gas technologies.
2003 was another year of low demand for new industrial gas facilities. This was particularly so in the developed
western economies and business opportunities were principally in the developing economies of the Far East.
The rapid pace of expansion in the Chinese steel and chemical industries is expected to offer further opportunities 
to BOC next year .
Water services In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation (EMC), a US water
services company with the intention of using a similar business model to that of PGS in developing additional business
with industrial customers.
EMC is a management company providing services for steam systems, cold and chilled water systems and
wastewater treatment. Customers include small to medium sized municipalities and industrial customers, many of
which are in the food manufacturing sector .
Turnover was on an increasing trend in 2003. Integration of the business was achieved smoothly but initial
integration costs made the business unprofitable in this first period under BOC ownership. Operating review (comparing 2003 with 2002) continued

Good business performances in most markets were offset by a disappointing result in the US. Market conditions
remained depressed in the US and in the UK but there was an overall improvement elsewhere. T rends were
particularly favourable in South Africa and in the south Pacific region during the first half of 2003 but the pace of
growth slowed later in the year as a result of exchange rate movements, which affected exporting industries.
BOC’s helium business continued to grow globally and so did the packaged chemicals business and the sales 
of medical gases. Margins improved in the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) markets as a result of more rapid selling
price adjustments to reflect changing input costs. In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the
output from a new helium extraction facility to be constructed in Qatar . Deliveries from this new source are
expected to begin in July 2005 and the location will assist in satisfying fast-growing demand in Asian markets.
Operating exceptional items in 2003 were for the completion of restructuring programmes, including those
that were part of the programme announced in August 2001 . Additionally , there were charges relating to the
integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
EuropeTurnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003 despite weak manufacturing activity in the key markets.
BOC has a strong market position in the mature UK manufacturing sector and achieved turnover growth by
extending the range of products and services offered to its customers. Growth of adjusted operating profit was 
also assisted by productivity improvements, control of costs and favourable price trends. Sales to the medical sector
increased because of service improvements and the introduction of new products – notably lightweight portable
cylinders for emergency applications. Sales of special gases including helium also increased and a new contract to
supply the needs of Oxford Magnet T echnology for medical imaging devices was announced during 2003. Sales of
Sureflow hospitality gases and equipment improved, as did sales of refrigerant gases.
Economic growth in Ireland slowed during 2003. Despite improved hospitality product sales, turnover was
almost unchanged and adjusted operating profit was marginally lower .
Increased turnover and adjusted operating profit in Poland were principally because of the addition of the
business of Praxair Polska that took effect from February 2003. The integration with BOC’s existing business in
Poland and the introduction of common business systems has proceeded smoothly . Price increases in Poland were
adequate to recover cost inflation during 2003.
North America In total, sales of gases in 2003 were similar to the previous year but sales of welding products were
depressed. Weak conditions in the manufacturing economy across north America coupled with costs related to the
implementation of a new business system in the US led to a sharp decline in adjusted operating profit.
Increased volumes of LPG and of special gases, including helium, together with modest price increases for most
products were sufficient to offset lower volumes of industrial gases leading to a marginal improvement in gases
turnover in the US.
Market conditions were also difficult in Canada but the acquisition of business from Air Products in Canada led
to a higher turnover and adjusted operating profit.
Latin America There was an improvement in both turnover and adjusted operating profit across the region. This was
generally based on trends that were favourable in terms of both volumes and selling prices.
Despite extended unrest and political uncertainly , there was a particularly strong performance in Venezuela.
BOC’s associated company based in Chile also achieved good growth. Business in Colombia was expanded during
2003 with the acquisition of an LPG business. T urnover from respiratory homecare products grew in Colombia,
where a local homecare company was acquired during the year , as well as in Chile, where an acquisition was made 
in the previous year .
Africa Turnover and adjusted operating profit again increased significantly in 2003, as manufacturing activity was
strong in South Africa. Although economic growth moderated later in the year as the rand strengthened, the
increased international investment in manufacturing in South Africa continued to provide a firm base for sales of gases
and welding products.
The mining industry also provided good business opportunities. There was a significant expansion of platinum
mining and ferro-chrome was also in strong demand. Production of the Afrox Res-Q-Pak was further increased in
2003 as demand for the product continued to accelerate. Several of the major mining companies are issuing this
device to their workforce to provide an emergency oxygen supply for those working underground.
Exports of Afrox welding products started the year well but growth was later curtailed by the strengthening 
of the rand, which began to reduce the competitive advantage. LPG sales increased and margins improved as a result
of lower input costs.
Results from other countries in Africa were somewhat mixed with good performances in Namibia and Kenya
offset by weakness in the Zambian copper industry . Overall, results were not significantly different in 2003. 37 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
JapanThe basis of accounting for BOC’s business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger . Full details can
be seen in the PGS section on page 34. On the respective bases used in each year , turnover and adjusted operating
profit for ISP in Japan were lower in 2003.
East Asia Turnover increased but adjusted operating profit was marginally lower in 2003, with the full year benefit of
acquisitions being reduced by the effect of industrial decline in the key market of Hong Kong and also by the increase
in business overheads to support the future development of business in the region.
Two acquisitions affected business performance comparisons in 2003. Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public
Company Limited (UGP) was acquired by BOC’s subsidiary in Thailand in May 2002 and BOC’s associated company
in Malaysia took full control of Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc (NIOI) in September 2002. The integration of NIOI
proceeded smoothly during 2003 and the business performed well. Although up on the previous year , results from
UGP were adversely affected by sharply competitive conditions in the ammonia business but LPG, which is the other
main product line for UGP , improved due to partial deregulation of end consumer prices.
While competition remained strong in industrial products, especially in Thailand and Malaysia, investments in
special products facilities enabled this more profitable business to be expanded. Facilities for breaking bulk and
repackaging refrigerant gases have already been installed in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Malaysia and a further
facility will be built in Thailand during 2004.
South Pacific Although economic growth was less rapid in 2003 than it was in 2002, both turnover and adjusted
operating profit improved. Increased turnover was largely a result of better prices rather than increased sales volume
and firm prices were coupled with effective cost controls.
Good progress was made in developing the safety products business in 2003 with significant new business from
major customers. The medical gas business also benefited from the introduction of new products. A web-based
customer portal was launched enabling customers to carry out transactions as well as to track and pay their accounts
over the Internet.
BOC’s joint venture company , Elgas, a leading supplier of LPG in the eastern part of Australia, enjoyed a 
record year . Sharp increases in costs before the Iraq war were successfully recovered by rapid adjustments to selling
prices. Although automobile gas is a minor part of the company’s turnover , sales may be affected in the longer term 
by the Australian government’s decision to remove the excise tax exemption for this application in the period 2008 
to 2012.
After difficult conditions in 2002, better results were obtained from Papua New Guinea and the other Pacific
islands during 2003.

Operating exceptional items in 2003 were for the completion of restructuring programmes, including those that
were part of the programme announced in August 2001 . Additionally , there were charges relating to the integration
of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
The semiconductor equipment downturn that affected most of 2002 continued throughout 2003. The second
half of 2002 had benefited from some improvement in activity but this proved transient and no such upturn was
repeated in 2003. Business was concentrated with those manufacturers with a specific investment strategy . This was
predominantly for upgrades and expansions of existing facilities rather than new plants. Demand for general vacuum
products from key customers in the chemicals, aerospace and automotive industries was also weaker in 2003.
Turnover and adjusted operating profit were therefore lower .
The impact of these adverse business conditions was lessened by rationalising manufacturing facilities and by
careful control of costs. Industrial vacuum and pressure products manufacturing in Philadelphia, Bolton and the 
Czech Republic was rationalised. Also in 2003, the size of a facility in Massachusetts was reduced to suit the lower
volume of business available.
The pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging business suffered from delayed investment by pharmaceutical
manufacturers during 2003 but order intake has since improved.
Semiconductor gases turnover was essentially unchanged in 2003 as a whole, despite an improving trend in the
second half. Additional volumes from new business were offset by pressure on prices as competition became more
severe during the second year of the downturn. The focus was therefore on retaining market share, winning new
business in Asia and on product development. Management believes that a major share of the bulk gas business has
been secured for the new semiconductor fabrication plants being built in China. Production of nitrogen trifluoride
has been increased and fluorine generators remain under evaluation by leading semiconductor manufacturers.
The basis of accounting for BOC’s business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger . Full details can

38 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
Vacuum equipment volumes worldwide were slightly better in 2003 and much of the increase was derived from
products for flat panel display manufacture. Management believes that BOC Edwards has achieved a leading share 
of this fast-growing market – particularly in T aiwan and Korea. However , these pumps currently earn lower margins
than semiconductor pumping systems. Although semiconductor equipment demand was weak in 2003, improved
products were developed to strengthen BOC Edwards’position in vacuum technology . These included single axis 
on-tool semiconductor pumps and a range of small dry pumps for the growing scientific equipment market.
The Kachina process tool component cleaning service grew in 2003 but the chemical management business
suffered from the small number of new semiconductor plants being built. Cost levels were reduced to improve
financial performance.
Contracts were won in Asia and Europe furthering a strategy to expand the range of value-added services 
to electronic manufacturers. These include gases management, chemicals supply , support services and materials
logistics. Other developments included an improved offering of gases and vacuum systems for lithography and
supercritical carbon dioxide cleaning technology .

Although hospital occupancy rates increased only marginally , turnover and adjusted operating profit both increased
significantly . This resulted from some minor acquisitions, positive price trends and a reduction in overhead costs.
New facilities continued to be added to existing hospitals in order to widen the range of available services.
There was a significant change in the reimbursement system during 2003 and the trend is expected to continue
in 2004. Insurance companies had previously paid private health care providers such as Afrox hospitals a fee for their
services but this is changing to a risk reimbursement system. A fixed payment is made for each kind of procedure
thus transferring some financial risk to the provider if complications arise.
Although acute care hospitals continued to make up the great majority of both turnover and adjusted operating
profit, there were better results from the Lifecare chronic care business, from occupational health services and from the
Direct Medicines pharmacy services business following restructuring to address more competitive market conditions.
In July 2003 African Oxygen Limited (Afrox) announced that it was in the process of considering its strategic
options with regard to its shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited. On 17 November 2003, Afrox announced 
that it had agreed to sell its entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium of Black Economic
Empowerment investors. The sale remains subject to certain conditions including clearance from the relevant
competition and other regulatory authorities.

Improved turnover reflects both new contracts and increased volumes with existing customers. The increase in
adjusted operating profit is not only as a result of higher turnover but also because of a gain of some £4.1 million
arising principally from the termination of operations for the Marks & Spencer General Merchandise business.
Gist continues to operate all of Marks & Spencer’s chilled and ambient food distribution and services and
remains its largest supply chain provider .
In 2003, a contract with Carlsberg-T etley , a leading brewer , was expanded to manage the entire primary
transport distribution business. A contract to manage the international inbound supply chain was also secured 
with New Look, the UK high street fashion retailer . 39 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
Group
Turnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was £4,017.9 million in 2002, down three 
per cent compared with £4,159.2 million in 2001 . Operating profit was £425.6 million, up one per cent compared
with £422.3 million in 2001 . After charging operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling £94.7 million and 
net interest and other financing items of £70.1 million, profit before tax was £335.3 million, down seven per cent
compared with £362.2 million in 2001 . Earnings per share were 41 .4p, down ten per cent compared with 46.0p 
in 2001 . Excluding the exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was £500.1 million, adjusted profit
before tax was £430.0 million and adjusted earnings per share were 55.9p.
Y ear ago comparisons are adversely affected by exchange rate movements, mainly for the South African rand
and, in the closing months of the year , for the US dollar . If the results of a year ago had been translated at the rates
applied to this year , turnover would have been reduced by £214.1 million. The corresponding reductions in operating
profit and adjusted operating profit would have been £25.1 million and £27.6 million respectively . Adjusted profit
before tax would have been £22.7 million less and adjusted earnings per share would have been reduced by 1 .7p.

Exceptional items in 2002 included restructuring charges of £47.2 million and a £21 .3 million charge relating to the
closure of facilities in connection with the combination of BOC Process Plants with Linde Engineering in the US.
An exceptional charge of £21 .2 million was made to write down the value of OSK, BOC’s gases business in Japan,
in advance of the then proposed merger of OSK with part of Air Liquide Japan.
Exceptional items in 2001 included restructuring charges of £35.8 million, a charge of £24.5 million for the
write-down and impairment of assets, a charge of £21 .0 million for the write-down of unproductive assets identified
for disposal and a charge of £16.7 million for a prior period amendment to pension plan benefits.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2002 was 12.3 per cent, after six successive
quarters of improvement. Return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2002 was 10.5 per cent.
Free cash flow (after interest, tax, dividends and capital spending but before acquisitions) remained positive and was
£166.5 million in 2002. Net cash outflow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including
exceptional cash items, was £120.3 million in 2002. A reconciliation of these measures is shown on page 32.
A first interim dividend for 2002 of 15.5p per share was paid in February 2002 and a second interim dividend of
22.5p per share was paid in August 2002. In aggregate this was a 2.7 per cent increase over the annual dividend of the
previous year .
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries (including interest capitalised) was £354.3 million in 2002, compared with
£352.6 million in 2001 . Capital expenditure by joint ventures and associates was £74.2 million in 2002, of which the
BOC share was £34.5 million. Equivalent expenditure in 2001 was £109.7 million, of which the BOC share was
£53.3 million. The Group also made acquisitions of businesses of £207.3 million in 2002 and proceeds from disposals
were £10.6 million. Equivalent items in 2001 were £145.9 million and £2.7 million respectively .

In addition to the revenues added by new plants coming into production and firm pricing trends, operational
efficiency gains were a key factor behind the adjusted operating profit increase. T owards the end of 2002, cost 
savings were realised from the closure of facilities in connection with the combination of BOC’s Process Plants
business with Linde Engineering in the US. Costs were also reduced as a result of better delivery scheduling and
remote plant operation. Operational service centres were already established in the UK, the US and Australia.
Management then believed that a further 70 plants could benefit from remote operation during the next 18 months
and new links were being established to bring Asian plants into the network.
Operating review (comparing 2002 with 2001) Operating review (comparing 2002 with 2001) continued
40 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
New plants were commissioned for OneSteel at Whyalla in South Australia in November 2001 , a hydrogen plant 
for Huntsman on T eesside in the UK during January 2002, an air separation unit for WCI Steel in Ohio in May 2002
and another at Midland, North Carolina in June 2002. These further strengthened BOC’s established base in the
metals sector and highlighted a growing commitment to the chemicals and oil sectors.
Economic uncertainties reduced the number of investment projects receiving authorisation from customers 
in 2002. However , despite the somewhat dull market conditions BOC Process Systems was able to win new
business by offering integrated solutions that added value for process industry customers.
Operating exceptional items in 2002 were mainly for the write-down of assets in the OSK business in Japan based
on valuations ahead of the merger with Air Liquide and further restructuring costs as part of the programme announced
in August 2001 . Operating exceptional items in 2001 related to the business initiative programme announced in August
2001 with the objective of releasing cash tied up in unproductive assets and improving cash generation.
Europe Turnover increased in the UK but adjusted operating profit was marginally lower despite success in reducing
overhead costs. The increase in turnover was due to additional sales from the plant commissioned in January 2002 
to supply hydrogen to Huntsman’s chemical plant on T eesside but this was offset by the effect of weak manufacturing
output in the UK. This affected sales volumes and prices in most sectors as some customers closed plants in the UK
and moved production to lower cost areas. Adjusted operating profit was also depressed by a temporary shutdown
of a customer’s steel furnace, leading to less efficient operation of BOC’s air separation plant in south Wales.
Another steel customer went into receivership towards the end of 2002 and a provision of £3.6 million was made 
for a bad debt and to write down the value of BOC’s plant supplying a facility that has closed.
In July BOC acquired pipeline assets serving customers on the T eesside chemical complex. This gave BOC 
more direct contact with its customers in this important area.
Although turnover in Ireland was similar to the previous year , adjusted operating profit increased as a result 
of success in reducing costs. Adjusted operating profit also increased in Poland for the same reason and because a
bad debt provision depressed adjusted operating profit in 2001 .
North America Overall turnover increased slightly but growth was restrained by generally weak economic
conditions in the US and by lower power and fuel costs leading to the reduction or elimination of surcharges.
Some increases in tonnage volumes arising from the recovery of steel output in the US and increased sales of 
carbon dioxide to the food and beverage sector were offset by generally lower demand for liquefied gases in the
merchant market.
Adjusted operating profit grew faster than sales as a result of firmer prices and cost savings, which more than
made up for some bad debt provisions for customers in liquidation.
New plant and acquisitions that affected the comparison with a year ago included a replacement plant
commissioned in May 2002 to supply WCI Steel in Ohio, a plant commissioned in September 2002 at Midland,
North Carolina, and a plant supplying Vitrotex in T exas that started up in July 2002. Assets purchased from 
Messer increased BOC’s capacity to supply the growing market for carbon dioxide in the US.
Latin America Despite continuing political uncertainty , BOC’s business in Venezuela achieved significantly better
adjusted operating profit in 2002. Demand from the glass industry was strong and sales of both nitrogen and carbon
dioxide to the food and beverage sector also increased. More efficient plant operation coupled with control of
overhead costs made an important contribution to adjusted operating profit growth in 2002.
Adjusted operating profit in Colombia was also better as a result of improved operating efficiency coupled with
better activity in the steel industry . Indura, BOC’s associate based in Chile, also achieved a better adjusted operating
profit as a result of new business in both Chile and in Argentina. Selling price increases that exceeded inflation also
made an important contribution to adjusted operating profit growth in Chile.
BOC’s associated company in Mexico supplying a Pemex company with high-pressure nitrogen continued to
demonstrate the value of re-pressurisation to enhance oil recovery . A number of equipment problems that emerged
after commissioning were investigated and corrective action was taken in 2002. This had no significant impact on the
adjusted operating profit for the year . BOC increased its share of the company from 30 per cent to 35 per cent in
early 2002.
Africa Buoyant conditions in the South African manufacturing economy made it possible to achieve a significant
increase in turnover . T ogether with strict cost controls, this drove a still greater increase in adjusted operating profit.
Demand from steel industry customers was high and sales to other sectors were expanded. New business was
obtained in the pulp and paper sector and an oxygen plant was commissioned to satisfy a supply scheme contract.
Price increases were sufficient to offset inflation in 2002.
Japan Turnover and adjusted operating profit were lower in 2002, reflecting continued weakness in the Japanese
economy , which affected both gas equipment sales and demand for liquefied gases. The impact on adjusted operating
profit was limited by operational cost savings. During 2002 BOC’s under -utilised air separation unit at Himeji was
closed and BOC began to supply its customers by purchasing products from another gas producer . Despite the weak
economic conditions, three new on-site generators were commissioned in 2002 and a further one is due to be
completed in 2003. 41 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
North Asia Growth of sales revenues in Korea was limited by weak economic conditions but adjusted operating
profit was significantly better as a result of operational and overhead cost savings and improved plant efficiency .
Rapid economic growth attracted exceptionally high levels of foreign direct investment into China during 2002.
A number of manufacturers began to expand in China at the expense of existing production in other parts of the
world. This was accompanied by heavy expenditure on local infrastructure and these factors combined to create a
particularly favourable environment for BOC’s business in China. T urnover increased significantly and adjusted
operating profit nearly doubled. Existing joint ventures performed strongly – partly in response to rising steel
production, which boosted the performance of BOC’s venture supplying the T aiyuan Iron and Steel Company in
north China. At the same time BOC took the opportunity to withdraw from underperforming joint ventures and
succeeded in improving the performance of others. New liquefaction capacity was added to supply the growing
merchant market in south China.
In April 2002, BOC established a joint venture in Nanjing with Y angtze Petrochemical Corporation (YPC),
which is a subsidiary of Sinopec, China’s leading petrochemical company . BOC purchased existing air separation
assets with effect from May 2002 and committed to installing a new air separation plant. This gave BOC a strategic
position as a key supplier in the Nanjing area, which is being developed through foreign investment as a leading centre
for chemical production in China. BOC’s joint venture is to supply industrial gases to a new BASF and YPC joint
venture plant now under construction and scheduled to begin production in 2004. In order to take advantage 
of the new business opportunities presented by the rapid growth of investment in China, BOC Process Systems
designated China as a new and separate marketing zone during 2002.
T aiwan was one of the main regions to be affected by the diversion of investment into mainland China during 2002.
Manufacturing growth was weak, leading to a more competitive environment in the gases business and some pressure
on prices. In response to these structural changes in the T aiwanese economy , a cost reduction programme was initiated
during 2002. Activity related to the electronics industry increased somewhat during the second half of 2002.
Business conditions in Hong Kong remained weak in 2002 as some customers also prepared to relocate
production to lower cost areas.
South East Asia Economic growth in the region was led by Thailand, supported by somewhat slower growth in
Malaysia. Singapore suffered from the slowdown in the electronics sector during 2002. Economic conditions in the
Philippines and Indonesia remained difficult.
There was some improvement in demand from the steel sector and petrochemical activity remained stable.
Direct foreign investment, which had supported growth previously , was diminished as more new investment was
directed towards north Asia.
Improved turnover and adjusted operating profit were driven mainly by increased merchant sales in Thailand –
particularly in the food sector . During 2002 BOC was able to supply its customers with food freezing equipment
constructed to BOC standards by a manufacturer in Thailand.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide (HyCO) plant was under construction at Map T a Phut in Thailand.
BOC’s associated company in Malaysia acquired Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc (NIOI) during 2002.
The acquisition began with the purchase of 35.6 per cent of the company in March 2002. Following a tender offer ,
100 per cent ownership was achieved in September 2002. NIOI has significant business in the glass sector .
BOC’s associated company in Singapore acquired part of Messer’s merchant industrial gases business there in late
September 2002.
South Asia BOC’s line of business structure was not then fully implemented in this region. The following commentary
therefore applies to both the Process Gas Solutions business and to the smaller element of Industrial and Special
Products business in the region.
During 2002, concerns about security and political stability continued to limit foreign direct investment.
Business opportunities were therefore limited to those generated by the local economies.
In India, asset disposals contributed towards a sharp increase in adjusted operating profit but there was also a
significant improvement in underlying sales and adjusted operating profit. A new supply scheme to provide industrial
gases to T ata Iron and Steel was won and the new plant was constructed in 2003.
Sales and adjusted operating profits also increased in Bangladesh and Pakistan. New carbon dioxide capacity was
added in 2003 to satisfy growing demand from the beverage industry in Pakistan.
South Pacific Recent investments in new plants were reflected in higher sales. The plant commissioned to supply BP
at Brisbane came into production during 2001 and contributed for a full year in 2002. A plant to supply OneSteel at
Whyalla in South Australia began production early in 2002. Increased customer demand following a process change
resulted in increased sales from the plant at Port Kembla that came into production during 1999. Demand for carbon
dioxide used in the food and beverage industries grew and increased awareness of food safety issues placed
additional emphasis on product quality . Plant investments made during 2001 provided additional product supply
security in 2002.
Adjusted operating profit increased significantly faster than sales as a result of improved operating efficiency and
control of overhead costs. Plant reliability was increased and 12 of the key production plants in Australia became
controlled from a central operations centre. In South Australia, production from the new plant at Whyalla
commissioned in November 2001 allowed savings to be achieved through the closure of an older and less efficient
plant at Adelaide. Price increases in the merchant markets for liquefied gases were generally slightly below inflation
but the shortfall was more than offset by operational efficiencies and overhead cost reductions. Operating review (comparing 2002 with 2001) continued
42 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
Process Plants In March 2002, BOC reached a master agreement to combine its Process Plants business with 
Linde Engineering in the US to form a new company , Linde BOC Process Plants LLC, based in T ulsa, Oklahoma.
The transaction was completed at the end of September 2002 and makes Linde Engineering the principal supplier 
of BOC’s industrial gas plants worldwide with access to Linde’s global technical capabilities in air separation, hydrogen
production and other gas technologies.
Spending on new air separation plants remained generally depressed in 2002 but the new arrangement with
Linde allowed a significant reduction of unrecovered costs in the second half of the year as the agreement was
implemented. Costs were also reduced by the closure of BOC Process Plants’UK manufacturing facility at Edmonton
in north London.
BOC’s Cryostar turbine and compressor business based in France produced significantly better adjusted
operating profit in 2002 following diversification to reduce its former dependence on investments in new air separation
projects. Sales of equipment to process liquefied natural gas (LNG) on board tankers were significantly increased.

Weak manufacturing activity in the key markets of the US and the UK affected sales of industrial products but there
was growth in both South Africa and in the south Pacific region. Sales of special products, medical gases as well as
hospitality products and services increased in all markets. Margins improved mainly as a result of increased
productivity following restructuring.
Operating exceptional items in 2002 were mainly for the write-down of assets in the OSK business in Japan
based on valuations ahead of the merger with Air Liquide and further restructuring costs as part of the programme
announced in August 2001 . Operating exceptional items in 2001 related to the business initiative programme
announced in August 2001 with the objective of releasing cash tied up in unproductive assets and improving 
cash generation.
Europe A modest improvement in UK turnover was matched by a similar increase in adjusted operating profit.
Sales of industrial products declined in line with falling manufacturing output but this was offset by increased sales 
of special and medical gases and the growth of BOC’s Sureflow hospitality gases and cellar service business.
A lightweight medical oxygen cylinder with integral regulator has proved popular for portable applications such 
as in the emergency services. A new arrangement has been made with an equipment wholesaler to improve sales 
of refrigerant gases to the contractor market and a refrigerant filling plant in the UK is being extended to include
additional production and storage capacity .
Sales and adjusted operating profit also increased in Ireland and BOC’s commercial systems accommodated the
change to the new euro currency without problems.
Although ISP was a minor part of BOC’s business in Poland during 2002, there was a significant improvement in
sales and adjusted operating profit. In September BOC announced that it had agreed to acquire Praxair’s industrial
gases business in Poland. This transaction then remained subject to approval by the competition authority in Poland.
This approval was subsequently granted in 2003.
North America Turnover increased only slightly as the trend in overall sales volumes was essentially flat and price
increases for most products were modest. Weakness in the manufacturing sector was reflected in lower sales of
welding and cutting equipment and consumable products in particular . In such conditions and with the initial financial
impact of installing a new enterprise resource and planning system during the year , adjusted operating profit in north
America decreased despite successful cost reduction programmes.
Helium prices were an exception to the generally slow trend and continued to rise more rapidly as higher input
costs were recovered in selling prices. BOC invested in new purification and liquefaction capacity in the US during
2002 to support its worldwide helium business.
During the year a new plant was opened to supply special gases to customers on the Gulf coast and a range of gas
apparatus was launched under the Airco brand name. These products were sold through distributors during 2003.
During 2002, BOC continued its roll-out of a medical gas cylinder with an integrated regulator .
Although economic conditions in Canada were similar to those in the US, there was a greater increase in sales.
Two acquisitions, T echnogas and Matheson Gas Products Canada Inc, were successfully integrated with the existing
business in Canada in 2002. The Matheson acquisition added important special products capability to BOC’s product
range in Canada. Latin America Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased significantly in each of the key markets. While export-
related heavy industry prospered, general manufacturing remained weak in V enezuela but growth was driven by
increased sales of special products and carbon dioxide. While sales of special products, including refrigerants and
ammonia, also increased in Colombia, the main source of growth was the medical gas and home health care markets
in an otherwise difficult industrial economy .
Indura, BOC’s associated company based in Chile, benefited from a stable political environment that served to
insulate the Chilean economy from heavy devaluations in neighbouring Argentina and Brazil. This led to a firm pricing
environment that allowed the benefits of cost controls to be realised.
Africa Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased significantly in 2002 as a result of a sustained resurgence in
South African manufacturing. This was reflected in the growth of sales volumes in the core cutting and welding
business for the first time in five years. New business in packaged chemicals and other special gases further increased
the growth of turnover as new propellants and refrigerants were added to the product range. Adjusted operating
profit also increased significantly despite making additional provisions for bad debts.
Sales volumes of liquefied petroleum gas grew slowly but higher input costs were successfully recovered in 
selling prices. Hospitality products and services, and medical gases were also less important sources of sales growth 
in 2002. However , a recently introduced rescue pack providing a portable oxygen supply for mineworkers continued
to generate strong demand, which exceeded production capacity .
Exports of cutting and welding equipment from South Africa principally to other African countries increased
strongly in 2002.
Japan During 2002 difficult economic conditions were reflected in essentially unchanged turnover and a decline in
adjusted operating profit. This was despite good growth in gases for applications in lasers, medical gases and
measurement equipment.
East Asia Turnover and adjusted operating profit both increased but mainly as a result of acquisitions. Economic growth
in T aiwan and Singapore was curtailed by their dependence on various aspects of electronics manufacturing, which
remained depressed in 2002, particularly during the first half. W eak demand also restrained price increases, which
were generally below the level of inflation.
The chief source of turnover and adjusted operating profit growth in the region during 2002 was the acquisition
of Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited (UGP) in Thailand in May . UGP is a leading supplier 
of liquefied petroleum gas and packaged ammonia.
BOC’s associated company in Malaysia acquired 35.6 per cent of the gases company Nissan Industrial 
Oxygen Inc in March 2002 and, following a tender offer , the holding was increased to 100 per cent in 
September 2002 providing a wider platform for growth in 2003.
South Pacific Strong economic and manufacturing growth supported increased sales and adjusted operating profit in
the key markets of Australia and New Zealand. The underlying growth of adjusted operating profit was ahead of the
sales increase. Civil turmoil and political uncertainty curtailed growth in the Pacific islands.
Increased manufacturing activity particularly in Australia but also in New Zealand supported growth in every
part of BOC’s business. Mining, manufacturing for export and infrastructure projects were particularly strong sectors.
Prices remained firm and overhead cost reduction, coupled with rationalisation of the supply chain for welding and
safety products, helped to widen margins.
The sales and adjusted operating profit of BOC’s associated company , Elgas, which supplies liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) in south-eastern Australia, increased sharply . Imported LPG prices remained stable and a relatively cold
winter encouraged sales in the home energy sector . The use of LPG as a vehicle fuel declined.

Despite the reduction in adjusted operating profit for the year , BOC Edwards remained profitable in each quarter
and was strongly cash generative during 2002.
Operating exceptional items in 2002 were mainly for the write-down of assets in the OSK business in Japan
based on valuations ahead of the merger with Air Liquide and further restructuring costs as part of the programme
announced in August 2001 . Operating exceptional items in 2001 related to the business initiative programme
announced in August 2001 with the objective of releasing cash tied up in unproductive assets and improving 
cash generation.
The severe reduction in capital expenditure by semiconductor manufacturers that began in the second half of
2001 continued into 2002. Although there was some revival of demand for semiconductor equipment in the second
half of 2002, the rate of order intake declined at the end of the year .
43 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Those Asian markets that were the basis of the mid-year revival did not sustain the earlier investment trends but
opportunities were presented by a number of customers investing in China. In August 2002 BOC formed a joint
venture with Lienhwa Corporation of T aiwan to help to take advantage of new business opportunities presented by
T aiwanese electronics companies investing in China. The venture combined the marketing capabilities of Lienhwa
with BOC’s existing resources in China. It delivered three new gas supply contracts to supply semiconductor
fabrication plants, including those under construction by Belling and HJT in the Shanghai area. BOC Edwards also
won an order to supply a new plant in Singapore.
Apart from the semiconductor industry , some other vacuum equipment markets such as aerospace and
chemicals also became more difficult in 2002. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets remained buoyant 
and BOC Edwards was notably successful in increasing sales of pharmaceutical drying and packaging systems.
Gases sales were also affected by weak conditions in the semiconductor industry worldwide, which led to
reduced plant utilisation and closures by some customers. The overall profit impact of lost revenue on adjusted
operating profit was offset by increased productivity . In 2002 a programme to rationalise production facilities for
electronic materials was completed. This involved the closure of electronic gases facilities at some sites, including
Immingham in the UK and part of the facility at Research T riangle Park in North Carolina, in order to concentrate
global production into fewer locations.
The capacity to produce nitrogen trifluoride at BOC’s plant in South Africa was increased during 2002 to reach
50 tonnes a year . This product, which is used for cleaning semiconductor process tool chambers, is undergoing
qualification trials with major customers. It will be possible to raise output further if it is justified by demand.
The pause in semiconductor capacity expansion did not prevent a drive by manufacturers to invest in projects
designed to reduce unit costs. T ypically this included outsourcing of major sub-systems, materials and services.
BOC Edwards participated in this movement through the development of several important new products, through
its close relationships with original equipment manufacturers and by acquisitions in new business areas. During 2002
the Kachina process tool component cleaning business was expanded by opening new facilities to service customers
in the US (Oregon), France and China.
In 2002 BOC Edwards acquired the industrial vacuum and pressure businesses of the Smiths Group.
This acquisition expanded BOC Edwards’existing general vacuum product range into new markets and added new
high volume pumping technology to the portfolio. T ypical customers are in the metallurgy , water treatment, food,
power and chemical industries. The integration of the business was completed smoothly and it was operating
profitably by the end of the year .
The most significant acquisition was of Seiko Instruments’turbomolecular pumps business based in Japan, which
was completed in March 2002. Management believes that the addition of Seiko turbomolecular pumps to the BOC
Edwards range of products should enhance the opportunity to develop vacuum sub-systems to satisfy the growing
trend towards on-tool pumping.
The acquisitions of Hydromatix and Semco were also completed in January and April 2002 respectively 
with the intention of positioning BOC Edwards in those market segments that are expected to grow most rapidly .
These companies now form part of BOC Edwards’Chemical Management Division.
Hydromatix is based in the US and helps companies in the surface finishing industry to recycle rinse waters with
a minimum amount of waste, allowing them to cut discharges. Customers are involved in plating, printed circuit
boards and galvanising, as well as higher -technology fields such as disc and semiconductor production.
Semco designs and manufactures high efficiency , process-critical, liquid chemical blend, delivery and collection
systems used in rapidly growing wet deposition processes, such as copper plating, a common application in the
semiconductor manufacturing industry .

The acquisitions of the Amahosp and Wilgers hospital groups in the first half of 2002 added to turnover and more
significantly to adjusted operating profit as integration benefits were realised. The acquisitions added approximately
1,000 acute care beds to Afrox hospitals’existing capacity . Existing hospital facilities were also enhanced during 2002
through investment in new services such as renal dialysis, physical and mental rehabilitation, pathology and radiography .
Acute care hospitals accounted for the majority of both turnover and adjusted operating profit. The remainder
was made up of health care services including chronic care, occupational health and pharmacy services. During 2002
there was a downturn in the Afrox direct medicines business that facilitates the supply of chronic medication to
patients by post. This followed increased competition as health care funding organisations set up their own supply
mechanisms at the same time as limiting reimbursement for patients.
Turnover of nursing staff continued to be a problem in South Africa as trained nurses were lured overseas by
higher pay . Afrox responded by increasing spending on training activities to ensure that sufficient well-qualified staff
were available.

Despite competitive conditions in the logistics market, Gist achieved strong results with improved margins and 
some notable business wins. T urnover increased by 14 per cent to £264.8 million and adjusted operating profit rose
20 per cent to £25.5 million.
Operating supply chains for customers remained at the core of the business and improved adjusted operating
profit reflects both new contracts and increased volume with existing customers. Gist now handles all of Marks &
Spencer’s chilled and ambient food distribution and services as well as the entire warehouse and distribution
operations for Budgens, another major UK retailer .
E-business continued to grow steadily and offered a number of opportunities with commercial promise to 
order on-line products and services. Gist provided e-fulfilment warehousing operations for Ocado, an on-line
grocery shopping and home delivery company established in partnership with the Waitrose supermarket chain,
for Marks & Spencer’s ‘Lunch to Go’operation and for Blueheath, the on-line wholesaler .
With increasing emphasis on global supply chains, Gist’s experience, skills and systems capabilities were already
being used to manage complex international supply chains, such as managing supplies for BOC Edwards’global
manufacturing operations. Gist also provided stand-alone consulting services to a range of customers.
45 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Post balance sheet events
An action was filed against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the Plan) in the US. At the time of the
preliminary announcement of the Group’s results on 13 November 2003, no provision was made in respect of this
case, as at that time the outcome of the litigation was uncertain and the amount of any loss could not be reliably
estimated. Subsequently the parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle at US$69 million, subject 
to approval by the court at a fairness hearing. Under UK accounting principles (FRS17) this amount has been
recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account of the Group. It has been shown as an exceptional item.
The settlement will be paid out of Plan assets. Further information is given on page 50.
On 17 November 2003, the Group’s South African subsidiary company African Oxygen Limited announced
that it had agreed to sell its entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited. The sale remains subject to certain conditions,
including clearance from the relevant competition and other regulatory authorities.
Corporate transactions
Group expenditure on acquisitions of businesses was £135.5 million (2002:£207.3 million). The main acquisitions
during 2003 were Environmental Management Corporation, a privately held US water services company , Praxair’s
Polish gases business and the Canadian packaged gas and related welding equipment business of Air Products. During
2002 the main acquisitions were the turbomolecular pumps business of Seiko Instruments Inc, the vacuum and
pressure business of the Smiths Group and Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited in Thailand.
In September 2002 BOC completed the merger of its Process Plants operations with Linde Engineering in 
the US to form a new company , Linde BOC Process Plants LLC. The costs of £21 .3 million for closing BOC’s 
Process Plants business were charged as an exceptional item in 2002. In September 2002 BOC and Air Liquide
announced a conditional agreement to merge their industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan to form Japan 
Air Gases Limited. Valuations undertaken as part of the business combination resulted in an exceptional write down
of £21 .2 million in 2002. The combination took effect in January 2003 and BOC has accounted for its 45 per cent
share of Japan Air Gases Limited as a joint venture from that date.
Restructuring
Costs of restructuring programmes amounting to £23.8 million have been charged in 2003. This includes £5.0 million
related to the business initiative announced in August 2001 to divest some assets and to restructure and improve returns
in the businesses being retained. These programmes are now completed and have resulted in some 1 ,600 job losses.
Further restructuring opportunities identified resulted in an additional cost of £10.5 million charged this year and these
programmes are also completed. Management expects that savings from restructuring programmes will amount to
over £50 million a year . Costs of £8.3 million were also incurred relating to the integration of the BOC gases business 
and part of the Air Liquide business in Japan to form Japan Air Gases Limited.
In 2002 £47.2 million was charged for restructuring of which £34.4 million related to the business initiative
announced in August 2001 and £12.8 million related to further restructuring opportunities. Both of these
programmes continued into 2003 and were completed in 2003.

0 01 02 03 Financing 
The Group has access to a range of funding. Debt finance is raised by issuing bonds, commercial paper , other
obligations to investors and through borrowings from banks.
As well as medium and long-term borrowings, the Group maintains short-term borrowings, principally in the
form of commercial paper and bank borrowings. The Group maintains US$450 million (£271 million) of committed
multi-currency facilities with a group of relationship banks. These facilities mature in 2008 and provide back-up for the
issue of commercial paper as well as general liquidity for the Group. Additional committed facilities are maintained by
the principal operating units in the Group.
Overall, net debt increased by £42.5 million as a result of a net cash inflow of £6.3 million, a £3.7 million 
inflow from the issue of shares, an outflow of £31 .8 million for the impact of business acquisitions and disposals and 
£20.7 million for the effect of exchange rate movements. In 2002, net debt increased by £53.5 million as a result of a
net cash outflow of £120.3 million offset by £25.0 million inflow from the issue of shares and £41 .8 million for the effect 
of exchange rate and other movements. During the year , borrowings by the parent company increased reflecting the
company’s effort to centralise its longer term funding needs.
The gearing ratio (net debt including finance leases as a percentage of capital employed) was 36.9 per cent in
2003 compared with 36.9 per cent in 2002 and 32.0 per cent in 2001 . The decline in the value of pension fund assets
following the fall in world equity markets accounted for some three per cent of the increase in 2002. The 2003 year
end net debt/equity ratio was 71 .5 per cent, compared with 73.6 per cent in 2002 and 57.2 per cent in 2001 .
The Group has access to a diverse range of debt finance including commercial paper , public bonds and bank
borrowings which, it believes, will be available to meet long-term financing needs. The Group has sufficient facilities to
cover likely borrowing needs. Management anticipates that capital expenditure in 2004 will be at a slightly higher level
than in 2003 and will be covered by cash inflow from operating activities.
Management of financial risks 
The board of directors sets the treasury policies and objectives of the Group which include controls over the
procedures used to manage currency , interest rate and credit risk. The approach to managing risk is set out below.
This approach is expected to continue during the next financial year . On a day-to-day basis, Group treasury carries
out these policies, with regular review meetings with the Group finance director . Specific and significant activities need
approval from the finance committee, which includes any two directors of the company .
The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments nor does it enter into any leveraged
derivative transactions.
Currency risk The Group faces currency risk principally on its net assets, most of which are in currencies other than
sterling. Currency movements can therefore have a significant effect on the Group’s balance sheet when translating
these foreign currency assets into sterling. In order to reduce this effect the Group manages its borrowings, where
practicable and cost effective, to hedge its foreign currency assets.
Where possible, hedging is done using direct borrowings in the same currency as the assets being hedged or
through the use of other hedging methods such as currency swaps. Group borrowings are currently held in a wide
range of currencies and, after swaps, 81 per cent of net debt (2002:86 per cent) is denominated in the principal
currencies affecting the Group:US dollars, Australian dollars, Japanese yen, South African rand and sterling.
The aggregate of the notional principal values of currency swaps was £474.7 million (2002:£360.7 million) spread
over a range of currencies. The fair value of such swaps is included in note 21 b) i) to the financial statements.
The balance sheets of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange for the
year and any exchange difference is dealt with as a movement in reserves. This is explained more fully in the
accounting policy note on page 77. The profit and loss accounts of overseas businesses are translated at average rates
of exchange and this translation impact directly affects the profit and loss account of the Group.
The Group manages its currency flows to minimise currency transaction exchange risk and forward contracts are
used as appropriate to hedge net currency flows and selected individual transactions. The Group’s foreign exchange
cover is mainly managed in the UK, Australia, Japan and South Africa. The UK manages the cover for exposures on 
net trade flows of the Group’s companies in the US and certain other countries. The aggregate principal amount of
forward cover outstanding at 30 September 2003 amounted to £173.8 million (2002:£133.9 million).
47 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Interest rate risk At 30 September 2003, the Group’s net debt position after interest rate hedging activity included a
net exposure of £436.3 million (2002:£497.3 million) to floating interest rates. Based on the Group’s 2003 year end
level and composition of net debt, an increase in average interest rates of one per cent per annum would result in a
decrease in future earnings, before tax, of £4.4 million per annum (2002:£5.0 million).
In order to manage interest rate risk the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt. At 30 September
2003, there was a 32:68 ratio (2002:38:62) between floating and fixed rate net debt. Underlying borrowings are
arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses interest rate swaps to
vary this mix and to manage the Group’s interest rate exposure.
At 30 September 2003, the aggregate of the notional principal values of swap agreements which affect the
floating rate/fixed rate mix was £417.6 million (2002:£420.0 million). The fair value of such swaps is included in 
note 21 b) i) to the financial statements.
Foreign exchange risk At 30 September 2003, the Group had outstanding forward exchange contracts totalling 
£173.8 million (2002:£133.9 million) in respect of its actual and forecast transaction exposures. The fair value of
these contracts at 30 September 2003 amounted to a gain of £5.8 million (2002:a gain of £4.9 million). A ten per
cent appreciation of sterling would increase the fair value of these contracts by £13.7 million (2002:£7.4 million).
In addition to these forward contracts, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange movements on its net debt
position. At 30 September 2003 net debt, after currency swaps, comprised net sterling liabilities of £285.3 million
(2002:£345.2 million) and net currency liabilities of £1 ,082.8 million (2002:£980.4 million). Based on the Group’s
2003 year end level and composition of net debt, a ten per cent appreciation of sterling would result in a reduction in
the value of net currency liabilities of £90.5 million (2002:£89.1 million).
Counterparty risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from
counterparties. Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one
counterparty depending upon its credit rating and by regular reviews of these ratings. The possibility of material loss
arising in the event of non-performance by a counterparty is considered unlikely by management.
The currency and interest rate hedging profile of the Group’s borrowings at 30 September 2003 is shown in
note 21 to the financial statements. Further information on financial risk management is also given in note 21 to the
financial statements.
Interest on net debt
The net charge before the Group’s share of interest of joint ventures and associates was £75.8 million in 2003 
(2002:£78.6 million, 2001:£98.5 million), which, after excluding interest income from loans to joint ventures and
associates, represented 5.6 per cent of average net borrowings during the year . After taking into account capitalised
interest and the Group’s share of joint ventures and associates the net charge was £96.1 million. Adjusted interest
cover (the number of times that the interest charge on net debt is covered by adjusted operating profit) increased to
5.3 times (2002:4.9 times, 2001:4.3 times).
Net interest on pension financing items
The interest on pension scheme liabilities was £110.2 million in 2003 (2002:£106.1 million, 2001:£107.2 million).
The expected return on pension scheme assets was £119.6 million in 2003 (2002:£139.1 million,
2001:£166.9 million). The decline in the expected return on pension scheme assets reflects the fall in the value 
of world equity markets.
Debt maturity profile
The maturity profile of the Group’s gross borrowings is as follows:
2003 2002
£ million % £ million %
More than five years 521.8 36.1 549.5 36.4
Two to five years 416.4 28.8 390.6 25.8
One to two years 146.5 10.1 180.9 12.0
Within one year 360.9 25.0 390.1 25.8
T otal 1,445.6 100.0 1,511.1 100.0
A portion of the debt which matures within one year is commercial paper issued by various Group companies.
The Group maintains US$450 million (£271 million) of committed multi-currency facilities with a group of
relationship banks. These facilities mature in 2008 and provide back-up for the issue of commercial paper as well 
as general liquidity for the Group. Additional committed facilities are maintained by the principal operating units in
the Group.
Additional information on the Group’s gross borrowings can be found in note 20. Details of the Group’s share
of net debt of joint ventures and associates, the majority of which is non-recourse, are given in note 13 a).

Off-balance sheet arrangements
The Group has provided guarantees of £26.8 million to third parties at 30 September 2003. For further information on
guarantees see note 26 a). Other than disclosed, there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
likely to have a current or future material effect on the Group’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity , capital expenditures or capital resources.
Inflation
Over the last three years, inflation has not had a material impact on the revenue or profit of the Group.
T axation
The tax charge for 2003 of £96.4 million is calculated in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS19
(deferred tax), under which full provision is made for deferred taxes.
The effective tax rate on adjusted profit in 2003 was 29 per cent (2002:30 per cent, 2001:32.5 per cent).
The total tax rate was 27.4 per cent (2002:31 .7 per cent, 2001:28.9 per cent). The Group pays corporation tax in the
UK at a rate of 30 per cent.
The Group is currently liable to pay federal tax at the rate of 35 per cent in the US. This is reduced by 
the existence of tax credits. In the other principal subsidiaries, the tax rate is typically between 30 per cent and 
42 per cent.
Contingencies
The Group monitors all contingent liabilities including matters relating to litigation and the environment via a process 
of consultation and evaluation which includes senior management, internal and external legal advisers and internal and
external technical advisers. This process results in conclusions with respect to potential exposure and provisions are
made or adjusted accordingly . Management believes that the Group has adequately provided for contingencies which
are likely to become payable in the future.
Legal proceedings
Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings, including some in which claims for damages in large
amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors
believe that such litigation should be disposed of without material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition 
or profitability .
W elding fumes litigation BOC has been named in numerous lawsuits in the US alleging injury from exposure 
to welding fumes. Many of these cases were filed during 2003. Certain of these cases have been either filed in,
or transferred for pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where a multi-
district litigation (MDL) proceeding has been commenced. The MDL proceeding is still at an early stage. The MDL
proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial proceedings in cases pending in different federal district courts 
in the US. In addition to the cases in federal court, BOC is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in 
state courts. These cases are in different stages of procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for 
trial from time to time.
From the time it purchased Airco in 1978 until this year BOC had never had an adverse jury verdict returned
against it in a case alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes. On 28 October 2003, a jury in Madison County ,
Illinois, rendered a verdict against BOC and two co-defendants. The jury awarded US$1 million to Mr Elam, a former
labourer who asserted that his idiopathic Parkinson’s disease was attributable to his exposure to welding fumes over
a period of years. BOC believes that the verdict is inconsistent with the decisions rendered by juries in previous cases,
is not supported by the existing scientific evidence and intends to pursue vigorously its post-trial and appeal rights.
BOC believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in these various proceedings related to alleged
injury from exposure to welding fumes and intends to defend vigorously such claims. Based on BOC’s experience to
date, together with BOC’s current assessment of the merits of the claims being asserted, and applicable insurance,
BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on
its financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made.

0 01 02 03 Fluorogas litigation In February 2003, the company was notified that a jury verdict in the US District Court for 
the W estern District of T exas was obtained for US$132 million against Fluorogas Limited, The BOC Group Inc and 
The BOC Group plc. The verdict arises primarily out of an alleged breach of a memorandum of understanding by
Fluorogas Limited before it was acquired by The BOC Group plc in September 2001 . In March 2003, the court also
awarded interest and costs against the defendants, making them jointly and severally liable for a total of US$174 million.
A bond for the full amount has been posted with the Court as part of the normal appeals process.
The company believes that the jury’s verdict reflects a misunderstanding of the law and does not reflect the 
facts of any loss that may have been suffered by the plaintiff. The company is challenging the verdict through the
appropriate appeals process in the US and hence no provision has been made. In addition, Fluorogas Limited was
placed in administration under the Insolvency Act of 1986 pursuant to an order of the English Courts. In a related
proceeding in a US Bankruptcy Court, the UK administrators have obtained injunctive relief preventing the plaintiff in
the Fluorogas litigation from commencing or continuing any action or proceeding enforcing any judgement against
Fluorogas Limited in the US.
ERISA litigation An action was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois against The BOC
Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the Plan). The plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and all
others similarly affected, alleging that the Plan improperly calculated lump sum distributions from the Plan in 
violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The maximum potential liability could have reached
US$116 million and any award would be paid out of Plan assets.
The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle at US$69 million. The settlement documents are
being prepared. The settlement is subject to approval by the court at a fairness hearing. A provision of US$69 million
has been made in the financial statements. Under UK accounting principles (FRS17), this has been recognised as a
charge in the profit and loss account of the Group. It has been shown as an exceptional item.
Insurance
Operational management is responsible for managing business risks. Several Group departments advise
management on different aspects of risk and monitor results. Insurance cover is held against major catastrophes.
For any such event, the Group will bear an initial cost before external cover begins.
Critical accounting policies
The principal accounting policies affecting the results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 77 
and 78 of the financial statements. The application of certain of these policies requires assumptions or subjective
judgements by management. Management bases these on a combination of past experience and any other evidence
that is relevant to the particular circumstances.
The application of these assumptions and judgements affects the reported amounts of profit during the year and
the assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using these
assumptions and judgements. Management believes that the following are the critical policies where the assumptions
and judgements made could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
T angible fixed assets A significant part of the capital employed of the Group, particularly in the Process Gas Solutions
and Industrial and Special Products lines of business, is invested in tangible fixed assets. The nature of the business
demands significant capital investment to renew or increase production capacity or to enable the business to achieve
greater productivity and efficiency .
It is the Group’s policy to depreciate tangible fixed assets, except land, on a straight line basis over the effective
lives of the assets. This ensures that there is an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the capital costs of
production and delivery of goods and services. A key element of this policy is the estimate of the effective life applied
to each category of fixed assets which, in turn, determines the annual depreciation charge. In deciding the
appropriate lives to be applied, management takes into account various factors including, among other things, the
accumulated experience of the effective asset lives from historic business operations and an assessment of the likely
impact of any changes in technology .
While Group earnings in any period would fluctuate if different asset lives were applied, in some cases the
original estimated life of an asset is closely related to contractual arrangements with large customers. Some of the
earnings impact of choosing a different asset life would be mitigated, as the different life may reflect different
contractual arrangements with such customers. Nevertheless, variations in the effective lives could impact the
earnings of the business through an increase or decrease in the depreciation charge. It is estimated that a change 
of one year in the effective life of all plant, machinery , vehicles and cylinders would have an impact of between 
£15 million and £20 million on annual Group operating profit. A change in the effective life of buildings would have
only a negligible impact.
Intangible fixed assets In a similar manner to tangible fixed assets, management uses its judgement to determine the
extent to which goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business has a value that will benefit the performance of the
Group over future periods. It is the Group’s policy to amortise goodwill on a straight line basis over its useful
economic life. This takes into account, among other things, the maturity of the business acquired and its product and
customer base. Any change in these assumptions would have an impact on the earnings of the Group.
It is estimated that a change of one year in the useful economic life of all goodwill would have an impact of
approximately £1 million on annual Group operating profit.
Financial review continued
50 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Retirement benefits Results of the Group include costs relating to the provision of retirement benefits for
employees. It is the directors’responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs
of meeting such future obligations. The assumptions are based on actual historical experience and are set after
consultation with the Group’s actuaries. They include the assumptions used for regular service costs and for the
financing elements related to the pension schemes’assets and liabilities. Whilst management believes that the
assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect both the operating profit and net
interest cost of the Group.
There are a number of elements used in the assumptions. These vary for the different countries in which the
Group operates, and there may also be an inter -dependency between some of the assumptions. As a result, it would
be impractical and potentially misleading to give any approximate impact on annual Group operating profit of a
change in any one assumption in isolation.
Environmental provisions In certain parts of the business, mainly in the US, the Group has obligations to carry out
environmental clean-ups at former and current production sites. Many of these obligations will not arise for a number
of years, and the costs are difficult to predict accurately . Management uses its judgement and experience to provide
an appropriate amount for the likely cost of such clean-ups, and the amounts, if material, are discounted to present
values. Both the amount of anticipated costs, and the interest rates used to discount such costs, are subjective.
The use of different assumptions would impact the earnings of the Group.
It is estimated that a change of one per cent in the interest rate used to discount such costs would have an
impact of approximately £1 million on annual Group profit before tax.
Current asset provisions In the course of normal trading activities, management uses its judgement in establishing
the net realisable value of various elements of working capital – principally stocks, work-in-progress and accounts
receivable. Provisions are established for obsolete or slow moving stocks, bad or doubtful debts and product
warranties. Actual costs in future periods may be different from the provisions established and any such differences
would affect future earnings of the Group.
The provisions are established at levels appropriate to the circumstances within individual Group business units,
and not on a Group-wide systematic basis. It is therefore considered that any estimate of the impact on annual Group
operating profit of any change in such provisions may not be meaningful. Nevertheless, a change of ten per cent in
the level of provision for bad and doubtful debts at 30 September 2003 would have an impact of approximately 
£3 million on annual Group operating profit.
The critical accounting policies under UK GAAP do not materially differ from those under US GAAP . Further details
of the differences between UK and US GAAP are given in note 30 to the financial statements.
Accounting
The Group’s accounting policies are based on accounting policies generally accepted in the UK (UK GAAP). No new
UK GAAP accounting standards have been issued or have come into force since 30 September 2002. The accounts
for the year to 30 September 2003 have therefore been prepared on an accounting basis consistent with that applied
in the financial year ended 30 September 2002.
The report and accounts also continues to include US reporting requirements. This enables the Group to meet
the reporting obligations for a foreign private issuer as required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
The report on remuneration follows the disclosure requirements of the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules and
the UK Companies Act 1985. Where appropriate, in order to improve clarity , voluntary disclosures are also given.
As a global business the Group supports initiatives to harmonise accounting standards. The Group is preparing
for the move to report under International Financial Reporting Standards in line with the timetable set out in 
European Union legislation. The first annual report and accounts to which this will apply will be for the year ended 
30 September 2006.
The Group plays an active part in accounting developments by responding to new proposals and by appropriate
representation.
US GAAP
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP , which differs in certain
respects from US GAAP .
The US accounting information in note 30 to the financial statements gives a summary of the principal
differences between the amounts determined in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies (based on 
UK GAAP) and amounts determined in accordance with US GAAP together with the reconciliation of net profit 
and shareholders’ funds from a UK GAAP basis to a US GAAP basis, presentation of the US GAAP measure of
comprehensive income and a movement in shareholders’ funds on a US GAAP basis.
The net income for the year ended 30 September 2003 under US GAAP was £264.3 million (2002:
£255.4 million, 2001:£234.2 million), compared with the net profit of £219.1 million in 2003 (2002:£202.9 million,
2001:£224.1 million) under UK GAAP . Shareholders’ funds at 30 September 2003 under US GAAP were 
£1 ,872.5 million (2002:£2,061 .0 million), compared with £1 ,734.8 million (2002:£1 ,684.1 million) under UK GAAP .
The difference primarily results from the differing accounting treatment of pensions, goodwill, financial instruments,
investments and fixed asset revaluations.
51 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Exchange rates 
The majority of the Group’s operations are located outside the UK and operate in currencies other than sterling.
The effects of fluctuations in the relationship between the various currencies are extremely complex and
variations in any particular direction may not have a consistent impact on the reported results. In 2003, sterling
strengthened against two of the four principal currencies affecting the Group:by nine per cent against the US dollar
and by four per cent against the Japanese yen. Sterling weakened by five per cent against the Australian dollar and by
15 per cent against the South African rand.
In 2002, sterling strengthened against the US dollar , the Japanese yen and the South African rand. It was almost
unchanged against the Australian dollar .
In 2001 , sterling weakened against the US dollar , but strengthened against the Australian dollar , the Japanese yen
and the South African rand.

Principal operating companies
The following operating companies principally affect the amount of profit or assets of the Group:
• The BOC Group Inc, a wholly-owned Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of The BOC Group Inc,
a wholly-owned Nevada corporation.
• BOC Limited, a wholly-owned English company .
• BOC Limited, a wholly-owned Australian company .
• Gist Limited, a wholly-owned English company .
• Japan Air Gases Limited, a Japanese company , in which the Group’s Japanese 98 per cent owned subsidiary
holds 45 per cent.
• African Oxygen Limited, a South African company , in which the Group’s shareholding is 56 per cent.
Supplier payment policy
The Group applies a policy of agreeing and clearly communicating the terms of payment as part of the commercial
arrangements negotiated with suppliers and then paying according to those terms. In addition the UK-based
businesses have committed to the ‘Better Payment Practice Code’. A copy of the code can be obtained from the
Department of T rade and Industry , DTI Publications Orderline, Admail 528, London SW1W 8YT .
For UK businesses, of amounts owing to suppliers, trade creditors represents 54 days at 30 September 2003.
Going concern
The directors are confident, after having made appropriate enquiries, that both the company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the accounts. Management believes that its current credit facilities provide sufficient
working capital to meet the present requirements of its existing businesses and that the gearing ratio is appropriate
given the nature of the Group’s activities.
Substantial holdings
Details of substantial holdings of Ordinary shares at 13 November 2003 are shown on page 125.

South African rand The BOC Group is committed to business integrity , high ethical values and professionalism in all its activities.
As an essential part of this commitment, the board supports the highest standards in corporate governance.
The board
At 30 September 2003 the board comprised the chairman, five executive directors and six non-executive directors.
Biographies of each of the directors can be found on pages 8 and 9. BOC has operated with a board comprised of 
12 members for some time and considers this to be an effective size and balance for the company . The executive
directors are the chief executive, Group finance director and the three chief executives of the lines of business.
The non-executive directors bring a wide range of experience and expertise to the board and all are considered by
the board to be independent. Sir Christopher O’Donnell is the senior independent director , having been appointed
to this role in March 2003 following the retirement of Göran Lundberg. The board composition allows for changes 
to be made with minimum disruption. The board reviews annually the senior managers and their succession and
development plans.
The roles of chairman and chief executive are separate. This has been so since 1994. The chairman leads 
the board, ensuring that each director , particularly the non-executive directors, are able to make an effective
contribution. He monitors, with assistance from the company secretary , the information distributed to the board 
to ensure that it is sufficient, accurate, timely and clear . The chief executive maintains day-to-day management
responsibility for the company’s operations, implementing Group strategies and policies agreed by the board.
This division of responsibilities between the chairman and the chief executive has been agreed with the board as a whole.
During the year the chairman’s other commitments have changed. Whilst remaining a non-executive director 
of Anglo American plc he has stepped down from the chairmanship of its audit committee and has assumed the role
of senior independent director . The board has reviewed the chairman’s current obligations and is satisfied that he has
sufficient time available to meet all his commitments.
The board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it. In particular the board’s main focus is on strategic
and policy issues and reviewing performance. These matters are reviewed annually at a combined board and strategy
meeting, lasting over a period of two days, with updates provided to the board on a regular basis.
The board delegates certain functions to committees. There are six board committees, details of which are
given below. The board, however , takes direct responsibility for the review and monitoring of key company policies 
in such areas as risk management, treasury matters and corporate social responsibility including safety , environment
and the Code of Conduct. The board currently approves all Group commitments in excess of £25 million.
Decisions relating to commitments below this level are delegated by the board to the business unit heads, line 
of business chief executives, investment committee and the executive management board in accordance with
specified financial levels agreed by the board. The board monitors the financial performance of the company .
It is given presentations on major projects and receives reviews from each of the individual businesses.
The board meets six times a year , with two meetings held at major operating subsidiaries and one of those 
two meetings at a location outside the UK. The attendance of directors at the board and principal board committee
meetings during the year are detailed in the chart below.

The chairman meets twice a year with the non-executive directors without the executive management present and
at each meeting there is a session without the chairman present, chaired by Sir Christopher O’Donnell as the senior
independent director , during which they review the chairman’s performance.
The company maintains directors’and officers’liability insurance with a limit of cover of £100 million for each 
and every claim or series of claims arising from the same set of circumstances.
The board reviews board meeting papers, regular reports on the company and market sector activity together
with updates on governance and regulatory matters and litigation affecting the Group.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary and there is a well established
procedure enabling any director , in the furtherance of his or her duties, to seek independent professional advice at 
the company’s expense.

Corporate governance Directors and officers
The directors holding office at the date of this report are named on pages 8 and 9. John Bevan joined the board as 
an executive director on 5 December 2002 and Dick Grant resigned as an executive director on 31 December 2002.
Roberto Mendoza was appointed a non-executive director on 9 October 2002 and, following the resignation of
Göran Lundberg on 4 March 2003, Andrew Bonfield was appointed a non-executive director on 29 July 2003.
The officers of the company are the executive directors and other members of the executive management
board as named on pages 10 and 11 . All held office throughout the year ended 30 September 2003 except Dick
Grant who resigned on 31 December 2002 and Kent Masters who became a member of the executive management
board on 11 December 2002. There have been no further changes up to the date of this report.
Non-executive directors
The Group has long recognised the vital role that non-executive directors play in ensuring high governance standards.
The BOC board has for many years had a significant presence of high calibre non-executive directors. The nomination
committee identifies and evaluates candidates to fill vacancies and these are nominated for approval by the board as 
a whole. Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term after which, whilst not automatic, their
appointment may be extended subject to mutual agreement and shareholder approval.
The non-executive directors have full access to management and both internal and external auditors, and are
encouraged to stay fully abreast of the Group’s business through site visits and meetings with senior management.
Appropriate training and briefings are available to all directors on appointment and subsequently , as necessary , taking
into account their qualifications and experience. During 2003 a non-executive director attended two relevant
external training courses. For all new non-executive directors a full induction programme is provided including site
visits and meetings with each of the line of business chief executives, each member of the executive management
board and also the company’s key external advisers.
Board committees
There are six board committees to which the board delegates specific areas of responsibility as described below.
Audit committee
Members:Fabiola Arredondo, Julie Baddeley , Andrew Bonfield, Roberto Mendoza, Matthew Miau and 
Sir Christopher O’Donnell (chairman).
The audit committee meets four times a year . Time is set aside at two of these meetings for the committee to
meet with the internal and external auditors without executive management present. The committee reviews the
effectiveness of internal controls, matters raised by the internal and external auditors in their regular reports to the
committee and the quarterly financial statements prior to their release. The committee reviews the programme and
effectiveness of risk management within the Group as well as ensuring that an appropriate relationship between 
BOC and the external auditors is maintained. The audit committee terms of reference are available on the company’s
website (www.boc.com).
Andrew Bonfield, an independent non-executive director , is considered by the board to be the audit committee
financial expert. He is considered to be independent in accordance with a definition of that term by the New Y ork
Stock Exchange. The qualifications of all members of the committee are given on pages 8 and 9.
A report from the audit committee on its activities during 2003 is given on page 55.
Nomination committee
Members:Fabiola Arredondo, Julie Baddeley , Andrew Bonfield, T ony Isaac, Rob Margetts (chairman),
Roberto Mendoza, Matthew Miau and Sir Christopher O’Donnell.
The nomination committee meets periodically as required, and in the year ended 30 September 2003 met 
six times. The committee primarily monitors the composition and balance of the board and its committees and
identifies and recommends to the board the appointment of new directors. Whilst the chairman of the board chairs
this committee he is not permitted to chair meetings when the appointment of his successor is being reviewed.
The nomination committee terms of reference are available on the company’s website (www.boc.com).
Following developments in corporate governance during the year , the committee reviewed the terms of
reference of each of the principal board committees. It recommended changes which were approved and
implemented by the board.
The committee carries out, on an annual basis, a review of the board and executive management board,
monitoring the succession plans for the board. This is complemented by an annual board evaluation which in 2002
was an internal review and in 2003 has been a more comprehensive review conducted by an external facilitator .
The results of the evaluation assist the committee in its consideration of the opportunities for improvement in the
performance of directors generally and in the reappointment of non-executive directors upon expiry of their term 
of office and also on their proposed re-election as directors retiring by rotation at the Annual General Meeting.
The results of the 2003 evaluation were very positive. In particular , the evaluation confirmed that the board and
each of the principal board committees worked effectively . The contributions by individual directors to board 
and committee discussions were also considered to be high. The review did highlight the need for continuing
improvement in the overall efficiency of board and committee meetings in order to maintain the focus of discussions
on key strategic and policy matters.
In the appointment of new directors the committee reviews the current balance of skills on the board. It draws up a
specification to include any specific knowledge or expertise it considers of future benefit to the board having regard to the
business throughout the Group and the overall strategy . It recruits using external search agents who would put forward a
short list of candidates for the committee to review before submitting its recommendation to the board as a whole.
Corporate governance continued
54 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 During the year the committee assessed the time commitment it considers appropriate for each non-executive
director to devote to BOC to ensure that they have enough time in addition to their existing commitments. This
agreed time commitment is taken into account when considering new appointees to the board.
Remuneration committee
Members:Fabiola Arredondo, Julie Baddeley (chairman), Andrew Bonfield, Roberto Mendoza, Matthew Miau and 
Sir Christopher O’Donnell.
The remuneration committee meets six times a year . The committee recommends to the board the policy on
executive directors’remuneration and the specific remuneration, benefits and terms of employment of each executive
director . The remuneration committee terms of reference are available on the company’s website (www.boc.com).
The committee’s report on directors’remuneration is set out on pages 60 to 69.
Pensions committee
Members:Julie Baddeley (chairman), T ony Isaac, Rob Margetts, René Médori, Roberto Mendoza.
The pensions committee meets twice a year and oversees the review of governance and control procedures
applying to all employee retirement benefit plans and reviews and makes recommendations on the investment
policies and strategies applied to the Group’s retirement benefit plans.
Executive management board
The members of the executive management board are detailed on pages 10 and 11 . The executive management
board is chaired by T ony Isaac.
The executive management board meets regularly having primary authority for the day-to-day management of
the Group’s operations and policy implementation pursuant to the Group’s strategy agreed by the board.
Investment committee
Members: John Bevan, T ony Isaac (chairman), René Médori, ‘Raj’Rajagopal, Greg Sedgwick, John Walsh and
representatives from the finance function.
The investment committee meets regularly and reviews and approves Group commitments up to certain levels
set by the board.
Accountability and audit
Statements of the respective responsibilities of the directors and auditors for these accounts are set out on 
pages 70 and 71 .
To enhance further the confidence of investors in the independence of the independent auditors and their
report, the board of BOC has introduced a policy that defines which other services PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
may or may not provide to BOC. The policy requires the provision of these services to be approved in advance by 
the audit committee of the board. A full statement of the fees paid for audit and non-audit services is provided in
note 2 c) to the financial statements.
Audit committee report
The audit committee meetings in 2003 reviewed the following issues:
i) interim financial results.
ii) interim report from the internal audit function of progress against the 2003 audit plan.
iii) corporate governance issues arising in the US under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and in the UK in the revised
Combined Code. The audit committee reviewed the Group’s actions and disclosure items in response to these
matters designed to enhance the Group’s corporate governance practices.
iv) the external 2003 audit plan for the Group’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). This review included
the audit objectives, auditor independence and objectivity policies managed by PwC, partner rotation, audit scope,
team, timetable, deliverables and fee proposal.
v) the Group’s risk management process, including progress on the management of key risks identified by the
Group, and within the Group’s lines of business.
vi) the 2003 full year results.
vii) the annual report disclosure items relevant to the audit committee.
viii) full year report on internal audit and effectiveness of internal control.
ix) the external auditors’year end report.
x) the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, including a review of non-audit fees.
During this period the audit committee met with the Group’s external auditors without the presence of management.
Regular attendees to audit committee meetings, at the invitation of the chairman of the committee, include:
the chairman, chief executive, Group finance director , company secretary (or his designate), director of risk
management and head of business assurance audit.
During 2003 the audit committee has reviewed the arrangements for staff to report, in confidence, financial
reporting, financial control issues or other matters. The committee has also reviewed the Group’s policy on the hiring
of former external auditor personnel and has received reports from management on changes in accounting
requirements and accounting policies relevant to the Group.
The audit committee has reviewed its terms of reference and amended them in accordance with the policies
and procedures introduced by BOC to enhance corporate governance practices.
55 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 The audit committee has reviewed and approved a policy for the provision of non-audit services by the auditor . This
policy defines services which can be provided by the auditor and specifies services which cannot be provided. The
policy requires all non-audit services to be approved in advance by the audit committee, which has delegated this task
to the chairman of the audit committee. The approval process requires full disclosure of the objectives and scope of
the services to be performed and fee structure. The audit committee reviews all approved services at subsequent
meetings.
The audit committee has reviewed and approved a policy to safeguard auditor objectivity and independence.
This policy requires annual review of:
i) policies and procedures adopted by the auditor .
ii) policies implemented by the Group to manage non-audit services, employment of former auditor employees,
audit partner rotation and influence on the conduct or objectivity of the audit.
The audit committee concludes that, based on the foregoing, it has discharged its responsibilities as set out in the
terms of reference and is satisfied that auditor independence and objectivity have been maintained.
Risk management and internal controls
This statement of compliance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance in respect of risk management
and internal controls is in line with the arrangements set out by the UK Listing Authority .
The board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of risk management and internal controls.
The schedule of matters reserved to the board ensures that the directors maintain full and effective control over
all significant strategic, financial, organisational and compliance issues.
Risk management in BOC The BOC risk management programme assists management throughout the Group to
identify , assess and manage business risk.
The risk management programme is supported by a dedicated central team of risk specialists. T o ensure all parts
of the Group have a firm understanding of risk, the central team has led over 170 risk workshops and reviews around
the world in the past three years. These risk assessments have been broad, covering:risks in strategy;risks to achieving
commitments contained in performance contracts;risks in organisational change;risks associated with major projects
and risks involving acquisitions. The risk management process operates throughout BOC and is applied equally to the
global lines of business, the business units and corporate functions.
The output from each assessment is a list of prioritised risks with associated action plans to mitigate them.
Line managers are responsible for these action plans and their progress is reported, as required, as part of their
performance contract reviews.
A report is made to the board twice a year . The relevant business executives presented to the board in May 
and November 2003, covering actions which had been completed and the status of continuing action plans to
manage the Group’s key risks.
BOC views risk management as integral to good business practice. The programme is designed to support
management’s decision making and to improve the reliability of business performance. BOC will continue to embed
the management of risk into all its management processes.
Internal controls in BOC The directors have delegated to executive management the establishment and
implementation of a system of internal controls appropriate to the various business environments in which it
operates. The Group operates under a system of controls that has been developed and refined over time to meet 
its current and future needs and the risks and opportunities to which it is exposed. These controls, which are
communicated through various operating and procedural manuals and processes, include but are not limited to:
• the definition of the organisational structure and the appropriate delegation of authorities to operational
management.
• procedures for the review and authorisation of capital investments through the investment committee including
post-acquisition reviews and appraisals.
• strategic planning and the related annual planning process including the ongoing review by the board of the
Group’s strategies.
• the establishment of individual business unit annual performance targets and the quarterly business review of
actual performance.
• the monthly financial reporting and review of financial results and other operating statistics such as the health
and safety reports as well as the Group’s published quarterly financial statements, which are based on a
standardised reporting process.
• accounting and financial reporting policies to ensure the consistency , integrity and accuracy of the Group’s
accounting records.
•specific treasury policies and objectives and the ongoing reporting and review of all significant transactions and
financing operations.
The internal control system is monitored and supported by an internal audit function that operates on a global basis
and reports its results to management and the audit committee on the Group’s operations. The work of the internal
auditors is focused on the areas of greatest risk to the Group determined on the basis of a risk management
approach to audit.
There have been regular reviews by the audit committee of the board of the effectiveness of the Group’s overall
internal control processes throughout the year .
The directors therefore believe that the Group’s system of risk management and internal controls provides
reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are safeguarded, transactions are authorised and recorded
properly and that material errors and irregularities are either prevented or would be detected within a timely period.
Corporate governance continued
56 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Having reviewed its effectiveness, the directors are not aware of any significant weakness or deficiency in the Group’s
system of internal controls during the period covered by this report and accounts. There were no changes in the
Group’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended 30 September 2003 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Group’s internal control over financial reporting.
Disclosure controls and procedures
The chief executive and Group finance director , after evaluating the effectiveness of the Group’s disclosure controls
and procedures as at the end of the period covered by this annual report and accounts, have concluded that, as at
such date, the Group’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Going concern
The directors’report on going concern is included in the financial review on page 52.
Communications with shareholders
The board considers communications with shareholders, whether institutional investors, private or employee
shareholders, to be extremely important. Results are published quarterly , and half year and annual reviews are sent
to all shareholders. A copy of the full report and accounts is available by election or on request. The Annual General
Meeting provides an opportunity for shareholders to question directors about the company’s activities and
prospects. The chairmen of each of the principal board committees are normally present. During the year responses
are given to letters received from shareholders on a variety of subjects. There is a programme of regular dialogue
with major institutional shareholders and fund managers and summaries of these discussions and meetings are
provided to the board. In addition the board receives copies of most analyst and broker reports issued on the
company . These summaries and reports enable the directors to gain an understanding of the views and opinions of
those with an interest in the company .
The company’s website (www.boc.com) provides financial and other business information about The BOC
Group. It contains an archive of past announcements and annual reports, share price information and a calendar of
events as well as BOC’s social responsibility policies, including the company’s Code of Conduct.
Compliance
The board has applied the principles contained in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
appended to the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules and has complied throughout the year , with the exception that
Dick Grant, a director who resigned with effect from 31 December 2002, had a service contract that could be
terminated by the company on two years’notice.
Directors submit themselves for re-election at regular intervals and at least every three years in accordance 
with the company’s Articles of Association and the Combined Code.
Although the new Combined Code is only effective for reporting years beginning on or after 1 November
2003, BOC has already made changes to its corporate governance procedures such that at this time the company 
is significantly advanced towards compliance with the new code.
US corporate governance compliance
BOC has securities registered in the US and, as a result, is required to comply with those provisions of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 (the Act) as it applies to foreign issuers. Whilst the company believes its corporate
governance structure to be robust and in line with best practice, changes have been made in order to ensure
compliance with the Act as far as it applies to BOC. The board continues to monitor the new rules being issued
pursuant to the Act and will comply with any new legal and regulatory requirements as they are introduced.
As recommended by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) BOC has established a disclosure
committee comprising the Group finance director , Group legal director and representatives from the finance,
company secretarial, treasury , investor relations, risk management and human resources functions. The committee
meets regularly and is responsible for performing an oversight and advisory role in the disclosure process for the 
quarterly announcements and the content and form of the annual report and Form 20-F . The committee makes
recommendations to the chief executive, Group finance director and executive management board on the adequacy
of processes to permit signing of the certifications required by the Act.
In November 2003, the SEC approved changes to the listing standards of the New Y ork Stock Exchange
(NYSE) related to the corporate governance practices of listed companies. Under these rules, listed foreign private
issuers, like BOC, must disclose any significant ways in which their corporate governance practices differ from those
followed by US domestic companies under the NYSE listing standards. There are no significant differences in the
corporate governance practices followed by BOC, as compared to those followed by US domestic companies
under the NYSE listing standards, except that BOC follows the recommendations contained in the Combined Code
with respect to the membership of its nomination committee which permits membership of this committee to be
composed of a majority of independent non-executive directors. The NYSE listing standards require that the
nomination committee be composed entirely of independent directors.
Corporate social investment
BOC’s social investment programme has four key objectives:
i) to continue to focus on projects to improve environmental stewardship;
ii) to strengthen BOC’s educational support in selected areas;
iii) to continue to devolve the choices of charitable donations to employees through matched giving and
volunteering schemes;and
iv) to broaden the organisation’s involvement in social programmes around the world.
57 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 These objectives were accompanied by the launch of BOC’s global Code of Conduct, which underpins the Group’s
commitment to high legal and ethical standards in business. The code is being transmitted to the organisation through
an extensive communication, training and change management process. It details and builds on many of the Group’s
existing social, environmental, legal and ethical standards as well as improving areas where there were perceived gaps
or deficiencies. The code includes many standards:safe working practices;sound environmental management; fair
competition and trade practices;rejection of corrupt practices;respect for the principles of human rights;and
community engagement and support. The code can be accessed on the company’s website at www.boc.com
The code is reinforced by a supporting programme, including clear channels for employees to lodge questions,
concerns or complaints. The BOC helpline operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week. T ranslators are available 
to handle concerns in every major business language. Using the helpline, employees can post, e-mail, fax or
telephone concerns to be handled confidentially by an independent helpline administrator or by BOC’s global
compliance department.
BOC operates a wide-ranging social investment and charitable donations programme, directing resources at
areas where the organisation feels it can make a difference or where employees have a direct involvement.
In 2003, BOC made charitable donations totalling £1 .12 million including £476,000 to UK-registered charities
through direct donations from the Group and matched giving. As in previous years, no political donations were
made in the European Union.
Supporting the environment
The Group’s environmental flagship remains the UK-based BOC Foundation for the Environment, which was
established with an initial injection of £1 million in 1990. The Foundation has supported over 120 projects. This year ,
the Group contributed £180,000 to Foundation projects and saw eight new initiatives come on stream. Since the
Foundation’s inception BOC has donated £3.7 million. Combined funding from BOC and its co-sponsoring partners
now exceeds £12 million. This year the Foundation was reorganised to concentrate on projects that improve air 
and water quality and to increase the proportion of its environmental spending that goes in direct support of 
selected projects.
BOC made a number of positive contributions to other environmental projects including the BOC New
Zealand community environmental grants programme, which provides assistance to schools and local community
groups. T ogether with the New Zealand Water Environment Research Foundation, BOC manages a scheme
providing funding to help communities maintain, protect and improve their water resources.
Charitable programmes
At a local level, BOC employees have continued to involve themselves in charitable fundraising and voluntary support.
To this end, BOC’s matched giving scheme again proved its worth as a way of aligning corporate funding with the
personal generosity of BOC employees. Matched giving schemes have been operating in the UK, the Americas and
the south Pacific for some time. In the course of 2003, BOC in the UK donated £201 ,000 (included in the UK total
above) through the Charities Aid Foundation to match employee beneficence.
In addition to the numerous causes supported through matched giving, BOC also supported a number of
Group causes, including the Royal British Legion, Thrive, St John’s Ambulance, Macmillan Cancer Relief and ProShare.
BOC ran the second year of the BOC Emerging Artist Award to encourage and support a committed UK-based
artist for a year . The 2003 award was won by Manchester Metropolitan University graduate T om Hackney who
emerged as the overall winner of the £20,000 bursary from 200 applicants.
The Group’s logistics business, Gist, has formed a partnership with FareShare, adopting the cause as its headline
charity . FareShare is a national network that redistributes surplus food to homeless and vulnerable people around the
UK. Food that is nearing its expiry date is delivered to the FareShare depots from big retailers. Volunteers at the
depots then sort, grade, refrigerate and deliver the food to day centres. Money saved on food is then used to
provide other support services such as training, medical services and counselling to help people rebuild their lives.
Community involvement
Outside the UK, the development of community activities rests in the hands of local BOC businesses, each one 
being responsible for its own project selection and funding. This devolved approach has resulted in the funding of 
a rich variety of programmes that are truly relevant to the communities in which BOC companies operate.
In the US, through a combination of financial support and many hours of volunteer involvement, BOC and its
employees continued to assist the United Way charitable appeal, helping to make a difference in many deprived
sectors of the community . BOC in the US also pursued a number of other projects including support for local arts
and educational causes.
In the south Pacific, the company matches employees’ fundraising for three charities a year . In Australia,
employees once again chose the Salvation Army’s Red Shield Appeal, Daffodil Day , a fundraising event for cancer
research, education and patient support, and Jeans for Genes, an international campaign that raises funds for
research into genetic disorders. In New Zealand, employees selected Daffodil Day , the Westpac Rescue Helicopter
and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. BOC in Australia continues a long-established relationship
with the Malcolm Sargent Cancer Fund for Children. BOC employees support this cause with financial contributions
and employee support through volunteering and fundraising activities.
In South Africa, BOC’s subsidiary Afrox and its staff continued to support the company’s community
involvement process (CIP), which includes the management of 125 projects to improve the lives of disadvantaged
young people. Once more, the highlight of the year was Bumbanani (meaning ‘let’s build together’) Day when 
13,500 children attended events hosted by BOC staff. This year , Afrox’s CIP was identified by the United Nations as 
a model community programme and the Springs Parkland clinic received the president’s merit award for outstanding
social commitment.
Corporate governance continued
58 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 In addition, Afrox hospitals engage in a wide range of health care and safety initiatives, including sponsorship of the
South African Heart Foundation. A Mended Hearts support group and cardiac rehabilitation team, supporting
people in their recuperation and rehabilitation after heart surgery , continued to roll out their programmes on an
increasingly national basis. Some Afrox hospitals have a special outreach service in the form of rape crisis centres.
Medical examinations are conducted in a non-threatening environment with the emphasis placed on maintaining the
dignity of the victim. Preventive medication and antiretroviral drugs are given against sexually transmitted diseases.
BOC and its employees have been active in many other markets. BOC in China has embarked on a support
programme to facilitate screened blood donations to local hospitals. In Thailand, BOC sponsored a sports
programme helping to discourage drug use. BOC in Pakistan, continued to provide support to community
organisations dealing with poverty alleviation, education and health care. This year , support continued for:the 
Layton Rehmatulla Benevolent T rust, an organisation dedicated to providing free eye care;the Marie Adelaide
Leprosy Centre;the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, the first institution in Pakistan dedicated to cancer
treatment;and the Aga Khan Medical Hospital and Foundation. BOC was one of the founding contributors to the
Aga Khan Foundation which runs a world class university hospital affiliated to the Harvard Medical School.
In Chile, BOC supported the Catholic University of Chile with sponsorship of part of the expenses for a new
engineering school and the establishment of departments of mining investigations, environmental management and
teaching through the Internet. In Venezuela, BOC donated funds and helium balloons to schools and orphanages and
breathing oxygen to local fire stations. In Curacao, the organisation channels support through the local Rotary Club
and contributed to various youth education and care for the elderly projects. In India, BOC made a number of
contributions across a range of poverty alleviation and community welfare initiatives.
Investing in education
Several BOC businesses initiated or strengthened their educational contributions. For example, in southern Africa,
BOC companies supported education and training with external and employee bursaries, grants, in-house vocational
courses and incidental donations as well as continued support for a welding school and the Afrox College of Nursing.
In Thailand, employees adopted a local primary school and supported it with books and stationery . It also supported
several establishments with equipment and scholarships for employee dependants. In the UK, BOC launched an
education website entitled Inspiring Gases, which is designed to help students and their teachers understand more
about gases and their uses. The website will be developed further as a focal point for other educational activities.
Where appropriate, BOC continues to play an active part in local communities by harnessing its educational
capabilities through school tours, lessons in the properties of gases, technical support and academic research. It also
funds programmes and events such as the BOC Gases Challenge, which encourages UK secondary school students
to develop chemical engineering ideas based on the uses of helium and carbon dioxide, sponsorship of the UK’s
Council for Industry and Higher Education, the annual Institute of Chemical Engineers’environment award, and the
Salters’Festivals of Chemistry for the propagation of science amongst the young. BOC signed a five year deal in 2001
to support the Salters’ festival season. Last year , 34 festivals of chemistry involving 500 different schools took place at
universities across the UK and Ireland.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Institution of Electrical Engineers (Lecture Theatre), Savoy Place,
London WC2R 0BL on Friday 23 January 2004 commencing at 11 .00 am. The Notice of the Annual General

Nick Deeming Secretary

59 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises, with the exception of the Group chairman, Rob Margetts, all the
independent non-executive directors namely Julie Baddeley (chairman), Fabiola Arredondo, Andrew Bonfield
(appointed July 2003), Roberto Mendoza (appointed October 2002), Matthew Miau and Sir Christopher O’Donnell.
Göran Lundberg had been the chairman of the remuneration committee until his retirement on 4 March 2003.
Whilst neither the Group chairman nor the chief executive are members of the remuneration committee they both
attend the meetings by invitation but are not present when their personal remuneration is discussed and reviewed.
The human resources director acts as secretary to the committee and provides it with information and data from
national and international surveys. In addition, during the year the remuneration committee appointed T owers Perrin
to review the remuneration arrangements for senior executives. No other services are provided by this adviser .
The remuneration committee sets the overall remuneration policy of the Group and makes recommendations
to the board on the framework of executive remuneration. It meets six times a year . Individual member attendance at
the meetings is shown on page 53. The terms of reference are reviewed annually to ensure that they conform with
best practice. Specifically , the remuneration committee determines, on behalf of the board, the detailed terms of
service of the executive directors and other members of the executive management team including basic salary ,
performance related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind, long-term incentives and pension benefits. The
remuneration committee also reviews the remuneration of the chairman, following a recommendation from the chief
executive and the senior independent director . The board as a whole determines the non-executive directors’ fees.
Remuneration policy
BOC’s remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive management is designed to attract and retain
executives of the highest calibre so that the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of its stakeholders. In setting
remuneration levels the remuneration committee takes into account the remuneration practices found in other UK-
listed companies of similar size, internationality and complexity and seeks to benchmark executive remuneration at
about the median level for this group.
During 2002 the remuneration committee reviewed the executive remuneration packages and decided that 
a realignment was necessary to support the company’s business strategy to improve both earnings growth and 
capital efficiency and to ensure that the packages were market competitive. T o this end, a proposal to adopt new 
long-term incentive arrangements was put to shareholders and approved at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
These arrangements comprise a long-term incentive plan and an executive share option scheme. They are intended
to encourage innovation and value-added growth and strengthen the link between short-term performance and
sustainable improvement in shareholder value over the longer term. It is the view of the remuneration committee
that performance-related remuneration should form a substantial element of total remuneration. As such, these
arrangements together with the variable compensation plan, which is a performance related cash plan, form the
variable elements of executive remuneration. It is expected that the achievement of ‘on target’performance of 
these variable elements will amount to about 60 per cent of total executive remuneration.
No changes to the framework of executive remuneration are proposed for 2004. The remuneration
committee will, however , review the policy on a regular basis and make any amendments it deems appropriate to
ensure that it meets the objectives of recruiting, retaining and motivating high performing individuals and ensuring 
that the Group is market competitive.
Remuneration components 
Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive management board members are based on median
market rates drawn from two external market data sources and take account of an executive’s experience,
responsibilities and performance. Performance is assessed both from an individual and business perspective.
Executive salaries are normally reviewed annually by the remuneration committee. Remuneration for those
executives of businesses outside the UK is denominated in the local currency .
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise company car benefits and membership of BOC’s health care insurance
scheme. Where appropriate, directors on international assignment receive overseas allowances such as housing 
and children’s education fees. These allowances are on similar terms to those applying to other employees on the
international programme. Such benefits are in line with those offered by peer group companies. Benefits in kind do
not form part of pensionable earnings.
Variable compensation plan The executive directors and senior management participate in the variable
compensation bonus plan. The plan focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance with business plans.
The financial targets for the executive directors and other executive management board members are set on an
annual basis by the remuneration committee and performance against these targets is reviewed by the remuneration
committee on a six-monthly basis. The remuneration committee considers that a six-monthly review acts as a
significant incentive and is conducive to sustaining performance throughout the year . The financial targets are based
equally on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) at Group level.
Adjusted means excluding exceptional items. Bonuses are assessed two-thirds on these financial targets with the
remaining third based on personal objectives derived from BOC’s strategic priorities, including safety and growth
initiatives. During 2002 the remuneration committee reviewed the plan and agreed the maximum bonus payable for
the achievement of financial and personal objectives would be 80 per cent of salary . There is a threshold performance
level below which no bonus is paid.
The bonuses for the executive directors and other members of the executive management board are paid 
half yearly following the remuneration committee review. Details of the payments to directors are included in the
directors’remuneration for the year on page 64.
Report on remuneration
60 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Current long-term incentive arrangements 
Long-T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP) Executive directors, members of the executive management board and a number
of other key executives selected from the company’s global operations participate in the L TIP . The remuneration
committee has the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum of two times salary . The award made in February
2003 to the chief executive was based on 1 .5 times salary and for other board directors one times salary . There are
three performance conditions:total shareholder return (TSR), adjusted earning per share (EPS) and adjusted return
on capital employed (ROCE). Up to one third of the award could vest in respect of each performance condition.
The TSR performance condition compares BOC’s TSR performance with two separate comparator groups, a
UK comparator group comprising 31 industrial and manufacturing companies and a global industrial gases group of
six leading companies as follows:
UK group
Aggregate Industries BPB Invensys Scottish & Southern Energy
AMEC Centrica Johnson Matthey Scottish Power
Anglo American Corus Group Kelda Group Severn T rent
AWG FKI National Grid T ransco Shell T ransport & T rading
BAE Systems Hanson Pilkington Smiths Group
BG Group IMI Rio Tinto T omkins
BHP Billiton ICI RMC Group United Utilities
BP International Power Rolls-Royce
When determining BOC’s performance relative to the global gases group, the TSR for BOC and the comparator
companies will be amended (amended TSR) so that it reflects the excess (or shortfall) in returns relative to the local
stockmarket index where each company has its primary listing. The nationality and the local stockmarket index that 
will be used to calculate the amended TSR for each company is shown in parentheses below.
Global gases group
Airgas (US – S&P 500 Index)
Air Liquide (France – CAC 40 Index)
Air Products & Chemicals (US – S&P 500 Index)
Linde (Germany – DAX 30 Index)
Nippon Sanso (Japan – NIKKEI 225 Index)
Praxair (US – S&P 500 Index)
The BOC Group (UK – FTSE 100 Index)
For the awards made in 2003 the target set by the remuneration committee is such that if the company’s TSR position
measured over a three year period is median in respect of both comparator groups, then 40 per cent of the shares in
respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the company’s TSR position is upper quartile all of the shares in
respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile a
proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the
company’s TSR position is below the median for both comparator groups the TSR part of the award will lapse.
The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on the company’s EPS before exceptional items relative to
three year targets on a sliding performance scale. For the award made in 2003 the target set by the remuneration
committee requires a five per cent per annum growth rate over three years for minimum vesting. If this is achieved,
40 per cent of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest. All of the shares in respect of the EPS part of
the award will vest if the company achieves a ten per cent per annum growth rate over three years. If the growth rate is
between five per cent and ten per cent a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the EPS
part of the award will vest. If the growth rate is less than five per cent per annum over the three year period the EPS part
of the award will lapse.
The adjusted ROCE performance condition is based on the company’s ROCE before exceptional items relative
to three year targets on a sliding performance scale. The minimum target set by the remuneration committee for
awards in 2003 is 13 per cent at the end of the three year performance period. If this is achieved 40 per cent of the
shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest. All of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award
will vest if the company achieves a ROCE of 14.5 per cent. If the ROCE performance is between 13 per cent and 14.5
per cent a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest.
If the ROCE is less than 13 per cent the ROCE part of the award will lapse.
In setting three performance conditions for the L TIP award, the remuneration committee took the view that
these were the most important measures that drive or measure sustainable improvements in shareholder value – 
the TSR performance condition measures comparative performance while EPS and ROCE reflect a core part of the
company’s business strategy , which is to improve both earnings growth and capital efficiency .
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 (ESOS 2003) Executive directors, members of the executive management
board and other selected middle and senior management throughout the company’s global operations participate 
in the ESOS 2003. The remuneration committee have the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum of two 
times salary . The awards made in February 2003 to the chief executive and other members of the board were based
on 1 .75 times salary . The performance condition set for the ESOS 2003 by the remuneration committee is that the
growth in the adjusted EPS over a three year performance period must be equal to or greater than the growth in the
UK retail prices index (RPI) plus three per cent per annum over the three year performance period. The performance
is assessed on the company’s published results. If the performance condition is satisfied at the end of the performance
period then the awards would be exercisable in full. In the event that the performance condition is not satisfied over
61 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Report on remuneration continued
62 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003
the original three year period then the remuneration committee has the discretion to re-test performance after five
years, but only where the remuneration committee believes the extension to be a fair and reasonable basis for
assessing the sustained underlying performance of the company . In line with current corporate governance best
practice there is no rolling re-testing of performance. The remuneration committee considers this performance
condition to be a challenging performance hurdle when compared to the company’s adjusted EPS compound annual
growth rate over the last ten years of around four per cent.
Awards under the L TIP and ESOS 2003 may be satisfied in cash or other assets, for example, where it is
necessary for legal or tax reasons. The amount to be paid will, in the case of share options, be equal to the
participants gain on the exercise of the share option. Also, the remuneration committee may decide, prior to grant,
that an award shall be expressed to be a right to acquire a cash sum rather than shares. This type of award, known as
a phantom award, will normally only be granted to participants in jurisdictions where, because of local security laws
or exchange control provisions, it is difficult to issue or transfer shares to employees. The L TIP and ESOS 2003 awards
may be satisfied by using existing shares purchased in the market through The BOC Group plc Employee Share T rust
or by issuing new shares.
Awards under the L TIP and ESOS 2003 are not pensionable.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme UK based directors are eligible to participate in the BOC Savings Related
Share Option Scheme. The scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue and it is open to all UK employees with 
one year’s service or more.
Former long-term incentive arrangements
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 The last grant of options to the executive directors and members of the
executive management board took place in February 2002 and the last award to other Group employees took place
in December 2002. No further awards will be made under this scheme. The options vest when the company’s
adjusted EPS growth is equal to, or exceeds, the growth in the retail prices index (RPI) by three per cent per annum
over any three year performance period.
Senior Executive Share Option Scheme,1994 Executive Share Option Scheme,Executive Share Purchase Plan
The last grants under these schemes took place in November 1994, February 1994 and August 1994 respectively .
In line with market practice at the time when these schemes were introduced the vesting of these awards was not
subject to performance conditions.
Share Incentive Unit Plan Between 1989 and 1995 awards were made to executives under an incentive
arrangement linked to the growth in the company’s share price. No awards have been made under the plan 
since 1995. The final payment was made in November 2002.
Retirement benefits 
Pension arrangements for executive directors are in line with those of comparable executives in the countries in
which the directors are located.
In the UK, the BOC Senior Executive Pension Scheme is a funded, tax-approved, defined benefit pension
arrangement. Where necessary , the director’s pensionable pay is limited by the ‘earnings cap’provisions of the
Finance Act 1989. In such cases, the company pays the director a salary supplement on earnings above the earnings
cap to reflect the loss of pension coverage. This supplement is recorded in the director’s emoluments and is not 
taken into account in calculating bonuses or any other form of remuneration.
BOC closed its UK defined benefit pension arrangements to all new employees on 30 June 2003. Pension
arrangements for new employees will be provided for under a defined contribution Retirement Savings Plan. The
company will make contributions to the plan equal to two times the employee’s core contributions which can be
three, four or five per cent of salary .
In the US, the BOC T op-Hat Pension Plan is an unfunded, non-tax-qualified, defined benefit pension arrangement.
In Australia, the BOC Gases Superannuation Fund is a defined contribution arrangement underpinned by a defined
benefit guarantee for long-serving employees who were members under a prior benefit structure.
Shareholding guidelines 
The remuneration committee encourages executive management to grow personal shareholding in the 
business over time. It is anticipated that each executive would build towards a shareholding of one times salary .
The remuneration committee believes that the vehicle of the long-term incentive arrangements will facilitate the
building of such a shareholding over a period of time.
Details of directors’individual remuneration, share options, L TIP awards, share incentive units and share holdings
are given on pages 64 to 68. As set out in the remuneration policy statement performance related remuneration is
expected to amount to about 60 per cent for each of the executive directors. The performance conditions for each
current and former share option and long-term incentive plan are set out above.
Non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors are generally appointed for an initial period to the next Annual General Meeting and subject
to reappointment at the meeting, for a further three year term. Subsequent reappointment is with the agreement of
the board and approval of shareholders. The fees are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary
experience and ability to make a significant contribution to the Group’s affairs. The responsibilities of, and the time
commitment expected from, non-executive directors have increased in recent times and fees paid to non-executives
are increasing to reflect this. As a result, from 1 January 2004 the non-executive directors’ fees will increase from
£37,000 to £40,000 per annum, £10,000 of which, less tax, will be invested in BOC shares. The fees for chairing a  committee will increase from £8,000 to £10,000 per annum, £5,000 of which, less tax, will be invested in BOC
shares. The fee for the chairman, Rob Margetts, is set at £225,000.
The non-executive directors do not have contracts of service nor do they participate in the Group’s variable
compensation arrangements, its long-term incentive arrangements or its pension arrangements, nor do they receive
any benefits in kind.
The graph above has been included to meet the requirement set out in the Directors’Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. It shows BOC’s TSR performance, assuming dividends are reinvested, compared with all FTSE 100
companies. This has been chosen because it provides a basis for comparison against companies in a relevant, broad
based equity index of which BOC is a constituent member . The remuneration committee decided that other
comparator groups were more appropriate as performance measurement for the L TIP . A graph showing BOC’s 
TSR performance compared with the six major gases companies relative to respective local indices, which is one of
the comparator groups chosen for the L TIP , is shown in the chairman’s statement on page 5.
Service contracts
The company’s policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of employment that terminate on the attainment
of retirement age. In order to mitigate its liability on early termination, the company’s policy is that it should be able to
terminate such contracts on no more than 12 months’notice, and that payments on termination are restricted to the
value of salary , car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the
preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period. Pension provisions on termination are detailed
in the individual service contracts below.
Individual service contracts Mr Bevan has a contract dated 5 December 2002 that can be terminated by the
company on 12 months’notice. In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the payment of
compensation based on the value of salary , car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the average
of actual payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period. Mr Bevan would
also be entitled to his deferred pension, with the unexpired portion of the notice period being added to his
pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement.
Mr Isaac has a contract which expires on 30 June 2005 subject to possible extension by mutual agreement.
The contract can be terminated by the company on 12 months’notice. In the event of early termination, the contract
provides for the payment of compensation based on the value of salary , car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on
the basis of the average of actual payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice
period. Mr Isaac would also be entitled to a special contribution to his funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme
amounting to the sum of 40 per cent of his pay above the ‘earnings cap’imposed by the Finance Act 1989 and 
50 per cent (58.33 per cent from 6 April 2003) of his pay up to the cap for the unexpired portion of his notice period.
Mr Médori has a contract dated 19 November 2002 that can be terminated by the company on 12 months’

and (b) to an immediate payment representing the discounted value of the difference in the capital values of a
pension calculated as in (a) and a pension calculated as in (a) but with the addition of the unexpired portion of his
notice period in the calculation of pensionable service.

Excess retirement benefits
No person who has served as a director at any time during the financial year has received retirement benefits in
excess of those to which he or she was entitled on the date that the benefits first became payable.
Compensation for past director
Mr Grant, former chief executive Process Gas Solutions, had a contract dated 1 May 1999. The contract could be
terminated by the company on two years’notice, and provided for the payment of the value of base salary for the
unexpired portion of the notice period. Additionally , the contract provided for the addition of Mr Grant’s notice
period to his pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement.
Mr Grant resigned as a director on 31 December 2002 and he left the company on 30 June 2003. His termination
entitlements were mitigated by an agreement that his contractual notice period would be treated as expiring on 
30 September 2004. He accordingly received a payment of £448,000, representing salary and compensation for
benefits in respect of the agreed 15-month notice period. Mr Grant was also entitled to purchase his company car for a
nominal amount. In addition, Mr Grant’s benefit in the US top-hat pension plan was credited with 15 additional months
of pensionable service in respect of his notional notice period. The top-hat pension plan was also adjusted to meet 
Mr Grant’s accrued entitlement. Additionally , he received the sum of £13,400 being the equivalent of the company’s
contribution which would have been credited to Mr Grant’s US cash balance retirement plan during the period of his
agreed notice period. These amounts are disclosed on page 64 as ‘T ermination payments’and have been charged
against profit in 2003.
Details of Mr Grant’s share options are given on page 67, and details of his pension entitlements are given on
page 68.
Sums paid to third parties
Except for fees paid to Smith & Nephew plc for the services of Sir Christopher O’Donnell as noted on page 64, no

69 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company and of the Group at the end of the year and of the profit or loss for the
year . In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently .
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements.
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. The directors also have general responsibility for taking reasonable steps to
safeguard the assets of the company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
A copy of the financial statements of the company is placed on the website of The BOC Group plc.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of statutory and audited information on the
company’s website. Information published on the Internet is accessible in many countries with different legal
requirements. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility of the directors
For preparation of the financial statements
70 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Group profit and loss account, the Group balance
sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the total recognised gains and losses, the movement in shareholders’ funds,
the balance sheet of The BOC Group plc, Group undertakings, accounting policies and the related notes. We have
also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985
contained in the report on remuneration (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, Form 20-F and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards and the requirements of the United States of America
Securities and Exchange Commission are set out in the statement of directors’responsibilities. The directors are also
responsible for preparing the report on remuneration.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the report on remuneration in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board and Auditing Standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether 
the financial statements and the auditable part of the report on remuneration have been properly prepared in
accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’
report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our report if 
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other
information comprises only the financial highlights, chairman’s statement, chief executive’s review, board of directors,
executive management board, Group five year record, Group profile, employees, safety , health and the environment,
research, development and information technology , risk factors, operating review, financial review, the unaudited part of
the report on remuneration, responsibility of the directors, dividends, nature of trading market, analysis of shareholdings,
taxation, financial calendar , key contacts information, cross reference to Form 20-F and glossary of terms.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’s compliance with the seven
provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are
not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form
an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s or Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the United Kingdom Auditing Practices
Board and with Auditing Standards generally accepted in the United States of America. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and 
the auditable part of the report on remuneration. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
and the auditable part of the report on remuneration are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
United Kingdom opinion In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
company and the Group at 30 September 2003 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then
ended;the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the United Kingdom Companies
Act 1985;and those parts of the report on remuneration required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the United Kingdom
Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared in accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985.
United States opinion In our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly , in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of the Group at 30 September 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 30 September 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom.
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom vary in certain significant respects from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The application of the latter would 
have affected results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended 30 September 2003 and the
consolidated shareholders’ funds at 30 September 2003 and 2002, to the extent summarised in note 30 to the
financial statements.

Balance sheet of The BOC Group plc
At 30 September
76 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 General
• Basis of preparationThese accounts are based on the historical cost accounting convention and comply with all applicable UK accounting standards.
UK accounting standards differ in certain respects from those generally accepted in the US and the major effects of these differences in the
determination of net income and shareholders’ funds are shown in note 30 to the financial statements. Disclosure requirements of both the 
UK and US are incorporated throughout the notes to these financial statements.
• Basis of consolidationThe Group accounts include the accounts of the parent undertaking and of all subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
The results of businesses acquired during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition. The results of businesses disposed of during
the year are included up to the date of relinquishing control. Material, separately identifiable business segments disposed of are analysed as discontinued
operations and prior years’analyses are restated to reflect those businesses as discontinued.
• Accounting policiesThese accounts have been prepared on an accounting basis consistent with that applied in the financial year ended 
30 September 2002.
• Exchange Profit and loss and other period statements of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at average rates of exchange. Assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the financial year end. Assets or liabilities swapped into other
currencies are accounted for in those currencies. Exchange differences are dealt with as a movement in reserves where they arise from:
i) the translation of the opening net assets of overseas operations;
ii) the retranslation of retained earnings of overseas operations from average to closing rates of exchange;and 
iii) the translation or conversion of foreign currency borrowings taken to hedge overseas assets.
All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account. The principal exchange rates affecting the Group are shown in the financial
review on page 52.
Revenue recognition
Turnover is based on the invoiced value of the sale of goods and services, and includes the sales value of long-term contracts appropriate to the state 
of completion. It excludes sales between Group undertakings, VA T and similar sales-based taxes. T urnover for goods and services is recognised when
delivery has occurred, title of the goods has passed to the purchaser , and where the price is fixed or determinable and reflects the commercial substance 
of the transaction.
Profit on contracts is only recognised close to contract completion and when profits can be reasonably determined. Provision is made for all losses
incurred together with any foreseeable future losses.
Retirement benefits
Retirement benefits are accounted for under FRS17. The regular service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to
operating profit in the year . The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service is also charged to operating profit in the year .
A credit representing the expected return on the assets of the retirement benefit schemes during the year is included within other net financing income.
This is based on the market value of the assets of the schemes at the start of the financial year .
A charge representing the expected increase in the liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes during the year is included within other net financing
income. This arises from the liabilities of the schemes being one year closer to payment.
Differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in the
year , together with differences arising from changes in assumptions.
Research and development
Revenue expenditure on research and development is written off when incurred.
Operating leases
The cost of operating leases is written off on the straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Intangible fixed assets
• Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets
acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, generally up to a maximum period of 20 years. An impairment
review is carried out at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition. Any impairment in the value of goodwill,calculated by discounting
estimated future cash flows, is dealt with in the profit and loss account in the period in which it arises. Negative goodwill, being the excess of the fair
value of the net assets acquired over the fair value of the purchase price, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis, generally over a period
equivalent to the realisation of the non-monetary assets acquired.
Goodwill, both positive and negative, arising on acquisitions before 30 September 1998 was taken to reserves and has not been reinstated on the
balance sheet. This is in line with the relevant accounting standard on goodwill, FRS10. This goodwill will remain in reserves until such time as it becomes
impaired or the business or businesses to which it relates are disposed of, at which time it will be taken to the profit and loss account or statement of
total recognised gains and losses where appropriate.
• Intangibles Other material intangible assets acquired, such as patents and trademarks, are capitalised and written off on the straight line basis over their
effective economic lives.
Accounting policies
77 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 T angible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. No depreciation is charged on freehold land or construction in progress.
Depreciation is charged on all other fixed assets on the straight line basis over the effective lives. Straight line depreciation rates vary according to 
the class of asset, but are typically:
Per annum
Freehold property 2% – 4%
Leasehold property (or at higher rates based on the life of the lease) 2% – 4%
Plant and machinery 3% – 10%
Cylinders 4% – 10%
Motor vehicles 7% – 20%
Computer hardware and major software 15% – 25%
• Until 30 September 1999, land and buildings were revalued periodically . Following the adoption of FRS15, land and buildings are no longer revalued.
At 1 October 1999, the net book value of assets previously revalued is regarded as the historical cost.
• Interest costs on major fixed asset additions are capitalised during the construction period and written off as part of the total cost.
• Where finance leases have been entered into, the capital element of the obligations to the lessor are shown as part of borrowings and the rights in the
corresponding assets are treated in the same way as owned fixed assets.
• Any impairment in the value of fixed assets, calculated by comparing the carrying value against the higher of the net realisable value or value in use,
is dealt with in the profit and loss account in the period in which it arises.
Investments
Investments which are held for the long term and in which the Group has a participating interest and exercises joint control with one or more other parties
are treated as joint ventures and accounted for on the gross equity method. Investments which are held for the long term and in which the Group has a
participating interest and exercises significant influence are treated as associates and accounted for on the equity method. In both cases, the Group’s share of
the results of the investment is included in the profit and loss account, and the Group’s share of the net assets is included in investments in the balance sheet.
Other investments are shown on the balance sheet at cost less any provision for impairment.
Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost where appropriate includes a proportion of overhead expenses.
Work in progress is stated at cost less progress payments received or receivable. Cost is arrived at principally on the average and ‘first-in, first-out’ (FIFO) basis.
The amount of long-term contracts, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales and after deducting foreseeable losses and payments on account, is included
in stocks as long-term contract amounts.
Deferred tax
The Group provides for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial
statements and their recognition for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are only recognised where it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Provisions
Provisions are made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where
appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
The Group uses financial instruments, including interest rate and currency swaps, to raise finance for its operations and to manage the risks arising from those
operations. All transactions are undertaken only to manage interest and currency risk associated with the Group’s underlying business activities and the
financing of those activities. The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
• Foreign exchange transaction exposuresThe Group generally hedges actual and forecast foreign exchange exposures up to two years ahead.
Forward contracts are used to hedge the forecast exposure and any gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on contracts designated 
as hedges of forecast foreign exchange are deferred until the financial period in which they are realised. If the contract ceases to be a hedge, any
subsequent gains and losses are recognised through the profit and loss account.
• Balance sheet translation exposures A large proportion of the Group’s net assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling. Where
practicable and cost effective the Group hedges these balance sheet translation exposures by borrowing in relevant currencies and markets and by 
the use of currency swaps. Currency swaps are used only as balance sheet hedging instruments, and the Group does not hedge the currency translation
of its profit and loss account. Exchange gains and losses arising on the notional principal of these currency swaps during their life and at termination or
maturity are dealt with as a movement in reserves. If the swap ceases to be a hedge of the underlying transaction, any subsequent gains or losses are
recognised in the profit and loss account.
• Interest rate risk exposuresThe Group hedges its exposure to movements in interest rates associated with its borrowings primarily by means 
of interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements. Interest payments and receipts on these agreements are included with net interest payable.
They are not revalued to fair value or shown on the Group balance sheet at the balance sheet date.

i) Litigation settlement
An action was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the Plan). The plaintiffs
brought this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly affected, alleging that the Plan improperly calculated lump sum distributions from the Plan in
violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle at US$69 million. The settlement
documents are being prepared. The settlement is subject to approval by the court at a fairness hearing. A provision of US$69 million has been made in the year .
Under UK accounting principles (FRS17), this has been recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account of the Group. It has been shown as an exceptional
item. The settlement will be paid out of Plan assets.
ii) Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs were incurred for various programmes including programmes under the business initiative announced in August 2001 . All of these programmes
have now been completed. The major restructuring programmes included the restructuring of BOC Edwards manufacturing capacity , investments in information
management systems and restructuring to deliver operational efficiencies in Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special Products. Cash flow from operating
activities includes an outflow of £28.3 million in 2003 (2002:£48.0 million, 2001:£22.4 million) in respect of these restructuring costs. Restructuring costs also include a
charge of £8.3 million (2002 and 2001:£nil) relating to the integration of BOC’s gases business and part of the Air Liquide business in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
iii) Write-downs of assets
The write-down in 2002 related to the merger of BOC’s gases business and part of the Air Liquide business in Japan to form Japan Air Gases. The net assets
of OSK (the existing BOC gases business in Japan), which had included an increase in the value of fixed assets through property revaluations in the 1980s and
early 1990s, were reduced to an appropriate amount based on valuations performed ahead of the merger . This resulted in a write-down of £32.7 million, of
which £11 .5 million was taken against the revaluation reserve and the balance of £21 .2 million was charged as an exceptional item in 2002.
The write-downs in 2001 related to the business initiative announced in August 2001 with the objective of releasing cash tied up in unproductive assets
and improving cash generation.
iv) Costs of proposed takeover
No costs were incurred in 2003 in respect of the proposed  takeover . The final costs associated with the pre-conditional offer for the Group were incurred in
2002 in respect of share options and other costs related to the retention of key employees.

v) In March 2002 BOC announced plans to merge its Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US to form a new company , Linde BOC Process
Plants LLC. The costs of £21 .3 million for closing BOC’s Process Plants business were charged as an exceptional item in 2002. This included severance costs
for 215 employees, the write-down of assets and the costs of winding down the business. Cash flow from operating activities above includes an outflow of 
£4.1 million (2002:£12.5 million, 2001:£nil) in respect of these exceptional costs.
In April 2002 BOC Edwards agreed the sale of its US glass coating business, resulting in a profit on disposal of £1 .1 million.
vi) In 2001 , proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets were £41 .2 million. Of this, £39.0 million was from those assets which were sold at a profit and 
£2.2 million was from those assets which were sold at a loss.

Overseas 284.9 268.7 275.8

d) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The total charge in future periods will be affected by any changes to the corporation tax rates in force in the countries in which the Group operates.
The current tax charges will also be affected by changes in the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation and the use of tax credits.
e) Unused tax credits
On a consolidated basis, the Group has net operating loss carryforwards of £51 .7 million. If not offset against taxable income, these losses will expire as follows:
Net
operating loss
Y ear £ million
2004 8.4
2005 –
2006 0.4
2007 –
2008 –
Thereafter , or no expiry date 42.9
For US Federal tax purposes, the Group has investment tax credits and general business tax credits to carry forward of approximately £12.9 million, which
are available to reduce income taxes otherwise payable. These do not expire until 2004 or thereafter .
In addition, the Group has alternative minimum tax credits for US Federal income tax purposes of approximately £24.8 million which can be carried
forward to reduce regular tax liabilities of future years. There is no expiration date on these credits.
Investment tax credits are accounted for by the flow-through method whereby they reduce income taxes currently payable and the provision for
income taxes in the period in which the assets giving rise to such credits are placed in service. Deferred tax assets, subject to the need for a valuation
allowance, are recognised to the extent that the investment tax credits are not currently utilised.

87 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 7.Options and incentive schemes
a) Policy
Executive options that are granted at the market price of the company’s shares at the time of the grant do not attract a compensation expense under UK GAAP .
For those executive options, including the Long-T erm Incentive Plan, that are granted at a discount to the market price of the company’s shares at the time of the
grant, the compensation expense is charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the option. The Group takes advantage of the exemption granted under
UITF17, Employee Share Schemes, whereby no compensation expense need be recorded for employee schemes that are granted at a discount.
b) Summary of movements
BOC operates share option schemes for both executives and employees. The features of these are given in the report on remuneration and the 
employees report.

88 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 8.Pensions and other retirement benefits
a) UK GAAP Group
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. The larger schemes are self-administered and the schemes’assets are held
independently of the Group’s finances. Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The UK defined benefit pension schemes were closed to new members with effect from 30 June 2003 and replaced with a new defined 
contribution plan.
On the advice of the actuaries, company contributions to the main UK scheme were resumed at a rate of 14.4 per cent of payroll on 1 October 2002.
Normal company contributions in respect of current service will reduce to 13.8 per cent from 1 October 2003 but, from that date, the company will make
additional contributions in order to reduce the funding valuation deficit. For the year to 30 September 2004, these additional contributions to the main UK
scheme will be £30 million.
In the US, company contributions to the pension plan remain suspended as the plan continues to be in surplus.
In Australia, company contributions recommenced on 1 October 2001 at rates ranging from 11 per cent to 17 per cent of payroll.
In South Africa, in accordance with legislation, company contributions were resumed on 7 December 2001 . They were increased in June 2003, and
currently range from 14.7 per cent to 21 .2 per cent of payroll. Under the Pension Funds Second Amendment Act 2001 , surpluses in pension funds have to
be used in a manner specified in Regulations to the Act to improve current and former members’benefits before the employer can obtain any benefit from
the surpluses. Consequently , it is considered unlikely that the company will obtain any benefit from the surpluses in the South African schemes. Therefore, in
accordance with FRS17, the surpluses at 30 September 2003 have been written off in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The current cost of defined benefit pension arrangements is calculated using an actuarial methodology known as ‘projected unit credit’. Under this
methodology , as the UK and South African defined benefit schemes, and the defined benefit guarantee of the Australian scheme, are closed to new
members, the current cost expressed as a percentage of pensionable salaries will tend to increase as members approach retirement.
The most recent actuarial funding valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries, in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 
30 September 2003 for the purposes of FRS17. Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 30 September 2003.

b) UK GAAP parent company
The company accounts for pension costs in accordance with FRS17 on retirement benefits. In accordance with the standard, the company treats
contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they were contributions to a defined contribution plan. This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of 
the defined benefit schemes cover a number of the Group’s UK undertakings and cannot readily be split between each undertaking on a consistent and
reliable basis.
The pension cost recognised in the company’s accounts is the total of company contributions payable to Group UK pension schemes in the year .
The assets of all Group UK pension schemes are held independently of the Group’s finances. The largest schemes are self-administered.

For the post retirement medical benefits plan at 30 September 2003, the initial health care cost trend rates for valuing the medical benefits and drug benefits
were 9.0 per cent (2002:10.0 per cent) and 3.5 per cent (2002:2.4 per cent) respectively . The rates for valuing medical benefits are assumed to reduce
gradually to 4.5 per cent in 2009 (2002: 4.5 per cent in 2009). The rates for valuing drug benefits are assumed to reduce gradually to 1 .1 per cent in 2010
(2002: 0.9 per cent in 2010).

10.Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
during the year .
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The company has only one category of dilutive potential shares:those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average
market price of the company’s shares during the year and where any performance conditions have been met at the balance sheet date.
Adjusted earnings per share (excluding exceptional items) are presented in order to show the underlying earnings performance of the Group.

pending exercise.
Loans and advances for the purchase of shares in trust have been made either by the company or its subsidiaries. If the value of shares in trust is
insufficient to cover the loans, the company and its subsidiaries will bear any loss. The company also bears administrative costs on an accruals basis.

c) Short-term interest rates
The average interest rate on commercial paper for the year to 30 September 2003 was 2.5 per cent (2002:3.4 per cent) and on other short-term
borrowings was 8.7 per cent (2002:9.0 per cent).
d) Facilities
The Group maintains a number of short and medium-term committed lines of credit. The main medium-term facilities are multi-currency agreements 
with a group of relationship banks, under which the Group may borrow up to US$450.0 million (£271 million) (2002:US$420.0 million (£268 million)) for
general corporate purposes. These facilities were undrawn both at 30 September 2003 and 30 September 2002. The following table shows the maturity
profile of these facilities.

certain overseas subsidiaries.
21.Financial instruments
a) Interest rate,currency and counterparty exposure
The Group’s approach to managing currency and interest rate risk and its use of swaps in that process is described on pages 47 and 48 in the financial review
under the heading ‘management of financial risks’.
Interest rate swaps
At 30 September 2003, the Group had entered into six interest rate swap agreements (2002:six) with its main relationship banks with notional principal
amounts of £417.6 million (2002:£420.0 million). The swaps’underlying currencies are sterling, US dollars and Japanese yen. The following table shows the
maturity profile and weighted average interest rates payable and receivable on interest rate swaps at 30 September:

The weighted average receivable/payable swap interest rate is calculated by applying the notional swap interest received or paid, using rates applicable at the
financial year end, to the notional principal of outstanding swaps at the financial year end.

Currency swaps
At 30 September 2003, the Group had entered into 13 currency swap agreements (2002:eight) with its main relationship banks with notional principal
amounts of £474.7 million (2002:£360.7 million). The maturity dates range between one month and 56 months from the balance sheet date (2002:between
one month and 33 months). The following table illustrates the impact of the currency swaps on the Group’s net debt at 30 September:

The weighted average receivable interest rate on currency swaps was 3.4 per cent (2002:4.0 per cent) and the weighted average payable interest rate was
2.9 per cent (2002:2.8 per cent). The weighted average receivable/payable swap interest rate is calculated by applying the notional swap interest received or
paid, using rates applicable at the financial year end, to the notional principal of outstanding swaps at the financial year end.
The currency and interest rate exposure of the net borrowings of the Group at 30 September , after taking into account interest rate and currency

Counterparty risk
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. There are procedures and policies in place limiting the Group’s exposure to concentrations of credit or
country risk.

1. For those bearing either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value. For those bearing a fixed rate of interest an assessment of the
interest rate at which the Group could make the same loan under current conditions has been made. Unless this differs significantly from the fixed rate it is also deemed that the carrying amount
approximates to the fair value. Where this does differ significantly , the fair value is based on the discounted value of future cash flows.
2. For equity instruments listed on a recognised stock exchange the fair value is the quoted market price. For other equity instruments it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the 
fair value.
3. The fair value is the quoted market price. Where no quoted market price exists, it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
4. As all bear either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
5. For those bearing a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value. For those bearing a fixed rate of interest the fair value is either the quoted market
price where a liquid market exists or has been calculated using well established pricing models.
6. The carrying amount is deemed to approximate to the fair value.
7. The fair value is the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay to terminate the agreements.
8. The fair value represents the net effect on the Group of closing out all outstanding contracts.
9. Includes foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements.
ii) Hedges
As explained on pages 47 and 48 of the financial review under the heading ‘management of financial risks’, the Group’s policies are to use forward foreign exchange
contracts to hedge transactional currency exposures (principally arising through anticipated sales and purchase transactions) and swap agreements to manage
interest rate risks and hedge structural currency exposures.
Currency swaps are only held to change the currency of the Group’s borrowings to match better its net investments in its overseas subsidiaries. In accordance
with the Group’s accounting policies, the assets and liabilities arising from these swap agreements are translated into sterling at the spot rate ruling at the balance sheet
date. The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses (to match the exchange gains or losses on the net
investments in the overseas subsidiaries).
The carrying amount of the swap agreements (as shown in note 21 b) i)) is the result of the exchange gains and losses recognised in the statement of
total recognised gains and losses, and is analysed in the deferred gains and losses table shown below.

c) Currency exposures
As outlined on page 47 in the financial review under the heading ‘currency risk’, it is the Group’s policy to hedge against the potential impact on its profit and
loss account of the currency gains and losses arising from monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the
operating unit involved.
After taking account of the hedging transactions, there was no significant net profit and loss account exposure to currency gains and losses arising from
monetary assets and liabilities at 30 September 2003.

The floating rate financial assets, which principally comprise cash and deposits, current asset investments and loans to joint ventures and associates,
carry interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial assets are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances, Australian bank bill rate

The floating rate financial liabilities principally comprise debt which carries interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial liabilities are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances, Australian bank bill
rate for Australian dollar balances, South African prime rate for South African rand balances and Japanese yen LIBOR for Japanese yen balances.
The maturity profile of borrowings is set out in note 20 b). Floating rate financial liabilities other than borrowings are mainly employee incentive
provisions. These are expected to be utilised over the period to 2011 depending on the future choices of the relevant employees. Financial liabilities on 
which no interest is paid principally relate to creditors due after more than one year . The majority of the amount relates to deposits for cylinder rentals.
It is not anticipated that this balance will reduce significantly in the short to medium term. The remaining balances falling due after more than one year 
are expected to be paid or utilised by 2006.

Notes to the financial statements continued
108 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 22.Provisions for liabilities and charges continued
Incentive and other employee provisions include long-term share incentive units and deferred compensation plans. Note 7 contains further details of the
long-term share incentive units.
Provision for uninsured losses covers third party liabilities or claims. Due to the time frame that is often involved in such claims, a significant part of this
provision is subject to actuarial valuation. Where this is not appropriate, other external assessments are used.
The restructuring provisions represent expenditure to be incurred on major reorganisations. In 2003 £28.3 million was spent of which £4.3 million was
provided for at 30 September 2002 and £0.8 million was provided for at 30 September 2001 . The provisions remaining at 30 September 2003 consist mainly
of redundancy costs and will be spent during 2004.
Environmental provisions have been set aside to cover the costs of remediation for a number of hazardous waste sites. The costs are expected to be
incurred between 2003 and 2030. Due to the period over which this expenditure is likely to be incurred, the provision has been discounted at a rate of 
four per cent. The effect of discounting is £6 million.
Other provisions are principally for warranty and legal costs.
Further information on deferred tax is disclosed in note 4.

The undistributed profits of Group undertakings may be liable to overseas and/or UK tax (after allowing for double tax relief) if distributed as dividends.
There are no material exchange control restrictions on the remittance of funds to the UK.
Goodwill written off against reserves in respect of continuing businesses acquired prior to 30 September 1998 amounts to £178.3 million (2002:
£166.2 million). The increase in the year principally reflects movements in exchange rates.
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy , unrealised exchange gains (net of losses) on net borrowings at 30 September 2003 included in
reserves amounted to £20.4 million (2002:£10.2 million).
There are no non-equity shareholders’interests in the share capital and reserves of the Group.

The reduction in guarantees of joint ventures’borrowings and other guarantees in 2003 relates to BOC’s joint venture in Mexico. In March 2003, the joint
venture fulfilled a series of operational and contractual tests that resulted in the release of the parental guarantee of third party borrowings and a reduction in
an operational performance bond.
b) Legal proceedings
Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings, including some in which claims for damages in large amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors believe that such litigation should be
disposed of without material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition or profitability .
Welding fumes litigation 
BOC has been named in numerous lawsuits in the US alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes. Many of these cases were filed during 2003. Certain of
these cases have been either filed in, or transferred for pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where a multi-district
litigation (MDL) proceeding has been commenced. The MDL proceeding is still at an early stage. The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial
proceedings in cases pending in different federal district courts in the US. In addition to the cases in federal court, BOC is a defendant in a number of similar
cases pending in state courts. These cases are in different stages of procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for trial from time to time.
From the time it purchased Airco in 1978 until this year , BOC had never had an adverse jury verdict returned against it in a case alleging injury from
exposure to welding fumes. On 28 October 2003, a jury in Madison County , Illinois, rendered a verdict against BOC and two co-defendants. The jury
awarded US$1 million to Mr Elam, a former labourer who asserted that his idiopathic Parkinson’s disease was attributable to his exposure to welding fumes
over a period of years. BOC believes that the verdict is inconsistent with the decisions rendered by juries in previous cases, is not supported by the existing
scientific evidence and intends to pursue vigorously its post-trial and appeal rights.
BOC believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in these various proceedings related to alleged injury from exposure to welding fumes
and intends to defend vigorously such claims. Based on BOC’s experience to date, together with BOC’s current assessment of the merits of the claims being
asserted, and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made.
Fluorogas litigation 
In February 2003, the company was notified that a jury verdict in the US District Court for the Western District of T exas was obtained for US$132 million
against Fluorogas Limited, The BOC Group Inc and The BOC Group plc. The verdict arises primarily out of an alleged breach of a memorandum of
understanding by Fluorogas Limited before it was acquired by The BOC Group plc in September 2001 . In March 2003, the court also awarded interest 
and costs against the defendants, making them jointly and severally liable for a total of US$174 million. A bond for the full amount has been posted with 
the Court as part of the normal appeals process.
The company believes that the jury’s verdict reflects a misunderstanding of the law and does not reflect the facts of any loss that may have been suffered
by the plaintiff. The company is challenging the verdict through the appropriate appeals process in the US and hence no provision has been made. In addition,
Fluorogas Limited was placed in administration under the Insolvency Act of 1986 pursuant to an order of the English Courts. In a related proceeding in a US
Bankruptcy Court, the UK administrators have obtained injunctive relief preventing the plaintiff in the Fluorogas litigation from commencing or continuing any
action or proceeding enforcing any judgement against Fluorogas Limited in the US.
ERISA Litigation
An action was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the Plan). The plaintiffs
brought this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly affected, alleging that the Plan improperly calculated lump sum distributions from the Plan
in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The maximum potential liability could have reached US$116 million and any award would be
paid out of Plan assets.
The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle at US$69 million. The settlement documents are being prepared. The settlement is subject
to approval by the court at a fairness hearing. A provision of US$69 million has been made in the financial statements. Under UK accounting principles
(FRS17), this has been recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account of the Group. It has been shown as an exceptional item.

30.US accounting information
a) Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles and other US accounting information
The financial statements of The BOC Group plc are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK (UK GAAP), which differ
in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the US (US GAAP).
Set out below is a summary of the more significant adjustments which would be required if US GAAP had been applied, together with reconciliations
of net profit, other comprehensive income and shareholders’ funds from a UK GAAP to a US GAAP basis. Also presented on a US GAAP basis are a
movement in shareholders’ funds, a consolidated cash flow statement, information on earnings per share, information on stock based compensation and
details of recently issued US accounting pronouncements.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Under UK GAAP , goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1998 accounted for under the purchase method has been eliminated against shareholders’ funds.
Additionally , UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal or closure of a business, any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders’ funds is then
charged against income. The Group adopted FRS10 in 1999, which requires goodwill on subsequent acquisitions to be capitalised and amortised over a
period not exceeding 20 years.
Under US GAAP , following the adoption of SFAS142 (Goodwill and other Intangible Assets), which was effective for the Group from 1 October 2002,
goodwill continues to be capitalised, although amortisation is no longer charged to the income statement. Instead, an annual impairment test is carried out,
with any identified impairment loss recorded in the income statement. Other intangible assets with a finite life continue to be amortised under both UK and
US GAAP . UK GAAP is highly prescriptive with regard to the recognition of intangible assets, although US GAAP rules result in the recognition of a greater
amount of intangible assets. Therefore, differences arise in the classification of some intangible assets and goodwill between UK and US GAAP . Amortisation
that has been charged against goodwill under UK GAAP is added back in the reconciliation to net income on a US GAAP basis.
Impairment of goodwill
Under UK GAAP , goodwill impairment reviews are carried out at the end of the first financial year following an acquisition, and also when an indicator of
impairment exists. The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill with the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use.
Under US GAAP , goodwill impairment reviews are also conducted when an indicator of impairment exists, in addition to an annual goodwill
impairment test, as required by SFAS142. The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its fair value. Where the
carrying value is greater than the fair value, the impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of goodwill in the reporting unit over the implied
fair value of the goodwill.
Profit or loss on the partial disposal of Group companies
Under UK GAAP (UITF 31), gains on the partial disposal of Group companies involving non-monetary consideration are recorded in the statement of total
recognised gains and losses. Under US GAAP , such gains and losses are recorded in the income statement.
Deferred tax
The Group adopted FRS19 (Deferred tax) in 2002 for UK GAAP purposes. This requires that full provision for deferred tax is recognised in the financial
statements. The adoption of FRS19 has eliminated most of the differences that previously existed between UK GAAP and US GAAP in the accounting
for deferred tax. As a result, the tax adjustment now primarily relates to the deferred tax effect of other US GAAP adjustments.
Revaluation of fixed assets
UK GAAP allowed for the periodic revaluation of land and buildings with depreciation then being calculated on the revalued amount. Any surplus or deficit
(to the extent that the revaluation reserve was in surplus) on the revaluation was then taken directly to shareholders’ funds. With the Group’s adoption of
FRS15 in 2000, the Group no longer revalues fixed assets. Under US GAAP , revaluations of fixed assets are not permitted and, as a result, the reconciliation
restates fixed assets to historical cost. The depreciation charge and any write downs of previously revalued assets are adjusted accordingly.
Impairment of tangible fixed assets
Under UK GAAP , a tangible fixed asset is reviewed for impairment if an indication exists that the asset may be impaired. If necessary , an impairment loss 
is recorded. A value in use calculation is carried out, based on discounted pre-tax future cash flows from the asset (or income generating unit to which the 
asset belongs).
Under US GAAP , a preliminary review of the tangible fixed asset is carried out using undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted future cash
flows are less than the asset’s carrying value, an impairment loss is required. The impairment loss will be calculated using discounted future cash flows, or the
asset’s market value.
Under US GAAP , the reversal of previously recognised impairment losses is not permitted.
Restructuring costs
Under UK GAAP , when a decision has been taken to restructure, supported by a detailed formal plan and the creation of a valid expectation in those 
affected that the restructuring will take place, the necessary provisions are made for impairment of asset values together with severance and other costs.
Under US GAAP (SFAS146), the requirements for charging restructuring costs to income are more prescriptive and all significant actions arising from
the restructuring plan and their completion dates must be identified by the balance sheet date.
Notes to the financial statements continued
116 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 30.US accounting information continued
Pensions
For UK GAAP reporting (FRS17 – Retirement benefits), the pension asset or liability in the balance sheet represents the difference between the market value
of pension scheme assets at the balance sheet date and the present value of pension scheme liabilities at that date, net of deferred tax.
Under US GAAP (SFAS87), plan assets are valued by reference to market-related value at the date of the financial statements. Liabilities are assessed
using the rate of return obtainable on fixed or inflation-linked bonds.
FRS17 requires that past service costs are recognised in full in the period in which they become vested. SFAS87 requires past service costs to be
amortised over the remaining service lives of the employees to whom the amendments relate.
There is a significant difference in the treatment of actuarial gains and losses arising during the accounting period. UK GAAP recognises the actuarial gains
and losses in full in the year in which they arise in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. Under US GAAP , the actuarial gains and losses which exceed
ten per cent of the value of the assets or liabilities at the start of the accounting period are amortised over the remaining service lives of scheme members.
Where an additional minimum liability exists under US GAAP , (ie where the amount provided for any scheme does not cover the unfunded
accumulated benefit obligation for that scheme), this must be recognised in the balance sheet under SFAS87. The adjustment resulting from the recognition
of an additional minimum liability is reported as an intangible asset to the extent of the unrecognised prior service cost, after eliminating amounts previously
shown as a prepaid benefit cost. Any excess above these amounts is reported in comprehensive income.
Post retirement medical costs
For UK GAAP reporting (FRS17 – Retirement benefits), the post retirement medical liability is discounted using the bond yield on suitable high quality
corporate bonds, and disclosed net of related deferred tax.
For US GAAP (SFAS106), the liabilities are assessed and discounted using the rates of return obtainable on high quality fixed income investments.
Differences between the UK and US GAAP figures arise largely from the treatment of actuarial gains and losses.
Securities investments
Under UK GAAP , current asset investments (of all types) are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, or
alternatively , at market value or at directors’valuation.
Under US GAAP , securities which are determined to be ‘available-for -sale’are stated at fair value and any unrealised gains or losses included as a separate
component of shareholders’ funds. The deferred tax consequences of unrealised gains or losses are also charged or credited to shareholders’ funds.
Employee share option plans (ESOPs) and other share options
Under UK GAAP , shares held by the ESOPs are recorded as fixed asset investments at cost, less a provision in accordance with UITF17. No cost is accrued
for share options awarded under employee share schemes where the price of the options is below the market value at the date of grant because they are
considered non-compensatory .
Under US GAAP , these shares and other shares held in trust are recorded as treasury stock at cost in the balance sheet as a deduction from
shareholders’ funds. A charge is made against net income where options in executive share option plans become vested in accordance with APB 
Opinion 25.
Contingent consideration
Under UK GAAP , contingent consideration is provided for as a liability when the likelihood of payment is considered to be probable.
Under US GAAP , contingent consideration is not recognised until the liability is determined beyond reasonable doubt. The elimination of contingent
consideration for US GAAP purposes also impacts on the value of goodwill arising on acquisitions, therefore there is no net impact on shareholders’ funds.
Financial instruments
The Group enters into a number of currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to currency and
interest rate risks. Under UK GAAP , such instruments are shown at their carrying value.
Under US GAAP , these instruments are marked to market and any change in value is recognised in either the income statement or through
comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS133 depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, the type 
of hedge transaction.
Accounting for swaps
Under UK GAAP , gains or losses on closing out interest rate swap contracts taken to hedge the Group’s fixed/floating interest rate position can be taken to
profit immediately .
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the remaining hedge period.
Share of results and net assets of joint ventures and associates
The Group’s share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates (as calculated under UK GAAP) is shown within fixed asset investments.
For the purposes of the reconciliations set out below, the Group’s share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates has been adjusted to
recognise a difference in the method of reporting profits under US GAAP .
Sale and leaseback transactions
Under UK GAAP , any profit or loss on the sale and operating leaseback of fixed assets can generally be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the contract lease period.
Comprehensive income
Under US GAAP , SFAS130 establishes requirements for the reporting of comprehensive income and its components (revenue, expenses, gains and losses)
in a full set of general purpose financial statements. Components of comprehensive income for the Group determined on a UK GAAP basis include profit for
the financial year , pension actuarial gains and losses, and foreign currency translation gains and losses. Information regarding the Group’s foreign currency
translation gains and losses is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses under UK GAAP on page 75.

f) Consolidated cash flow statement 
The Group cash flow statement on page 74 has been prepared in accordance with UK accounting standard FRS1 , the objectives and principles of which are
similar to those set out in US accounting principle SFAS95, Statement of Cash Flows. The principal differences between the standards relate to classification 
of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under FRS1 , cash flows are presented separately for:a) operating activities;b) dividends from joint ventures and associates;c) returns on investments
and servicing of finance;d) tax paid;e) capital expenditure and financial investment; f) acquisitions and disposals;g) equity dividends paid;h) management of
liquid resources;and i) financing. Under SFAS95, however , only three categories of cash flow activity are reported:a) operating activities;b) investing activities;
and c) financing activities. Dividends from joint ventures and associates, cash flows from returns on investments and servicing of finance (excluding dividends
paid to minorities) and tax paid under FRS1 would be included in operating activities under SFAS95;capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals would
be included in investing activities under SFAS95;equity dividends would be included as a financing activity under SFAS95.
Under FRS1 , cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less overdrafts from any qualifying
financial institution repayable on demand. Under SFAS95, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits but also includes cash equivalents which are short-term,
highly liquid investments. Generally only investments with original maturities of three months or less come within this definition.
Set out below, for illustrative purposes, is a summary consolidated statement of cash flows under SFAS95.

119 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 30.US accounting information continued
g) Stock-based compensation
For US reporting purposes the company applies APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations, in accounting for 
its share option plans. By applying this statement the employee share schemes are deemed non-compensatory and therefore do not result in an expense for
financial reporting purposes. With the exception of the Long-T erm Incentive Plan, grants of share options under executive schemes are at the market price of
the company’s shares at the time of grant. The schemes are deemed compensatory and a charge is only recognised when certain performance conditions are
met.
If compensation cost for the Group’s share option plans had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans
consistent with the method of SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Group’s net income under US GAAP would have been:
2003 2002 2001
£ million £ million £ million
Reported net income 264.3 255.4 234.2

Diluted – as reported 53.6 51.9 47.9
Diluted – pro forma 52.2 51.0 46.5
The Black-Scholes model was used to measure the compensation expense under SFAS123. The assumptions used for grants in 2003 included a dividend
yield of 4.5 per cent (2002:4.0 per cent, 2001:4.0 per cent), expected share price volatility of 30.6 per cent (2002:31 .0 per cent, 2001:30.0 per cent),
a weighted average expected life of 5.0 years (2002:5.0 years, 2001:4.2 years) and a weighted average interest rate of 4.0 per cent (2002:4.9 per cent,
2001:5.1 per cent). The weighted average interest rate is based on UK Gilts on the date of grant with a maturity similar to the related options.
h) Recently issued accounting pronouncements implemented in the year
SFAS142 – Goodwill and other intangible assets
SFAS142 became effective for the Group on 1 October 2002. The statement removes the requirement to amortise goodwill and certain other intangible
assets, and instead, requires an annual impairment review to be carried out on these items. The impact of this standard is reflected in the US accounting
information for the year to 30 September 2003.
The following table reflects net income for comparative periods prior to the adoption of SFAS142 as if the statement’s non-amortisation provisions had
been adopted at the beginning of the respective periods.

Balance at 30 September 59.5 82.7 121 .0 11 .6 0.7 2.7 278.2
There were no impairments of goodwill during the year .
SFAS143 – Accounting for asset retirement obligations
SFAS143 became effective for the Group on 1 October 2002. The statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
recognised in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalised as
part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The standard has not had a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group in the year .
SFAS144 – Accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets
SFAS144 became effective for the Group on 1 October 2002. The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets, and it establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of. The standard has not had a material impact on the results
or financial position of the Group in the year .
Notes to the financial statements continued
120 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 30.US accounting information continued
SFAS146 – Accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
SFAS146 is effective for all exit or disposal activities initiated after 31 December 2002. The statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities. It requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognised when the liability is
incurred, rather than the date at which a commitment is made to an exit or disposal plan. The impact of the standard is reflected in restructuring costs in the
US GAAP reconciliation statements.
SFAS148 – Accounting for stock-based compensation – transition and disclosure – an amendment to SFAS123
In December 2002, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS148. This statement provides alternative methods of transition for companies
electing to adopt a fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS123
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, but makes no changes to the fair value principles of SFAS123.
The Group has complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS148 in note 30 g) in the current year . There is no impact on the results or financial
position of the Group, as the Group applies APB Opinion 25 for the treatment of stock-based compensation.
SFAS149 – Amendment of Statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities
In April 2003, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS149. This statement amends and clarifies financial reporting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. This statement is effective for contracts entered
into or modified after 30 June 2003, and has not had a material effect on the results or financial position in the current period. Management does not believe
that this statement will have a material effect on the Group’s results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
SFAS150 – Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both debt and equity
In May 2003, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS150. This statement establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity . Some financial instruments will be classified as a liability , and others will be classified as equity .
This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after 31 May 2003 and has not had a material effect on the results or financial
position in the current period. Management does not believe that this statement will have a material effect on the Group’s results and financial position under
US GAAP in future periods.
EITF 00-21 – Accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables
In May 2003, the Emerging Issues T ask Force (EITF) finalised amendments made to Issue 00-21 following a consensus being reached in November 2002.
Issue 00-21 addresses certain aspects of accounting by a seller , especially relating to the identification of single units of accounting for arrangements where 
the company will perform multiple revenue-generating activities. Issue 00-21 is effective prospectively for arrangements initiated on or after 1 July 2003.
Issue 00-21 has not had a material impact on the Group’s results and financial position in the current period. Management does not believe that this issue 
will have a material effect on the results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
EITF 01-8 – Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
In May 2003, the Emerging Issues T ask Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue 01-8. Issue 01-8 provides guidance for determining whether an
arrangement contains a lease that is within the scope of SFAS13 Accounting for Leases. If it is determined that a lease exists, the lease and non-lease
components of a combined sales arrangement must be accounted for separately . Issue 01-8 is effective prospectively for arrangements initiated, modified,
or acquired after 1 July 2003.
Management is currently evaluating the impact of EITF Issue 01-8 on its on-site supply agreements, and assessing the impact that this issue is likely to 
have in future periods. Issue 01-8 has not had a material impact on the Group’s results and financial position in respect of new or modified arrangements in
the current period under US GAAP .
i) Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet implemented
FIN46 – Consolidation of variable interest entities
In January 2003, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation Number (FIN) 46. In the current period, this interpretation is
applicable to all variable interest entities created after 31 January 2003. It will apply to all variable interest entities for accounting periods beginning after 
31 December 2003. This interpretation requires the primary beneficiary to consolidate a variable interest entity if it holds a variable interest that will absorb 
a majority of the entity’s expected losses if they occur , receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns if they occur , or both. This interpretation 
has not had a material effect on the results or financial position in the current period. Management is currently assessing whether this interpretation is likely 
to have a material effect on the Group’s results and financial position under US GAAP in future periods.
j) Other information
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
31.Post balance sheet events
a) On 17 November 2003, the Group’s South African subsidiary company African Oxygen Limited announced that it had agreed to sell its entire holding 
in Afrox Healthcare Limited. At that date, the estimated impact of the transaction was a reduction of a maximum of 1 .5p in Group earnings per share 
for the year to 30 September 2003. The sale remains subject to certain conditions, including clearance from the relevant competition and other 
regulatory authorities.
b) An action was filed against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the Plan) in the US. At the time of the preliminary announcement of the
Group’s results on 13 November 2003, no provision was made in respect of this case, as at that time the outcome of the litigation was uncertain and the
amount of any loss could not be reliably estimated. Subsequently , the parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle at US$69 million, subject 
to approval by the court at a fairness hearing. Under UK accounting principles (FRS17) this amount has been recognised as a charge in the profit and loss
account of the Group. It has been shown as an exceptional item. The settlement will be paid out of Plan assets.

Ordinary shares
The company has paid cash dividends on its Ordinary shares in every year since 1899. Since 1988, the dividend policy has been to pay two interim dividends,
one in February and one in August. The dividends are reported in the accounts in the year in which they are paid.
Two dividends were paid in 2003. A first interim dividend of 15.5p (net) per share was paid in February and a second interim dividend of 23.5p (net) 
per share was paid in August. Future dividends of the company will be dependent upon future earnings, the financial position of the company and other
factors. A first interim dividend of 15.5p (net) per share has been declared for payment on 2 February 2004.

125 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 T axation
A summary of the principal tax consequences for certain beneficial holders of Ordinary shares of BOC and ADSs representing Ordinary shares is set 
out below. This summary applies to citizens or residents of the UK or US, or otherwise who are subject to UK tax or US federal income tax on a net income
basis in respect of such securities. It is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of all of the potential tax consequences of holding Ordinary shares or
ADSs and does not purport to deal with persons who hold their Ordinary shares or ADSs in special circumstances, such as financial institutions, tax exempt
organisations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, persons who own, directly or indirectly or by attribution, ten per cent or more of the outstanding
share capital or voting stock of BOC, persons holding Ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a ‘hedge’, ‘straddle’or other risk reduction transaction, or who
acquired such Ordinary shares or ADSs through the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation. All holders and investors are
advised to consult their tax advisors on the tax implications of their particular holdings, including the consequences under applicable state and local law.
The statements of tax laws set out below are based on the laws in force at the date of this report unless otherwise noted, and are subject to any
subsequent changes in UK and US law, or in any double tax convention between the UK and the US.
UK shareholders
The following information applies to individuals who hold Ordinary shares and who are resident or ordinarily resident in the UK for UK tax purposes 
(UK resident holders).
T axation of capital gains 
A UK resident holder will be liable to UK tax on the gain from the disposal of Ordinary shares. For the purposes of calculating the gain from the disposal of
Ordinary shares, a UK resident holder who held Ordinary shares prior to 31 March 1982 may substitute the market value of such shares as at that date for
the original cost of such shares. The market value of Ordinary shares on 31 March 1982 was 168.75p per Ordinary share.
A UK resident holder may also be entitled to indexation relief and taper relief when selling shares. Indexation relief is calculated on the market value of
shares held at 31 March 1982 and on the cost of any subsequent purchases from that date. Indexation relief is not available for periods after 1 April 1998.
T aper relief provides UK resident holders with relief from tax on gains accrued on the disposal of Ordinary shares held or acquired after 5 April 1998. The
amount of taper relief available depends on the length of time such shares have been held and on the UK resident holder’s individual facts and circumstances.
T axation of dividends 
A UK resident holder is entitled to a tax credit on receipt of a cash dividend. The tax credit is a fixed proportion of the dividend and is currently 
1
/9
th of the
cash dividend received.
The income subject to UK income tax is the sum of the dividend and the attached tax credit, with the tax credit being available as a deduction against any
resulting tax liability .
Special rates of tax apply to dividend income:the ‘ordinary rate’is ten per cent and applies to individuals liable to tax at the basic or lower rates of tax;the
‘upper rate’is 32.5 per cent which applies to the extent that income exceeds the basic rate band.
For a UK resident holder liable to income tax only at the basic or lower rates of tax, there will thus be no further tax liability in respect of the dividend
received. If, however , the UK resident holder is subject to income tax at the higher rate there will be a further tax liability on the sum of the cash dividend
received and the associated tax credit. Where a UK resident holder’s tax liability is less than the associated tax credit, no refund is available.
By way of example, the payment by BOC of a cash dividend of £90 would have an associated tax credit of £10 and a UK resident holder is treated as
receiving a gross dividend of £100. The upper rate tax of 32.5 per cent on the gross dividend is £32.50. Therefore the UK resident holder liable to tax at the
upper rate will have a tax liability of £22.50, being the tax liability on the gross dividend of £32.50 less the tax credit of £10.
Stamp duty 
Stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5 per cent of consideration payable is normally payable on the purchase price of shares.
Inheritance tax 
Individual shareholders may be liable to inheritance tax on the transfer of Ordinary shares. Inheritance tax may be charged on the amount by which the value
of a shareholder’s estate is reduced as a result of any transfer by way of gift or other gratuitous transaction made by them or treated as made by them.
US holders
For the purposes of this summary , a US holder is a beneficial owner of ADSs who is an individual citizen or resident of the US, a corporation or other entity
organised under the laws of the US or any state thereof, an estate whose income is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its source, or a trust if a
court within the US is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust.
US holders should be aware that a new UK-US Income T ax Convention, as amended by a Protocol to the Convention signed on 19 July 2002, came 
into force on 31 March 2003 (the New Convention). The New Convention generally will have effect in respect of dividends paid on or after 1 May 2003.
However , a US holder entitled to benefits under the US-UK Income T ax Convention that came into force on 25 April 1980, as amended by Protocols 
(the 1980 Convention) may elect to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue in their entirety for an additional 12 months if the election to apply
the 1980 Convention would result in greater benefits to the holder . If a US holder were to make an effective election, the discussion below with respect to
dividend payments made pursuant to the 1980 Convention would continue to apply to dividends paid by the company prior to 1 May 2004. The discussion
below notes the instances where the relevant provisions of the New Convention will produce a materially different result for a US holder . US holders should
note that certain articles in the New Convention limit or restrict the ability of a US holder to claim benefits under the New Convention and that similar
provisions were not contained in the 1980 Convention. US holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of both Conventions.
US holders of ADSs are treated as owners of underlying Ordinary shares for the purposes of the New Convention, the 1980 Convention and the
convention relating to estate and gift tax (the Estate T ax Convention) and for the purposes of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).
Shareholder information continued
126 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 T axation of dividends 
Under current UK tax legislation, no tax will be withheld from dividend payments made by BOC. Under the 1980 Convention US holders of ADSs are treated
as receiving dividend income equal to the sum of the dividend and the associated tax credit, reduced by UK withholding tax at a rate not exceeding 15 per cent
of the amount of the dividend and the associated tax credit. As the tax credit is equal to 
1
/9
th of the dividend the withholding tax is equal to the tax credit.
This will be the case where the holding is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base in the UK and provided that the
shareholder is not subject to the special rules of the 1980 Convention such as those applying to US tax-exempt entities and certain investment or holding
companies where 25 per cent of the capital is held directly or indirectly by persons who are not individual residents or nationals of the US.
Thus, under the 1980 Convention, a US holder receiving a dividend of £90 will be treated as receiving taxable income of £100 less UK withholding 
tax of £10. No refund of UK tax is available.
Dividends received by a US holder will be foreign source income for US federal income tax purposes in the amount equal to the US dollar value of the
gross dividend (that is the sum of the dividend and the associated tax credit), on the date of such payment. Generally dividends will not be eligible for the
‘dividends received’deduction allowed to US corporations under the Code. Subject to certain limitations, the UK tax treated as withheld from payments will
be available as a credit against US tax.
Under the New Convention which generally applies with respect to dividends paid on or after 1 May 2003 (unless an effective election is made to
extend the applicability of the 1980 Convention) a US holder has no right to receive the associated tax credit with the dividend payment made by BOC.
US holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether they are eligible for benefits under the 1980 Convention and the New
Convention, whether , and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received from BOC, and whether it may be
advisable in light of the holder’s particular circumstances to elect to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue in force until 1 May 2004.
Recent United States tax law changes applicable to individuals
Recent US tax legislation (the 2003 T ax Act) generally has reduced the rates of tax payable by individuals (as well as certain trusts and estates) on many items
of income. Under the 2003 T ax Act, the marginal tax rates applicable to ordinary income generally have been lowered with effect from 1 January 2003.
In addition, for capital assets held for over one year and sold or exchanged on or after 6 May 2003 but in taxable years beginning before 1 January 2009, the
maximum applicable US federal rate of tax generally will be 15 per cent (rather than the higher rates of tax generally applicable to items of ordinary income).
Furthermore, ‘qualified dividend income’received by individuals in taxable years beginning after 31 December 2002 and beginning before 1 January 2009,
generally will be taxed at a maximum US federal rate of 15 per cent (rather than the higher rates of tax generally applicable to other items of ordinary
income) provided certain holding period requirements are met. For this purpose, ‘qualified dividend income’generally includes dividends paid on stock in US
corporations as well as dividends paid on stock in certain non-US corporations if, among other things, (i) the shares of the non-US corporation (including
ADSs) are readily tradable on an established securities market in the US, or (ii) the non-US corporation is eligible with respect to substantially all of its income
for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the US which contains an exchange of information program. The New Convention has been
identified by the US T reasury as a qualifying treaty . BOC currently anticipates that dividends paid with respect to Ordinary shares and ADSs should constitute
‘qualified dividend income’ for US federal income tax purposes and that US holders who are individuals should be entitled to the reduced rates of tax,
as applicable. However , the precise extent to which dividends paid by non-US corporations will constitute ’qualified dividend income’and the effect of such
status on the ability of a taxpayer to utilise any associated foreign tax credits is not entirely clear at present. It is anticipated that there will be administrative
pronouncements concerning these provisions in the future. In the meantime, US holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the impact 
of the provisions of the 2003 T ax Act on their particular situation.
T axation of capital gains 
Generally , a US holder who is not resident or ordinarily resident in the UK for tax purposes should not be subject to UK tax on any gain from the disposal of
ADSs, but will be subject to US tax on any capital gain realised on the sale or other disposal of ADSs.
US information reporting and backup withholding
Dividend payments with respect to ADSs and proceeds from the sale or other disposal of ADSs may be subject to information reporting to the US Internal
Revenue Service and backup withholding at a current rate of 28 per cent. Holders should consult their own advisors as to the application to them of the
information reporting and backup withholding rules.
Stamp duty 
In practice no UK stamp duty is payable on the transfer of an ADS, provided that the separate instrument of transfer is not executed in, and always remains
outside of, the UK. No stamp duty reserve tax is payable on an agreement to transfer ADSs.
Estate and gift tax 
Under the Estate T ax Convention, a US holder generally is not subject to UK inheritance tax.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders 
There are currently no exchange controls or other limitations in the UK affecting security holders.

Chairman’s statement
“Our strategy is to 
deliver superior returns”
Last year I stated your board’s commitment to a strategy
of delivering superior returns for shareholders based on
sustained growth in earnings and improvements in capital
efficiency. This requires increasing the scale and scope of BOC
while continuously improving the efficiency and productivity 
of capital and other resources.
Consistent strategy
Your company reviews and tests its strategy thoroughly
each year. The requirements and expectations of shareholders
are compared with objective analysis of what the business can
and should deliver. This combination of top-down expectations
with bottom-up capabilities gives a rigorous framework for
debate. When Tony Isaac and his management team have
completed their work, the board reviews and tests it in detail.
Last year I described the forward programme for BOC’s
management and staff as ambitious and the board is pleased
with the progress being made.
Within the corporate strategy each line of business and
the specialist businesses have their own strategies. The clarity 
of direction this gives is of great assistance to your board in
overseeing proposed acquisitions, strategic moves and the
general progress of efficiency initiatives.
Last year I included two graphs looking at BOC’s financial
performance over the two-year period since the bid lapsed.
The same graphs are reproduced here, updated with this year’s
data. The first shows total shareholder returns relative to all
FTSE100 companies to 30 September this year. The second
compares BOC’s performance with its main global gases
competitors. They again show your company’s strong
performance compared with other UK companies and the
competitive challenge presented by its global peers.
Dividends
In 2003 BOC paid a first interim dividend of 15.5p per
share in February and a second interim dividend of 23.5p per
share in August. The total of 39p was an increase of 2.6 per
cent on the year before. This year, in line with its established
policy, the board again proposes a first interim dividend for
2004 of 15.5p. Any increase will be reflected in the second
interim dividend announced with our half year results.
Corporate governance
Your company has been at the forefront when it comes 
to implementing best practice in corporate governance and
financial matters. Its implementation last year of the new
accounting standard FRS19, and the full implementation of
FRS17 well in advance of this being required, is an indication 
of an open and transparent culture. This year in the UK we 
had the recommendations from the Higgs and Smith reviews
that were subsequently incorporated in a modified form 
into a new Combined Code. BOC contributed fully to the
consultation phase of the Higgs review and I believe the end
result strengthens corporate governance in an effective way.
Your company is substantially complying with the revised
Combined Code this year, ahead of it being required.
Corporate social responsibility
BOC consistently takes an ethical view of its responsibilities 
in pursuing profitable business. Leadership comes from 
Tony Isaac and the senior management team. BOC is also a
very practical organisation, preferring to implement, test and
refine what it does before making claims in the wider world.
This year BOC developed and launched its Code of Conduct.
There were many existing policies, but the Code of Conduct
process brought these into one programme together with 
new and amended policies. The code energised the whole of
the company during its development and roll out.

It is more important to be socially responsible than to 
seek out awards for social responsibility. It happens that others
have given recognition to BOC’s achievements in this area.
For instance, in the UK last year BOC’s environmental
performance was ranked by Business in the Environment in 
the top 25 per cent of FTSE companies participating in its
survey; the investment community voting in Investor Relations
magazine ranked BOC in the top five of FTSE100 companies
for the best practice of corporate responsibility; and Gist,
our logistics business, won the Motor Transport magazine’s
environmental award. In South Africa, Afrox’s community
involvement programme is used by the United Nations as a
global case study of how an employee-driven, sustainable 
social development programme should work.
Board of directors
This year I was delighted to welcome John Bevan and 
Andrew Bonfield to your board. John is chief executive of 
Process Gas Solutions and, being an Australian, adds yet
another nationality to what is an already very diverse board.
Andrew brings his financial experience and knowledge of
international business to our discussions. I would also like to
congratulate two of my board colleagues who have been
honoured this year: Sir Christopher O’Donnell received 
his knighthood in the Queen’s birthday honours list while 
Dr ‘Raj’ Rajagopal was awarded the Sir Eric Mensforth
International Manufacturing Gold Medal by the Institution of
Electrical Engineers and subsequently was elected a Fellow 
of the Royal Academy of Engineering.
During the year Göran Lundberg and Dick Grant 
stepped down from the board. We wish them both well for
the future. Göran was replaced by Sir Christopher as senior
independent director and by Julie Baddeley as chairman of the
remuneration committee.
Thank you
The board would like to thank all BOC’s people 
around the world for their efforts in what have been testing
economic conditions. We would also like to thank all BOC’s
customers, with whom we seek a mutually prosperous future.
By recruiting, training and retaining the best employees we will
continue to deliver high standards of service to our customers.
This is the basis of BOC’s strength and will be the means by
which we will deliver the returns expected by you, our
shareholders. I thank you for your continued support.
Rob Margetts Chairman

Chief executive’s review
“Concentrating on 
safety, performance
and profitable growth”
BOC performed well in 2003, although many of the
world’s leading industrial countries remained in the economic
doldrums. The semiconductor industry, the key to BOC
Edwards’ profitability, showed only limited signs of recovery
following a prolonged downturn.
Financial overview
In managing our business we use financial results excluding
exceptional items, referred to as ‘adjusted’, and at constant
currencies as the best way to report results and to reflect the
nature of our business. Exceptional items are exactly that,
one-off events that would distort the figures if not reported
separately, while constant currencies show best how we are
doing in our local markets. The products and services we sell
and their associated costs are largely contained in the 50 or 
so countries where we operate; we export relatively little.
Currencies have an effect when we translate our turnover and
profit into pounds sterling. We could have a bumper year,
improving our business and market position around the world,
yet we could report reduced turnover and profit if the pound
was strong. Conversely, a weak pound could at face value
disguise poor performance.
On this basis, we increased turnover this year by 
nine per cent, the result of actions over recent years to grow
in existing markets and enter new ones. Adjusted operating
profit rose by one per cent. This improved performance was
not reflected in adjusted profit before tax, which declined by
four per cent because of a lower net pension credit largely
resulting from lower equity valuations. Comments below on
business performance are also given on this basis.
Since announcing our preliminary results on 13 November
2003 The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan in the 
US has reached agreement in principle to settle an action
against it for US$69 million. This was shown as a contingent
liability in the preliminary results when we stated that the
potential liability could reach US$116 million. The award will 
be paid out of the assets of the Plan but under UK accounting
principles the payment has been recognised as a charge in 
the profit and loss account. Our statutory results include
exceptional items and comparisons with the previous year
reflect changes in the relative value of currencies. On this basis,
we increased turnover by eight per cent and operating profit
by three per cent. Profit before tax increased by five per cent.
Operating cash flow was eight per cent lower than last
year. There were a number of reasons for this: BOC Edwards
contributed less cash; currency changes had a negative impact;
and, having merged our gases business in Japan with part of 
Air Liquide Japan, BOC no longer consolidates the cash flow
from the combined operation, receiving a dividend instead.
We also resumed contributions to the UK pensions scheme.
This year
We entered the year having just merged our plant building
business with Linde Engineering in the US to form Linde BOC
Process Plants LLC. This combination guarantees us access to 
world-class technology and it is working well, delivering the
capability and the cost savings we had predicted. We were 
also at various stages of finalising four more strategic ventures.
Three were acquisitions: Praxair’s Polish industrial gases
business, Air Products’ Canadian packaged gas business and
Environmental Management Corporation, a privately held US
water services company. The fourth was the merger I referred
to above, the combination of our OSK business in Japan with
part of Air Liquide Japan to create Japan Air Gases.
The Polish and Canadian acquisitions are in important
markets for us and they strengthen our positions there. In both
cases they give us better national coverage and add to the
range of products and services we can offer our customers.
Environmental Management Corporation manages water and
wastewater treatment facilities for industrial and municipal
customers around the US; BOC has a strong industrial
customer base and it is a natural extension to manage the
water cycle for such customers. The emphasis now, as it is with
06 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003 07 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003
all our recent acquisitions, is to achieve the growth and profit
forecasts that were the reasons for making the acquisitions in
the first place. All three are well on the way to doing that.
The reasons for forming Japan Air Gases were different.
Japanese growth has been disappointingly low in recent 
years and the combined business promised to be more
efficient with a lower cost base. Cost savings at the rate of
Japanese Yen 5 billion a year are confidently predicted by 
the end of next year and a revitalised business is showing 
signs of growth.
In recent years we have reviewed all our investments,
seeking to add to our capability where we could grow
profitably and finding other solutions for assets that either 
fit less well strategically or have not delivered the returns 
we expect.
Our businesses are performing well
Our three lines of business – Process Gas Solutions,
Industrial and Special Products and BOC Edwards – produce
85 per cent of BOC’s turnover and 88 per cent of its adjusted
operating profit. The rest comes from our two specialist
businesses, Afrox hospitals and Gist. The line of business
structure remains unique in the industrial gases industry and is
a major competitive advantage for us. We continue to work
hard at delivering exemplary customer service and this has
enabled us to grow our top line sales, to obtain order renewals
and to gain acceptance for price increases.
Process Gas Solutions (PGS) serves our larger customers.
Many of them operate on a global scale and we invest
wherever they require industrial gases. PGS did well last year,
growing turnover by eight per cent and adjusted operating
profit by three per cent. Most of the growth came from
acquisitions and new liquefied gases business. Shortly after 
the year ended we announced further investments in China
totalling over US$100 million.
Industrial and Special Products, centred on our cylinder
business, increased its turnover by nine per cent, but good
profit performance in most countries was undermined by 
a weak result in the US, leading to a decline in adjusted
operating profit of three per cent.
BOC Edwards has performed well considering the
prolonged downturn of the semiconductor industry. It has 
paid close attention to its cost base, matching it closely to
demand. Turnover was £684.1 million with adjusted operating
profit £18.5 million.
Afrox hospitals and Gist delivered particularly good results.
Afrox hospitals grew turnover by 16 per cent and adjusted
operating profit by 31 per cent. Gist delivered increases of 
ten per cent and 13 per cent respectively. African Oxygen
Limited, the majority shareholder in Afrox Healthcare Limited,
announced in July 2003 that it was conducting a strategic
review of the hospitals business. On 17 November it
announced that, subject to conditions, it had agreed to sell its
entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium of
Black Economic Empowerment investors.
Each year I make the point that while financial performance
is important, it is not our only measure of success. I make no
apologies for stating that safety remains our highest priority.
No manager can be content if anyone is hurt in the process of
doing business, but I also believe that safe operations reduce
business risk and contribute eventually to improved profits.
We are concentrating on changing the behaviour of everyone
in BOC to make sure that safety really does come first.
This year we developed our Code of Conduct, based on
important social, environmental and good governance business
principles. People throughout BOC helped prepare it and we
are in the process of communicating it to everyone in BOC.
It states clearly what we expect to ensure we meet our legal
and ethical obligations; to make sure we always do the right
thing. You will find a copy on our website, www.boc.com.
I think you will agree it is something we can be proud of and 
I can assure you we are implementing it in an effective and
practical way.
I thank all the employees of BOC for their efforts this 
year. I thank our customers for doing business with us and 
our suppliers for their contribution. I thank you, our
shareholders, for your support through difficult economic
times. We will continue to strive to deliver attractive 
returns on your investment.

A super cool relationship
Medical science relies on magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,
and Oxford Magnet Technology (OMT) supplies one third of the
world’s superconducting magnets that are at the heart of MRI
scanners. David Hawksworth, managing director of OMT, explains
the role of BOC:
“We have been customers of BOC for over 20 years. We use
liquid helium to cool our magnets down to minus 269°C. At this
temperature they become superconducting and able to generate the
scanning images. Helium looks like it will become scarcer over the
next few years and we wanted to make sure we had a secure and
affordable supply to support our growth.
“A key element was to ensure that more of the gas we used 
in the process was captured and recycled. BOC’s solution included
not only designing and installing the equipment but also providing
site personnel to manage the facility.
“I think it is a relationship where we both benefit. BOC has 
a long-term contract with us and we have security of supply and
much improved efficiency. We have grown our business over the
years and BOC’s relationship has grown with us. I expect this 
to continue.”
our customers
Customers have a choice and we want to make 
sure they choose us. We also know that our products
and services are essential for many businesses.
We must perform to enable our customers to work.

Technology. Serving customers in a big country
We try and make industrial gases as close to our customers as
possible. It makes economic sense and is more efficient. But what 
if your customer is at least two hours’ flying time away and the only
way to get the product to where it is needed is to drive there and
back every week? Well that is what we have to do to serve the
growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry in Australia.
Each weekend a triple road train, a unique feature of Australian 
road transport able to carry large loads over long distances, travels
the 2,800 kilometre round-trip from our plant in Perth to our
customers at Karratha on the northern coast of Western Australia.
Large quantities of nitrogen needed in Darwin for another LNG
project were shipped by road tanker from our plants in Townsville,
Whyalla and Perth. This time the round-trip from Perth to the
customer stretches to some 8,000 kilometres. And on a regular
basis contractors working on the pipeline connecting the gas 
fields in the Timor Sea to Darwin ship our nitrogen a further 
500 kilometres to the offshore production platform.
Industrial gases are involved in the production of virtually
everything we buy and use. Sometimes customers for our 
gases are just round the corner, sometimes, as in Australia,
they are half a continent away. Whatever the challenge,
we do our best to meet it.

Carlsberg-Tetley.
Right: New Look – one 
of Gist’s new contracts.
A long hot summer
In Britain, along with most of Europe, 2003 was one of the hottest
summers for decades and for Carlsberg-Tetley, one of Britain’s 
biggest brewers, summer heat means bigger sales. On a typical
summer weekend beer sales in Britain can reach some 50 million
pints. This year those figures soared, with Carlsberg-Tetley seeing 
its on-trade business for the Carlsberg brand increase 40 per cent 
and its off-trade business increase 46 per cent.
Gist, BOC’s specialist logistics business, used to be responsible
only for storing the beer at the national distribution centre in
Northampton, where it arrives from the breweries in Northampton
and Leeds. Earlier this year Gist expanded its contract to move the
bottles, kegs and cans from Northampton out to Carlsberg-Tetley’s
local depots from where the beer is delivered to pubs.
To meet the record summer demand, Carlsberg-Tetley’s canning and
bottling plants worked at full capacity and Gist responded to the
increased volume. It collected and delivered increased imports of beer
arriving from Denmark and even helped move empty cans and bottles
to the filling sites. Businesses want flexibility and the ability to meet
rapid changes in demand. Gist is able to deliver. As Colin Povey,
chief executive of Carlsberg-Tetley in the UK, says:“We’ve worked
with Gist for seven years. They understand our needs and adapt to
meet our changing demands. We look forward to continuing our
partnership with Gist.” our opportunities
Gases are, literally, all around us. Oxygen supports life while nitrogen,
the largest component of air, is for all intents and purposes inert.
Gases can become liquid if they are cold enough and even a solid 
in the case of carbon dioxide. For over a hundred years BOC has
exploited the properties of gas to make its living and the opportunities
for applying gases are nowhere near exhausted.
13 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003
Putting some gas in the tank
The fuel in your car today has most likely been environmentally
improved by the use of hydrogen. It helps remove sulphur and
convert heavy crude oils into lighter products. Looking forward 20
years it may be hydrogen itself powering your car. When produced
from renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, it is
the true eco-fuel. If 20 years seems a long time, specialist
applications for hydrogen power are much closer.
In a fuel cell hydrogen combines with oxygen from the air to
produce electricity. As long as you supply hydrogen to the fuel cell 
it will produce electricity and the only residue is good old H
2
O,
or water. Because fuel cells are far more efficient than even the 
best internal combustion engines they offer major environmental
benefits, benefits we will need if we are to achieve significant
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
BOC is working with BP to supply hydrogen to two trial 
fleets of fuel cell buses in London, England and Perth, Australia.
Through its share in Chrysalix, a venture capital company, it invests
in early stage hydrogen technology companies and it has an
investment in QuestAir, a Canadian company that makes
specialist hydrogen equipment. Add to that a wide range of
internal and collaborative product development projects 
and BOC is well placed to participate in the forecast
hydrogen economy of the future.
The BOC Gh2ost,
powered by a hydrogen
fuel cell, made an 
attempt on the world 
fuel efficiency record. 14 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003
our opportunities continued
Moving electricity more efficiently
The temperature of liquid nitrogen is minus 196°C. To most 
people that is unbelievably cold, but physicists working on more
efficient ways to move electricity describe it as a high temperature.
How come?
Cool certain materials and they conduct electricity more
efficiently. When they get very cold their resistance will suddenly
drop to zero and they will conduct electricity without losing 
energy as heat. Unfortunately this phenomenon, known as
superconductivity, occurs at very low temperatures and for a 
long time only liquid helium, which is close to absolute zero at 
minus 269°C, was cold enough.
More recently, materials have been discovered that
superconduct at higher temperatures. Now liquid nitrogen 
can be used. This is more cost effective, and a new wave of
superconducting applications has become possible.
BOC is working in the US with SuperPower Inc. and 
Sumitomo Electric Industries on a project in Albany, New York.
There are obvious environmental benefits if electricity transmission
losses can be reduced and, in a year when countries on both
sides of the Atlantic suffered severe blackouts, the economic
advantages from more efficient electricity distribution
systems are clear. 15 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003
Main image:The Hubble 
space telescope.
Left: Applying technology

Below:The semiconductor
industry is the customer
for supercritical carbon
dioxide.
Supercritical solutions
Carbon dioxide, or CO
2
, is probably best known for putting the 
fizz in fizzy drinks and for freezing food. BOC does not make
carbon dioxide, rather it captures it as a by-product from the
industrial processes of others and puts it to productive use.
In the hands of BOC Edwards it may become an important
component in the manufacture of semiconductors. CO
2
has an
ability unique among gases. Under high pressure it acts like a gas 
but behaves like a liquid – it becomes supercritical with a high
density and low viscosity. In this state it can penetrate and clean 
the microscopic features of integrated circuits. Because it is neither
flammable nor hazardous it has great advantages over traditional
solvent-based technologies. It is also economical and can be
disposed of easily.
Process Gas Solutions sells most of BOC’s carbon dioxide 
and it too is beginning to exploit the cleaning properties of CO
2
.
This year it bought the operating and intellectual property assets 
of Eco-Snow Systems, which is the technology that helped clean 
and polish the mirrors of the Hubble space telescope. In these
applications the CO
2
is fired as snow at very high velocity.
It does its cleaning job and then evaporates away into 
the atmosphere. Managing the supply chain
Only some of the gases sold by BOC come from separating air 
into its constituent parts. Helium may be the second lightest of all 
the gases, but on our planet economic quantities are only found
under the earth. It is brought to the surface from natural gas wells
where it is extracted and refined. But only some natural gas deposits
are sufficiently rich in helium to make this worthwhile. Sales of 
helium grow steadily while new sources of supply become available 
only occasionally.
We have access to, and sell, more helium than anyone else.
Even so we have to work hard to keep supply ahead of demand.
That is why we enter into long-term contracts with key supplying
countries. This year we have renewed our agreement to take all
Poland’s exportable helium and signed up for a new source in 
Qatar that will be available later this decade.
Like helium, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) also comes from beneath
the earth. LPG is traded internationally and the price of the raw
material, which is tied closely to that of crude oil, fluctuates widely
driven by supply and demand. The challenge for us is to adapt to
these price fluctuations, particularly in BOC’s largest LPG markets in
South Africa, Australia and Thailand. Being able to respond quickly to
such changes in price directly affects the profitability of the business –
and by sharing skills and understanding across the world we have 
been able to maintain a growing and profitable LPG business.
our insights
Successful businesses know their own industry inside 
out and understand exactly what their customers need.
It is this combination of knowledge that is important.
If you are not very good at what you do you will lose
out to your competitors. Y ou will also never make
money delivering what customers don’t want.
We look hard for profitable new opportunities.
We search for ways to take our expert knowledge and
apply it to give us a competitive edge. An insight is rarely
a blinding flash of light; more often it is a matter of doing
what customers want better than anyone else.

BOC has specialist filling
and storage facilities for
refrigerant gases.
Taking the answer around the world
It is hard to imagine a world without refrigeration or air conditioning.
Everyday life depends on refrigerants. The modern market for
refrigerants has many characteristics well suited to BOC. Twenty years
ago the number of products available was small, their environmental
impact was not good, and BOC had little involvement in the market.
Today the range is much larger but the emphasis remains on safe
handling and minimising losses. Refrigerants need to be handled
responsibly and here our experience is second to none – so much
so that we have taken the lead in developing formal training courses
for refrigeration engineers.
BOC does not make refrigerants. Our expertise lies in buying
products effectively from manufacturers, moving them in bulk safely
around the world, and then transferring them into smaller vessels
before selling them on, typically to smaller wholesalers. In 2000 
we sold refrigerants in only three countries; today it is 17. Filling
techniques pioneered recently at our plant at Immingham in the 
UK have been transferred successfully to Malaysia, Hong Kong and
the Philippines; another example of our best operating practice
where we solve a problem once and then implement the
solution many times. Above:The LASOX
process uses a laser and

Left: A winning team.
Each year teams of innovators from throughout BOC develop fresh
ideas, new solutions and better ways of doing things. And each year
BOC recognises many of them through local innovation awards.
Not everyone winning an award sees him or herself as an innovator,
many are just tackling the regular problems presented by a complex
business but succeeding in exceptionally creative ways.
18 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003
What a good idea
Good people with good ideas make good business. What makes 
the business even better is using good ideas as widely as possible,
as quickly as possible. This is where BOC’s lines of business give us
our competitive advantage, deploying best practice globally in the
shortest time – making innovations work.
Two events held on either side of the Atlantic celebrated 
the ingenuity of BOC’s employees in Europe and north America.
In New Jersey 18 project teams received awards for ideas that
promise or have already delivered significant benefits for BOC.
The next day, 13 European teams gathered at Hampton Court
Palace in the UK for the presentation of their awards.
Over 150 people were honoured. You would expect scientists
and engineers to be well represented, but today the search for 
new and better ways of doing things involves everyone in BOC.
So awards also went to marketing people, to those involved with
day to day operations in our plants and offices, to supply managers,
to safety representatives, to customer service staff and to sales
people. Ideas included safer ways of transporting cylinders and 
of gathering our safety data from around the world, advances 
in branding and product launches, improved processes for 
the semiconductor industry, and new ways to cut steel 
using lasers and to make the administration of medical
oxygen easier.

Winning with people
Good people make a difference. Finding good people and making
them better makes an even bigger difference. BOC works in some 
of the most competitive job markets of the world and does a good
job of recruiting, training and retaining some of the best people in 
our industry. The challenge in a fast growing market such as China 
is even greater.
We knew early on that parachuting in teams of western technical
experts was not the way to win business in China in the long term.
Talented local managers would be the key. China produces well
qualified technical people but the demand for them has risen as
China’s economy has grown.
Over the years we have run MBA-type training courses for 
our Chinese managers. We have funded PhD courses in the UK for
exceptional chemical engineers graduating from Chinese universities.
Now, as our business expands, we have a concentrated development
programme recruiting and developing our management team for 
the future and identifying those with leadership potential. It is the 
way we will keep our leading position in the world’s fastest 
developing market.
Growing in Poland
BOC entered the Polish market in 1993 when the state-run industrial
gases business was privatised. In January 2003 BOC completed the
acquisition of Praxair Polska and two businesses that had been
competitors found themselves on the same side. On the same side,
maybe, but not yet part of the same family.
Some of the areas to address became clear during the
negotiation process. Others were identified quickly when the new
members of BOC’s Polish team undertook the same ‘Voice of BOC’
survey that the existing workforce had completed a few months
earlier. Differences in the results were then discussed in groups drawn
from all employees.
Half a dozen main themes emerged. High on the list were
concerns about job security and how fair the selection process would
be for jobs in the new organisation. A message from everyone was
that uncertainty was the worst thing.
BOC gave an early commitment that the best person would 
be selected for each job, however long they had been with either
company, and that the process would be fair and open.
Less than a year has passed and the signs are promising.
The difficult decisions that come with bringing two businesses 
together have been made, explained and mostly implemented.
The new BOC Polish business is well established and concentrating 
on serving its customers.
BOC is growing both organically and by acquisition. Growth produces change 
and BOC handles change well, an important skill when integrating new acquisitions
quickly and effectively. There have been many acquisitions in recent years and many
lessons learnt and subsequently applied. This year BOC acquired Air Products’
packaged gas business in Canada and Praxair’s Polish gases business. It immediately
set about integrating them with BOC’s existing business. In China, on the other hand,
we are growing a successful business with talented local managers. 20 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003
Companies have wider responsibilities than just delivering profits 
to shareholders. There is more scrutiny today than ever before,
not just of what a company does but how it does it. Details of 
BOC’s corporate responsibility programmes are on our website,
www.boc.com
our responsibilities
South Africa
South Africa has a unique history. Corporate social responsibility 
in a South African setting means more than it does for business
elsewhere in the world, and far greater prominence is given to
community involvement. Back in 1995 Afrox started its community
involvement process (CIP), partly in response to the government’s 
call for business to participate in a national reconstruction and
development programme and partly because it seemed the right 
way to do business at the time.
The CIP involves employees from Afrox and Afrox hospitals in
the communities where they live and work. They adopt and support
homes and organisations for underprivileged children. The businesses
provide money but the greatest contribution comes from the
employees themselves, who give freely of their time. The United
Nations has featured Afrox’s CIP as an excellent example of an
employee-driven sustainable social development programme. As the
UN document says:“The programme is popular within schools,
communities and the business sector, and amongst Afrox staff as
well. Eighty per cent of Afrox’s units participate in the programme
and in 2002 alone 113 projects received funding (125 projects
representing 8,000 children in 2003). This is a remarkable
achievement given that participation is voluntary and all
contact with the adopted home takes place after hours,
i.e. in the employees’ spare time.”

Left:The Code of
Conduct involves
everyone in the Group.
Doing the right thing
Early in 2002 a working group drawn from all parts of BOC started
work on the Group’s Code of Conduct. We already had a variety 
of policies and standards, but the task was to produce a common 
set that every employee should follow, wherever BOC does business.
The code, published this summer, is based on important social,
environmental and good governance principles. We are training all
45,000 BOC employees on what the code means for them and we
have translated it into many of the languages used in the countries
where we do business.
Because we involved people from throughout BOC in 
developing the code we identified early any issues and worries.
If employees have concerns, they are encouraged to raise them with
their supervisors. We have a strict non-retaliation policy, protecting
any employee who raises issues in good faith, and this is supported 
by a free confidential helpline run by an independent company.
Doing the right thing is important in BOC. The code has been
developed in line with BOC’s guiding principles of accountability,
collaboration, transparency and stretch, ACTS. Our employees 
now know exactly what is expected of them and what BOC stands
for – high legal and ethical standards in business.
The BOC Foundation for the Environment
The BOC Foundation was established in 1990 and, with its partners,
has funded nearly 120 environmental projects since then to the tune
of more than £12 million. The environment is a big subject and the
Foundation concentrates its funds on projects that improve air and
water quality. Air is important to BOC as it is the source of important
gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen and argon, and water is both an
essential part of many of our production processes and a growing
market for us.
The Foundation wants to make a practical contribution.
It encourages those with good scientific ideas who need financial 
help to turn academic or early results into workable environmental
solutions. It expects the projects it supports to make a measurable
difference within a few years and to benefit the community as a
whole, not just the recipient of the grant. The Foundation has worked
in partnership with government departments, local authorities,
environmental charities and commercial organisations. 22 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003

As well as reporting results on a statutory basis, we
believe that shareholders will be assisted in understanding 
the performance relative to previous periods by presenting 
the results in an alternative manner. This presentation isolates 
the impact of currency movements from year to year and
eliminates the impact of exceptional or non-recurring items.
Where the latter adjustment is made, results are referred to 
as ‘adjusted’.
Turnover and operating profit details for each line of
business and specialist business on each basis will be found 
near the start of each section. The discussion of business
performance that follows is based on figures adjusted for
exceptional items and constant currency.
Process Gas Solutions
Process Gas Solutions raised turnover by eight per cent
this year and adjusted operating profit by three per cent.
Because we serve many of the world’s largest industrial
companies we anticipate and respond to the main themes of
the global economy. Traditional industries continue to move
from the industrialised West to growing economies in the East
and we are able to welcome them, having established a leading
position in Asia many years ago. Companies seeking innovative
supply solutions to their industrial gases needs find our
engineering creativity and access to world-class technology
deliver the best answers. Linked to everything is the continuing
drive to do things more efficiently and at lower cost.
The greatest opportunities are to be found in Asia and 
the headquarters of Process Gas Solutions moved to Singapore
to be close to where much of the business is being done.
While Asia as a whole promises growth, China offers some of
the greatest opportunities. Our joint venture in Nanjing with
YPC, a subsidiary of Sinopec, China’s leading petrochemical
company, continues to perform well and we added extra
capacity for liquid production onto the existing plant. The steel
industry is also showing strong underlying growth, as in other
parts of Asia. To meet our growth targets in China we are
investing heavily in recruiting and developing local management
talent and giving them the opportunity for international
development through postings to BOC businesses around the
world.
In Thailand we commissioned a hydrogen and carbon
monoxide, or HyCO, plant at Map Ta Phut and are building a
new 300 tonnes-a-day carbon dioxide plant to meet increased
demand for food freezing. Taiwan, Korea and Malaysia all saw
good growth as did India, where the economy improved and
we achieved sales success in the merchant market and brought
on stream a new 225 tonnes-a-day plant to supply Tata Steel.
The difficulties experienced by industry in the UK have
been well documented, yet despite seeing some customer
closures and the transfer of other businesses overseas, we still
increased both turnover and adjusted operating profit in the
UK. The full-year effect of investments made last year helped,
while detailed attention to cost and high levels of customer
service were equally important. Ireland, by comparison, saw
declines in turnover and adjusted operating profit for the first
time in many years as growth reined back, particularly in the
electronics sector. As Poland prepares for EU membership
next year, the acquisition of Praxair Polska gave us for the 
first time a source of carbon dioxide in the country and a
complementary fit with our existing business. Our specialist
engineering business Cryostar had strong demand for its
turbines and compressors, particularly from China and for
ships being built to carry liquefied natural gas.
The messages from the US economy remained mixed
throughout the year, although both turnover and adjusted
operating profit rose. Volumes from existing customers
remained flat and a number of companies, notably in the steel
industry, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In contrast,
new business wins for liquefied gases were at a record high and
we won a significant contract from Celanese for their Clear
Lake plant in Texas. We are supplying Clear Lake with carbon
monoxide and steam as well as feeding hydrogen into the
important chemical complex on the Gulf coast. 23 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003

The steel industry in both Australia and New Zealand
continued to perform well despite the strength of the Australian
dollar that affected all exporters, especially mineral producers.
Oxygen and nitrogen demand increased at BHP’s plant at Port
Kembla as pulverised coal replaced coke as the primary fuel.
Many of BOC’s major plants around the world are now
controlled remotely from centralised operations centres and
this year control of all our production plants in New Zealand
was transferred to the Australian centre based near Sydney.
South Africa saw strong growth in the first six months
slow in the second half as a strengthening rand hindered
exports from major gas-using industries, such as mineral 
and precious metal producers.
Industrial and Special Products
Industrial and Special Products (ISP) produced good
growth in turnover and adjusted operating profit from most of
its key markets. The US was the exception, as slower growth
combined with residual issues from installing a new computer
system to have an adverse impact on adjusted operating profit.
Overall, ISP’s turnover was up by nine per cent and adjusted
operating profit down by three per cent.
ISP’s four business sectors established last year – industrial,
medical, hospitality and special gases – set the global strategies.
These strategies are then implemented through geographically-
based business units. While some markets retain strong local
characteristics, all benefit from increased global leadership and
common best operating practice programmes to grow the
business and to improve service, safety and operational and
commercial efficiency.
BOC acquired Praxair Polska in January 2003 and the
packaged gas business of Air Products in Canada in April 2003,
strengthening ISP’s position in these two important markets.
In Europe, all countries increased turnover and overall
adjusted operating profit was up. The continuing decline of 
the UK manufacturing sector was more than offset by the
development of service-related sectors. Increasingly our
business is about more than just delivering cylinders of gas to
customers and collecting them when they are empty. Hospitals,
for instance, value our ability to replenish their gas supplies at
night without disrupting their busy routine and our willingness
to manage all aspects of their medical gases if that is what they
want. BOC Sureflow, which sells mainly to pubs and clubs,
was founded on its service promise and continues to win new
business as a result. Our national network and technical
expertise in special gases delivered strong growth in
refrigerants and helium. Refrigerants benefited from a major
distribution contract signed last year and helium from a long-
term supply contract signed this year.
Ireland’s economy slowed after many years of high growth
while in Poland the major impact came from the acquisition
and successful integration of Praxair Polska.
South Africa had a very good year with significantly
increased turnover and adjusted operating profit, although 
the economic conditions that boosted exports and industrial
production in the first six months were less favourable later in
the year. Manufacturing, and in particular the motor industry,
is of increasing importance alongside the traditional markets in
fabrication and mining.
The increased strength of the Australian dollar and
continuing drought produced slower growth this year in
Australia, but both turnover and adjusted operating profit
increased, as they did in New Zealand. The distances covered
to serve customers in Australia can be vast and much effort
has gone into developing a fairer and more transparent pricing
structure to reflect the costs involved. Elgas, our liquefied
petroleum gas business in Australia, performed very well,
largely through its improved ability to respond to rapid 
changes in raw material cost, such as those this year linked 
to the Iraq war. 24 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003

Manufacturing continues to move to Asia from higher-cost
regions and our industrial volumes in south-east Asia have
benefited accordingly. Our investments in special products have
generated good growth, notably in refrigerants where we
opened new facilities in Hong Kong, Malaysia and the
Philippines. We have successfully integrated NIOI, a company
we acquired last year, into our business in Malaysia and BOC
management is now fully in place in Unique, the Thai ammonia
and liquefied petroleum gas business also purchased in 2002.
In north America, Canada grew both turnover and
adjusted operating profit. Some of this came from the first full
year of the special gases business we acquired in April 2002,
but more significant was the contribution from Air Products’
packaged gas business acquired in 2003. In the US gas revenues
increased but adjusted operating profit was down significantly.
Partly this reflected the sluggish economy but it was also due
to costs associated with the extended introduction of a major
computer system. Good progress was made in south America,
notably in Venezuela, despite difficult economic conditions,
and Chile. We also entered the liquefied petroleum gas 
market in Colombia when we acquired a local distributor.
BOC Edwards
BOC Edwards experienced a second year during which its
most important market, the semiconductor industry, has been 
in a downturn. Turnover increased by four per cent and
adjusted operating profit declined by 26 per cent. Increased
demand for devices saw existing semiconductor fabs operating
at higher utilisation levels later in the year. Electronic gases 
and our Kachina parts cleaning business, which are involved in
the production processes at these fabs, saw some volume
increases although pressure on prices remained strong.
New investment by the semiconductor industry was aimed 
at expanding or upgrading existing fabs rather than building
new ones, so orders for vacuum equipment and chemical
management systems remained at a low level.
Where new fabs were built, BOC Edwards improved its
position. It is present in all the latest generation 300mm fabs in
the US and Europe, a better position than it had when the
earlier generation 200mm fabs were first being introduced.
In Asia strong demand came from manufacturers of flat panel
displays, especially in Taiwan and Korea. We won orders for
gas supply to three out of the four fabs built in China last year,
which complements our already strong position in vacuum and
exhaust management elsewhere in Asia.
The broadening of BOC Edwards’ range of products and
services continues. In the silicon and compound semiconductor
market our Zenith combined pump and exhaust treatment
products are proving very successful with device and
equipment manufacturers. We won contracts in Europe and
Asia to manage rather than just supply a range of gases,
chemicals and other material required by semiconductor
manufacturers. We improved our position in vacuum
lithography and can now offer a full service for cleaning wafers
using supercritical carbon dioxide. We increased production 
of nitrogen trifluoride, NF
3
, at our plant in South Africa and
placed fluorine generators on trial to enable customers to
evaluate the technology. The turbomolecular pump business 
we bought from Seiko Instruments is now fully integrated into
BOC Edwards and is operating profitably.
The scientific market for vacuum pumps continued 
to grow while other industrial markets were less buoyant.
In response we cut costs and rationalised production.
We are increasingly making pumps for the general vacuum
market in the Czech Republic, taking advantage of lower
manufacturing costs.
BOC Edwards’ pharmaceutical packaging business started 
the year more slowly as a number of projects were delayed.
Demand for its complex loading systems and freeze dryers
improved later in the year and the underlying trend is positive.

Afrox hospitals
Both turnover and adjusted operating profit rose
significantly as Afrox hospitals continued to prosper in 
a market showing little underlying growth. It made some small
acquisitions and built a new 140-bed clinic on the East Rand,
but this compares with over 1,000 acute beds added through
acquisition in the previous year. Progress came mainly from
providing higher value services to patients.
An increasing percentage of revenue came from a new 
risk-sharing fee structure introduced this year. Up until now we
have been paid for services used by patients: there was a tariff
for every bed day, for each minute in the operating theatre
and for every item used. There was therefore no incentive to
limit the length of stay or to control input costs. Under the
new tariff structure the cost for an agreed medical intervention
is fixed, so there is one cost for an operation such as a hip
replacement, whether there are complications or not. Already
over a third of our tariffs are on this risk-sharing basis and we
expect that figure to rise to two-thirds or more.
The direct medicines dispensing business was restructured
during the year to adapt to changed medical insurance and
reimbursement procedures. As a result, profit increased.
Afrox hospitals is also exploring opportunities to extend its
operating and management processes to other markets. In a
joint bid with Care UK it was chosen by the UK national health
service as preferred bidder for three day treatment centres in
England. It will be paid a management fee for its services.
On 17 November 2003 African Oxygen Limited
announced that, subject to conditions, it had agreed to sell its
entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium of
Black Economic Empowerment investors.
Gist
Gist improved both turnover, up ten per cent, and
adjusted operating profit, up 13 per cent. The increase in
adjusted operating profit was not only as a result of higher
turnover but also because of a gain of some £4.1 million 
arising principally from the termination of operations for the
Marks & Spencer General Merchandise business.
Gist has the skills and knowledge to meet the needs of
modern retailers. As supply chains become more complex 
and consumers require increasing levels of service and
availability, products on sale in the high street are brought 
from wherever the best value can be obtained.
This year Gist won new contracts from, among others,
New Look, a fashion chain, and Carlsberg-Tetley, one of the 
UK’s largest brewers. Gist’s flexibility and ability to manage 
supply chains of varying complexity are at the heart of these
successes. New Look brings its products to the UK from
around 20 countries. Gist manages the whole process through
a network of partners, solving any problems of quality long
before the goods arrive in the high street. At Carlsberg-Tetley,
Gist had to meet the demands of one of Britain’s hottest, and
thirstiest, summers. Beer sales hit exceptional peaks and Gist
showed the flexibility and dedication needed to meet demands.
This was the first full year when Gist handled all of Marks 
& Spencer’s chilled and ambient foods. Based on a relationship
that stretches over 30 years, Gist is M&S’s largest supply chain
provider, although this year it stopped handling any of the
retailer’s general merchandise business in the UK. It provides
similar services for Budgens, the UK convenience store group,
managing all its warehouse and distribution operations, and 
e-fulfilment for Ocado, the on-line grocery shopping company. 26 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003

A review of the Group’s business activities and their
performance can be found on pages 22 to 25. See also
note 6 on post balance sheet events. The report of the
directors deals with other issues that the board and
management regard as important to the conduct of the
company’s affairs.
Employment policies
BOC’s employment policies are designed to underpin the
Group’s operating requirements and growth strategies. Where
practicable, policies are adapted to meet local requirements.
Communication and involvement BOC places a high 
priority on communicating with its people and has invested in
web-based communications technology to convey consistent
and coherent messages to employees around the world.
Resourcing, training and development Programmes are
designed to ensure that the Group has a pool of well-qualiﬁed,
gifted individuals able to meet both its day-to-day operational
needs and its plans for the future.
Reward and recognition Reward and recognition programmes
are designed to endorse outstanding individual and team
performance.
Retirement beneﬁt plans BOC fully supports its people’s
efforts to provide for their retirement and provides a range of
opportunities for them to participate in programmes tailored
to suit local conditions.
Employee share schemes Employees are encouraged to share
the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of the Group’s success through a number
of option and incentive schemes.
Diversity BOC values the diversity of its workforce and is
committed to maintaining a workplace free from discrimination
for reasons of race, creed, culture, nationality, gender, sexual
orientation or marital status.
Safety and environment
The Group continues to place the highest priority on issues 
of safety. The nature of our business activities means that 
our employees encounter many hazards in the workplace.
These include ﬂammable and toxic gases and operations that
often involve high pressures and extreme temperatures.
Common to all our businesses is the movement of products
and the various hazards associated with driving, distribution and
service operations. Signiﬁcant efforts are made to improve
safety performance. This year safety statistics incorporated
recent mergers, acquisitions and all joint ventures for the
ﬁrst time.
BOC has a comprehensive environmental programme 
and conducts an annual survey to highlight any potential
environmental impacts from our sites. It is believed that 
the Group is in substantial compliance with all material
environmental laws and regulations. BOC also contributes
technology and processes to meet the environmental needs 
of customers.
Supplier payment policy
The Group applies a policy of agreeing and clearly
communicating the terms of payment as part of the
commercial arrangements negotiated with suppliers and 
then paying according to those terms. In addition, the 
UK-based businesses have committed to the ‘Better Payment
Practice Code’.
Corporate donations
The BOC Group and its businesses made donations of 
£1.12 million, of which £476,000 went to UK-registered
charities. A further £180,000 was used to support projects
identiﬁed by The BOC Foundation for the Environment.
As in previous years, no political donations were made in 
the European Union.
Dividends
Two dividends were paid in 2003. A ﬁrst interim dividend of
15.5p per share was paid in February and a second interim
dividend of 23.5p per share was paid in August. A ﬁrst interim
dividend of 15.5p per share has been declared for payment on
2 February 2004 and participation in the dividend reinvestment
plan will be available to shareholders whose applications have
been received by Lloyds TSB Registrars by 12 January 2004.
Corporate governance
The BOC Group is committed to business integrity, high ethical
values and professionalism in all its activities. As an essential
part of this commitment, the board supports the highest
standards in corporate governance.
The board has applied the principles contained in Section 1
of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance appended
to the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules and has complied
throughout the year, with the exception that Dick Grant, a
director who resigned with effect from 31 December 2002,
had a service contract that could be terminated by the
company on two years’ notice.
Although the new Combined Code is only effective for
reporting years beginning on or after 1 November 2003,
BOC has already made changes to its corporate governance
procedures such that at this time the company is signiﬁcantly
advanced towards compliance with the new code.
Risk management and internal control The board of directors
has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of risk
management and internal controls.
The BOC risk management programme assists
management throughout the Group to identify, assess and
mitigate business risk. Since its introduction in 2001, over 
170 risk workshops and reviews have been conducted across
the Group. The output from each assessment is a list of
prioritised risks with associated action plans to manage them.
A report to the board is made twice a year of the key risks
facing the Group and actions to manage these key risks.
The directors have delegated to executive management
the establishment and implementation of a system of internal
controls. The internal control system is monitored and
supported by an internal audit function that operates on a
global basis and reports its results to management and the
audit committee of the board. The system is rigorous and
designed to ensure that directors maintain full and effective
control over all signiﬁcant strategic, ﬁnancial, organisational 
and compliance issues.
Having reviewed its effectiveness, the directors are not
aware of any signiﬁcant weakness or deﬁciency in the Group’s
system of internal controls.
Report of the directors

directors, with their biographies, photographs, and board
committee memberships can be found on pages 26 and 27.
A summary and explanation of their remuneration is given on
pages 33 and 34.
Board committees
Audit committee The audit committee meets four times a
year. Time is set aside at two of these meetings for the
committee to meet with the internal and external auditors
without executive management present. The committee
reviews the effectiveness of internal controls, matters raised by
the internal and external auditors in their regular reports to
the committee and the quarterly ﬁnancial statements prior to
their release. The committee reviews the programme and
effectiveness of risk management within the Group as well as
ensuring that an appropriate relationship between BOC and
the external auditors is maintained. The committee comprises
only independent non-executive directors and is chaired by 
Sir Christopher O’Donnell.
Nomination committee The nomination committee meets
periodically as required, and in the year ended 30 September
2003 met six times. The committee primarily monitors the
composition and balance of the board and its committees and
identiﬁes and recommends to the board the appointment of
new directors. All independent non-executive directors, the
chairman and the chief executive serve as members of this
committee. The committee is chaired by Rob Margetts.
Whilst the chairman of the board chairs this committee he 
is not permitted to chair meetings when the appointment 
of his successor is being reviewed.
Remuneration committee The remuneration committee meets
six times a year. The committee recommends to the board the
policy on executive directors’ remuneration and the speciﬁc
remuneration, beneﬁts and terms of employment of each
executive director. The committee comprises only independent
non-executive directors and is chaired by Julie Baddeley.
Pensions committee The pensions committee meets twice 
a year and oversees the review of governance and control
procedures applying to all employee retirement beneﬁt plans
and reviews and makes recommendations on the investment
policies and strategies applied to the Group’s retirement
beneﬁt plans. The committee comprises two independent non-
executive directors, the chairman, chief executive and Group
ﬁnance director. The committee is chaired by Julie Baddeley.
Executive management board The executive management
board meets regularly having primary authority for the 
day-to-day management of the Group’s operations and policy
implementation pursuant to the Group’s strategy agreed by the
board. The committee comprises the chief executive, the other
executive directors and certain senior managers and is chaired
by Tony Isaac. Further details are given on pages 28 and 29.
Investment committee The investment committee meets
regularly and reviews and approves Group commitments up to
certain levels set by the board. The committee comprises the
chief executive, the other executive directors and certain
senior managers and is chaired by Tony Isaac.

Independent auditors’ statement
To the members of The BOC Group plc The report below is only a summary of the directors’
remuneration report as permitted by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The full report setting
out the composition of the remuneration committee, the
remuneration policy, together with full details of the directors’
emoluments, pensions, share options and shareholdings, is
contained within the report and accounts 2003 on pages 60
to 69. Copies of the full directors’ remuneration report can 
be obtained, free of charge, from BOC or may be viewed 
on, or downloaded from, BOC’s website, www.boc.com
The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises, with the exception 
of the Group chairman, Rob Margetts, all the independent
non-executive directors namely Julie Baddeley (chairman),
Fabiola Arredondo, Andrew Bonﬁeld (appointed July 2003),
Roberto Mendoza (appointed October 2002), Matthew Miau
and Sir Christopher O'Donnell. Göran Lundberg had been the
chairman of the remuneration committee until his retirement
on 4 March 2003. Whilst neither the Group chairman nor the
chief executive are members of the remuneration committee
they both attend the meetings by invitation but are not present
when their personal remuneration is discussed and reviewed.
The human resources director acts as secretary to the
committee and provides it with information and data from
national and international surveys. In addition, during the year
the remuneration committee appointed Towers Perrin to
review the remuneration arrangements for senior executives.
No other services are provided by this adviser.
The remuneration committee sets the overall remuneration
policy of the Group and makes recommendations to the 
board on the framework of executive remuneration. It meets
six times a year. The terms of reference are reviewed annually
to ensure that they conform with best practice. Speciﬁcally, the
remuneration committee determines, on behalf of the board,
the detailed terms of service of the executive directors and
other members of the executive management team including
basic salary, performance related bonus arrangements,
beneﬁts in kind, long-term incentives and pension beneﬁts.
The remuneration committee also reviews the remuneration 
of the chairman, following a recommendation from the chief
executive and the senior independent director. The board as a
whole determines the non-executive directors’ fees.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are generally appointed for an initial
period to the next Annual General Meeting and subject to
reappointment at the meeting, for a further three year term.
Subsequent reappointment is with the agreement of the board
and approval of shareholders. The fees are set at a level which
will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability
to make a signiﬁcant contribution to the Group’s affairs.
The responsibilities of, and the time commitment expected
from, non-executive directors have increased in recent times
and fees paid to non-executives are increasing to reﬂect this.
As a result, from 1 January 2004 the non-executive directors’
fees will increase from £37,000 to £40,000 per annum,
£10,000 of which, less tax, will be invested in BOC shares.
The fees for chairing a committee will increase from £8,000 to
£10,000 per annum, £5,000 of which, less tax, will be invested
in BOC shares. The fee for the chairman, Rob Margetts, is set
at £225,000.
The non-executive directors do not have contracts of service
nor do they participate in the Group’s variable compensation
arrangements, its long-term incentive arrangements or its pension
arrangements, nor do they receive any beneﬁts in kind.
Remuneration policy
BOC's remuneration policy for executive directors and other
executive management is designed to attract and retain executives
of the highest calibre so that the Group is managed successfully to
the beneﬁt of its stakeholders. In setting remuneration levels the
remuneration committee takes into account the remuneration
practices found in other UK-listed companies of similar size,
internationality and complexity and seeks to benchmark executive
remuneration at about the median level for this group.
During 2002 the remuneration committee reviewed 
the executive remuneration packages and decided that a
realignment was necessary to support the company’s business
strategy to improve both earnings growth and capital efﬁciency
and to ensure that the packages were market competitive.
To this end, a proposal to adopt new long-term incentive
arrangements was put to shareholders and approved at the
2003 Annual General Meeting. These arrangements comprise 
a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and an Executive Share
Option Scheme. They are intended to encourage innovation
and value-added growth and strengthen the link between 
short-term performance and sustainable improvement in
shareholder value over the longer term. It is the view of 
the remuneration committee that performance-related
remuneration should form a substantial element of total
remuneration. As such, these arrangements together with 
the variable compensation plan, which is a performance 
related cash plan, form the variable elements of executive
remuneration. It is expected that the achievement of ‘on target’
performance of these variable elements will amount to about
60 per cent of total executive remuneration.
No changes to the framework of executive remuneration
are proposed for 2004. The remuneration committee will,
however, review the policy on a regular basis and make any
amendments it deems appropriate to ensure that it meets the
objectives of recruiting, retaining and motivating high performing
individuals and ensuring that the Group is market competitive.
The graph above has been included to meet the requirement 
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations
2002. It shows BOC’s total shareholder return (TSR)
performance, assuming dividends are reinvested, compared
with all FTSE100 companies. This has been chosen because 
it provides a basis for comparison against companies in a
relevant, broad based equity index of which BOC is a
constituent member. The remuneration committee decided
that other comparator groups were more appropriate as
performance measurement for the LTIP . A graph showing
BOC’s TSR performance compared with the six major gases
companies relative to respective local indices, which is one 
of the comparator groups chosen for the LTIP , is shown in 
the chairman’s statement on page 5.
Long-term incentive arrangements The performance measures
for the LTIP are based one third on earnings per share (EPS)
before exceptional items, one third on return on capital
employed (ROCE) before exceptional items and one third on
the company’s TSR performance relative to 31 industrial and

2. Mr Bevan was appointed to the board on 5 December 2002. Mr Grant resigned from the board on 31 December 2002 and he left the company on 
30 June 2003. Mr Grant’s termination entitlements were mitigated by an agreement that his contractual notice period would be treated as expiring on 
30 September 2004. He accordingly received a payment of £448,000, representing salary and compensation for beneﬁts in respect of the agreed 15-month
notice period. Mr Grant was also entitled to purchase his company car for a nominal amount. In addition, Mr Grant’s beneﬁt in the US top-hat pension plan
was credited with 15 additional months of pensionable service in respect of his notional notice period. The top-hat pension plan was also adjusted to meet 
Mr Grant’s accrued entitlement. Additionally, he received the sum of £13,400 being the equivalent of the company’s contribution which would have been
credited to Mr Grant’s US cash balance retirement plan during the period of his agreed notice period. These amounts are disclosed as ‘T ermination payments’
and have been charged against proﬁt in 2003.
3. Total fees for non-executive directors’ services in the year were £443,000. Included in this amount were the chairman’s fees of £225,000.
4. Total directors’ remuneration in 2003, including the charge to proﬁt in respect of amounts paid to former directors was £7.1 million compared with 
£6.4 million in 2002.

34 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2003
The performance measure for the Executive Share Option
Scheme 2003 is assessed on the growth in basic EPS before
exceptional items as reported in the annual report and
accounts. The remuneration committee considers these
performance measures to be important drivers of sustainable
improvement in shareholder value that focus executives’
attention and effort on proﬁtable growth and capital efﬁciency
in both the short and long term.
Service contracts
The company’s policy is for all executive directors to have
contracts of employment that terminate on the attainment of
retirement age. In order to mitigate its liability on early
termination, the company’s policy is that it should be able to
terminate such contracts on no more than 12 months’ notice,
and that payments on termination are restricted to the value of
salary, car beneﬁt and bonus entitlement (calculated on the
basis of the average of actual payments over the preceding two
years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Shareholding guidelines
The remuneration committee encourages executive
management to grow a personal shareholding in the business
over time. It is anticipated that each executive would build
towards a shareholding of one times salary. The remuneration
committee believes that the vehicle of the long-term incentive
arrangements will facilitate the building of such a shareholding
over a period of time.
Pensions
During the year, ﬁve directors accrued beneﬁts under the
deﬁned beneﬁt schemes operated by the company.
Contributions amounting to £279,000 were paid by the
company to money purchase plans in respect of three directors.
When determining BOC’s performance relative to the global
gases group, the TSR for BOC and the comparator companies
will be amended (amended TSR) so that it reﬂects the excess
(or shortfall) in returns relative to the local stock market index
where each company has its primary listing. The nationality and
the local stock market index that will be used to calculate the
amended TSR for each company is shown in parentheses.

• The accounts are prepared on the going concern basis. This means that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operation for the foreseeable future.
• The Group accounts include the accounts of the parent undertaking and of all subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
Subsidiary undertakings are those businesses controlled by the Group and their results are fully included. Joint ventures are
those businesses which the Group jointly controls with one or more other parties. Associates are those businesses in which the
Group has a participating interest and exercises signiﬁcant inﬂuence.
• The results of businesses acquired are included from the effective date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions during the year
(the difference between the fair value of the purchase price of a business and the fair value of the net assets acquired) is
capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life.

4. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings
Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings, including some in which claims for damages in large amounts have
been asserted. The outcome of litigation to which Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors
believe that such litigation should be disposed of without material adverse effect on the Group’s ﬁnancial condition or proﬁtability.
Welding fumes litigation BOC has been named in numerous lawsuits in the US alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes.
Many of these cases were ﬁled during 2003. Certain of these cases have been either ﬁled in, or transferred for pre-trial purposes
to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding has been
commenced. The MDL proceeding is still at an early stage. The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for co-ordinating pre-trial proceedings
in cases pending in different federal district courts in the US. In addition to the cases in federal court, BOC is a defendant in a
number of similar cases pending in state courts. These cases are in different stages of procedural development, and certain cases
are scheduled for trial from time to time.
From the time it purchased Airco in 1978 until this year, BOC had never had an adverse jury verdict returned against it in a
case alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes. On 28 October 2003, a jury in Madison County, Illinois, rendered a verdict  4. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings continued
against BOC and two co-defendants. The jury awarded US$1 million to Mr Elam, a former labourer who asserted that his
idiopathic Parkinson’s disease was attributable to his exposure to welding fumes over a period of years. BOC believes that the
verdict is inconsistent with the decisions rendered by juries in previous cases, is not supported by the existing scientiﬁc evidence
and intends to pursue vigorously its post-trial and appeal rights.
BOC believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in these various proceedings related to alleged injury from
exposure to welding fumes and intends to defend vigorously such claims. Based on BOC’s experience to date, together with
BOC’s current assessment of the merits of the claims being asserted, and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued
defence and resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its ﬁnancial condition or proﬁtability and
no provision has been made.
Fluorogas litigation In February 2003, the company was notiﬁed that a jury verdict in the US District Court for the Western
District of Texas was obtained for US$132 million against Fluorogas Limited, The BOC Group Inc and The BOC Group plc. The
verdict arises primarily out of an alleged breach of a memorandum of understanding by Fluorogas Limited before it was acquired
by The BOC Group plc in September 2001. In March 2003, the court also awarded interest and costs against the defendants,
making them jointly and severally liable for a total of US$174 million. A bond for the full amount has been posted with the Court
as part of the normal appeals process.
The company believes that the jury’s verdict reﬂects a misunderstanding of the law and does not reﬂect the facts of any loss
that may have been suffered by the plaintiff. The company is challenging the verdict through the appropriate appeals process in
the US and hence no provision has been made. In addition, Fluorogas Limited was placed in administration under the Insolvency
Act of 1986 pursuant to an order of the English Courts. In a related proceeding in a US Bankruptcy Court, the UK
administrators have obtained injunctive relief preventing the plaintiff in the Fluorogas litigation from commencing or continuing 
any action or proceeding enforcing any judgement against Fluorogas Limited in the US.
ERISA litigation An action was ﬁled in the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois against The BOC Group Cash Balance
Retirement Plan (the Plan). The plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly affected, alleging that the Plan
improperly calculated lump sum distributions from the Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The maximum
potential liability could have reached US$116 million and any award would be paid out of Plan assets.
The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle at US$69 million. The settlement documents are being prepared.
The settlement is subject to approval by the court at a fairness hearing. A provision of US$69 million has been made in the
ﬁnancial statements. Under UK accounting principles (FRS17), this has been recognised as a charge in the proﬁt and loss account
of the Group. It has been shown as an exceptional item.
Guarantees At 30 September 2002, BOC had guaranteed a portion of the borrowings of its joint venture company in Mexico.
The amount of the guarantee was £116.7 million and it was shown as a contingent liability in the Group’s report and accounts at
that date. In March 2003, as a result of certain conditions being met by the joint venture company, BOC’s guarantee has been
released and no contingent liability remains at 30 September 2003.
5. US accounting information
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles 
(UK GAAP). These differ in certain respects from accounting principles accepted in the US (US GAAP).
The application of the different accounting principles results in adjustments being needed to show what the Group’s proﬁt 
would be under US GAAP . The main adjustments are shown individually in the table below.

a) On 17 November 2003, the Group’s South African subsidiary company African Oxygen Limited announced that it had agreed
to sell its entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited. At that date, the estimated impact of the transaction was a reduction of a
maximum of 1.5p in Group earnings per share for the year to 30 September 2003. The sale remains subject to certain conditions,
including clearance from the relevant competition and other regulatory authorities.
b) ERISA litigation. See note 4 above.

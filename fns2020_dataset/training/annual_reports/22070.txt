 Annual report 2016
Y ear ended 31 March 2016 Welcome to Caledonia
Caledonia is a self-managed investment trust company with 
net assets of £1.6bn. Our aim is to grow net assets and dividends 
paid to shareholders over the long term, whilst managing risk 
to mitigate volatility of returns. We achieve this by investing 
in well-managed businesses that combine reasonable growth 
characteristics with an ability to deliver increasing levels of 
income. Our investments include listed and private companies, 
as well as funds, in a range of sectors and geographies.
The success of this strategy can be seen in the performance 
of Caledonia’s NAV per share total return measured against 
the FTSE All-Share since 1987 and its track record of increasing 
its annual dividend every year since 1967.

2 Annual report 2016 Caledonia Investments plc  
Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s report
The company delivered a positive 
NAV total return of 2.6%. Our long 
term diversified portfolio of both 
quoted and unquoted investments 
provided mitigation to the continued 
volatility of the markets and we 
continued our rolling ten year 
outperformance against the  
FTSE All-Share. The portfolio continues 
to provide a growing income and we 
are pleased to have increased our 
annual dividend by 4.0%, the 49th 
consecutive year of increase.
Results
Caledonia delivered a positive net asset value per share total return 
(‘NAVTR’) of 2.6% for the year ended 31 March 2016, compared with 
14.2% for the previous year. We do not seek to benchmark our 
performance over as short a period as a year, but rather our 
objective is to outperform the FTSE All-Share Total Return over ten 
years. This we have achieved over the last ten years when our 
NAVTR was 71.6%. Over shorter periods, we aim to produce overall 
annualised returns of between RPI+3% and RPI+6% and this has 
been delivered.
Background to the year in listed equities
Over the year, the FTSE All-Share Total Return fell by 3.9%, though 
the S&P 500 remained flat. Equity markets in both the US and 
Europe suffered two significant falls during the year, in August 2015 
and in January 2016. The bull market in commodity related stocks 
is well and truly over, following sharp falls in the price of oil and gas 
and other basic commodities. However, markets recovered their 
poise within a couple of months on both occasions, as the 
requirement for income drove investors back into yielding equity 
investments. Having taken money out of the market last year, we 
took advantage of the market volatility during the year to make 
selective purchases of high quality businesses that match our 
Quoted pool’s long term strategy.
Caledonia’s competitive advantage in private 
equity markets
The private equity market is flush with capital looking to be invested. 
This is being provided by funds which have very significant unutilised 
commitments and banks which are once again offering high levels of 
debt but at very low rates. The result is keen competition for, and 
pricing of, private equity money. It is therefore vital for us to be able 
to differentiate ourselves from the competition in order to attract 
deals at sensible prices. In this regard, Caledonia has two significant 
advantages.
The first is the fact that we are a closed-ended investment trust with 
a long term supportive family shareholder, which enables us to 
invest for considerably longer than the majority of those who 
operate in unlisted markets, often for over a decade. Our main 
competition comes from the private equity industry, which raises 
money through funds and promises to deliver it back to fund 
holders within a designated period. This rarely allows them to invest 
for longer than five to seven years, whereas we have no such time 
constraints. If an investee company continues to perform and its 
management are of sufficient quality, we are able to remain as a 
shareholder rather than be forced by the time limits of a particular 
fund to have to sell our investment.
The second is our reputation. We strive to be fair and to work 
alongside management teams rather than, as is so often the case, 
take a view that managements work for us. We call this a ‘hands 
with’ rather than a ‘hands on’ approach. We believe that our 
established reputation for being a good partner for management 
teams continues to give us an advantage in the marketplace.
These characteristics have led to two interesting new investments 
this year, Seven Investment Management and Gala Bingo. Both 
companies were purchased without having to enter into an auction 
process, as the vendors and the managements believed that we 
would deliver on our promises and that we would be the right home 
for their businesses.

Investment performance
We take a longer term perspective when assessing Caledonia’s 
investment performance. The construction of our portfolio, with its 
significant portion of unquoted investments and lack of correlation 
to any particular equity market, has led the board to measure 
performance by comparing Caledonia’s NAVTR with the FTSE 
All-Share Total Return index over rolling ten year periods. History 
shows that a consistent performance of RPI+3% to RPI+6% will 
deliver a return that will outperform most markets over ten years. 
The table below shows a summary of performance against RPI for 
periods up to ten years and against the FTSE All-Share for ten years:
1 year

recently have slipped marginally below our RPI target area as 
designated by the shaded zone.

Income
Portfolio income for the year rose by 7 .3% to £50.2m which, 
after expenses, fully covered the dividend for the year. We place 
a strong emphasis on income yield in our investment strategy, 
as this ensures that we purchase cash generative companies 
which have the ability not only to increase their capital value but 
also to pay growing dividends to their shareholders on an annual 
basis. This supports our objective of paying an increasing annual 
dividend to our shareholders, which we have now done for 
49 consecutive years.
Expenses
Our ongoing charges ratio for the year was 1.01%, compared 
with 0.96% in 2015 on a like-for-like basis. The increase primarily 
reflected the costs of temporary office accommodation whilst our 
head office is being refurbished. Caledonia’s business model, which 
includes significant investment in unquoted businesses, requires 
more resource than a pure quoted equity portfolio, hence we 
have higher costs than a typical listed fund manager. For the first 
time this year, we have allocated share award costs relating to 
our performance-based incentive schemes to capital, in line 
with industry practice.
Balance sheet and cash
At the year end, our balance sheet was ungeared with a net 
cash position of £22.9m, compared with net cash of £131.0m at 
31 March 2015. During the year, we made investments totalling 
£406m and divestments of £315m, excluding purchases and sales 
within the Income & Growth pool. The two most substantial new 
investments were £74m in Seven Investment Management and 
£92m in Gala Bingo. We received proceeds of £79m from the sale 
of TGE Marine and distributions of £50m from the Capital Today 
China fund following further realisations of its holding in JD.com.
Strategy
The Cayzer family, whose ancestors built from scratch the business 
from which Caledonia derives its origins and who now owns 
some 48% of the company, takes a long term view. The stability 
and inter-generational time horizon of the family shareholding 
and other shareholders have helped to define Caledonia’s strategy, 
which remains to seek long term capital growth combined with 
an increasing annual dividend. This is executed by investing in 
two principal markets, listed equity and private equity. The 
company is managed via four ‘pools of capital’ covering both these 
markets, each with an allocated amount of capital and carefully 
designed return targets which reflect the risk appetite of the 
shareholder base.
During the year, the board carried out a detailed review of the 
strategy adopted in 2011. This concluded that the strategy 
had delivered good returns to date and should continue to do so. 
It is important to re-emphasise the key tenets of this strategy:
Strategic aims
• To grow capital value over the long term measured in real terms
• To pay an increasing annual dividend, which grows at or in excess 
of inflation over the long term
• To manage risk commensurate with shareholders’ requirements 
and our investment horizon.
Investment strategy
The portfolio is structured to deliver these strategic aims through:
• A long term investment horizon (ten years or longer), investing 
in quoted and unquoted businesses and funds that accumulate 
value over that time period
• A diversity of investment markets via pools that together reflect 
our risk/return aims
• A sustainable and increasing annual cash yield that is a prominent 
part of total return and covers annual dividends and expenses.

Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s report continued
Performance measurement
• To deliver annual average total returns of between RPI+3% and 
RPI+6% which, based on history, should deliver performance over 
a ten year period in line with or above most share indices, 
including the FTSE All-Share.
The board however agreed to make several minor adjustments 
to the strategy:
• To make some changes to the allocation ranges of some of 
the pools
• To increase the Funds pool’s exposure to private equity funds 
in the US and Asia through further commitments and to reduce 
its exposure to quoted market funds in those regions
• To reduce the Funds pool’s strategic requirement for income 
to zero, reflecting the structure of the funds in which it invests
• To reduce the target return for the Income & Growth pool from 
10% to 7%, reflecting its required risk/return profile.

Review of portfolio
The portfolio, before expenses and other net assets were taken into 
account, returned 4.1% for the year under review. Excluding 
transactions within the Income & Growth pool, we invested more 
than £400m during the course of the year, equivalent to some 
25% of the portfolio. Of this, some 40% was attributed to the 
Unquoted pool, with the two sizeable acquisitions of Seven 
Investment Management and Gala Bingo, and 40% to the Quoted 
pool. Realisations totalled £315m, with TGE Marine, Capital Today 
China and Quintain Estates being the largest.

Net assets 1,626.9 1,644.3 2.6 
The Unquoted pool produced a 15.2% return, which was 
commendable and included over £26m of income, an uplift of 12% 
over the previous year. The main driver of value was our investment 
in Park Holidays, where profitability increased significantly for the 
second consecutive year, enabling a refinancing of its bank facilities 
and payment of a special dividend just after the year end. The Funds 
pool also produced a respectable return of 5.9%, especially 
considering that over a third of its investments are in quoted market 
funds. These pools provide a good mitigation to the more volatile 
returns of the quoted equity markets. The Quoted pool suffered 
from its holding in Bristow Group falling considerably in value, 
though in line with the oil price. This pool, however, took advantage 
of the fall in equity markets in August to add several new holdings. 
The Income & Growth pool demonstrated its robust nature in the 
face of falling markets, ending the year with a broadly flat overall 
return. This was a particularly good effort, for which Jonathan Greig, 
in his first year as the manager of the fund, should take credit.
The changes to pool allocations have been mentioned in the 
strategy section above. The only pool currently outside its strategic 
range, some 3% below its lower range, is Income & Growth. This 
reflects the nature of the pool which we use, alongside cash and 
facilities, to provide liquidity or a store for capital as and when 
required. The exact timing of our larger investments and 
divestments from the Unquoted pool is difficult to estimate and 
the liquid nature of the Income & Growth pool adds to our flexibility.
Overview of pool performance
Quoted (£449m, 27% of net assets)
We invest in companies with established business models, strong 
balance sheets and good returns on capital and strong annual 
cash flows.
The Quoted pool produced a negative total return of 7 .0% for 
the year. Performance was held back by falls in the share price 
of Bristow Group and AG Barr, in which we have large holdings. 
Having taken profits from Bristow a couple of years ago and with 
our deep knowledge of the business gathered from over 25 years 
as an investor, we felt comfortable in adding to our holding at an 
advantageous price. AG Barr suffered from poor investor sentiment 
whilst the sugar tax argument raged in political circles. We have 
owned an 8% stake in this company for many years and believe that 
its prospects remain good, led by an excellent management team. 
Other notable detractors from performance were Rolls-Royce, 
which we sold following several profit warnings, and Avanti 
Communications, in which we significantly reduced our stake in 
the early part of the year.
On the bright side, more recent additions to the portfolio, including 
Microsoft, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Unilever, British American 
Tobacco and Colgate Palmolive, all produced returns of over 20%. 
Quintain Estates was taken over during the year at a good premium 
and Hill & Smith continued to produce excellent results that 
translated into a strong share price performance.

Annual report 2016 Caledonia Investments plc  
We have been overall sellers in the quoted markets for several 
years, as valuations have become stretched, although the occasional 
market hiccup has allowed us to deploy some capital, as happened 
in August this year. However, we remain wary of high market levels, 
low investor confidence and signs that GDP growth is slowing a little.
Income & Growth (£194m, 12% of net assets)
We invest in a portfolio of liquid global equities that produces a 
reliable and increasing income stream.
The portfolio was repositioned earlier in the year to take a more 
defensive stance. With the benefit of hindsight, this proved well 
timed and the result for the year, a flat return, compared well with a 
market that retreated by 4%. The pool also returned a 4.1% dividend 
yield, which helped to underpin our overall income requirement.
Unquoted (£646m, 39% of net assets)
We invest in unlisted businesses requiring capital and an investor 
with a balance sheet who is able to provide a long term perspective. 
We mainly invest in majority positions.
The Unquoted pool returned over 15% for the year under review, 
including over £25m of income. Park Holidays was the outstanding 
performer in the pool, producing a total return of 63% over the 
course of the year, which included a £12m dividend. In addition, 
Cobehold, the Belgian investment company, produced a healthy 
23% sterling return after a couple of flat years.
The market remains busy with plenty of businesses available for 
purchase, the Unquoted team reviewing over 220 during the year. 
We sold one business during the year, TGE Marine for £79m, and 
since the year end have realised our stake in Bowers & Wilkins, the 
premium audio equipment manufacturer, for £24m. We made two 
purchases during the year, Seven Investment Management (‘7IM’) 
for £74m and Gala Bingo for £92m. Both businesses fit our criteria 
well and have made good starts in the portfolio.
7IM is a fast growing wealth 
management company with 
funds under management of 
£10bn. The experienced 
management team, who started 
7IM 11 years ago, were introduced to Caledonia whilst searching for 
replacement shareholders and we were pleased that we had the 
characteristics that they were looking for in a shareholder.
Gala Coral had been searching for a 
purchaser for its retail bingo business prior 
to its merger with Ladbrokes. The head of 
our Unquoted team knew the business 
well from earlier in his career and we were 
able to agree terms to buy this substantial 
and cash generative company, because of 
our ability to move quickly to close the deal.
Since 2011, when Caledonia’s new strategy was implemented, the 
pool has produced an annualised return of 12.4%. Over the past 
three years this has increased to 17 .4%. The objective of the pool is 
to produce consistent returns, both on capital and income accounts, 
without taking too much risk. The businesses that we have 
purchased over the past five years reflect this strategy and have 
the capability of producing good returns in the future.
Funds (£308m, 19% of net assets)
We invest in both private equity and quoted market funds, with 
an emphasis on providing exposure to areas of the world where 
we are less willing to invest directly.
The Funds pool return of 5.9% was respectable considering the 
volatile markets in Asia where we have several quoted market fund 
investments. We took the opportunity created by market weakness 
to top up several holdings, including PVAM Perlus Microcap, 
Arlington AVM Ranger, Macquarie Asia New Stars and NTAsian.
The private equity portfolio continued to perform well and we 
made several new commitments during the course of the year 
to funds in the US and Asia.
We received distributions of £50m from the Capital Today China 
fund, a large portion of which was proceeds from its sale of JD.com. 
This fund has produced a return of 11.7x money invested and an 
IRR of 47 .5% so far over its ten year life. Kathy Xu, the manager, 
has delivered outstanding results, having backed four separate 
businesses that have returned over 10x the initial investment. 
We consider ourselves fortunate to have been a cornerstone 
investor in this fund.
Looking ahead, the Funds pool will increase its exposure to private 
equity funds, particularly in the US which is a mature market, and 
also in Asia, though at a lower rate due to the infancy of this market.

Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s report continued
Dividend and discount
The company paid an interim dividend of 14.3p on 7 January 2016 
and a second interim of 38.3p on 1 April 2016 making a total for 
the year of 52.6p, the 49th consecutive year in which the annual 
dividend has been raised. No final dividend is proposed. The 
dividend is a vital component of our return to shareholders and the 
strategy of the company is focused on its maintenance and steady 
increase. During the year, the discount of the share price to our 
NAV per share ranged between 12% and 26% and the share price 
rose marginally, from 2281p at the beginning of the year to 2285p, 
whereas the FTSE All-Share fell by some 7%.
We did not make any share buybacks during the year, but we will 
again seek the necessary permissions from shareholders at the 
AGM to buy in shares should they offer particular value.
Board
Robert Woods stepped down from the board in March 2016. 
He joined in 2011 at a time of strategic change at Caledonia and his 
depth of experience and wisdom was a particular source of strength 
for the company and management during his time on the board. 
We wish him well in his retirement and will miss his insights into 
the world of trade that stemmed from his career in shipping.
Outlook
We are faced with several seminal moments this year. There 
is a referendum on British membership of the EU and the US 
Presidential election, both of which have the potential to destabilise 
the existing order. There is a lack of fundamental confidence in GDP 
growth, be it in China, the US, Europe, or at home in the UK. The 
central bankers have utilised extreme monetary policies to stimulate 
economies without much effect and seemingly have few tools to 
bring to bear if growth deteriorates. Equity markets have witnessed 
a prolonged period of growth but are seemingly expensive, perhaps 
lacking the underlying earnings growth from companies to justify 
those valuations. However, investors have few alternative options, 
with bond yields at record lows.
We have invested in companies that have consistent and 
dependable cash flows, such that they are able to pay us annual 
dividends whilst continuing to grow steadily. We have exposure 
through the listed markets to some of the world’s leading brands 
that will continue to sell goods to consumers and businesses alike 
whatever the state of the economy and our unquoted portfolio 
complements and diversifies the shorter term volatility of the 
quoted markets. This gives us confidence that we will be able to 
meet our shareholders’ requirements for capital growth and income 
over the longer term, without needing to expose their capital to 
undue risk.

back to the shipping empire established 
by Sir Charles Cayzer in 1878. 
We have the backing of the Cayzer 
family, which owns some 48.5% of 
the share capital and provides both 
support for our long term value 
investment horizon and a foundation 
to our culture of conservative 
generational wealth management.
Business model
We aim to deliver long term growth to both shareholder capital 
and income by investing in a balanced, risk managed range of 
asset classes, across diversified sectors and regions. We focus on 
established businesses, where return on capital employed is a 
differentiator of longer term performance and where underlying 
real assets provide risk mitigation to the balance sheet. We use 
gearing judiciously and focus it within the Unquoted pool, where 
the investment case includes strong cash generation to support 
a resilient repayment plan. Our Funds pool targets investments that 
employ little or no gearing in structuring their returns.
We have funding flexibility, through a £125m revolving credit facility 
in the company, which is used to mitigate any short term illiquidity 
within the portfolio, facilitating the bridging of short term 
investment flows. We also have a £50m revolving credit facility 
in a subsidiary treasury company.
Our business model has been tested over many years to deliver 
long term growth in capital and an increasing annual dividend to 
shareholders.
Pools of capital
We manage our portfolio through distinct pools of capital, each 
headed by an experienced, specialist investment executive. Each 
pool invests to achieve differentiated capital and income returns, 
combining to provide a balanced total return for Caledonia.
• The Quoted pool focuses on identifying opportunities to build 
meaningful positions in long term value businesses.
• The Income & Growth pool provides an exposure to global 
companies offering higher dividend yield and dividend growth 
expectations. This pool provides both a reliable platform for our 
overall income requirements and a source of readily accessible 
liquidity.
• The Unquoted pool targets direct majority, and in exceptional 
cases minority, stakes in private companies, where an opportunity 
exists to partner a strong management team with capital, without 
the traditional restrictions of short term private equity financing. 
We take board seats in all significant private company 
investments. 
• The Funds pool contains investments in both private equity 
and quoted market funds, providing Caledonia with diversified 
overseas reach in areas where our investment model would 
make direct investing more difficult to manage. The Funds pool 
is primarily focused on investment in North America and Asia.

Principles
We allocate our capital predominantly amongst quoted equities, 
private companies and funds. We identify a strategic allocation 
range to each of these classes commensurate with our overall  
risk/return objectives. These allocation ranges are reviewed 
regularly to ensure they remain consistent with our strategy 
and market conditions.

We look to achieve a diverse investment portfolio, managed 
through distinct investment pools.
We achieve geographic exposure outside the UK through the 
global reach of our direct investments and particularly in Asia 
and North America through the Funds pool.
Overall exposures to geography, currency and asset classes are 
actively monitored and managed by our executive management, 
under the supervision of the board. The portfolio is further 
diversified through investing in international companies with 
revenues generated throughout the world.
We have a concentrated investment portfolio, but look to mitigate 
concentration risk by managing the value of an investment in any 
one company to less than 10% of our net asset value and will look 
for appropriate market opportunities to recycle value throughout 
the portfolio to achieve this in an appropriate timeframe. In recent 
years, our investment concentration has reduced.

Manage and support investees
We manage our investments as pools 
of capital, focusing ownership and 
responsibility on our executive team. 
Where we take a board seat, we can both 
actively monitor the development of our 
investment and contribute long term 
support and governance.
Make significant investments
We invest directly in both listed and unlisted 
opportunities around the world. Our 
minimum investment size is £10m and we 
aim to invest between £25m and £100m for 
significant equity interests in companies.
Develop business network
Maintaining our reputation as a supportive 
and constructively-involved long term 
investor enables us to develop our network 
of contacts, who will give us priority 
consideration when new deal 
opportunities arise.
Identify best opportunities
We adopt a disciplined process of research 
and due diligence to identify value 
opportunities in well-managed, long term 
businesses with established business 
models and strong cash flows. Such 
opportunities are typically not reliant on 
leverage for returns and offer long term 
growth potential.
Monitor and control risk
Individual investments and the investment 
portfolio as a whole are monitored for risk 
against our strategic objectives. Consideration 
is given to concentration exposure, volatility 
levels, liquidity and geographical and industry 
sector diversity. Private company 
performance is closely monitored through 
monthly reporting of key metrics.
Attract preferential deal flow
Our reputation, network of deal originators 
and family tradition enable us to access 
premium investment opportunities not 
always available to others. This derives from 
both tracking quality management teams in 
proven businesses and through the contacts 
we make through our extensive board 
representation network.
Investment process
Our investment process is built from a disciplined series of steps, 
leveraging Caledonia’s reputation and the experience of our 
investment team. We look to identify long term value through each 
stage, including sourcing opportunities and initial reviews, through 
due diligence, approval and deal execution. The performance of 
our investments is subject to a formal review process and both 
individual investments and the portfolio as a whole are periodically 
measured against a number of risk control metrics, including 
concentration, liquidity, volatility and sector and geographical 
diversity. In addition, we ensure that we have formal representation 
on the boards of all our core private company investments and, 
where we have a significant holding, some listed investments.

The Caledonia team
At its heart, our investment process is 
focused on recruiting and retaining high 
quality investment executives to maintain 
deal flow and investment continuity, who 
understand and are able to execute 
Caledonia’s investment philosophy.
Target returns
Our investment approach is aimed at delivering high single digit 
total annual returns, over rolling ten year periods. This investment 
horizon provides the time frame for businesses to grow and 
accumulate value in a controlled manner, within both the public 
and private markets, whilst mitigating some of the volatility inherent 
in short term trading investment strategies.
Over rolling ten year periods, we believe such an investment 
approach both optimises risk/return characteristics and 
outperforms most markets. Over a ten year investment horizon, 
we target a sustainable annual yield from portfolio assets, providing 
a balance to total return between income and capital appreciation.
We target real return and the chart below shows Caledonia’s 
annualised ten year rolling net asset value total return growth,

Investment review
Performance and analysis
Over the year, our investment 
performance delivered an NAV 
total return of 2.6%.
Over the last six years we have 
rebalanced our portfolio substantially, 
increasing diversification, yield and 
portfolio liquidity whilst reducing 
investment concentration and the 
number of subscale investments.
Our investment process is at the heart of our current performance 
and future prospects. We have an unconstrained approach, which 
allows us to look across regions, sectors, size and time horizons. 
Our research and disciplined process is fundamental to our choice 
of investments.
Performance
Our NAV total return over the year was 2.6%, which built on a total 
return of 14.2% in the previous year. Over the year, we have 
developed our portfolio through significant new investment, funded 
by opportunistic disposals and managed top-slicing. The portfolio 
has benefited from revaluation and realisation gains, as well as 
higher levels of income. Our investment portfolio produced a 4.1% 
return, which, after management and other expenses, delivered 
an overall NAV total return of 2.6%.
The 4.1% portfolio return comprised increases in the valuation of 
our investments and the income that they yielded.

Annual report 2016 Caledonia Investments plc  
During the year, we realised £450.9m, spread evenly across the four 
pools, with around one-fifth resulting from the sale of TGE Marine.
Net portfolio gains over the year totalled £12.9m, comprising 
£174.4m of gains and £161.5m of losses. Around one-third of the 
gross gains were generated by Park Holidays and 40% of the losses 
by Bristow Group and Sterling Industries. Overall, the Quoted pool 
generated £47 .8m of net losses and the Unquoted pool £53.4m 
of net gains.

Total portfolio investments 548.6 
During the year, we made two substantial unquoted investments. 
We invested £92.3m for 98.9% of the equity in Gala Bingo, the UK’s 
largest retail bingo operator, and £73.6m for 93.6% of the equity in 
Seven Investment Management, the UK provider of discretionary 
fund management, retail investment fund and platform services 
to UK investors.
Other new investments included four purchases through the 
Quoted pool. £35.0m was invested in Flowserve, the US listed 
manufacturer of pumps, valves, seals and components to the 
process industries. £25.0m was invested in Union Pacific, the 
US listed operator of a railroad franchise in the western two-thirds 
of the US. £10.9m was invested in Thermo Fisher Scientific, the 
US listed provider of products and services to life sciences research. 
£10.3m was invested in Unilever, the UK listed provider of food, 
home care and personal care products.
Follow-on investments included a further £21.7m in British 
American Tobacco, the UK listed tobacco company, £17 .1m in 
Bristow Group, the US listed offshore helicopter transport services 
company, and £37 .0m in two US funds and one Asian fund.
The £142.6m invested through the Income & Growth pool reflected 
a restructuring of the portfolio to increase yield and reduce 
volatility, by reducing the number of holdings and increasing the 
weighting of businesses domiciled in the UK.
Realisations
Proceeds from portfolio realisations during the year totalled 
£450.9m (2015 – £371.7m), summarised as follows:

During the year, we disposed of our 67 .9% holding in TGE Marine, 
the German gas engineering business, for £78.8m to Mitsui 
Engineering & Shipbuilding. This investment delivered a lifetime 
IRR of 39% and a money multiple of 3.5x over nine years.
We received £49.6m of distributions from the Capital Today China 
Growth fund on its sale of part of its holding in JD.com, the US listed 
Chinese internet retail company.
In the Quoted pool, we realised a total of £96.9m from the sale of 
part of our holdings in Close Brothers and Avanti Communications 
and the whole of our stakes in Quintain Estates, Rolls-Royce and 
Weir.

Total portfolio return 12.9 50.2 63.1 4.1 
The overall return benefited significantly from the revaluation of 
Park Holidays, based on a CBRE property valuation and strong 
trading results in the year. We also saw a significant uplift in the 
valuation of TGE Marine and Quintain Estates, resulting from the 
sale of our holdings in both companies during the year.
Partially offsetting these gains, we recorded valuation losses in 
Bristow Group, whose share price reflected the continued oil price 
decline, and Sterling Industries, on the back of an economic 
slowdown reducing demand for its services.

The investments in Seven Investment Management and Gala Bingo 
and the sale of TGE Marine, resulted in the balance of exposure 
in the Unquoted pool shifting from Europe to the UK. In addition, 
the Quoted pool used UK cash to invest in new investments in the 
US and the Funds pool invested distributions from the Capital Today 
China Growth fund in US fund drawdowns.
Further, restructuring of the Income & Growth pool resulted in 
a shift of investment exposure from Europe and Asia to the UK.
At the end of the year, non-UK investments accounted for 46% of 
our investment portfolio. However, much of our investment is in 
multinational companies, which generate a large proportion of their 
revenues overseas. The following chart shows the geographic 
analysis by revenue generation, which shows an exposure to non-UK 
economies of 59%.

Quoted market funds 8%  7%
Cash and other 3%  9%
Over the year, there was a substantial shift in allocation from cash 
and listed equities to private companies. This was due principally to 
the acquisitions of Seven Investment Management and Gala Bingo, 
partially offset by the sale of TGE Marine.

The following chart analyses net assets by currency exposure, based 
on the currencies in which investments are denominated or traded.

The changes in currency exposures over the year principally 
reflected portfolio changes. In particular, the sale of TGE Marine and 
European Income & Growth pool investments, the acquisitions of 
Seven Investment Management and Gala Bingo in the UK and fund 
investment in the US resulted in reduced euro and increased sterling 
and US dollar exposures.

Investment review continued
Quoted pool
The Quoted pool is a concentrated 
portfolio of listed equities.
Our focus is on mature, long term 
businesses with significant presence 
in their market space and where assets 
produce strong returns on capital, 
giving strength to their balance sheets.
The Quoted pool contains significant holdings in well managed 
companies, held for the long term. These investments typically offer 
substance, brand, intellectual property and strong market positions. 
We target opportunities that have a long term record of return on 
capital employed and a strong asset base. In common with the 
wider Caledonia philosophy, we look to invest in companies whose 
business model emphasises long term accumulation of value, 
consistent with our target returns and risk.
The pool started the year with investments valued at £447 .7m and 
ended with a value of £449.3m, with £49.4m of net investment 
(2015 – £55.6m net divestment) substantially offset by net valuation 
losses of £47 .8m. In total, £156.9m was invested and £112.9m was 
realised. New investments included £35.0m in Flowserve, £25.0m 
in Union Pacific, £10.9m in Thermo Fisher Scientific and £10.3m 
in Unilever. Also, we added a further £21.7m to British American 
Tobacco and £17 .1m to Bristow Group. Realisations included £34.8m 
from Quintain Estates, £19.2m from selling down Close Brothers, 
£15.4m from selling down Avanti Communications and £13.0m from 
Weir Group.
Including £13.9m of income, the Quoted pool recorded a negative 
return of 7 .0%, following last year’s positive return of 3.5%.
The greatest effect on pool performance in the year was the 
significant loss of value of £39.3m from Bristow Group, where its 
share price was significantly impacted by the declining oil price. 
This is an investment from which we sold down £35.2m in the year 
ended 31 March 2014, at market highs, and we took the opportunity 
of the current market volatility to reinvest in the current year. 
Balancing our exposure to the broader commodity-related cycle, 
we exited our holding in Weir Group and invested in Flowserve, 
which we feel offers a broader range and diversity of markets. 
Our increased investment in British American Tobacco reflects 
our confidence in the long term value supported by a proven 
dividend income.

Income & Growth pool
The Income & Growth pool comprises 
a portfolio of 24 investments in 
international blue chip businesses 
of global scale and market presence. 
The pool targets a net yield of 4.5%.
Over the year, the Income & Growth pool invested £142.6m and 
realised £135.8m. Net dividend income during the year was £8.6m, 
representing a net yield of 4.1% on the average invested capital.
The Income & Growth pool was created in March 2011. Over the 
five years of its existence, the Income &Growth pool has produced 
a return of 41.8%, giving an annualised rate of 7 .2%, and provided 
a total £33.4m of income to Caledonia.
The Income & Growth pool has been affected by the volatility 
in global equity markets over the year. However, the underlying 
strength of the investment companies, supported by strong 
dividend income has seen the pool outperform the FTSE All-Share 
for the year, with a negative total return of 0.4%, compared with 
a FTSE loss of 3.9%.
During the year, the Income & Growth pool has refined its 
investments, with the goal of increasing yield and reducing volatility. 
The number of holdings has been reduced from 40 to 24 and the 
geographical weighting has been shifted to companies domiciled in 
the UK or with revenues generated in the UK, thereby reducing the 
impact of volatile foreign exchange markets on income and returns. 
The focus has been on companies with a resilient earnings model, 
high cash flow generation and a high and growing dividend yield. 
All holdings are of similar size, around £7m to £9m in value at the 
year end.

Unquoted pool
The Unquoted pool contains both 
majority and significant minority 
holdings in private companies. 
Our focus is on established businesses, 
led by sound management teams, 
where our target investment size 
of £25m to £100m provides a 
meaningful presence and growth 
capital supporting double-digit 
operating margins.
The year has seen significant market opportunities for the portfolio, 
with two new investments in Seven Investment Management and 
Gala Bingo and the sale of TGE Marine. The pool NAV increased over 
the year, from £510.3m to £646.3m, after £82.9m of net investment 
and net valuation gains of £53.4m, most significantly from the 
Park Holidays investment, which has performed strongly. Including 
£25.8m of income, the Unquoted pool achieved a return over the 
year of 15.2%, building on a return of 19.2% last year and 17 .7% 
in 2014.
On 7 September 2015, we invested £73.6m for 93.6% of Seven 
Investment Management, the UK provider of discretionary fund 
management, retail investment fund and platform services to 
UK investors.
On 28 September 2015, we disposed of our 67 .9% holding in  
TGE Marine, the German gas engineering business, for £78.7m 
to Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding. This investment delivered 
a lifetime IRR of 39% and a money return of 3.5x over nine years.
On 19 December 2015, following a change of control approval from 
the Gambling Commission and finalisation of a £155m senior debt 
facility, we invested £92.3m for 98.9% of the equity of Gala Bingo, 
the UK’s largest retail bingo operator, in a transaction valuing the 
business at £241m.
The pool performance has again been strong across the portfolio, 
primarily reflecting the strong market positions and cash generative 
nature of the investments. This has provided an excellent mitigation 
to the volatility of broader quoted equity markets.

Funds pool
The Funds pool comprises investments 
in private equity and quoted market 
collective investment vehicles, 
structured through companies, limited 
partnerships and open-ended funds.
Our fund investments provide broad 
exposure to areas of the world where 
it would prove more difficult for us 
to invest directly.
The Funds pool performed well over the year, achieving a total 
return of 5.9%, following a total return of 45.2% in the previous year. 
The Capital Today China fund continued to perform well with a 
return of 6.6% and, at the same time, continued its programme of 
realisation of its highly successful JD.com investment, following that 
company’s IPO last year.
The nature of the longer term investment process within the Funds 
pool requires the continuous origination of, and investment in, new 
funds, to ensure both effective vintage management and a balance 
between maturing funds and those at the initial stages, where returns 
are naturally phased to later years. Over the year , the returns from 
the investments in mature funds, including those managed by Capital 
Today, Greenhill Capital, CBPE Capital, Livingbridge and JF Lehman, 
more than offset the expected early losses from net investments in 
the Macquarie, NTAsian, and New Silk Road funds.
During the year, we committed to a number of new private equity 
funds. In the Asia Pacific region, we committed $50m (£34.8m) to 
Axiom Asia IV, a fund of funds, $12m (£8.3m) to Decheng Capital II, 
investing in early and growth stage life sciences companies in China, 
and $30m (£20.9m) to PAG Asia II, a pan-Asia buyout fund. In the US, 
we committed $50m (£34.8m) to the Aberdeen US PE VI fund of 
funds, $30m (£20.9m) to CenterOak Fund 1, focused in control-
oriented investments in middle market companies, $30m (£20.9m) 
to JFL Equity Investors IV, investing in companies in the defence, 
aerospace and maritime industries, and $25m (£17 .4m) to 
Stonepeak Infrastructure II, which has a conservative yet 
opportunistic approach to infrastructure investing. In Canada, we 
committed C$35m (£18.8m) to Ironbridge III, focusing on buyout 
investments in the Canadian lower-mid market.
In addition, we made a number of investments in quoted market funds. 
We invested $10m (£6.4m) in the NT Asian Emerging Leaders fund, 
specialising in undiscovered small cap companies, $20m (£13.3m) in 
the Macquarie Asia New Stars fund, aiming to capture capital growth of 
small and mid-sized companies in Asia, $20m (£13.2m) in the Arlington 
AVM Ranger fund, investing in US equities, and $10m (£7 .0m) in the 
PVAM Perlus Microcap fund, also investing in US equities.
Realisations in the year totalled £113.6m, comprising £42.4m from 
the sale of securities and fund interests and £71.2m from fund 
distributions. Included in the sale of securities and fund interests 
were £14.6m from the redemption of shares in the Newton Asian 
Income fund, £13.0m from the PVAM Perlus Microcap fund and 
£10.6m from the Ocean Dial Gateway to India fund. Fund 
distributions included £49.6m from the Capital Today China fund, 
resulting from sales of part of its holding in JD.com.

Financial review
The strength of the company’s balance 
sheet has continued to reflect our 
longer term risk managed approach 
to capital accumulation. Sustained 
growth in revenue supports 
a record of 49 consecutive years 
of dividend growth.
Caledonia’s net asset value is significantly exposed to global equity 
markets as a whole and the current year has seen significant 
uncertainty and consequent volatility in the markets. Nevertheless, 
our balanced exposure to those worldwide markets, through our 
pool structure and our exposure to both quoted and unquoted 
equity, has mitigated much of this. Our portfolio, whilst focused 
on long term value accumulation achieved a total return of 4.1%, 
compared with the FTSE All-Share loss of 3.9%.
Caledonia’s net asset value increased to £1,644.3m at 31 March 2016, 
from £1,626.9m at the start of the year. The following chart analyses

Total return
The company seeks to generate total return from both investment 
income, net of expenses, and long term capital growth. For the 
year ended 31 March 2016, the total return was £42.8m (2015 – 
£205.9m), of which £34.2m (2015 – £32.8m) derived from income 
and £8.6m (2015 – £173.1m) from capital.
Revenue performance
Investment income in the year of £50.7m (including £0.5m from 
unallocated investments) was 7 .4% higher than last year’s £47 .2m 
(including £0.4m from unallocated investments). The Quoted and 
Unquoted pools contributed £2.5m and £2.7m respectively more 
than in 2015 and the Funds pool £1.7m less. The Quoted pool more 
than replaced the loss of income from the sales of Dewan Housing 
and Close Brothers with dividends from new investments in British 
American Tobacco, Union Pacific and Flowserve, combined with 
increased distributions from Spirax Sarco and LondonMetric. The 
Unquoted pool replaced reduced dividends following disposals from 
the Latshaw Group and of our TGE Marine investment with an 
increased £12.1m of dividends from Park Holidays. The Funds pool 
did not see a repeat of its income distributions from the Livingbridge 
and CBPE Capital funds this year.
Investment income represented a net yield on the monthly average 
portfolio value of 3.3%, the same as last year.
Capital performance
Net gains on investments totalled £12.6m (2015 – £179.9m), 
including £0.4m of losses on unallocated investments (2015 – £0.4m 
of net gains). Overall, investments generated £174.4m of gross gains, 
offset by £161.9m of gross losses. The principal individual gain was 
£49.3m from Park Holidays, arising from an external valuation of the 
properties and excellent trading results. Cobehold increased in value 
by £19.0m, based on the manager’s valuation. In addition,  
TGE Marine and Quintain Estates recorded gains of £13.9m and 
£11.3m as a result of their sales in the year. Against these gains, 
Bristow Group recorded a loss of £39.3m, reflecting the declining

Industries recorded a loss of £24.4m, as a result of a slowdown in 
the areas of manufacturing utilising Sterling’s specialised services.
Overall, across the entire portfolio our investment structure 
provided a good diversified balance to volatile markets, with listed 
investments recording valuation losses of £57 .4m and unlisted 
investments £69.9m of valuation gains.

balance
The company maintains a prudent valuation approach to all 
investments. Internal valuations of investments are conducted in 
accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital 
Valuation Guidelines. Adjustments are normally made to earnings 
multiples – up to 30% – to account for points of difference between 
the comparators and the company being valued, most significantly 
reflecting relative marketability and scale. Unlisted property and 
fund investments are based on external valuations.
The following chart summarises the source of valuations across the 
portfolio, illustrating that only 8% of the portfolio value is subject to 
a directors’ valuation in the year:
Portfolio by valuation source
    
Quoted price   4 0 %  
External fund manager   28%  
E x t e r n a l v a l u e r   1 4 %  
Directors’ valuation   8%  
Recent transaction   10%  
Expenses
Caledonia has revised its policy of allocating expenses between 
revenue and capital in order more closely to adhere to AIC guidance 
and broader market practice. In addition to allocating transaction 
costs and external performance fees, share-based payment 
expenses are now allocated to capital. Caledonia’s share-based 
compensation is directly linked to investment performance and 
is therefore properly viewed as an expense against gains on 
investments included in capital.
Caledonia has also revised its ongoing charges methodology better 
to reflect the purpose of the calculation as a measure of the costs 
of running funds in the absence of any purchases or sales of 
investments and assuming that markets remained static throughout 
the period. In particular, costs relating to compensation schemes 
that are directly linked to investment performance are now 
excluded.
Our ongoing charges ratio for the year was 1.01% (2015 revised – 
0.96%). The ongoing charges ratio is calculated on an industry 
standard basis, comprising published management expenses over 
the monthly average NAV.
Overall, the company’s revenue management expenses were slightly 
higher than last year at £16.2m (2015 – £14.3m). This primarily 
reflected the increased costs of the company’s temporary office 
accommodation while the head office building is being refurbished.
Dividend
We recognise that a reliable source of growing dividends is an 
important part of shareholder total return over both the short and 
longer terms and have extended our record of growing annual 
dividends to 49 consecutive years.
We paid an interim dividend of 14.3p per share on 7 January 2016 
and a second interim dividend of 38.3p per share on 1 April 2016. 
The total dividend for the year of 52.6p is an increase of 4.0% on 
last year.
Including the second interim dividend, not accrued in the accounts 
at 31 March 2016, the dividends to be paid out of revenue earnings 
for the year ended 31 March 2016 totalled £29.0m, which was more 
than covered by the net revenue for the year of £34.2m.
Cash flows, liquidity and facilities
Over the year, we moved from opening net cash of £131.0m to 
net cash of £22.9m, principally due to net portfolio investments.
The total cash decrease over the year of £108.1m is analysed by  
pool as follows:

At 31 March 2016, the company had undrawn committed facilities 
of £125m, expiring in April 2018. In addition, its treasury subsidiary 
had £50m of undrawn committed facilities.
Treasury management
The Treasury department provides a central service to group 
companies and conducts its operations in accordance with clearly 
defined guidelines and policies, which have been reviewed and 
approved by the board. Treasury transactions are only undertaken 
as a consequence of underlying commercial transactions or 
exposures and do not seek to take active risk positions. It is 
Treasury’s role to ensure that the group has sufficient available 
funds to meet its needs in the foreseeable future.

20 Annual report 2016 Caledonia Investments plc  
Valuation methodology
Investments are measured at the directors’ estimate of fair value 
at the reporting date, in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurement. Fair value is the amount for which an asset could 
be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s 
length transaction.
Publicly traded securities
Investments listed in an active market are valued at their bid price 
on the reporting date. When a bid price is unavailable, the price 
of the most recent transaction will normally be used.
Unlisted companies
Unlisted company investments are valued by applying an 
appropriate valuation technique, which makes maximum use of 
market-based information, is consistent with models generally used 
by market participants and is applied consistently from period to 
period, except where a change would result in a better estimation 
of fair value.
The value of an unlisted company investment is generally 
crystallised through the sale or flotation of the entire business, 
rather than the sale of an individual instrument. Therefore, 
the estimation of fair value is based on the assumed realisation 
of the underlying business at the reporting date, based on the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation 
Guidelines (December 2015). Recognition is given to the 
uncertainties inherent in estimating the fair value of unlisted 
companies and appropriate caution is applied in exercising 
judgments and making the necessary estimates.
Enterprise value is normally determined using one of the following 
valuation methodologies:
Price of recent investment
Where the investment being valued was recently acquired or a 
recent transaction has taken place, its cost or transaction price will 
generally provide a good indication of fair value. This methodology 
is likely to be appropriate only for a limited period after the date 
of the relevant transaction.
Multiples
This methodology involves the application of an earnings multiple 
to the maintainable earnings of the business and is likely to be 
appropriate for an investment in an established business with an 
identifiable stream of continuing earnings.
The earnings multiple used is determined by reference to market-
based multiples appropriate for the business and correlating to the 
period and calculation of earnings of the company being valued. 
The aim is to identify comparator companies that are similar in 
terms of risk and growth prospects to the company being valued. 
Earnings multiples are adjusted for points of difference between the 
comparator and the company being valued where appropriate, 
including the ability of Caledonia to effect change in the company 
and risks associated with holding an unlisted share.
Maintainable earnings balance reliability and relevance. Generally, 
the latest historical accounts are used unless reliable forecast results 
for the current year are available. Earnings are adjusted where 
appropriate for exceptional or non-recurring items and an average 
of more than one year’s earnings may be used to estimate 
maintainable earnings for cyclical or volatile businesses.
Net assets
The net assets methodology is likely to be appropriate for a business 
whose value derives mainly from the underlying value of its assets 
rather than its earnings, such as a property holding company or an 
investment business. It may also be appropriate for a business that 
is not making an adequate return on assets and for which a greater 
value can be realised by liquidating the business and selling its 
assets. A third party valuation may be used to give the fair value 
of a certain asset or group of assets.
Fund interests
Fund interests refer to participations in arrangements to create 
a designated pool of capital to invest in a wider range of assets 
than is feasible for an individual investor and to share the costs 
and benefits.
Open-ended funds, including investment companies with variable 
capital, typically report regular net asset values, which usually 
provide a reliable basis to estimate fair value. If the price reported 
by the fund is not available at the reporting date, the latest available 
price is used and may be adjusted to take account of changes or 
events to the reporting date.
Closed-ended funds include unlisted investment companies and 
limited partnerships. For these investments, the fair value estimate 
is based on a summation of the estimated fair value of the 
underlying investments. Fund manager valuation reports may be 
used where there is evidence that the valuation is derived using fair 
value principles and may be adjusted to take account of changes or 
events to the reporting date. Adjustment may also be necessary for 
features of the fund agreement not captured in the valuation report, 
such as performance fees or carried interest.
Other investments
Other investments include preference shares, loan notes or facilities, 
options, warrants and treasury instruments that are not publicly 
traded and do not form part of an investment in an unlisted 
company. For such investments, appropriate valuation techniques 
are adopted and used consistently.

Risk management
Effective risk management is 
a key component of the company’s 
investment model and assists in 
ensuring that the different parts of 
the group operate within strategic 
risk parameters. The board has 
overall responsibility for setting 
and monitoring the company’s 
risk appetite.
Caledonia risk governance and structure
Risk management and its governance is the responsibility of the 
board, with the executive given the task of ensuring an effective 
and transparent process to ensure risks are identified, documented, 
assessed and, where appropriate, mitigated. The board sets the risk 
appetite within the business model and this is communicated 
through the executive to all those with managerial responsibilities. 
Risks emanate from all parts of the business and are considered by 
all executives as part of their work, from origination of investments 
to ongoing monitoring and portfolio management. 
The Audit Committee assesses and monitors the risk management 
processes and structure and specifically reviews the controls 
assurance programme. This programme identifies key mitigating 
controls, tests their operation and reports on compliance and 
effective operation. This, together with reports arising from the 
external audit, provides input to the board as a whole on the status 
of the risk management process.

Risk management reporting
Caledonia manages and reports risk through two primary areas of 
focus – an overall business risk report and a portfolio investment 
risk report.
The business risk report considers the wider business environment 
of the group, including business continuity planning, IT and cyber 
security risks, regulatory risks and financial control risks. Caledonia 
manages business risk through a number of integrated processes 
and procedures operating throughout the year to provide risk 
visibility to both the executive team and the wider board.

Risk management continued
Principal risks Mitigation Key developments
Risk level 
change
Strategic
Risks in relation to the appropriateness of the business model to 
deliver long term growth in capital and income and the effective 
communication and delivery of the business model.
Strategic risks include the appropriate allocation of capital in relation 
to geographic, sector and currency exposures.
The company’s business model and strategy are reviewed 
periodically, against market conditions and target returns.
The performance of the company and its key risks are 
monitored regularly by management and the board.
Caledonia reviews its investment strategy annually, taking  
into consideration the current and potential future 
investing environment and discussions with executives. 
The investment strategy is reviewed and approved by 
the board.
Investment
Risks in respect of specific investment and realisation decisions.
Investment risks include the appropriate research and due diligence 
of new investments and the timely execution of both investments 
and realisations for optimising shareholder value.
Pool managers have well-developed networks through 
which they attract proprietary deal flow.
Investment opportunities are subject to rigorous and 
disciplined investment appraisals and multi-stage approval 
processes. Target entry and exit events and prices are 
monitored and updated regularly, in relation to market 
conditions and strategic aims.
Caledonia has continued actively to recruit new members 
to its investment teams and has expanded the range of tools 
used in the investment assessment process.
Market
Risk of losses in value of investments arising from sudden and 
significant movements in market prices, particularly in highly  
volatile markets.
Caledonia invests primarily in listed equities, private companies and 
equity funds. Its principal market risks are therefore equity price 
volatility, foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate 
volatility. An explanation of these risks, along with sensitivities, 
is included in note 22 to these accounts.
Market risks and sensitivities are reviewed on a weekly basis 
and actions taken to balance appropriately risk and return.
A regular review of market and investment volatility and value 
at risk is conducted by the board and the portfolio is realigned 
with strategic aims where appropriate. Reviews also consider 
investment concentration, currency and liquidity exposures.
An active year has seen Caledonia reinvest much of the asset 
value taken out of markets in 2015, taking opportunities that 
short term volatility and uncertainty provides to invest in 
strong long term businesses.
Liquidity
Risk that liabilities cannot be met or new investments made due to  
a  lack of liquidity. Such risk can arise from not being able to sell an 
investment due to lack of a market or from not holding cash or being 
able to raise debt.
Detailed cash forecasting for six months ahead is updated 
and reviewed weekly, including the expected drawdown 
of capital commitments.
Loan facilities are maintained to provide appropriate 
liquidity headroom.
The liquidity of the portfolio is reviewed regularly.
We have continued to manage our investment process to 
ensure we minimise the need to access our available facilities.
At 31 March 2016, we had net cash of £22.9m and undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities of £175m, which are in place 
up to April 2018.
Operational
Risks arising from inadequate or failed processes, people and 
systems or from external factors.
Operational risks arise from the recruitment, development and 
retention of staff, systems and procedures and business disruption.
Systems and control procedures are developed and reviewed 
regularly. They are tested, as part of the annual programme  
of controls assurance, to ensure effective operation.
Appropriate remuneration and other policies are in place to 
encourage the retention of key staff. Business continuity plans 
are maintained, using an offsite facility.
A temporary relocation of offices from Cayzer House to 
Stratton House was achieved, with no interruption to 
operations or IT systems.
The board has reviewed and approved our business 
continuity plans during the year.
Regulatory and legal
Risk arising from exposure to litigation or fraud and adherence to 
the tax and regulatory environment. Caledonia operates across 
a number of jurisdictions and in an industry that has been subject 
to increasing regulatory oversight.
Caledonia has internal resources to consider all regulatory 
and tax matters as they arise. Use is made of advisers and the 
Association of Investment Companies, of which Caledonia is 
a member and on whose self-managed investment company 
committee it is represented. Regular training is undertaken.
There have been no significant additional regulatory 
requirements in the year.
Caledonia risk management process
Risks are identified and assessed through a risk dashboard, 
capturing the most significant business risks facing Caledonia and 
documenting the actions required to achieve an acceptable level of 
risk. The business risk dashboard is reported to the board half yearly.
The portfolio investment risk report specifically focuses on the more 
technical areas of investment portfolio risk in relation to Caledonia’s 
investment strategy. This includes such risks as investment volatility, 
value at risk, diversification, liquidity and concentration.

Sustainability
We are committed to building our 
business for the long term. To this end, 
we consider the impact of our business 
on the marketplace, workplace and 
environment.
Marketplace
As an investment company, we are committed to a long term 
investment strategy and to maintaining effective relationships with 
those companies in which we invest. We often hold a board seat in 
our significant investments and use this to maintain a close 
relationship with managements of those companies. Additionally, 
we hold frequent meetings with managements and review internal 
documents, such as management accounts and reports.
We also make considered use of our voting rights. As a consequence 
of our involved investment style, we would expect to vote in line 
with management recommendations, but are prepared to abstain 
or vote against recommendations where we consider they are not in 
the interests of our shareholders.
We continue to meet with our shareholders and listen to any 
concerns they may have.
Workplace
Caledonia has in place a set of polices intended to protect 
employees from unlawful discrimination, offer them a working 
environment where they have a right to be treated fairly, with 
consideration and respect, and support high standards of conduct 
and performance. These policies assist in ensuring that the company 
meets applicable health and safety standards and treats disabled 
employees in accordance with its statutory obligations. These 
policies are communicated to employees by way of a staff handbook 
provided at the time of joining, with periodic updates thereafter.
In addition to a grievance procedure, which allows employees to 
raise concerns either formally or informally, there are formal 
whistleblowing arrangements in place, which enable members of 
staff to raise any issue of concern regarding possible impropriety in 
the conduct of the company’s business, confidentially and 
independently of line management.
A formal performance appraisal process, through which employees 
may be set objectives on an annual basis and their achievement 
against those objectives assessed at the end of the year, is intended 
to ensure that employees have a clear view of their performance 
and the ability to develop their potential within the company 
through additional training where necessary. Together with team 
meetings and company-wide briefings, this provides staff with the 
opportunity to be closely involved in the success of the business.

We are committed to creating an inclusive environment where

Environment
Caledonia’s environmental impact is limited. However, any measures 
taken to reduce this impact demonstrate the company’s 
commitment to improve the environment and can have direct 
benefits through reductions in costs for energy and consumables. 
During the year, Caledonia, and its subsidiaries, completed their 
compliance with the Environment Agency’s Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme, assessing and reporting its energy usage 
and identifying cost-effective energy savings opportunities. This 
has encouraged a number of initiatives throughout our unquoted 
subsidiaries. 
For Caledonia, the bulk of its energy saving will come from the 
refurbishment of Cayzer House, which will replace the systems 
for maintaining the office environment as well as replacing the fabric 
of the building with modern, more energy efficient, materials.
Other measures undertaken include:
• the use of electronic communications to save paper, printing 
consumables and energy
• recycling of office waste, used paper and other consumables.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Caledonia’s carbon footprint has been estimated in line with the 
WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (GHG Protocol) and Defra guidelines.
The sources of greenhouse gas emissions shown in the table below

28 Annual report 2016 Caledonia Investments plc  
Corporate governance report
Caledonia recognises the importance 
of good corporate governance, which 
requires the board to consider the 
processes, controls and limits within 
which the company should operate 
and define a working framework 
that is clear and understandable to 
everyone involved in the management 
of the company.
Statement of compliance
The board recognises the importance of good corporate governance 
and this report describes how the company has complied with The UK 
Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’) issued in September 2014 for the 
duration of the reporting period.
The company has complied throughout the year with all of the provisions 
of the Code, other than provision D.1.1., which requires that schemes for 
performance-related remuneration should include provisions that would 
enable the company to recover sums paid (‘clawback’) or withhold any 
sums (‘malus’) and specify the circumstances in which it would be 
appropriate to do so. As explained in the Directors’ remuneration report, 
malus provisions were introduced into Caledonia’s performance share 
scheme and deferred bonus plan in 2014 and were included in the 
directors’ remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the annual 
general meeting in that year. The provision in the Code requiring malus 
and clawback did not become operative until after the directors’ 
remuneration policy had been approved and the Remuneration 
Committee has been advised that it would be necessary to seek 
shareholder approval of a change in the remuneration policy for clawback 
provisions to be included in the company’s incentive plans. Accordingly, 
the Remuneration Committee has resolved to incorporate clawback 
provisions into Caledonia’s incentive plans as part of the next scheduled 
remuneration policy renewal in 2017 , in line with the GC100 guidance.
A copy of the Code is available on the website of the Financial Reporting 
Council at https://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Publications/Corporate-
Governance/UK-Corporate-Governance-Code-2014.pdf.
The board
Overall responsibility and operation
The board as a whole is collectively responsible for the success of the 
company and for supervising its affairs. It sets the company’s strategy, 
ensures that the necessary financial and human resources are in place 
to enable the company to meet its objectives and reviews management 
performance. It also defines the company’s culture and sets the 
company’s values and standards to ensure that its obligations to its 
shareholders and others are understood and met. It aims to provide 
leadership of the company within a framework of prudent and effective 
controls, which enables risk to be assessed and appropriately managed.
To assist its operation, the board has adopted a Schedule of Authorities 
which sets out those matters which it specifically reserves for its own 
decision and those which are delegated to board committees and to 
executive management. Matters reserved for the board’s own decision 
include the following:
• the appointment and removal of directors of the company, as 
prescribed by the company’s articles of association, and of certain 
senior executive positions
• the terms of reference of board committees and the membership 
thereof
• the company’s strategy
• annual budgets
• the company’s systems of risk management and internal control
• treasury policies, banking counterparties and counterparty exposure 
limits
• directors’ remuneration and terms of appointment 
• significant capital transactions
• charitable donations and political donations.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separated and 
clearly defined in the Schedule of Authorities. The Chairman is primarily 
responsible for the leadership of the board to ensure that it carries out its 
role effectively and for succession planning. The Chief Executive is

responsible for the implementation of the board’s strategy and policies 
and the management of the company’s activities, other than those 
matters specifically reserved to the board. The Schedule of Authorities 
is reviewed annually by the board.
All directors receive detailed papers in advance of board meetings to 
enable them to discharge their duties and also have unlimited access 
to senior management should further information be required. 
Presentations by investment pool managers and other senior executives 
are regularly given to the board, as well as occasionally by senior 
executives of investee companies.
Appointment, induction and training
The company complies with the recommendation of the Code that 
all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual election 
by shareholders.
Following changes in the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules 
introduced in 2014, the election of those directors determined by the 
board to be independent under the Code must be subject to the approval 
of both all shareholders of the company and separately those 
shareholders who are not controlling shareholders, being the Cayzer 
family concert party.
On appointment, new directors are offered induction and training 
considered appropriate by the board, and subsequently as necessary, 
and the annual performance evaluation of the board encompasses the 
identification of any individual training needs of board members so that, 
if necessary, these can be reviewed by the Chairman with the directors 
concerned. The directors receive briefings at board meetings on 
regulatory and other issues relevant to the company and its business 
sector and, in addition, may attend external courses to assist in their 
professional development.
Board composition
The biographies of the directors appear on pages 26 and 27 .
The board currently comprises ten directors. Excluding the Chairman, 
three of the directors are executive and six are non-executive. The board 
considers all of the non-executive directors to be independent, other than 
The Hon C W Cayzer, who was an executive director prior to becoming 
non-executive. In assessing Mr Boël’s independence, the board took 
account of his position as Chief Executive Officer of Sofina SA, whose 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Rebelco SA, has a 5.1% shareholding in 
Caledonia. Mr Boël’s position at Sofina has not given rise to any conflicts 
of interest and his circumstances very much accord with the importance 
that Caledonia attaches to its own executives having board positions at, 
or close contact with, investee companies.
Since August 2015, Mr Bridges has been Group Finance Director of ICAP , 
where Mr Gregson is non-executive Chairman. The board does not 
consider that Mr Bridges’ role has any influence on either his, or 
Mr Gregson’s, ability to exercise independent judgement in relation 
to the affairs of Caledonia, which has no other connection with ICAP . 
Mrs Jemmett-Page was Caledonia’s audit partner at KPMG Audit Plc from 
November 1995 to March 2001. The board does not consider that this 
affects her independence given the length of time that has elapsed since 
this role ended and also the fact that none of the current board members, 
other than The Hon Charles Cayzer, were in post whilst she was audit 
partner.
Board committees
The board has delegated certain specific areas of responsibility to the 
following standing committees – the Nomination Committee, the Audit 
Committee, the Governance Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee. Further details of the work of each of these committees and 
their membership during the year are set out on pages 31 to 49.
The terms of reference of each committee are reviewed annually and 
are available on the company’s website.
Other committees
Various other committees have been established with responsibility for 
specific areas of the company’s activities, other than matters reserved 
to the board as a whole, as follows:
• The Administrative Committee of the board has been established to 
deal with administrative matters of a routine nature requiring board 
approval or matters which are reserved to the board, but for which 
board approval has already been given in principle. The Administrative 
Committee meets when required and comprises any two directors.
• The Executive Committee meets when required and is responsible 
for matters relating to the day to day management of the company’s 
business, other than where delegated to other committees. It is chaired 
by the Chief Executive and other members comprise the Chairman, the 
executive directors, the heads of the pools of capital and the Company 
Secretary.
• The Investment Management Committee meets fortnightly and 
considers matters relating to the company’s investment portfolio and 
monitors the company’s cash requirements and its net asset value per 
share total return performance. The Investment Management 
Committee is chaired by the Chief Executive and other members 
comprise the entire investment team, the Company Secretary and the 
Deputy Company Secretary.
• The Investment Approvals Committee considers and formally approves 
new investments and proposed realisations. This committee meets 
when required, is chaired by the Chief Executive and other members 
comprise the Chairman, the executive directors, the heads of the pools 
of capital and the Company Secretary.
• The Compliance Committee meets weekly to monitor the company’s 
ongoing compliance with the requirements for investment trust status 
and to approve all investment activity from an investment trust 
compliance perspective. It also monitors the potential impact of legal, 
tax and regulatory developments. The Compliance Committee is 
chaired by the Company Secretary and other members comprise the 
Finance Director, the Heads of Tax, Treasury and Finance, the Group 
Financial Controller and the Deputy Company Secretary.
• The Challenge Committee formally reviews valuations of all of the 
company’s investments at each half-year and full-year. It is chaired by 
the Chief Executive and other members comprise the Finance Director, 
the Head of Finance and the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The 
meetings are observed by representatives from KPMG LLP .
Board performance evaluation
The board conducts an annual evaluation of its performance and that 
of its committees and, in accordance with best practice, engages an 
independent third party facilitator to assist in this process every three 
years. For the year ended 31 March 2016, the evaluation of the board 
as a whole and of its committees was undertaken internally, led by the 
Chairman, and was conducted by inviting individual board members to 
complete questionnaires regarding the operation and effectiveness of the 
board and its committees, the responses from which were collated by the 
Company Secretary and discussed at a special session of the board.
The evaluation of the performance of the Chairman was led by the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director and involved individual discussions 
with other members of the board. The Chairman considered the 
performance of the non-executive directors and that of the executive 
directors was reviewed by the Chairman and the non-executive directors, 
with the Chief Executive also present for the discussion on the other 
executive directors.

Corporate governance report continued
The results of the 2016 evaluation process were presented in a report to 
the board. The conclusion was that the board operated in a cohesive and 
constructive manner, with open debate and an appropriate level of 
challenge to management proposals. Actions identified to improve the 
board’s processes and effectiveness included the addition to each board 
agenda of a formal list of outstanding action points carried forward from 
previous meetings to ensure all are appropriately concluded, an explicit 
annual review and, if necessary, restatement of the board’s risk appetite 
and enhanced analysis of risk within each of the investment pools to 
optimise returns. It was also agreed that the board should undertake 
an annual review of business security, including cyber risk.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Each director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a 
situation where he has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest which 
conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the company’s interests. The 
Companies Act 2006 however allows directors of public companies to 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where the articles of association 
contain a provision to this effect. The Companies Act 2006 also allows 
the articles to contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts 
of interest to avoid a breach of duty.
There are safeguards in the company’s articles which apply when the 
directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict 
of interest. First, only independent directors, being those who have no 
interest in the matter being considered, are able to take the relevant 
decision and, second, in taking the decision, the directors must act in 
a way which they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote 
the success of the company. The directors are able to impose time limits 
or conditions when giving authorisations if they think this is appropriate.
The board has adopted procedures to address the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 in relation to directors’ conflicts of interest. Each 
new director on appointment is required to declare any potential conflict 
situations, which may relate to him or her, or his or her connected 
persons. These are reviewed by the board and, if necessary, also by the 
Governance Committee, which then considers whether these situations 
should be authorised and, if so, whether any conditions to such authority 
should be attached.
Each board meeting includes a standing agenda item on conflicts of 
interest to ensure that all directors disclose any new potential conflict 
situations. These are then reviewed, again if necessary also by the 
Governance Committee, and authorised by the board as appropriate. 
A register of directors’ conflicts of interest is maintained by the Company 
Secretary and is reviewed annually by the Governance Committee.
Relations with shareholders
The company welcomes dialogue with investors in order to achieve a 
mutual understanding of objectives. The Chief Executive and the Finance 
Director regularly hold meetings with institutional investors, private client 
stockbrokers and fund managers. The Chairman and other non-executive 
directors are also available to attend some of these meetings, if 
requested. Any views put forward by shareholders are reported back 
to the board, which periodically also receives presentations from the 
company’s brokers on shareholder feedback and the general market 
perception of the company. In addition, the annual general meeting 
provides a forum for shareholders to meet the directors, both formally 
and informally.
The Chairmen of all of the board’s committees will be available to answer 
questions at the annual general meeting.
Relations with controlling shareholders
As at 18 May 2016, being the latest practicable date prior to the 
publication of this annual report, the Cayzer family concert party (‘Cayzer 
Concert Party’) held 48.49% of Caledonia’s voting rights.
Under the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules, where a premium 
listed company has a controlling shareholder or shareholders (being a 
person or persons acting in concert who exercise or control 30% of more 
of the company’s voting rights), the company is required to enter into 
a written and legally binding agreement which is intended to ensure that 
the controlling shareholder undertakes to comply with certain 
independence provisions, namely that:
1.  transactions and arrangements with the controlling shareholder  
(and/or any of its associates) will be conducted at arm’s length and 
on normal commercial terms;
2.  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates will take 
any action that would have the effect of preventing the listed company 
from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules; and
3.  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates will 
propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder resolution which 
is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the proper 
application of the Listing Rules.
The board confirms that agreements specified under the Listing Rules 
as described above (which were required to be in place by 17 November 
2014) were entered into by the company on 30 October 2014 with 
The Cayzer Trust Company Limited (‘Cayzer Trust’) and separately with 
the Trustee of the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust 
(‘Employee Share Trust’), which is deemed by the Panel on Takeovers and 
Mergers to form part of the Cayzer Concert Party. Under the terms of its 
agreement, Cayzer Trust has undertaken to procure the compliance with 
the independence provisions of all of the other members of the Cayzer 
Concert Party, other than the Employee Share Trust.
The board confirms that, during the period under review and up to 
18 May 2016, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication 
of this annual report:
1.  the company has complied with the independence provisions included 
in the agreements with Cayzer Trust and the Employee Share Trust
2.  so far as the company is aware, the independence provisions included 
in the agreements have been complied with by Cayzer Trust and the 
Employee Share Trust
3.  so far as the company is aware, the procurement obligation included 
in the agreement with Cayzer Trust has been complied with by that 
company.

Nomination Committee report
The Nomination Committee is focused 
on evaluating the directors and 
examining the skills and attributes 
needed of board members. It is also 
responsible for identifying suitable 
candidates for new director positions.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for the regular review of 
the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity) of the board and for giving consideration to 
succession planning for directors and, if requested by the board, for other 
senior executives. It is responsible for identifying, using external search 
consultants where necessary, candidates to fill board vacancies as and 
when they arise, for making recommendations to the board in relation 
thereto and for keeping under review the leadership needs of the 
company, both executive and non-executive.
The Nomination Committee also reviews the time required of the 
non-executive directors and ensures that they receive formal letters 
of appointment setting out clearly what is expected of them in terms 
of time commitment, committee service and involvement outside board 
meetings.
Diversity
The board’s policy on diversity is, as it has been in the past, to seek to 
appoint the best qualified person to a particular role regardless of 
gender or other diversity criteria and therefore it has not adopted any 
measureable objectives in relation thereto.
Work of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee met twice during the year and the work 
undertaken included:
• consideration of the contributions and effectiveness of the non-
executive directors seeking election or re-election at the 2015 annual 
general meeting, prior to giving recommendations for their elections 
or re-elections.

Audit Committee report
The Audit Committee plays a 
significant role in ensuring that the 
company’s financial statements are 
properly prepared and that the system 
of controls that is in place is effective 
and appropriate.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the 
financial statements of the company and any announcements relating 
thereto and for reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements 
contained therein. In addition, it oversees the relationship with the 
external auditor, KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’). It also reviews the company’s 
systems of internal control and risk management procedures and 
considers annually whether an internal audit function is required.
The Audit Committee, comprised exclusively of independent non-
executives directors, met three times in the year ended 31 March 2016, 
in May and November 2015 and in March 2016. Subsequent to the year 
end, it met in May 2016 to consider the significant issues in relation to 
the 2016 annual report.
The external auditor, KPMG, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the 
Company Secretary and members of the finance team attend the 
meetings of the Audit Committee. Other board members and/or senior 
executives may also attend meetings at the invitation of the Chairman. At 
the end of each meeting, the Audit Committee has a separate discussion 
with the external auditor without executive management present.
Work of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee undertook the following activities in the discharge 
of its responsibilities.
Financial statements
The main focus of the meetings in May and November 2015 was the 
2015 annual report and financial statements and the 2015 half-year 
results respectively, including evaluation of the going concern statements 
therein.
The March 2016 meeting considered principally the audit planning for 
the 2016 annual report, including in particular the requirements of the 
2014 revision of The UK Corporate Governance Code and other disclosure 
requirements.
In its May 2016 meeting, the Audit Committee reviewed the form and 
content of the 2016 annual report and financial statements. In conducting 
its review, the Audit Committee considered reports prepared by 
management and the external auditor. These reports provided an 
analytical review of the financial statements, comparing the current to 
prior year financial position and results, and detailed the judgements 
and sources of estimation uncertainty involved in applying the accounting 
policies to the financial statements. The Audit Committee also considered 
the going concern statement and the viability statement. The Audit 
Committee recommended the 2016 annual report to the board.
The significant issues the Audit Committee considered in relation to 
the 2016 financial statements were the valuation of unlisted and listed 
investments. In relation to these financial statements, the Audit 
Committee also considered the going concern statement, the viability 
statement and compliance with the annual report ‘fair, balanced and 
understandable’ provisions of the 2014 revision of The UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Unlisted valuations
The Audit Committee recognises that unlisted investments are a 
significant component of the financial statements and that their valuation 
is subject to considerable judgement and uncertainty. The Chairman 
of the Audit Committee attended the Challenge Committee meetings 
(along with the external auditor) and reported to the Audit Committee 
on the quality of the review, adherence to the company’s valuation policy 
and consistency of valuation methodologies over time.

the year was as follows:

33 Annual report 2016 Caledonia Investments plc  
Listed valuations
Listed investments are a significant component of the financial 
statements. The Challenge Committee meetings referred to above also 
considered the listed securities, to ensure that the exchange bid prices 
used in the valuation were from an actively traded market. The Audit 
Committee concurred that it was appropriate to use the exchange bid 
price in all cases.
Going concern and viability
The Audit Committee considered the funding needs of the company 
and its financial capacity, including available bank credit and liquid funds, 
to be wholly sufficient to confirm the going concern of the business.
The Audit Committee also assessed the viability of the company. They 
agreed to provide a viability statement for a period of three years for 
the reasons set out in the statement on page 51. In May 2016, the Audit 
Committee conducted a series of stress tests that considered the impact 
of severe market downturn scenarios on shareholders’ funds, the debt 
facility, investment income and also the potential loss of investment 
trust status. The outcome of this activity led the Audit Committee to 
recommend to the board to make the statement on page 51.
Fair, balanced and understandable statement
The Audit Committee reviewed the draft annual report and, taken as a 
whole, considered it to be fair, balanced and understandable. The Audit 
Committee recommended to the board that the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial 
statements, set out on page 53, should be signed accordingly.
Internal control
In the May and November meetings, a report on the internal control 
reviews performed during the previous six months was presented, 
together with an update on the controls assurance programme given 
at the March 2016 meeting. The Audit Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the internal control environment and the structure in 
place to resolve identified weaknesses. The control reviews included 
review of the US limited partnership investment structure. No significant 
areas of weakness were identified. The Audit Committee agreed the 
control review work plan for 2016.
The board of directors is responsible for the company’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
New subsidiary investments
The Audit Committee recognised the increased regulatory risk associated 
with the investments in the year in Seven Investment Management 
and Gala Bingo, both of which are regulated entities. The company will 
closely monitor the controls in place in these entities.
Internal audit
As the company does not have an internal audit function, the Audit 
Committee considers annually whether there is a need for one. The 
company is an investment trust and manages its non-consolidated 
subsidiaries as other private company investments, expecting them 
to operate their own risk management processes. The company closely 
monitors the control environment of its private company investments. 
The Audit Committee recommended to the board that an internal audit 
function was not required.
Auditor
The Audit Committee last conducted an audit tender process in mid-2011. 
The main outcomes of the process were the replacement of Deloitte 
(who had been the company’s auditor since 2006) with KPMG Audit Plc 
and a plan for the development of the external audit approach. The 
principal planned changes were to increase the depth of the audit by 
reducing the materiality level. At its request and for internal reasons, 
KPMG Audit Plc resigned as the company’s auditor with effect from the 
conclusion of the annual general meeting on 24 July 2013 and was 
replaced by its immediate parent entity, KPMG LLP .
Audit effectiveness
Audit quality is reviewed continuously throughout the year by both 
the Finance Director and Audit Committee. The focus is centred on the 
following:
• the quality and seniority of the auditor’s staff
• the appropriateness of the planned audit methodology as applied 
to Caledonia’s business activity
• the level and challenge and quality of reporting to the Audit Committee.
The effectiveness of the audit is also monitored throughout the year 
using a number of measures, including but not limited to:
• a review and approval of the scope of the planned audit
• the planned implementation of improvements following appropriate 
post audit reviews
• the monitoring of the independence of the external auditor
• a review of any Financial Reporting Council’s Audit Quality Review 
Report for KPMG’s audit of the company
• discussion with the firm’s independent senior partner.
Non-audit work
In order to safeguard the auditor’s independence and objectivity, the 
Audit Committee maintains a schedule of specific non-audit activities 
which may not be undertaken by the external auditor, within the broad 
principles that the external auditor should not audit its own work, should 
not make management decisions on behalf of the company, should not 
be put into the role of advocate for the company and that no mutuality 
of interest should be created between the company and the external 
auditor.
Pre-approval of non-audit fees is required for non-audit fees exceeding 
a pre-determined threshold.
Re-appointment of KPMG as auditor
KPMG Audit Plc was appointed auditor in 2011 and was replaced by 
KPMG LLP in 2013. The lead audit partner is required to rotate every 
five years and other key audit partners every seven years. No contractual 
obligations restrict the Audit Committee’s choice of external auditor. The 
Audit Committee concluded that KPMG provides an effective audit and 
the Audit Committee recommended to the board the re-appointment 
of KPMG LLP .
Resolutions to re-appoint KPMG LLP as auditor and to authorise the 
directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration, will be proposed 
at the annual general meeting on 21 July 2016.
Private meetings
During the year, the Chairman of the Audit Committee met separately 
and privately with the Finance Director and KPMG.

Governance Committee report
The Governance Committee monitors 
and reviews the ability of each director 
to act in the interests of shareholders 
as a whole and to exercise 
independence of judgement.
The Governance Committee keeps under review corporate governance 
issues relating to the company and is responsible for the monitoring and 
review of the ability of each director to act in the interests of shareholders 
as a whole and to exercise independence of judgement free from 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to, or could appear to, 
affect his or her judgement. The Governance Committee also reviews 
conflict or potential conflict situations relating to directors, which may 
require the prior authorisation of the board under the Companies Act 2006, 
and makes recommendations to the board as to whether such conflict or 
potential conflict situations should be authorised and, if so, whether any 
conditions, such as duration or scope of the authority, should be attached. 
The Governance Committee reviews annually all authorisations previously 
granted by the board to ensure that they remain appropriate. If the 
Governance Committee believes that a director may be subject to 
a conflict of interest which may prejudice his or her ability to exercise 
independence of judgement, it may make such recommendations to 
the board as it may think fit, including that the director abstains from 
participating in any decision of the board or any of its committees on 
the matter concerned.
Work of the Governance Committee
The Governance Committee met three times during the year and the 
principal matters it considered were: 
• the review and approval of the Corporate governance report for 
the year ended 31 March 2015
• the review of potential conflict situations notified by directors in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the making of 
recommendations to the board in relation thereto
• consideration of the influence of the Cayzer family concert party 
(‘Cayzer Concert Party’) on Caledonia’s board and whether it was in 
the general interest of the non-Cayzer Concert Party shareholders, 
with the conclusion that it was
• the review and approval, on behalf of the board, of the statements of 
compliance with the independence provisions of Listing Rules relating 
to premium listed companies with controlling shareholders.

executives of the calibre needed

successfully.
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to introduce Caledonia’s Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2016.
The report reproduces the principal elements of the remuneration policy 
which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 annual general meeting 
and which provides the current framework within which we incentivise 
and reward our senior executive team and pay fees to our non-executive 
board members. No changes to this policy are proposed at this year’s 
annual general meeting, although the policy is due for renewal in 2017 
and therefore one of the key tasks for the Remuneration Committee for 
the year ahead will be to review Caledonia’s current remuneration policies 
and practices to ensure that they remain fully aligned with the company’s 
strategy and that they reinforce and contribute to our overall objective 
of creating sustained value for shareholders over the long term.
In this introductory statement, I have set out a summary of the 
implementation of the remuneration policy in respect of the year ended 
31 March 2016 and how we intend to approach remuneration for the 
2017 financial year. Detailed disclosure and explanations of the 
remuneration paid to directors in the year ended 31 March 2016 are 
included in the Annual report on directors’ remuneration, which will 
be put to an advisory vote of shareholders at the annual general meeting 
on 21 July 2016.
Remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2016
Against a background of volatile markets in which the FTSE All-Share Total 
Return index (‘FTSE index’) fell by 3.9%, Caledonia’s net asset value per 
share total return (‘NAVTR’) was 2.6%, slightly below the minimum 3% 
threshold set by the Remuneration Committee for bonus purposes. 
Accordingly, none of the executive directors received any bonus on the 
basis of the company’s performance. The Funds pool, led by Jamie 
Cayzer-Colvin, achieved a total return of 5.9%, but again this was below 
the minimum threshold of 6% set for this pool and therefore he received 
no bonus for pool performance. The Funds pool has however continued 
to make significant progress in identifying, and gaining access to, high 
quality funds in Asia and the US and in building a pipeline of potential 
future fund commitments. The Remuneration Committee therefore felt 
it appropriate to award Mr Cayzer-Colvin a bonus of 48.25% of basic 
salary in relation to his pool and personal objectives. The Remuneration 
Committee also determined to award Will Wyatt and Stephen King 45% 
of basic salary in respect of the achievement of individual objectives 
set for them at the beginning of the year.
The year to 31 March 2016 also represented the end of the three year 
performance measurement period for all of the matching share awards 
granted in 2013 under the company’s deferred bonus plan and half of 
the awards granted in that year under its performance share scheme. 
For the deferred bonus plan matching awards, the performance targets 
were that, for two-thirds of the shares comprised in an award, Caledonia’s 
NAVTR had to outperform the FTSE index and, for the other third, the 
FTSE Actuaries UK Index-linked Gilts (all-stocks) Total Return index (‘Gilts 
index’) over the three year measurement period, in each case with shares 
vesting on a graduated basis between 0.5% and 3.5% outperformance. 
Both of these targets were comfortably met, with Caledonia’s NAVTR 
outperforming the FTSE index by 24.5% and the Gilts index by 14.9% over 
the three year period, and accordingly these awards have vested in full.
For the awards granted under the performance share scheme, half were 
to be measured against the Gilts index over three years and half against 
the FTSE index over five years, with the same graduated vesting scale 
applying as described for the deferred bonus plan matching awards 
above. The half of the awards measured against the Gilts index have 
accordingly vested in full and those to be measured against the FTSE 
index will be tested in two years’ time.

Remuneration for the year ending 31 March 2017
Looking ahead to the 2017 financial year, basic salaries of executive 
directors, other than Mr Wyatt, have been increased with effect from 
1 April 2016 by 1.0%, broadly in line with inflation, which was the same as 
the standard increase given to all of the company’s staff. Mr Wyatt’s basic 
salary has not been increased and therefore remains the same as in 2015. 
The Chairman’s and the non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed on 
a triennial basis and, since these were last increased in April 2014, they 
have not been changed. 
We plan to make performance share scheme and deferred bonus plan 
awards following the release of our 2016 full year results announcement 
in line with our normal grant cycle. These will be subject to the same 
performance measures used for the 2015 award grants, which are 
summarised in the remuneration policy table on pages 39 and 40.
Malus and clawback
In 2014, provisions were introduced into Caledonia’s performance 
share scheme and deferred bonus plan which give the Remuneration 
Committee the right to cancel or reduce unvested awards in the 
event of a material misstatement of the company’s financial results, 
a miscalculation of a participant’s entitlement, misconduct on the part 
of the participant or an event resulting in material loss or reputational 
damage to the company or a member of the group. These are known 
as ‘malus’ provisions.
In September 2014, a revised UK Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’) 
was issued, which included a provision that all performance related 
incentive schemes for executive directors operated by UK listed 
companies should include not only malus provisions, but also 
arrangements to recover amounts of variable remuneration after it has 
been paid (known as ‘clawback’). The Code is not specific as to the period 
of time over which clawback should operate, nor the circumstances in 
which it should be applied, and the Remuneration Committee has been 
advised that, since only malus provisions were included in the current 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 2014, it would be 
necessary to seek formal shareholder approval to amend the policy 
should clawback provisions be introduced. As a consequence, the 
Remuneration Committee decided last year to see how market practice in 
relation to clawback developed before making a decision as to whether to 
introduce it to Caledonia’s performance related incentive schemes.
Twelve months on, it is clear that increasingly listed companies are 
adopting, or committing to adopt, both malus and clawback provisions 
and accordingly our Remuneration Committee has resolved to introduce 
clawback into Caledonia’s performance related incentive schemes. 
However, in view of the need for shareholders’ approval, it proposes to 
do so as part of the next scheduled remuneration policy renewal in 2017 , 
in line with the GC100 guidance.

Remuneration policy
Remuneration structure
Executive directors
The table below sets out Caledonia’s policy in relation to each component of executive director remuneration, with further explanations in the notes 
that follow.
Salary (fixed pay)
Purpose and link to strategic objectives To support the recruitment and retention of executive directors of the calibre required to manage and 
grow the company successfully.
Operation Reviewed annually.
The basic salaries of the executive directors on implementation of the policy were as follows:
W P Wyatt  £506,480 J M B Cayzer-Colvin  £303,890 
S A King  £359,380
The current salaries of the executive directors are set out in the Annual report on directors’ remuneration.
Opportunity and recovery or  
withholding provisions
Salary increases are normally awarded by reference to any increase in the cost of living, but may take into 
account other factors such as external market positioning, change in the scope of the individual’s responsibilities 
or level of experience, development in the role and levels of pay elsewhere in the company.
Other than in exceptional circumstances or where there is a change in role or responsibilities, year on year 
increases in basic salaries will not exceed inflation by more than 5%.
No recovery or withholding provisions.
Performance measurement framework Not applicable.
Benefits (fixed pay)
Purpose and link to strategic objectives To provide a range of benefits alongside basic salary to recruit and retain high calibre executive directors.
Operation Executive directors are provided with family private medical insurance cover, death-in-service insurance, and 
permanent health insurance and, in the case of Mr Wyatt and Mr Cayzer-Colvin, a cash allowance in lieu of 
a company car. They are also entitled to receive minor benefits that are available to other Caledonia staff.
The executive directors are also covered by the company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy 
and have the benefit of an indemnity under the company’s articles of association.
Where there is a valid business reason for doing so, the company may pay for the cost of spouses accompanying 
directors on business trips and reimburse directors for hotel accommodation and travel expenses (including 
payment of any tax thereon). Executive directors are also eligible to receive other minor benefits and expenses 
payments (again including payment of any tax thereon).
Opportunity and recovery or  
withholding provisions
A taxable benefits package that is competitive with the marketplace. 
The value of taxable benefits provided, other than ad hoc items incurred in connection with Caledonia’s business 
that may be deemed taxable benefits such as travel and other expenses, will not in aggregate exceed 10% of 
basic salary.
No recovery or withholding provisions.
Performance measurement framework Not applicable.
Introduction
Set out below are the material elements of the directors’ remuneration 
policy which was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting 
of the company held on 17 July 2014. The policy came into effect on that 
date and is next due to be put for approval by shareholders in 2017 , unless 
the Remuneration Committee wishes to implement any changes earlier.
There have been no changes to the policy since its implementation and 
the extracts shown below are for information only and to provide context 
for the 2016 annual report on directors’ remuneration which follows. The 
performance conditions for the deferred bonus plan and the performance 
share scheme described in the policy table and the notes thereto have 
been updated to reflect the new performance measures adopted by 
the Remuneration Committee since the original policy was approved. 
References to share awards held by executive directors at the date of 
approval of the policy which have since been exercised have been 
removed and it has also been noted where share awards have met their 
performance targets since implementation of the policy.
The full directors’ remuneration policy is contained on pages 38 to 44 
of the company’s annual report 2014, which is available in the ‘Literature’ 
section of Caledonia’s website at www.caledonia.com. 
Objectives
The key objectives of the Remuneration Committee in setting the 
company’s remuneration policy are as follows:
• remuneration of executive directors should be linked to the company’s 
long term performance and its business strategy
• performance related remuneration should seek to align the interests 
of executive directors with those of the shareholders
• a significant proportion of executive directors’ remuneration should 
be linked to the performance of the company and only receivable if 
demanding performance targets are achieved
• remuneration packages for executive directors should be competitive, 
but not excessive, in terms of market practice in order to attract, retain 
and motivate executive directors of the quality needed to manage 
and grow the company successfully.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy
Short term incentives (variable pay)
Purpose and link to strategic objectives To reward performance on an annual basis against key financial, operational and individual objectives. 
Operation Discretionary annual bonus scheme and deferred bonus plan under which a proportion of bonus may be 
compulsorily or voluntarily deferred into shares.
Bonus is not pensionable.
Opportunity and recovery or  
withholding provisions
The maximum potential bonus is 100% of basic salary. Any bonus over 50% of basic salary is compulsorily 
deferred into shares and up to half of any remaining cash bonus may be voluntarily deferred, each for a period 
of three years. Shares derived from compulsory or voluntary deferral of bonus are matched on a one for one 
basis, subject to performance conditions (as described under long term incentives below).
All bonus payments are subject to the overriding discretion of the Remuneration Committee, which also retains 
discretion to amend the proportions of bonus subject to compulsory or voluntary deferral or not to require 
or offer any deferral.
In order to be entitled to an annual bonus, an executive director must normally be in the group’s employment 
and not under notice of termination (either given or received) at the time the bonus is paid.
The Remuneration Committee has the right to cancel or reduce any bonus compulsorily or voluntarily deferred 
into shares which have not yet vested in the circumstances described under long term incentives below.
Performance measurement framework By reference to a combination of company performance against external benchmarks and individual 
performance against personal objectives. Executive directors with responsibility for pools of capital will have 
a proportion of bonus determined by reference to pool performance and objectives.
Long term incentives (variable pay)
Purpose and link to strategic objectives To motivate executive directors to deliver long term shareholder value, thereby aligning the interests of 
management with those of shareholders.
To encourage long term retention of key executives.
Operation Caledonia operates a performance share scheme under which participants are awarded nil-cost options over  
the  company’s shares.
The performance share scheme replaced an executive share option scheme under which market value options 
were awarded to senior executives. The last awards under the executive share option scheme were made in 
2010, although Mr Wyatt and Mr Cayzer-Colvin retain options under this scheme which have yet to be exercised. 
Under the company’s deferred bonus plan, matching share awards are granted in respect of compulsory and 
voluntary deferral of pre-tax bonus. The current deferred bonus plan replaced an earlier plan introduced in 2005 
under which there are no matching share awards still outstanding.
Opportunity and recovery or  
withholding provisions
The maximum value of nil-cost options that may be granted in any year under the performance share scheme 
rules is 200% of basic salary, although the company’s policy is to grant annual awards of no more than 125% 
of basic salary.
Matching shares are granted on a one for one basis for shares derived from bonus deferral.
On exercise of nil-cost options or calling of matching share awards, participants will also receive an amount 
equivalent to the dividends and any associated tax credits that would have accrued on the shares during the 
relevant performance measurement period.
The Remuneration Committee has the right, in respect of awards granted after 1 April 2014, to cancel or reduce 
long term incentive awards which have not yet vested, in the event of a material misstatement of the company’s 
financial results, miscalculation of a participant’s entitlement, individual misconduct or an event resulting in 
material loss or reputational damage to the company or any member of the group.
In the event of a change of control before the expiry of the performance measurement period of a long term 
incentive award, the vesting level of the award will be determined by the Remuneration Committee based on  
the extent to which the performance targets have been achieved and vested shares will then be scaled down to 
reflect the shortened measurement period. The Remuneration Committee may modify such vesting levels if it 
considers that the performance target would be met to a greater or lesser degree at the testing date and/or if the 
application of time pro rating would be inappropriate in the circumstances.
Performance measurement framework For Mr Wyatt and Mr King, nil-cost options awarded under the 2011 performance share scheme are subject to  
the performance, on an absolute basis, of the company’s diluted net asset value per share on a total return basis 
(‘NAVTR’) measured on an annualised basis over three or five years. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, the nil-cost options are 
subject to a combination of the performance of the company’s NAVTR as above and the total returns achieved  
by the Funds pool, for which he is responsible, again measured on an annualised basis over three or five years.
Matching share awards granted under the deferred bonus plan are subject to the performance, on an absolute 
basis, of the company’s NAVTR, measured on an annualised basis over three years.
The rules of each scheme provide discretion to the Remuneration Committee to amend the performance targets 
or impose different performance targets. 
The performance targets for all outstanding options granted under the company’s executive share option 
scheme have been met.

Pension related benefits (fixed pay)
Purpose and link to strategic objectives To provide a means of retirement saving as part of a range of benefits alongside basic salary to recruit and retain 
high calibre executive directors.
Operation Executive directors are offered defined contribution funding, based on a percentage of salary, to a personal 
pension scheme or a cash salary supplement (or a combination of both) at their choice.
Opportunity and recovery or  
withholding provisions
The percentage of basic salary for the Chief Executive is 22.5% and for other executive directors 17 .5%. If a 
director chooses to take a cash supplement in lieu of some or all of his or her pension entitlement, the payment is 
reduced by such amount as is necessary to make the cash supplement cost neutral for the company after taking 
into account National Insurance contributions.
The Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to increase the percentage of salary relating to pension 
benefits from time to time in line with market conditions, up to a maximum of 30% of basic salary.
No recovery or withholding provisions.
Performance measurement framework Not applicable.
Performance measures and targets 
Annual bonus 
For the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, a maximum of 50% of 
bonus is determined by reference to company performance and 50% by 
reference to individual performance objectives. For executive directors 
responsible for a specific pool of capital, 25% of bonus is determined by 
reference to the company’s performance, 25% to pool performance, 35% 
to pool objectives and 15% to individual performance objectives. In all 
cases, the company performance element is determined by reference to 
the relative performance of the company’s NAVTR against RPI. For bonus 
awards for the 2016 and subsequent financial years, RPI will be taken as 
the higher of actual RPI over the bonus year or 3%, being broadly in line 
with its historic long term average. Bonus payments for this element 
commence with a 10% pay-out if NAVTR matches RPI, increasing 
incrementally to the maximum entitlement payable if outperformance of 
7% or more is achieved. Pool performance is judged by the Remuneration 
Committee by reference to the return achieved by the pool against a set 
target return and by objectives such as deal flow and delivery of portfolio 
strategy. Individual performance is assessed by reference to personal 
objectives set at the start of the year, including non-financial measures 
such as risk management, marketing of the company, team leadership, 
management skills and promotion of Caledonia’s corporate culture and 
image both internally and externally.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to amend or adopt 
alternative annual bonus targets in order to achieve better alignment 
with the company’s strategic objectives.
Compulsory and voluntary deferral of bonus 
 Shares comprised in a compulsory deferral will normally only vest if the 
director remains an employee of the Caledonia group for a three year 
period commencing on the first day of the financial year in which the 
award is made.
Shares comprised in a voluntary deferral are not subject to any conditions 
and will normally vest at the earlier of three years from the first day of 
the financial year in which the award is made or the date that the director 
ceases to be an employee of the Caledonia group for any reason.
Long term incentive plans 
Performance share scheme 
 For nil-cost options granted prior to the 2014 financial year under the 
performance share scheme, one-third of the shares comprised in an 
award were subject to a performance condition which compared the 
performance of Caledonia’s NAVTR against the FTSE Actuaries UK 
Index-linked Gilts (all stocks) Total Return index (‘Gilts index’) over three 
years. For the other two-thirds, NAVTR was measured against the FTSE 
All-Share Total Return index (‘FTSE index’), also over three years. Awards 
vested on a graduated basis, with 10% vesting on 0.5% outperformance of 
the relevant benchmark, rising on a straight line basis to maximum vesting 
on 3.5% outperformance. There was no re-testing of either performance 
target and, to the extent a performance target was not met, the relevant 
award would lapse. For the purpose of calculating the performance 
measures, averages of the company’s NAVTR and the two benchmark 
indices over the three months prior to the start and end of the 
performance period were used to reduce volatility. To the extent that the 
performance targets were met, awards may be exercised between the 
date of vesting and the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, except that 
only two-thirds of the shares that have vested may normally be exercised 
after three years, with the remaining one-third normally becoming 
exercisable after five years. The nil-cost options granted in the 2013 
financial year were tested by reference to Caledonia’s NAVTR over the 
three years to 31 March 2015. Maximum vesting was achieved against 
both benchmark indices.
For nil-cost options granted in the 2014 financial year, the performance 
criteria were as above, except that one-half of the shares comprised in 
an award would be measured against the Gilts index over three years and 
the other half against the FTSE index over five years, with shares that vest 
in each case becoming exercisable immediately. Those shares measured 
against the Gilts index were tested by reference to Caledonia’s NAVTR 
performance for the three years to 31 March 2016 and achieved 
maximum vesting.
For nil-cost options granted to Mr Wyatt and Mr King in the 2015 financial 
year and subsequently, awards will vest on a graduated basis, with vesting 
commencing at 10% on the achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 3%, 
rising incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised 
NAVTR of 10%, measured over three and five years. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, 
who is head of the Funds pool, 60% of his performance share scheme 
awards will be measured against the annualised total returns achieved 
by the Funds pool, measured over three and five years. Awards will 
similarly vest on a graduated basis, with vesting commencing at 10% 
on achievement of an annualised Funds pool total return of 6%, rising 
incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised total 
return of 13.5%. The remaining 40% of Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s performance 
share scheme awards will be measured against Caledonia’s NAVTR 
as above.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy
For nil-cost options granted in the 2015 financial year, one-half of the 
shares comprised in the awards will be measured over three years and 
one-half over five years. For subsequent financial years, one-third will be 
measured over three years and two-thirds over five years. In all cases, 
shares that vest will become immediately exercisable and will lapse 
if not exercised within ten years of grant.
Deferred bonus plan matching awards 
 The performance targets for matching shares awarded under the 
deferred bonus plan in the 2015 and prior financial years were the 
same as those described above for the nil-cost options granted under 
the performance share scheme prior to the 2014 financial year, except 
that shares that vest can be called immediately following the end of 
the measurement period and will lapse if not called within twelve 
months thereafter.
Matching awards granted in the 2016 and subsequent financial years are 
subject to performance measurement by reference to Caledonia’s NAVTR 
on an annualised basis over three years, with vesting commencing at 20% 
on achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 4%, rising incrementally to 
100% vesting on achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 10%. Again, 
shares that vest can be called immediately following the end of the 
performance measurement period and will lapse if not called within 
twelve months thereafter.
Rationale for choice of performance measures for the short  
and long term incentive plans 
The Remuneration Committee has chosen NAVTR as the basis of 
performance measurement for the company for both its short term 
and long term incentive arrangements as it regards this as the best 
indicator of the success or failure of management decisions in terms 
of creating value for the company.
For the company performance element of the annual bonus scheme, the 
board has taken the view that benchmarking against a stock market index 
or indices over a short period is not relevant given Caledonia’s long term 
investment horizon and the nature of its portfolio. The Remuneration 
Committee has therefore instead chosen RPI as the comparator, as on 
this basis executives will only be rewarded to the extent that they are 
able to deliver positive real returns for shareholders. The Remuneration 
Committee will review the rate of increase in RPI at the start of each 
financial year and may adjust the level of outperformance required for the 
incremental and maximum bonus payments in order to ensure that they 
remain a fair measure of performance.
For awards under the performance share scheme and matching shares 
under the deferred bonus plan, the Remuneration Committee has chosen 
Caledonia’s NAVTR on an annualised basis as the performance 
measurement, as it believes that this is the most effective method of 
aligning directors’ rewards with the long term strategic objective of the 
company of delivering annualised returns over rolling ten year periods 
of between RPI+3% and RPI+6%. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, the Remuneration 
Committee believes that a significant proportion of his variable pay 
should be weighted towards the annualised total return performance 
of the Funds pool of capital for which he is responsible and has therefore 
determined that 60% of his performance share scheme awards should 
be tested by reference to this.
The targets for each component of the long term incentive plans have 
been set by the Remuneration Committee with the aim of delivering 
increasing reward for greater outperformance. The Remuneration 
Committee keeps these measures and the levels at which incremental 
and maximum entitlements are earned under review in order to ensure 
that they remain sufficiently challenging and aligned with the company’s 
strategy and key performance indicators.
New components introduced into the new remuneration policy 
There are no new components included in the above policy table which 
were not a part of the remuneration framework previously operated 
for executive directors by the company.
Changes to components included in the previous remuneration policy 
 The only changes to the remuneration policy operated for the year to 
31 March 2013 were the adoption of RPI as the measure of the company 
performance element of the annual bonus scheme, the phased adoption 
of a five year performance measurement period for a significant 
proportion of awards under the company’s performance share scheme 
and the introduction of malus provisions for long term incentive awards 
and bonus deferral.
Since its approval by shareholders at the 2014 annual general meeting, 
there have been no changes to the policy, although new performance 
measurement conditions for the performance share scheme and the 
deferred bonus plan matching shares have been adopted within the  
terms of the policy, as described above.
How the remuneration policy for executive directors relates 
to remuneration of Caledonia group employees generally 
Caledonia’s executive directors’ remuneration packages tend to be higher 
than those of other group employees, but also include a higher proportion 
of variable pay.

Chairman and non-executive directors
The table below sets out each component of the Chairman’s and the non-executive directors’ remuneration and the approach taken by the company 
in relation thereto. 
Component Approach
Chairman’s and  
non-executive  
directors’ fees
The Chairman’s fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee and the non-executive directors’ fees are set by the board. 
These are reviewed periodically taking into account the responsibilities and time commitments required and non-executive 
director fee levels generally.
The Chairman receives an annual fee, which includes his basic non-executive director’s fee, but does not receive any other 
remuneration.
Non-executive directors receive basic fees, which are subject to an annual limit for non-executive directors’ ordinary 
remuneration contained in the articles of association, currently £350,000. In addition, special fees are paid for the chairmanship 
and membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and also for the role of Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and chairman of the Governance Committee.
The fees of the Chairman and the non-executive directors on implementation of the policy were as follows:

Audit Committee chairman  £5,600  Audit Committee member  £2,300
Remuneration Committee chairman £4,900  Remuneration Committee member £1,600
Senior Independent Director/
Governance Committee chairman £5,100
The current fees paid to the Chairman and non-executive directors are set out in the Annual report on directors’ remuneration, 
but are unchanged from the above.
Additional fees payable 
for services to other 
group companies
Exceptionally, non-executive directors may receive fees from companies for services provided to them. The Hon C W Cayzer 
receives such a fee, currently £60,000, for his chairmanship of The Sloane Club, a position which he held as an executive director 
of Caledonia prior to becoming non-executive.
Fees for services provided to subsidiary companies are set and reviewed by the boards of those companies, but will not exceed 
£100,000 per annum in aggregate for any non-executive director.
Other benefits The Chairman and the non-executive directors are all covered under the company’s directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
policy and have the benefit of an indemnity under the company’s articles of association. The Chairman is also provided with an 
office and some secretarial support.
The company may, where appropriate, pay for the cost of spouses accompanying non-executive directors on trips where there 
is a business reason for doing so and reimburse non-executive directors for hotel accommodation and travel expenses (in each 
case including payment of any tax thereon).
Remuneration policy for new appointments
Executive directors
In the case of the appointment of a new executive director, the 
Remuneration Committee would typically seek to align the remuneration 
package with the above remuneration policy. The Remuneration 
Committee however retains the discretion to make special remuneration 
commitments on the appointment of a new executive director, including 
the use of awards made under Rule 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules, if such were 
absolutely necessary to ensure the recruitment of an exceptional 
candidate. In doing so, the Remuneration Committee would take into 
consideration all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, overall 
quantum, type of remuneration offered and comparability with the 
packages of other Caledonia senior executives and the total variable pay 
would not exceed the maxima stated in the policy table for executive 
director remuneration above.
The Remuneration Committee may in addition make bonus commitments 
or share awards on the appointment of an external candidate to 
compensate for remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a 
previous employer, taking into account factors such as any performance 
conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were 
granted, for example cash or shares, and the time over which they 
would have vested. The aim would be to ensure that replacement 
awards would be made on no greater than a comparable basis.
In order to attract and retain suitable executives, the Remuneration 
Committee retains discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to offer 
service contracts with up to an initial 24 month notice period, which then 
reduces to 12 months at the end of this initial period. If it considers it 
appropriate, the Remuneration Committee may also offer a lower salary 
initially, but with a series of increases to achieve the desired salary 
positioning over a period of time, as the individual develops into the role.
If a new appointment is the result of an internal promotion, the 
Remuneration Committee would expect to honour any pre-existing 
contractual arrangements or benefits package agreed with the relevant 
individual. In the event that a new director resides overseas, the 
Remuneration Committee may agree a reasonable relocation package 
and tax equalisation arrangements.
In recruiting any new executive director, the Remuneration Committee 
would apply the overall policy objective that executive directors’ 
remuneration should be competitive, but not excessive. In the event 
that the Remuneration Committee agreed that it was necessary for 
special commitments or sign-on arrangements to be offered to secure 
the recruitment of a new executive director, an explanation of why 
these were required and details thereof would be announced at the 
time of appointment.
Chairman and non-executive directors
Terms for the appointment of any new Chairman or non-executive 
director would also be determined by the Remuneration Committee 
or the board within the above remuneration policy.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy
Legacy arrangements
The policy is essentially forward looking in nature. In view of the long term 
nature of the company’s remuneration structures – including obligations 
under service contracts, pension arrangements and incentive schemes – 
a substantial number of pre-existing obligations will remain outstanding 
at the time that the new policy is approved, including obligations that 
are ‘grandfathered’ by virtue of being in force at 27 June 2012. It is the 
company’s policy to honour in full any pre-existing obligations that have 
been entered into prior to the effective date of this policy.
Executive directors’ service contracts and the Chairman’s 
and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment 
Executive directors
Executive directors have service contracts with Caledonia Group Services 
Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, details of which are 
summarised below:
Date of contract
Notice period  
for the company 
and the director
Unexpired
term
W P Wyatt 2 June 2005 12 months 12 months
S A King 19 November 2009 12 months 12 months
J M B Cayzer-Colvin 19 April 2005 12 months 12 months
If notice is served by either party, the director can continue to receive 
basic salary, benefits and pension payments for the duration of the notice 
period, during which time the company may require the individual to 
continue to fulfil his current duties or may assign a period of gardening 
leave. Alternatively, the company may, in its discretion, terminate the 
contract without notice and make a lump sum payment in lieu of notice. 
This lump sum would include an amount equivalent to the basic salary 
and benefits (based on a fixed percentage of salary specified in the 
service contract) for the unexpired period of notice to which the payment 
relates. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s service contracts provide that 
an amount equivalent to 80% of the average of the annual bonuses 
paid for the previous three financial years would also be included in the 
payment in lieu of notice. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s service 
contracts also include provisions whereby a liquidated sum is payable 
in the event of termination within one year following a change of control. 
The payment would be calculated on the same basis as a payment in 
lieu of notice, except that an amount equivalent to 100% of the average 
of the annual bonuses paid for the previous three financial years would 
be included.
Mr King’s service contract contains provisions whereby, as an alternative 
to the payment of a lump sum in lieu of notice, the company may elect 
to pay the equivalent amount in equal monthly instalments, such 
instalments to be reduced by 50% of one-twelfth of the basic salary in 
excess of £20,000 per annum that Mr King receives from any alternative 
employment that he takes up during the notice period.
Executive directors’ service contracts may be terminated without notice 
and without any further payment (other than in respect of amounts 
due at the date of termination) on the occurrence of certain events such 
as gross misconduct.
Chairman and non-executive directors
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not have service 
contracts, but are appointed under letters of appointment, which provide 
for termination without notice or compensation.
Inspection
Executive directors’ service contracts and the Chairman’s and non-
executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection 
at the registered office of the company.
Policy on external non-executive directorships held 
by executive directors
It is the company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold non-
executive directorships unrelated to the company’s business to broaden 
their commercial experience, provided that the time required is not 
material. Normally the company will retain any fees arising from such 
non-executive directorships, but may permit the executive director 
to retain fees on a case by case basis.
Details of any fees from external non-executive directorships 
retained by executive directors are disclosed in the Annual report 
on directors’ remuneration.
Policy on payments for loss of office
Executive directors
It is the policy of the company that, other than in exceptional 
circumstances on recruitment as stated above, no executive director 
should be offered a service contract that requires more than one year’s 
notice of termination or which contains provision for predetermined 
compensation in excess of one year’s total emoluments. In the event 
of a termination, the Remuneration Committee will consider a director’s 
past performance and the circumstances of the departure in exercising 
any discretions relating to the arrangements for loss of office, including 
contractual obligations, prevailing best practice, the reason for the 
departure and any transition or handover required.
The termination provisions in executive directors’ current service 
contracts are described above in the section on executive directors’ 
service contracts. It is the Remuneration Committee’s intention that all 
future executive directors’ service contracts should include provisions 
enabling the company to reduce compensation payments in the event 
that the director takes up alternative employment within the notice 
period. However, if a new director is appointed internally, the 
Remuneration Committee would expect to honour any existing 
contractual arrangements agreed with the relevant individual before 
he or she becomes a director.
In applying the company’s right to make a lump sum payment in lieu of 
notice, the Remuneration Committee would normally expect to pro rate 
the lump sum for the unexpired period of notice to which the payment 
relates. In appropriate circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may 
make a payment in respect of the full twelve months’ notice period, even 
if the director works under notice for part of it.
The company’s annual bonus scheme provides that an employee must 
be in the group’s employment and not under notice of termination 
(either given or received) in order to be entitled to receive a bonus for 
the relevant financial year. The Remuneration Committee would expect 
to apply this principle to executive director terminations, but retains 
discretion to make bonus payments on termination if it believes it 
appropriate to do so. 
Executive directors would also be entitled under their service contracts to 
be paid on termination for any accrued, but untaken, holiday entitlement. 
The Remuneration Committee may, where it considers it appropriate in 
the circumstances, make payments for loss of statutory rights or waiver 
thereof and a contribution towards legal and outplacement fees. The 
Remuneration Committee may also make a payment to ensure that any 
restrictive covenants remain enforceable.

43 Annual report 2016 Caledonia Investments plc  
Where the director holds unvested awards under the company’s long 
term incentive schemes, the Remuneration Committee would exercise 
its discretions as to vesting in accordance with the relevant scheme 
rules. In good leaver circumstances, for example where cessation of 
employment is by reason of death, retirement, injury, disability, ill-health, 
redundancy, or such other reason as the Remuneration Committee may 
decide, the Remuneration Committee will normally determine the level of 
vesting based on the attainment of the performance targets, either at the 
time of cessation or at the normal test date if permitted by the scheme 
rules, but in the case of the former may decrease or increase the level of 
vesting if the Remuneration Committee considers that the targets would 
have been met to a lesser or greater extent at the end of the performance 
period. The number of shares that vest will normally be reduced to 
reflect the proportion of the performance period that the director was 
in employment, although the Remuneration Committee has discretion 
not to scale down the number of shares if it believes it appropriate in 
the circumstances.
Following termination, the Remuneration Committee may agree to pay 
a director consultancy fees and continue insurance related benefits 
until the end of the policy period. The company’s directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance policy also provides for a six year period of run-off cover 
for former directors. In limited circumstances, the company may permit 
a director to remain in employment after ceasing to be a director for 
a limited period to allow time for an effective handover or for a successor 
to be appointed.
Chairman and non-executive directors
The Chairman and the non-executive directors have no entitlement 
to any compensation on termination of their appointments, although 
they would have the benefit of run-off cover under the directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance policy as described above.

1. Taxable benefits
  Taxable benefits comprised private medical insurance cover and a small Christmas 
supplement paid to all Caledonia staff. Mr Wyatt’s and Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s taxable 
benefits also included a cash allowance of £15,024 in lieu of a company car.
  In addition to taxable benefits, other non-taxable benefits were provided to 
executive directors, including death-in-service insurance (4x basic salary), 
permanent health insurance, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and certain 
other benefits of minor value provided to all of Caledonia’s staff.
2. Short term incentives
  In accordance with the rules of the company’s deferred bonus plan, the following 
amounts included in the total of short term incentives were compulsorily deferred, 
satisfied by share awards made shortly after the announcement of the company’s 
final results for the relevant year:

S A King – 164 164 179 180 359
J M B Cayzer-Colvin – 148 148 152 152 304
 
  For Mr Wyatt and Mr King, a maximum of 50% of bonus was determined by 
reference to company performance and 50% by reference to individual 
performance objectives. For Mr Cayzer-Colvin, who has specific responsibility for 
the Funds pool of capital, 25% of his bonus was determined by reference to the 
company’s performance, 25% to his pool’s performance, 35% to his pool’s 
objectives and 15% to individual performance objectives. For the 2016 financial 
year, the company performance element was determined by reference to the 
relative performance of the company’s NAV per share on a total return basis 
(‘NAVTR’) against the Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’), which for bonus purposes was 
taken as 3%, or actual RPI if greater, with bonus payments for this element 
commencing with a 10% pay-out if the company’s NAVTR matched RPI, increasing 
incrementally to the maximum entitlement payable if outperformance of 7% or 
more was achieved. Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s pool performance was assessed by 
reference to the return achieved by the Funds pool over the year, with payments 
commencing on achievement of a total return of 6%, rising to a maximum pay-out 
against a total return of 13.5% and pool objectives, by measures such as deal flow 
and delivery of portfolio strategy. Individual performance for each executive 
director was assessed by reference to personal objectives set at the start of the 
year, including non-financial measures such as risk management, marketing of the 
company, team leadership, management skills and promotion of Caledonia’s 
corporate culture and image both internally and externally.
  The company’s NAVTR was 2.6% over the year and therefore below the minimum 
RPI target set by the Remuneration Committee of 3.0%. Accordingly no bonus was 
awarded for the company performance related element. The Fund pool’s return 
over the year was 5.9%, below the minimum payment trigger of 6% and therefore 
no bonus was awarded to Mr Cayzer-Colvin for this element. In recognition of the 
continued progress made by the Funds pool in identifying, and gaining access to, 
high quality private equity funds in Asia and the US and building a pipeline of 
potential new fund commitments, the Remuneration Committee awarded 
Mr Cayzer-Colvin 33.25% out of a maximum 35% for attainment of his pool 
objectives. Based on an assessment of their individual performance objectives over 
the year, the Remuneration Committee awarded Mr Cayzer-Colvin his maximum 
bonus for that component of 15% and Mr Wyatt and Mr King 45% out of their 
maximum of 50%.
 
  
   The total bonuses awarded to Mr Wyatt, Mr King and Mr Cayzer-Colvin for the 
year were therefore determined as follows:

3. Long term incentives
  The long term incentive awards whose performance measurement period ended 
during the year were all of the matching share awards granted in 2013 under the 
company’s deferred bonus plan and half of the awards granted in that year under 
the performance share scheme. The vesting of the awards under the deferred 
bonus plan was dependent on the performance of the company’s NAVTR over 
the three financial years ended 31 March 2016 measured against two separate 
performance benchmarks. For two-thirds of the shares comprised in an award, 
Caledonia’s NAVTR was measured against the FTSE All-Share Total Return index 
(‘FTSE index’) and for the remaining one-third against the FTSE Actuaries UK 
Index-linked Gilts (all stocks) Total Return index (‘Gilts index’). In each case, 
vesting was on a graduated basis, with 10% vesting on achievement of 0.5% 
outperformance of the relevant benchmark index, rising on a straight line basis to 
100% vesting on 3.5% outperformance of the relevant index. For the purpose of 
calculating the performance measures, averages of the figures for the company’s 
NAVTR and the two benchmark indices published over the three months prior to 
the start and end of the performance period were used to reduce volatility. Under 
the performance share scheme, half of the shares comprised in the awards granted 
in 2013 were to be measured against the Gilts index over three years and the 
other≈half against the FTSE index over five years, with graduated vesting and use  
of average figures being on the same basis as for the deferred bonus plan awards 
as described above.
  The company’s NAVTR increased by 34.7% over the three year performance period, 
compared with increases of 10.2% for the FTSE index and 19.8% for the Gilts index. 
Accordingly, both of the performance targets for the deferred bonus plan matching 
awards granted in 2013 and the Gilts index referenced performance share scheme 
awards granted in that year vested in full.
  The amounts shown in the table above under long term incentives therefore 
comprised the value of the vested deferred bonus plan matching awards and 
performance share scheme awards granted in 2013, based on the company’s share 
price at 31 March 2016 of 2285p, together with the value of dividends and 
associated tax credits that would have accrued on the vested shares during the 
performance measurement period and also the value of dividend equivalents that 
would have accrued on the compulsory deferred bonus plan awards granted in 
2013, that gave rise to the matching share awards. These are analysed as follows:

Defined benefit
The Hon C W Cayzer has deferred pension entitlements under the 
Caledonia Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme. He ceased 
to be an active member of the scheme in December 2012 and therefore 
has not accrued any further pensionable service since then, nor have 
any contributions been made on his behalf into the scheme. The  
Hon C W Cayzer’s normal retirement age is 60, however early retirement 
can be taken from age 55 with the company’s consent. In such 
circumstances, the accrued pension would be reduced to take account 
of its early payment.
Details of The Hon C W Cayzer’s accrued pension benefits were as follows:

Accrued pension at 31 March 2016 a 190,768

Transfer value of accrued pension  
at 31 March 2015 e 3,653,745 
Change in transfer value over the year f 187,071 
1.  The accrued pensions shown in rows (a) and (b) represented the deferred pension 
that would be paid at normal retirement age, ignoring any revaluation. The increase 
in accrued pension during the year shown in row (c) represented the increase in 
deferred pension in accordance with the revaluation of pension provisions of the 
Caledonia Pension Scheme applicable to all deferred members.
2.  The transfer values shown in rows (d) and (e) were the present values of the 
accrued pension revalued to normal retirement age and associated benefits at 
the relevant date. Transfer values were calculated using the transfer value basis 
as determined by the trustees of the Caledonia Pension Scheme, which reflected 
market conditions at the relevant date.
3.  The change in transfer value over the year shown in row (f) (calculated as row (d) 
less row (e)), also reflected the impact on transfer values of factors beyond the 
control of the company and the directors, such as movements in financial markets. 
These changes can cause transfer values at different points in time to fluctuate 
significantly. Disclosed changes in transfer values may therefore be subject to a 
large degree of volatility and may even be negative. In particular, the Caledonia 
Pension Scheme’s transfer value assumptions have been updated to allow for 
changes in market conditions.

Statement of directors’ shareholdings and scheme interests 
(audited)
Executive directors’ minimum shareholding guidelines
In order to align the interests of executive directors with those of 
shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has adopted guidelines for 
minimum shareholdings, which executive directors will be expected to 
attain through the retention of all post-tax share awards vesting under the 
company’s long term incentive plans until the minimum shareholding is 
met. For these purposes, shareholdings include those of connected 
persons and also the value, net of any exercise costs, income tax and 
National Insurance contributions, of unexercised options granted under 
the company’s executive share option scheme and awards granted under 
its performance share scheme for which the performance targets have 
been met. Also included are bonuses deferred, compulsorily or 
voluntarily, under the company’s deferred bonus plan and any uncalled 
bonus matching shares for which the performance targets have been 
met, again net of income tax and National Insurance contributions.
For the Chief Executive, the minimum guideline shareholding has been set 
at 200% of basic salary and for other executive directors 150% of basic 
salary. All of the executive directors have attained the minimum guideline 
shareholding as at 31 March 2016. The values of the relevant 
shareholdings of each executive director as at 31 March 2016, calculated 
by reference to Caledonia’s closing share price on that date of 2285p, and 
the percentage level by which the value of the minimum guideline 
shareholding has been achieved were as follows:

Annual report on directors’ remuneration
1. Performance conditions
 Executive share option scheme
  Options outstanding under the executive share option scheme have all met their 
performance targets.
 Performance share scheme
  Nil-cost options awarded under the performance share scheme on 28 May 2012 
and 12 June 2013 are subject to targets related to the company’s NAVTR 
performance against two benchmark indices, the FTSE index and the Gilts index. 
Awards vest on a graduated basis, with 10% vesting on 0.5% outperformance of the 
relevant benchmark, rising to maximum vesting on 3.5% outperformance. There is 
no re-testing of either performance target and, to the extent that a performance 
target is not met, the relevant award will lapse. For the purpose of calculating the 
performance measures, averages of the company’s NAVTR and the two benchmark 
indices over the three months prior to the start and end of the performance period 
is used to reduce volatility. To the extent that the performance targets are met, 
vested awards may be exercised between the date of vesting and the tenth 
anniversary of the date of grant.
  For nil-cost options granted on 28 May 2012, two-thirds of the shares comprised in 
an award were tested against the FTSE index and one-third against the Gilts index. 
In each case the performance period was a period of three years commencing with 
the financial year in which the awards are granted and both targets were met in full. 
For the nil-cost options awarded on 12 June 2013, one-half of the shares comprised 
in an award were measured against the Gilts index over three years and the other 
half against the FTSE index over five years. The shares measured against the Gilts 
index have met their target in full.
  For nil-cost options granted to Mr Wyatt and Mr King on 27 November 2014 and 
26 June 2015, shares will vest on a graduated basis, with vesting commencing at 
10% if the company achieves an annualised NAVTR of 3%, rising incrementally to 
100% vesting on achievement of an annualised NAVTR of 10%. For Mr Cayzer-
Colvin, who is head of the Funds pool, 60% of his performance share scheme 
awards granted on 27 November 2014 and 26 June 2015 will be measured against 
the annualised total returns achieved by the Funds pool. Awards will similarly 
vest on a graduated basis, with vesting commencing at 10% on achievement of 
an annualised Funds pool total return of 6%, rising incrementally to 100% vesting 
on achievement of an annualised total return of 13.5%. The remaining 40% of 
Mr Cayzer-Colvin’s performance share scheme awards for these grants will be 
measured against Caledonia’s NAVTR as above. For the nil-cost options granted on 
27 November 2014, the relevant performance conditions will be tested over three 
years for one-half of the shares comprised in an award and over five years for the 
other half of the shares comprised in an award. For the nil-cost options granted on 
26 June 2015, the relevant performance conditions will be tested over three years 
for one-third of the shares comprised in an award and over five years for the 
remaining two-thirds of the shares comprised in an award.
  Deferred bonus plan matching awards
  The performance targets for the matching awards granted on 12 June 2013 
and 6 June 2014 are the same as those for nil-cost options granted under the 
performance share scheme on 28 May 2012. For the matching awards granted on 
26 June 2015, shares will vest on a graduated basis, with vesting commencing at 
20% if the company achieves an annualised NAVTR measured over three years of 
4%, rising incrementally to 100% vesting on achievement of an annualised NAVTR 
of 10%. Shares that vest must be called within 12 months of vesting.
2. Other exercise conditions
  Performance share scheme
  For nil-cost options granted under the performance share scheme on 28 May 2012, 
to the extent that a performance target is met, two-thirds of the shares that vest 
may normally be exercised three years after grant, with the remaining one-third 
normally becoming exercisable five years after grant. For nil-cost options granted 
on 12 June 2013, 27 November 2014 and 26 June 2015, shares that vest following 
the three or five year performance testing become immediately exercisable.
3. Vested but unexercised
  Shares vested but unexercised represent those awards that are immediately 
exercisable without any conditions.
Performance graph of total shareholder return and 
table of Chief Executive’s total remuneration
The graph below shows the company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) 
against that of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index for the seven 
financial years ending on 31 March 2016. TSR has been calculated 
assuming that all dividends are reinvested on their ex-dividend dates. The 
FTSE All-Share Total Return index has been chosen as it is the benchmark 
by which the company measures its delivery of value over the longer 
term. For comparison, the table below the graph shows the total 
remuneration received by the Chief Executive in each of the seven years 
to 31 March 2016, prepared on the same basis as in the single total figure 
in the table on page 44, and the percentage of the maximum potential 
short and long term incentives received in those years.

time Mr Wyatt was appointed as his successor. The remuneration shown for 2011 
represents the amounts paid to each in the period that they served as Chief 
Executive in that financial year. The long term incentives held by Mr Ingram which 
vested in 2011 were HMRC approved executive share options granted in 2008, 
which the Remuneration Committee determined should vest based on the 
measurement of the performance targets up to the date of his retirement. The 
percentage of short term incentives shown as vesting for Mr Wyatt in 2011 relates 
to his annual bonus for that year, the total amount of which has been included 
in the corresponding single figure for total remuneration.
  Subsequent to his retirement, Mr Ingram exercised further share options at 
a pre-tax gain of £119,413 in the 2014 financial year.

Percentage change in remuneration of Chief Executive
The following table shows the percentage change in the basic salary, value 
of taxable benefits and short term incentives paid to the Chief Executive 
in the year to 31 March 2016 against the previous financial year, 
compared with the average percentage changes in those components 
of pay of Caledonia’s other staff on a per capita basis. Caledonia’s senior 
executives, including the Chief Executive, received a standard increase in 
basic salary of 1.0%, although other grades of staff were awarded a 
standard increase of 3.0%. The average per capita percentage change for 
staff taxable benefits reduced over the year principally due to lower rates 
and extended cover options negotiated for the company’s private medical 
insurance plan, which enabled some members of staff to benefit from 
lower renewal premiums. The Chief Executive was awarded a bonus of 
45% of basic salary, based on the company’s performance and individual 
objectives, compared with the maximum entitlement in the previous year. 
The average per capita percentage change in staff bonuses reflected 
a variety of factors, such as company performance, pool performance, 
individual objectives and increases in the basic salaries on which the 
bonus awards were based.

The company expects to operate the remuneration policy as described 
in the previous section without any changes in the financial year ending 
31 March 2017 .
Basic salaries of executive directors
In respect of the 2017 financial year, the Remuneration Committee has 
maintained the Chief Executive’s basic salary at the same level as the 2016

Annual bonus scheme and long term incentive schemes
No changes to the company’s annual bonus or long term incentive 
schemes are anticipated for the 2017 financial year.
Approach
The Remuneration Committee will keep the implementation of the 
remuneration policy under review in order to take account of any 
changes in the company’s business environment and remuneration 
practice generally, but with the overall aim of ensuring that Caledonia’s 
remuneration arrangements continue to support the company’s 
strategy and deliver long term shareholder value by attracting and 
retaining talent and rewarding executives appropriately in the light 
of the company’s performance.
Consideration by the directors of matters relating to 
directors’ remuneration
The current members of the Remuneration Committee are Charles 
Gregson (Chairman), David Stewart and Shonaid Jemmett-Page. 
Mr Gregson and Mr Stewart served throughout the year and 
Mrs Jemmett-Page served from the date of her appointment as a 
directoron 1 July 2015. Robert Woods also served as a member of the 
Remuneration Committee until his retirement from the board on 
31 March 2016.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice from 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP , the company’s main legal advisers, 
in relation to the preparation of the 2015 Directors’ remuneration report 
and emerging practice in relation to the adoption of clawback provisions 
by other UK listed companies. The Remuneration Committee also 
consulted with the Chairman and the Chief Executive in relation to the 
remuneration of the executive directors and internal support was 
provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary.

Dividends
An interim dividend of 14.3p per share (2015 – 13.8p) was paid on 
7 January 2016 and a second interim dividend of 38.3p per share  
(2015 – final dividend of 36.8p) was paid on 1 April 2016, giving total 
dividends for the year of 52.6p per share (2015 – 50.6p). The directors  
do not recommend the payment of a final dividend.
Share capital structure
The company has two classes of share capital – ordinary shares of 5p each 
and deferred ordinary shares of 5p each.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as 
declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at 
meetings of the company. All voting rights are however suspended in 
respect of any of the company’s shares that are held in treasury or by 
group companies.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are not 
redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference 
dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of the 
nominal value of such deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or 
£4,000 in aggregate, for all such shares currently in issue. The company is 
required to pay the dividend to the extent that it has distributable profits. 
On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred ordinary shares 
carry the right to the payment of the amount paid up on such shares only 
after holders of the ordinary shares have received the sum of £100,000 
in respect of each ordinary share. All of the deferred ordinary shares are 
held by Sterling Industries Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caledonia.
At 31 March 2016, 55,381,017 ordinary shares and 8,000,000 deferred 
ordinary shares were in issue. The ordinary shares therefore represented 
approximately 87% and the deferred ordinary shares approximately 13% 
of the total issued share capital by nominal value. Of the ordinary shares 
in issue at 31 March 2016, 3,000 shares were held by a group company. 
As stated above, all voting rights are suspended on these shares. The 
company did not purchase any of its ordinary shares the company’s issued 
share capital as at 18 May 2016, being the latest practicable date prior 
to signature of these accounts, was 55,381,017 ordinary shares and 
8,000,000 deferred ordinary shares.
Restrictions on the transfer of shares
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of the company’s shares, 
although the articles of association contain provisions whereby the 
directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share which is 
not fully paid, provided that such refusal does not prevent dealings in the 
share from taking place on an open and proper basis. The directors may 
also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless it is (a) 
lodged, duly stamped, at the registered office or at such other place as the 
directors may appoint, accompanied by the certificate for the shares to 
which it relates and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably 
require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; (b) in 
respect of only one class of shares; and (c) in favour of not more than 
four transferees.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of shares if a shareholder 
has not supplied information to the company in default of a request duly 
served under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and such shares 
represent at least 0.25% of the class of shares concerned.

Employee share trust
The Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust acquires and holds 
ordinary shares in the company for subsequent transfer to employees 
exercising options under the company’s executive share option scheme 
and the performance share scheme or calling for awards vesting under 
the company’s deferred bonus plan. The voting rights of shares held 
by the trust are exercisable by the independent trustee. The trustee 
has waived all dividends payable in respect of the ordinary shares 
held by the trust, except to the extent of 0.0001% of such dividends. 
At 31 March 2016, the trust held 245,097 ordinary shares.
Restrictions on voting rights
The directors may direct that a shareholder shall not be entitled to 
attend and vote either personally or by proxy or exercise any other right 
conferred by membership in relation to general meetings of the company 
in respect of some or all of the shares held by him, if he or any person 
with an interest in such shares has been duly served with a notice under 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and is in default for the prescribed 
period in supplying to the company the information required or, in 
purported compliance with such a notice, has made a statement which 
is false or inadequate in a material particular.
Agreements which may restrict the transfer of shares or 
exercise of voting rights
The company is not aware of any arrangements which may restrict the 
transfer of any of its shares or the exercise of any voting rights.
Authority to allot and purchase shares
At the annual general meeting of the company held on 16 July 2015, 
shareholders granted to the directors authority to allot ordinary shares up 
to a nominal amount of £923,016, representing approximately one-third 
of the ordinary share capital then in issue, with authority to allot 
additional ordinary shares up to a nominal value of £923,017 , representing 
approximately a further one-third of the ordinary share capital then in 
issue, by way of pre-emptive rights issues only, in accordance with 
guidance issued at that time by the Association of British Insurers. The 
directors were further authorised to issue ordinary shares up to a nominal 
amount of £138,452 other than pro rata to existing ordinary shareholders. 
These authorities last until 16 October 2016 or, if earlier, the conclusion 
of the next annual general meeting.
At the annual general meeting held on 16 July 2015, shareholders also 
granted authority for the company to make market purchases of up to 
5,538,100 of its own ordinary shares, being approximately 10% of the 
ordinary share capital then in issue, at a price not more than the higher 
of (a) 5% greater than the average of the middle market quotations for 
such ordinary shares during the five business days preceding any such 
purchase; and (b) the higher of (i) the price of the last independent trade 
in such ordinary shares; and (ii) the highest current independent bid 
relating thereto on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out, 
nor at a price less than 5p, being the nominal value of an ordinary share. 
This authority lasts until 16 October 2016 or, if earlier, the conclusion of 
the next annual general meeting. At the same time, shareholders who 
were not members of the Cayzer family concert party (‘Cayzer Concert 
Party’) gave their approval for a waiver by the Panel on Takeovers and 
Mergers of the obligation that could arise on the Cayzer Concert Party 
under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers to make a 
general offer for Caledonia on the implementation by the company of the 
above authority to purchase its own shares. The approval was subject to 
the maximum percentage of voting rights in which the Cayzer Concert 
Party is interested not exceeding 49.9% as a result of purchases by the 
company. This waiver expires on 16 October 2016 or, if earlier, the 
conclusion of the next annual general meeting.

Change of control rights
There are no special control rights in relation to the company’s shares.
Options granted under the company’s executive share option scheme 
and its performance share scheme and awards made under its deferred 
bonus plan may become exercisable or vest as a result of a change of 
control, although the number of shares comprised in those options or 
awards may be reduced. The service contracts of certain directors and 
other senior executives also contain provisions whereby a liquidated sum 
is payable by the company in the event of termination within one year 
following a change of control. 
Further details of these change of control rights are set out in the 
directors’ remuneration report.
Investment trust status
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has confirmed that Caledonia 
has investment trust status for all financial periods from 1 April 2012.
Annual general meeting
The eighty-seventh annual general meeting of the company will be 
held at the Royal Over-Seas League, Park Place, St James’s Street, 
London SW1A 1LR on Thursday, 21 July 2016 at 11.30 am. The notice 
of the annual general meeting and details of all of the resolutions to be 
put to shareholders are set out in a separate circular sent to shareholders 
at the same time as this annual report.
Directors
The directors of the company are shown on pages 26 and 27 . All of the 
directors served throughout the year, other than Mrs S C R Jemmett-Page 
who was appointed on 1 July 2015. In addition, Mr R B Woods served 
as a director until his retirement from the board on 31 March 2016.
Directors’ indemnity
Each of the directors has the benefit, under the company’s articles of 
association, of an indemnity, to the extent permitted by the Companies 
Act 2006, against any liability incurred by him or her for negligence, 
default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the affairs of 
the company.
Appointment and removal of directors and the articles 
of association
The appointment and removal of directors is governed by the company’s 
articles of association and prevailing company law.
The articles of association provide that at every annual general meeting 
one-third of the directors, or if not a multiple of three, the number 
nearest to one-third, shall retire by rotation and therefore be required to 
seek re-election by shareholders. New directors may be appointed by the 
board, but are subject to election by shareholders at the next annual 
general meeting of the company following their appointment. However, 
to comply with the provisions of The UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
company requires that all directors should be subject to annual election 
by shareholders. Shareholders may also appoint new directors by 
ordinary resolution. The articles of association limit the number of 
directors to not less than two and not more than twelve, unless the 
shareholders resolve otherwise.
In accordance with changes to the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing 
Rules introduced in May 2014, the election of those directors determined 
by the board to be independent under The UK Corporate Governance 
Code must be subject to the approval of both all shareholders of the 
company and separately those shareholders who are not controlling 
shareholders, being the Cayzer Concert Party.
Customers and suppliers
The group’s policy in relation to all of its suppliers is to settle the terms 
of payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction. The group will 
abide by those terms on condition that it is satisfied that the supplier 
has provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms 
and conditions. The group does not follow any code or statement on 
payment practice.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s report on pages 2 to 6 and the 
investment review on pages 10 to 17 . The financial position of the group, 
its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the financial review on pages 18 and 19. In addition, note 22 to the 
financial statements includes the group’s capital management policies 
and procedures and processes for managing market risk and exposures 
to currency risk, interest rate risk, price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group has cash and other liquid resources and committed bank 
facilities available to meet existing and new investment commitments. 
As a consequence, the directors believe that the group is well placed 
to manage business risks successfully.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the annual report and accounts.
Viability statement
The directors have assessed the viability of the company over the 
three years to March 2019, taking account of the company’s position, its 
investment strategy, and the potential impact of the relevant principal 
risks set out on pages 21 to 23. In making this statement, the board 
is satisfied that the company operates an effective risk management 
process and confirms that it has conducted a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the company. This includes those that would 
threaten its strategic objectives, its business as usual state, its business 
model, and its future performance, solvency or liquidity. Based on 
this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to March 2019.
In making this assessment, the directors took comfort from the results 
of a series of stress tests that considered the impact of a number of 
severe market downturn scenarios and loss of investment trust status 
on the company’s financial position and, in particular, its ability to 
settle projected liabilities of the company as they fall due. The directors 
determined that a three year period to March 2019 is an appropriate 
period for which to provide this statement given the company’s long term 
investment objective and the resilience demonstrated by the stress 
testing and the relatively low working capital requirements.
Auditor
Resolutions will be proposed at the annual general meeting to re-appoint 
KPMG LLP as auditor of the company and to authorise the directors 
to agree the auditor’s remuneration. A description of how the Audit 
Committee ensures the objectivity and independence of the auditor 
is set out on page 33 within the Audit Committee report.

Responsibility statements
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the 
Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the directors have prepared the 
group and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law, the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and 
of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union has been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the group and parent company financial statements respectively
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the company and the group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the company and the group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that:
1.  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant information 
of which the company’s auditor is unaware
2.  the director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as 
a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
This confirmation is given, and should be interpreted, in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Responsibility statements under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and The UK Corporate Governance Code
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 26 
and 27 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
1.  the group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the group
2.   the strategic report contained on pages 1 to 25 includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Caledonia Investments plc 
for the year ended 31 March 2016 set out on pages 56 to 74. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2016 
and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the 
risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit 
were as follows:
Valuation of unlisted investments £967.2m (2015 – £850.2m)  
Risk vs 2015 
Refer to page 32 (Audit Committee report), page 60 (accounting policy) 
and page 64 (financial disclosures).
The risk
58.5% (2015 – 50.9%) of the group’s total assets (by value) is held in 
investments where no quoted market price is available. Unlisted 
investments comprise investments in equity, investment property 
and funds. Unlisted investments are measured at fair value, which is 
established in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture 
Capital Valuation Guidelines by using measurements of value such as 
price of recent orderly transactions, earnings multiples and net assets. 
Investment properties are subject to annual independent valuation and 
measured accordingly. There is a significant risk over the valuation of 
these investments and this is one of the key judgmental areas that our 
audit focused on.
Our response
Our procedures included:
• Enquiry of management to document and assess the design and 
implementation of the investment valuation processes and controls 
in place. 
• Attending the biannual Challenge Committee meetings and all Audit 
Committee meetings where we assessed the effectiveness of the 
Committees’ challenge and approval of unlisted investment valuations.
• Assessment of investment realisations in the period, comparing actual 
sales proceeds to prior year-end valuations to understand the reasons 
for significant variances and determine whether they are indicative of  
bias or error in the group’s approach to valuations.
• Challenging the investment manager on key judgments affecting 
investee company valuations in the context of observed industry 
best practice and the provisions of the International Private Equity and 
Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines. In particular, we challenged the 
appropriateness of the valuation basis selected as well as the underlying 
assumptions, such as discount factors, and the choice of benchmark 
for earnings multiples. We compared key underlying financial data 
inputs to external sources and investee company audited accounts 
and management information as applicable. We challenged the 
assumptions around sustainability of earnings based on the plans of 
the investee companies and whether these are achievable, and we 
obtained an understanding of existing and prospective investee 
company cash flows to understand whether borrowings can be serviced 
or refinancing may be required. Where a recent transaction has been 
used to value any holding, we obtained an understanding of the 
circumstances surrounding the transaction and whether it was 
considered to be on an arm’s-length basis and suitable as an input into a 
valuation. Our work included consideration of events which occurred 
subsequent to the year end up until the date of this audit report.
• We compared the investment property valuations of the directors 
to valuations performed by the external valuer and evaluated the 
competence, capabilities and objectivity of the valuer. With the 
assistance of our own valuation specialist, we considered the 
appropriateness of the external and internal valuations and inherent 
assumptions by comparing the group’s assumptions to externally 
derived data.
• For the valuation of fund interests, we obtained and agreed the latest 
reported net asset values from the fund managers. Our procedures 
also included obtaining audited financial statements of the funds 
and checking the historical accuracy of the net asset values.
• Our procedures also included consideration of the appropriateness, 
in accordance with relevant accounting standards, of the disclosures 
in note 22 in respect of unlisted investments and the effect of changing 
one or more inputs to reasonably possible alternative valuation 
assumptions.
Carrying value of investments listed on recognised stock exchanges 
£642.0m (2015 – £648.6m) Risk vs 2015 
Refer to page 33 (Audit Committee report), page 60 (accounting policy) 
and page 64 (financial disclosures).
The risk
The group’s portfolio of listed equity investments makes up 38.3%  
(2015 – 38.8%) of the total assets by value of the group and is considered 
to be one of the key drivers of operations and performance results.  
We do not consider these investments to be at high risk of significant 
misstatement, or to be subject to a significant level of judgment because 
they comprise liquid, quoted investments. However, due to their 
materiality in the context of the financial statements as a whole, they are 
considered to be one of the areas which had the greatest effect on our 
overall audit strategy and allocation of resources in planning and 
completing our audit.
Our response
Our procedures over the completeness, valuation and existence of the 
group’s listed equity investment portfolio included, but were not limited to:
• documenting and assessing the processes in place to record investment 
transactions and to value the portfolio;
• agreeing the valuation of 100 percent of investments in the portfolio 
to externally quoted prices; and
• agreeing 100 percent of investment holdings in the portfolio to 
independently received third party confirmations.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of 
our audit
Materiality for the financial statements as a whole was set at £16.75m 
(2015 – £25.1m), determined with reference to a benchmark of total 
group assets, of which it represents 1%, reflecting industry consensus 
levels (2015 – 1.5%).
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected and uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding £0.84m (2015 – £1.25m) in addition 
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
The group audit team performed the audit of the group as if it was a single 
aggregated set of financial information. The audit was performed using 
the materiality levels set out above and covered 100% of total group 
revenue, group profit before tax, and total group assets.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006;
• the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the information given in the Corporate governance statement set out 
on pages 28 to 30 with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share 
capital structures is consistent with the financial statements. 
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the directors’ statement of risk management on pages 21 to 23, 
concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, 
the directors’ assessment and expectations of the group’s continuing 
in operation over the three years to 2019; or 
• the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements concerning the 
use of the going concern basis of accounting. 
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which 
we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based 
on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other 
information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency 
with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge 
we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider that the annual report and financial statements taken 
as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee report does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or 
• a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by 
the company. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the directors’ statements, set out on page 51, in relation to going 
concern and longer-term viability; and 
• the part of the Corporate governance statement on pages 28 to 30 
relating to the company’s compliance with the eleven provisions of 
the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set 
out on page 53, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is 
provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/ 
auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the company’s 
members as a body and is subject to important explanations and 
disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are incorporated 
into this report as if set out in full and should be read to provide an 
understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we have 
undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

60 Annual report 2016 Caledonia Investments plc  
Significant accounting policies
General information
Caledonia Investments plc is an investment trust company domiciled 
in the United Kingdom and incorporated in England in 1928, under the 
Companies Acts 1908 to 1917 . The address of its registered office is 2nd 
Floor Stratton House, 5 Stratton Street, London W1J 8LA. The ordinary 
shares of the company are premium listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors 
on 19 May 2016.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, as this 
is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
Caledonia operates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Fair values of financial instruments
Most of the group’s financial instruments are measured at fair value in 
the statement of financial position and it is usually possible to determine 
their fair values within a reasonable range of estimates.
For actively traded financial instruments, quoted market prices are readily 
available. For other financial instruments, such as unlisted securities, 
valuation techniques are used to estimate fair value. Valuation techniques 
make maximum use of market inputs, including reference to the current 
fair values of instruments that are substantially the same (subject to 
appropriate adjustments).
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on 
market conditions and information about the financial instrument. 
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and 
matters of significant judgement and therefore cannot be determined 
with precision.
Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
EU and therefore the group financial statements comply with Article 4 
of the EU IAS Regulation. IFRSs comprise accounting standards issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board and its predecessor 
body as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee and its predecessor body.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, 
except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and properties. 
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended 
Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture 
Capital Trusts (‘SORP’) issued by the Association of Investment Companies 
in November 2014 is consistent with the requirements of IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements 
on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP .
The statement of comprehensive income of the company has been 
omitted from these financial statements in accordance with section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Under The UK Corporate Governance Code and applicable regulations, 
the directors are required to satisfy themselves that it is reasonable to 
presume that the company is a going concern. The directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
as discussed on page 51. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of preparing the financial statements.
Adopted IFRSs
In the current year, the group has not adopted any new standards or 
interpretations.
IFRSs not yet applied
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following 
standards had been issued by the IASB but not adopted by the EU:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards in 
future periods in their issued form will have no material impact on 
the financial statements.
Assessment as investment entity
Entities that meet the definition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are 
required to account for most investments in controlled entities as held 
at fair value through profit or loss. Subsidiaries that provide investment 
related services or engage in permitted investment related activities with 
investees continue to be consolidated unless they are also investment 
entities. The board has concluded that the company meets the definition 
of an investment entity.
Basis of consolidation
In accordance with the IFRS 10/IAS 28 Investment entities amendments, 
the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of 
the company and service entities controlled by the company made up to 
the reporting date. Control is achieved where the company has the power 
over the potential investee as a result of voting or other rights, has rights 
to positive or negative variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect 
significantly the amount of its returns.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated 
to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the 
reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated to the 
functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
that are stated at fair value are translated to the functional currency at 
foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were determined.
In the financial statements, foreign exchange gains or losses are 
recognised in capital or revenue reserve depending on whether the 
gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.
Income
Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue when 
the shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established, normally 
the ex-dividend date. Where no ex-dividend date is available, dividends 
receivable on or before the period end are treated as revenue for the 
period. Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities, loans and non-equity shares are 
recognised on an effective interest rate basis, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected 
life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The company’s share of net income from limited partnerships is 
recognised as revenue when received.
Where uncertainty arises over the collectability of an amount already 
included in income, the uncollectible amount or the amount in 
respect of which the recovery has ceased to be probable, is recognised 
as an expense. When the uncertainty over collectability is removed, 
normally on receipt, the income is recognised in the Statement of 
comprehensive income.

61 Annual report 2016 Caledonia Investments plc  
Expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis. In the financial 
statements, ongoing management expenses are included in revenue 
reserves, whereas performance fees and share-based payment expenses – 
costs relating to compensation schemes that are linked directly to 
investment performance – are included in capital reserves. Expenses 
of acquisition of an investment designated as held at fair value through 
profit or loss or expenses of an aborted acquisition or disposal of an 
investment are presented as transaction costs, or deducted from the 
proceeds of sale as appropriate, and included in capital reserves.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense 
as they fall due.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined 
using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being 
carried out at each reporting date. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognised in full in the period in which they occur in other 
comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately in the period of a 
plan amendment.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Statement of financial 
position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from 
this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Profit sharing and bonus plans
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit 
sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit 
attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. 
The group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where 
there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant and the fair value is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest.
Where employees of a subsidiary are granted rights to the equity 
instruments of its parent as consideration for the services provided to 
the subsidiary, the subsidiary recognises an equity-settled share-based 
payment transaction expense with a corresponding increase recognised 
in equity representing a contribution from the parent. In addition, 
the parent recognises an increase in equity and an increase in 
subsidiary investment equivalent to the amount of the share-based 
payment transaction.
An employee share trust is used for distributing option and performance 
share and deferred bonus awards to employees under Caledonia’s share 
remuneration schemes. The trustee purchases shares with money lent 
interest free by Caledonia and transfers shares to participating employees 
on receipt of the requisite consideration or calling of awards.
The transactions the employee share trust undertakes are considered 
to be performed by the trust as an agent for Caledonia. The transactions 
of the employee share trust are included in the separate financial 
statements of the parent company and, following the requirements 
of IFRS 10, in the consolidated financial statements as if they arose in 
that company. Own shares held by the employee share trust as at the 
reporting date are accounted for as if they were treasury shares.
National Insurance on share option scheme gains and performance share 
and deferred bonus awards
National Insurance payable on the exercise of certain employee share 
options and performance share awards at the date of exercise and 
deferred bonus awards at the date of call has been charged as an expense 
spread over the respective vesting periods. The charge is based on the 
difference between the market value of the underlying shares at the 
reporting date and the exercise price for share options or £nil for 
performance share awards and deferred bonus awards and calculated 
at the latest enacted National Insurance rate.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Statement of 
comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current 
tax is calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Investment trust 
companies that have approval as such under section 1159 of the 
Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting 
date and adjusted to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to 
be recovered.
Dividend distribution
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are appropriately 
authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity. For interim 
dividends, this will normally mean the date on which they are paid 
and, for final dividends, the date on which they are approved in 
general meeting.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date, where 
a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms 
require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established 
by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, excluding 
transaction costs.
Investments held as part of the group’s business of investing in 
financial assets are designated as held at fair value through profit or  
loss in both the consolidated financial statements and the company 
financial statements.
Investments designated as held at fair value through profit or loss are 
measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains or losses 
arising from changes in the value of investments designated as held at 
fair value through profit or loss, including foreign exchange movements, 
are included in net profit or loss for the period as a capital return.
Listed investments are valued at bid price or the last traded price when 
a bid price is not available. Unlisted investments are valued using 
recognised valuation methodologies, based on the International Private 
Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines, which reflect the 
amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, 
willing parties on an arm’s length basis. The portfolio valuation 
methodology is detailed on page 20.

Significant accounting policies continued
Distributions from investment limited partnerships are treated as 
disposal proceeds or income in accordance with the nature of the 
distribution. Any surplus capital distributions after repaying partner’s 
capital are treated as realised gains.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered 
into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
Hedge accounting is not applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive 
income as they arise.
Capital reserve
The company maintains a capital reserve. The following items are 
transferred into the capital reserve from profit or loss:
• gains and losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss
• gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge the fair value 
of investments
• fees and share-based payment expenses linked to investment 
performance
• expenses and finance costs incurred directly in relation to capital 
transactions
• actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes
• taxation on items recognised in the capital reserve.
Property, plant and equipment
Property is measured at fair value. Gains arising from changes in the 
fair value are included in other comprehensive income for the period in 
which they arise and losses included in profit or loss. To the extent gains 
represent the reversal of cumulative losses previously recognised they 
are included in profit or loss.
Plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any accumulated impairment loss.
Assets in course of construction are measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment loss.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the fair value or cost of items 
of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values 
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Land 
and assets in course of construction are not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are 
as follows:
Buildings  25-50 years
Office equipment 3-5 years
Accumulated depreciation on revalued property is eliminated against 
the gross carrying amount of the asset.
The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset and is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of assets
At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of 
its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, if any. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs 
to sell and value in use. 
Receivables
Receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their 
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are 
short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes 
in value.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the fair value 
of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accrual basis in the Statement of comprehensive 
income using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise. The effective interest method allocates the 
interest expense over the life of the instrument so as to reflect a constant 
return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Statement of financial position when 
the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at 
the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material.
In the financial statements, provisions recognised for investments are 
included in the Statement of comprehensive income as a capital return.
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded as the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
Where the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust purchases 
the company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted 
from equity attributable to the company’s owners until the shares are 
transferred. Where such shares are subsequently transferred, any 
consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to the company’s owners.
Operating segments
Operating segments are based on the financial information reported to 
the chief operating decision maker.

The bank guarantee provision related to a bank loan drawn by a subsidiary 
and lent to another subsidiary, which did not have sufficient resources to 
settle the obligation in full. The provision was estimated based on the 
expected shortfall should the loan be repaid. During the prior year, the 
ultimate borrower was restructured and the loan obligation settled in full.
The solvency guarantee provision related to a subsidiary that had a claim 
against it, but insufficient resources to settle any such obligations. The 
provision was estimated based on the amount of the claim against the 
subsidiary. During the prior year, the provision was increased based on 
a review of the obligations. There was no increase in provision during 
the current year.
The litigation provision related to a claim arising from the acquisition of 
a subsidiary in 2013. During the year the claim was settled in full, and the 
provision was used against costs incurred.
With the exception of the litigation provision, these provisions were 
allocated to the capital reserve. As the matters that gave rise to the 
provisions were expected to be resolved over the next year, all provisions 
were classified as current liabilities.

The company had outstanding share options and performance share 
scheme and deferred bonus awards (note 23).
As at 31 March 2016, the issued share capital of the company comprised 
55,381,017 ordinary shares (2015 – 55,381,017) and 8,000,000 deferred 
ordinary shares (2015 – 8,000,000). The ordinary and deferred ordinary 
shares have a nominal value of 5p each.
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as 
declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at 
meetings of the company. In respect of the company’s ordinary shares 
that are held by subsidiaries, all voting rights are suspended.
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are not 
redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference 
dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of the 
nominal value of such deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or 
£4,000 in aggregate, for all such shares currently in issue. The company is 
required to pay the dividend to the extent that it has distributable profits. 
On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred ordinary shares 
carry the right to the payment of the amount paid up on such shares only 
after holders of the ordinary shares have received the sum of £100,000 in 
respect of each such ordinary share. All of the deferred ordinary shares 
are held by Sterling Industries Ltd, a wholly-owned group company.
17. Net asset value per share
The group’s undiluted net asset value per share is based on the net assets 
of the group at the year end and on the number of ordinary shares in issue 
at the year end less ordinary shares held by the Caledonia Investments plc 
Employee Share Trust. The group’s diluted net asset value per share 
assumes the exercise of all outstanding in-the-money share options and 
the calling of performance share and deferred bonus awards.

Net asset value per share is calculated in accordance with AIC guidance 
and, in particular, recognises dividends payable on the ex-dividend date. 
Net assets in 2016 are stated after deducting the second interim dividend 
of £21.1m, which had an ex-dividend date of 3 March 2016 and was paid 
on 1 April 2016.

18. Operating segments
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Executive 
Committee, which reviews the company’s internal reporting in order to 
assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined 
the operating segments based on these reports.
The performance of operating segments is assessed on a measure of 
group total revenue, principally comprising gains and losses on 
investments and derivatives hedging those investments and investment 
income. Reportable profit or loss is after treasury income and ‘Other 
items’, which comprise management and other expenses and provisions. 
Reportable assets equate to the group’s total assets. Cash and cash 
equivalents and other items are not identifiable operating segments.
‘Other investments’ comprise subsidiaries not managed as part of the 
investment portfolio.

The company has provided guarantees capped at £6.5m, £3.7m and 
£5.0m to the trustees of the Caledonia Pension Scheme, the Sterling 
Industries Pension Scheme and the Amber Industrial Holdings PLC Pension 
& Life Assurance Scheme respectively in respect of the liabilities of the 
participating employers of those schemes.
22. Financial instruments
Financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, cash 
balances, borrowings and receivables and payables that arise from 
operations. The investment portfolio includes listed and unlisted equity 
investments, debt instruments and investments in funds that are 
intended to be held for the long term.
Risk analysis
The main types of financial risk to which the group is exposed are 
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The nature and extent of the financial instruments outstanding at 
the reporting date and the risk management policies employed are 
discussed below.
Market risk
Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes 
price risk, currency risk and fair value interest rate risk.
The strategy for managing market risk is driven by the investment 
objective, which is to outperform the FTSE All-Share Total Return index 
over rolling ten year periods. Investments are made in a range of 
instruments, including listed and unlisted equities, debt and non-equity 
investment funds, in a range of sectors and regions.
Price risk
Price risk may affect the value of listed and unlisted investments as a 
result of changes in market prices (other than arising from interest rate 
risk or currency risk), whether caused by factors specific to an individual 
investment, its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in 
the market.
As the majority of financial instruments are carried at fair value, with fair 
value changes recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income, 
all changes in market conditions will directly affect reported 
portfolio returns.
Price risk is managed by constructing a diversified portfolio of instruments 
traded on various markets and hedging where appropriate.
The exposures of listed and unlisted equity investments, equity linked 
bonds and funds were as follows:
 Group Company
2016 
£m 
2015 
£m

£m 
2015

Investments held at fair value 
through profit or loss 1,565.3 1,465.4 1,580.5 1,480.8 
The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% variation in equity 
prices. The sensitivity analysis includes all equity and fund investments 
held at fair value through profit or loss and adjusts their valuation at the 
year end for a 10% change in value.
 Group Company

Increase in prices 156.5 146.5 158.1 148.1 
Decrease in prices (156.5) (146.5) (158.1) (148.1)
The sensitivity to equity and fund investments has increased during the 
year due to net investments and investment portfolio gains in the year.
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of 
the inherent price risk as the year end exposure does not reflect the 
exposure throughout the year as a whole.
Currency risk
Investments in financial instruments and other transactions may be 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. 
Consequently, there is exposure to the risk that the exchange rate of the 
functional currency may change relative to other currencies in a manner 
that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of assets and 
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
The company’s non-functional currency denominated investments and 
gains and losses thereon are reviewed regularly by the directors and the 
currency risk is managed by the directors within the overall asset 
allocation strategies.

rates. This level of change is considered to be reasonable, based on 
observation of market conditions and historic trends. The sensitivity 
analysis includes all foreign denominated debt investments.

The exposure to foreign currency has remained consistent in the year due 
to similar foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate movements may affect the fair value of investments in fixed 
interest securities and the level of income receivable from fixed income 
securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
The company and group held cash at bank and term deposits, with the 
term to maturity of up to three months, and floating rate, interest-bearing 
financial assets. The group also held fixed rate, interest-bearing financial 
assets, with maturities of up to five years. In the prior year the group also 
had floating rate, interest-bearing borrowings.
The exposure to interest rate risk on financial assets and liabilities was 
as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents 22.9 140.0 23.8 138.7 
Interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings – (9.0) – – 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the 
exposure to interest rates at the reporting date from a 50 basis point 
change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held 
constant throughout the year. This level of change is considered to be 
reasonable, based on observation of market conditions and historic trends.

Decrease in interest rates (0.1) 0.5 0.1 0.4 
Increase in interest rates 0.1 (0.5) (0.1) (0.4)
The group’s and company’s sensitivity to interest rates has changed in 
the year due to an increase in fixed interest loans, against a reduction in 
floating rate loans and net cash with a relatively lower rate of interest.
 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will 
fail to discharge an obligation or commitment. A credit policy is in place 
and exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored.
The exposure to credit risk in financial assets was as follows: 
 Group Company
2016 
£m 
2015 
£m 
2016 
£m 
2015

Cash and cash equivalents 22.9 140.0 23.8 138.7 
75.1 180.7 71.2 160.4 
Prior to making investments in debt instruments, management has in 
place a process of review that includes an evaluation of a potential 
investee company’s ability to service and repay its debt. Management 
reviews the financial position of investee companies, including their 
continuing ability to service and repay debt, on a regular basis.
The exposure to credit risk on operating and other receivables is mitigated 
by performing credit evaluations on investee companies as part of the 
due diligence process.
Credit risk arising on money market funds and cash and cash equivalents 
is mitigated by spreading investments and deposits across a number 
of approved counterparties in accordance with board policy. These 
are either investment grade banks with a credit rating of ‘AA3’ or ‘AA-‘ 
or higher, as determined by the rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch, 
or banks specifically approved by the board. These credit ratings are 
reviewed regularly.
At the year end, the group and company had cash deposits with the  
Royal Bank of Scotland plc of £18.9m (2015 – £98.0m) and £19.8m  
(2015 – £96.7m) respectively.
All transactions in listed securities are settled on contract terms using 
approved brokers. The risk of default is considered minimal, as delivery  
of securities sold is only made once the broker has received payment. 
Payment is made on a purchase once the securities have been received by 
the broker. The trade will fail if either party fails to meet their obligations. 
Listed security trades are settled through HSBC Global Custody.
Fair value
Most of the financial instruments are carried at fair value in the Statement 
of financial position. Usually, the fair value of the financial instruments can 
be reliably determined within a reasonable range of estimates. For certain 
other financial instruments, specifically operating and other receivables 
and payables, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the 
immediate or short term nature of these financial instruments.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises as a result of the possibility that the group and 
company may not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The corporate treasury function provides services to the company and 
group, coordinating access to domestic financial markets for both 
borrowing and depositing. Group companies access local financial 
markets when this is more favourable, in liaison with the corporate 
treasury function. Executive management monitors the group’s liquidity 
on a weekly basis, including the level of undrawn committed bank 
facilities.

Capital management policies and procedures
The group’s capital management objectives are:
• to ensure that the group and company will be able to continue as 
a going concern
• to maximise the income and capital return to the company’s 
shareholders, principally through the use of equity capital, although 
the group will maintain appropriate borrowing facilities, to be used 
for short term working capital or bridging finance, currently £175m 
(2015 – £175m).
The group’s total capital at 31 March 2016 was £1,644.3m (2015 – 
£1,626.9m) and comprised equity share capital and reserves. The group 
was ungeared at the year end (2015 – 0.6%) and had a further £175m 
of undrawn committed bank facilities.
The board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the group’s 
and company’s capital on an ongoing basis. This review includes:
• the planned level of gearing, which takes into account planned 
investment activity
• the possible buy-back of equity shares for cancellation, which takes 
account of the discount of the share price to net asset value per share
• the annual dividend policy.
The group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital 
are unchanged from the preceding year.
The parent company is subject to the following externally imposed 
capital requirements:
• as a public limited company, the company is required to have a 
minimum issued share capital of £50,000
• to maintain its approval as an investment trust company, the company 
is required to comply with the provisions of section 1158 of the 
Corporation Tax Act 2010 as amended by the Investment Trust 
(Approved Company) (Tax) Regulations 2011.
The parent company has complied with these requirements, which are 
unchanged since the previous year end.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments held at fair value according 
to the subjectivity of the valuation method, using the following hierarchy:
Level 1  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical 
assets.
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that 
are directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3  Inputs for the asset that are not based on observable market 
data.

Level 3 830.3 751.0 816.8 736.3 
1,609.2 1,498.8 1,604.7 1,496.2 
In the year, group and company investments with a value of £45.3m were 
transferred from Level 3 to Level 2, as a result of quoted market fund 
valuations derived from observable market prices.
In the prior year, group and company investments with a value of £0.9m 
and £2.9m were transferred from Level 1 to Level 3 respectively, as 
a result of there no longer being any observable market data. In addition, 
the group transferred £5.5m from Level 2 to Level 3 in respect of  
property investments.
Movement in Level 3 financial instruments was as follows:

at the year end (32.3) 118.2 (32.3) 115.6 
Balance at the year end 830.3 751.0 816.8 736.3 
The directors have used several valuation methodologies as prescribed 
in the valuation guidelines to arrive at their best estimate of fair value, 
including the price of recent investments, revenue and earnings multiples 
and recent market transactions where available.
Significant unobservable inputs used in measuring Level 3 financial 
instruments were developed as follows:
• EBITDA multiples represent amounts that market participants would 
use when pricing investments. EBITDA multiples are selected from 
comparable public companies based on geographic location, industry, 
size, target markets and other factors that management consider 
reasonable. The traded multiples for comparable companies are 
determined by dividing the enterprise value of the company by its 
EBITDA. EBITDA multiples ranged from 9 to 17 (2015 – 5 to 12), 
weighted average 10.4 (2015 – 8.3).
• Marketability discounts represent the adjustment to comparable 
market multiples to reflect the illiquidity of the portfolio companies 
relative to the comparable peer group. Management determines the 
discount for lack of marketability based on its judgement, after 
considering market liquidity conditions and company specific factors 
such as the development stage of the portfolio company. Marketability 
discount rates ranged from 23% to 30%, weighted average 26%.
The table below sets out information about Level 3 investments whose 
valuation is based on significant internally developed unobservable inputs 
and those externally developed, either using net assets or an external 
manager’s NAV.

Private equity fund investments, included in Level 3, are valued in 
accordance with the valuation guidelines and are based on information 
provided by the general partners. The general partners’ policy in valuing 
unlisted investments is to carry them at fair value. Similarly, externally 
managed unquoted investment valuations are based on information 
provided by the managers.
23. Share-based payments
The company has an executive share option scheme, which entitles senior 
employees to purchase shares in the company at the market price of the 
shares at the date of grant and on similar terms, subject to service and 
company performance criteria. Under the terms of the scheme, options 
may be exercised between three and ten years after the date of grant, 
although only one-third of the options may be exercised after three years 
from grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming exercisable six years 
after grant. A number of grants have been made under this scheme.
In 2011, shareholders approved a new performance share scheme to 
replace the existing share option scheme as the means of delivering long 
term incentive awards to senior executives. The performance share 
scheme entitles senior executives to receive options over the company’s 
shares which are exercisable at nil-cost, subject to service and 
performance conditions. Nil-cost option awards granted in 2012 may be 
exercised between three and ten years after the date of grant, although 
only two-thirds of the awards may be exercised after three years, with the 
remaining one-third becoming exercisable five years after grant. For 
nil-cost option awards granted in 2013 and 2014, half of the shares 
comprised in the awards may be exercised after three years, and half after 
five years. For nil-cost option awards granted in 2015, one-third of the 
shares comprised in the awards may be exercised after three years, and 
two-thirds after five years.
The company also has a deferred bonus plan, under which senior 
employees compulsorily defer part of their annual bonus, being any 
bonus in excess of 50% of their basic salary for the bonus year, into shares 
and may voluntarily defer up to 50% of their remaining cash bonus into 
shares. The company will match the number of shares comprised in both 
compulsory and voluntary deferral, subject to service and company 
performance criteria.

The options outstanding at 31 March 2016 have an exercise price of

The fair value of services received in return for performance share 
scheme and deferred awards granted was measured indirectly, by 
reference to the share price at the date of grant.
Under the schemes, share options were granted with service and 
non-market performance conditions. Such conditions were not taken 
into account in the fair value measurement of the services received at 
the dates of grant. There were no market conditions associated with 
the share option grants.
The fair value of services received in return for deferred share awards 
was measured directly, by reference to the fair value of services received 
during the period. This was based on the amount of annual bonus that 
was compulsorily and voluntarily deferred in accordance with the rules 
of the company’s deferred bonus plan.

73 Annual report 2016 Caledonia Investments plc  
Principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date (expressed as 
weighted averages) were as follows:
2016 
% 
2015 
% 
Discount rate at the year end 3.4 3.1 
Future salary increases 4.1 4.1 
Future pension increases 3.1 3.1 
RPI price inflation 3.1 3.1 
Mortality rates are assumed to follow the Self-Administered Pension 
Schemes ‘Series 1’ Light tables applicable to each member’s year of birth, 
projected to calendar year 2012 in line with the core CMI scale of 
improvements. Allowance has also been made for further improvements 
in line with CMI core projections with a long term trend of 1.5% pa. Life 
expectancy on retirement in normal health is assumed to be 27 .5 years 
(2015 – 27 .7 years) for males and 28.0 years (2015 – 29.0 years) for 
females who are currently 62 years of age.
Expected contributions to group post-employment benefit plans for the 
year ending 31 March 2017 were £0.4m (2016 – £0.2m).
In the UK, the funding is set on the basis of a triennial funding valuation 
by the actuaries for which the assumptions may differ from those above. 
As a result of these valuations, the group and the scheme trustees agree a 
Schedule of Contributions, which sets out the required contributions from 
the employer and employees for current service. Where the scheme is in 
deficit, the Schedule of Contributions also includes required contributions 
from the employer to eliminate the deficit. The most recent triennial 
valuations were completed in 2015. A summary of the recent funding 
obligations and weighted average duration of the defined benefit 
obligations was as follows:

Sensitivities
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the 
assumptions set out above. The following table summarises the estimated 
increase in defined benefit obligations to a change in individual actuarial 
assumptions, while holding all other assumptions constant. This sensitivity 
analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined 
benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in an assumption would 
occur in isolation, as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
2016 
£m 
2015 
£m 
Reduction in the discount rate of 0.25% 1.5 1.5 
Increase in inflation of 0.25% 1.2 1.2 
Increase in future salary increases of 0.25% 0.1 0.2 
Increase in life expectancy of one year 1.2 1.5 
Risks
The pension schemes typically expose the group to risks such as:
• Investment risk – the schemes hold their investments in equities and 
bonds, the value of which fluctuates, whether caused by factors specific 
to an individual investment, its issuer or factors affecting all instruments 
traded in the market.
• Interest rate risk – the schemes’ liabilities are assessed using market 
rates of interest, based on corporate bond yields, to discount the 
liabilities and are therefore subject to any volatility in the movement 
of the market rate of interest. The net interest income or expense 
recognised in profit or loss is calculated using the market rate 
of interest.
• Inflation risk – a significant proportion of the benefits under the 
schemes are linked to inflation. Although the schemes’ assets are 
expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, 
movements over the short term would increase the schemes’ 
net deficit.
• Mortality risk – in the event that members live longer than assumed, 
the liabilities may turn out to have been understated originally and a 
deficit may emerge if funding has not been adequately provided for the 
increased life expectancy.

statements are sent to shareholders’ registered addresses.

amendment, shareholders should notify Capita Asset Services,

more than one registered holder, under the signature of the first 
named holder.
Post and telephone contact details for Capita Asset Services are 
shown on the opposite page. Capita Asset Services also provide 
an online facility to enable shareholders to manage securely their 
shareholdings via the internet. By registering to use the facility, 
shareholders can access a range of online services, including viewing 
shareholding details, transaction and dividend histories, change 
of address and bank mandate and use of the online proxy voting 
service. The online facility is available at www.capitashareportal.
com.

to buy more shares in the company. You can elect for the dividend 
reinvestment plan online at www.capitashareportal.com, where  
you can view the terms of service, or you can request an application 
form by telephone on 0371 664 0381 or +44 371 664 0381 if calling

www.enrc.com Kazakhstan – A Powerhouse in Central Asia
Since its independence in 1991, the Republic of Kazakhstan has 
emerged as a strong economic force, with average annual GDP growth 
of 9.5% to US$135 billion in 2008 from US$21.6 billion in 1998, 
underpinned by the country’s vast oil, mineral and metal resources. 
The country is geographically well positioned to benefit from the 
rise of a resource-hungry China and the emerging economy of 
Russia, the Republic of Kazakhstan’s largest trade partners.
Building upon this strong foundation, the Government of  
the Republic of Kazakhstan has for some years been taking 
active measures to promote and sustain economic 
growth in more diverse sectors, providing 
additional attractive opportunities for 
foreign investors despite the current 
challenging economic environment. 
It has adopted the ‘Kazakhstan-2030’ 
strategy, which sets out a roadmap 
for the country’s domestic and foreign 
policy, as well as the improvement 
of legal and tax systems.
The natural resources sector is the main 
destination for foreign investment in Kazakhstan 
and will remain a significant contributor into the 
economy of the country. Oil and gas constitute 
more than 60% of Kazakhstan’s total exported 
goods, while the country possesses around 3% 
of the world’s proven coal reserves, more than 
25% of the world’s total uranium reserves and 
about 30% of the world’s chrome reserves.
There are a number of investment opportunities 
outside the extractive sectors of the economy, 
such as energy and transport. The Government 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan supports and 
encourages development of infrastructure projects.  
The country plays a crucial role in the establishment 
of security and stability in Central Asia. The 
Government of Kazakhstan is currently working 
to acquire observer status at the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) and to 
become a member of the World Trade Organisation 
(WTO). In 2010 the Republic of Kazakhstan will 
take over the presidency of the Organisation for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
In order to mitigate the implications of the current 
global financial crisis on the economic and social 
situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan, the 
Government has announced the implementation  
of the Action Plan on Stabilisation of the 
country’s economy and financial system for 
2009–10. The main efforts will be directed to 
support the country’s banks and their lending 
activities. The construction, manufacturing and 
agricultural sectors are also to receive support.

ENRC at a glance
Focused operations
ENRC has established itself  
as one of the world’s leading 
natural resources groups,  
and is well positioned to take  
a leading role in the global 
mining industry. Integrating  
the Republic of Kazakhstan’s 
foremost mining, processing, 
power and logistics operations, 
ENRC is now firmly established 
as a world-class business  
with revenue in 2008 of 
US$6.8 billion, an ongoing 
capex programme that 
invested US$1.3 billion in 
2008 and approximately 
67 ,000 employees. The 
Group’s strategy aims to bridge 
the Group’s current position as  
a leading, diversified natural 
resource Group largely based 
in the Republic of Kazakhstan, 
to its future opportunities  
as a more broadly based 
international mining group.
1 Ferroalloys Division
The Ferroalloys Division’s mining operations comprise 
Kazchrome’s Donskoy GOK and, manganese miner, 
Zhairem GOK, and also includes the Aktobe and Aksu 
ferroalloy plants and a gas-fired power station  
at Aktobe. In addition, in 2008, we acquired Serov,  
a Russian ferroalloys producer, and a stake in Tuoli,  
a ferroalloys producer in China. The Division produces 
and sells high-, medium- and low-carbon ferrochrome 
and other alloys, including ferrosilicochrome, 
ferrosilicomanganese and ferrosilicon, as well as 
chrome and manganese concentrate. The Division sells 
its ferroalloys primarily to steel producers and sells the 
remaining chrome and manganese ore to third party 
ferroalloy producers and the chemical and refractory 
industry. The Ferroalloys Division, according to 
estimates, is the world’s largest ferrochrome producer 
by chrome content, and is at the bottom of the global 
industry cost curve.
2 Iron Ore Division
The Iron Ore Division includes primary 
mining operations that produce iron 
ore, ancillary mining operations that 
produce limestone, dolomite and 
bentonite-clay, an iron ore processing 
plant and a power plant. The Division 
mines and processes iron ore into 
concentrate and pellets for sale 
primarily to steel producers. The Iron 
Ore Division sells much of its iron ore 
to the Russian steel producer, the 
Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, 
under a long-term contract. The Iron 
Ore Division, according to estimates,  
is one of the region’s significant 
exporters of iron ore and is in the 
lowest third of the industry cost curve 
for iron ore pellet production.

3 Alumina and Aluminium Division
The Alumina and Aluminium Division’s assets include 
two bauxite mining units, a limestone mine, an 
alumina refinery and a power station. The new 
aluminium smelter attained its Phase 1 run rate 
capacity of 125 thousand tonnes per annum in Q2 
2008. The Division sells its alumina, which it 
produces from mined bauxite, primarily to the Russian 
aluminium producer, United Company RUSAL (‘Rusal’), 
under a long-term contract, and sells its aluminium 
under an offtake agreement. The Alumina and 
Aluminium Division, according to estimates, is the 
ninth largest supplier of traded alumina by volume  
in the world and is at the lower end of the global 
industry cost curve for both alumina and aluminium.
5 Logistics Division
The Logistics Division provides transportation and logistical services  
to the Group’s primary operating divisions and to third parties. The 
Division’s operations include three core businesses: freight forwarding; 
railway construction and maintenance; and wagon and locomotive 
repair. In addition, the Division operates a transfer and reloading 
terminal on the Republic of Kazakhstan/China border. 
4 Energy Division
The Energy Division is one of the largest 
producers of electricity and coal in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, accounting for 
approximately 15% of the country’s 
recorded electricity production in 2008. 
The Division has a coal-fired power 
station at Aksu. The Division supplies 
electricity and coal primarily to the 
Company’s other Divisions as well as  
to third parties. The Division also 
purchases electricity for resale from 
third parties.

With our production centred in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan we are well 
positioned to extend our strong regional 
presence as the market for natural 
resources continues to shift eastwards 
towards the higher-growth potential of 
China and Russia. Initially our strategy 
was to become a regional champion and 
be recognised as a leading metals and 
mining company. With a strong balance 
sheet and attractive natural resource 
assets becoming available, we have 
broadened our view and accelerated 
the timescale for consideration of 
international opportunities.

Management team > >
The Group’s attractiveness to investors is built on five key factors that 
bridge the current position of ENRC with its aspiration to emerge as  
an international mining group. In addition the Group is supported by  
its cash flow and a strong balance sheet. 
High quality assets. The Group’s asset base includes production 
assets which are at the bottom of the cost curve (ferroalloys and 
alumina) or in the lower third of the cost curve (iron ore pellets  
and aluminium). In addition, the mineral resources are characterised  
by large scale – mine lives of 30 to 40 years for our main products and 
significantly scalable through resources of between two and three 
times. The asset base is represented by what are regarded in the 
industry as, ‘Tier 1 assets’.
Diversified revenue. The revenue base of the Group is broadly spread 
by geography, customer and industry, although with a focus upon steel 
and stainless steel. In addition the revenue base includes secure power 
and logistics. The largest business, the Ferroalloys Division, has only 
26.8% of its revenue from its top 5 customers, whilst the revenue from 
the top customers of the Iron Ore and Alumina and Aluminium Divisions 
are, respectively, 64.1% and 68.3% of the revenue of the Division.
Integrated operations. The Group’s core mining and processing 
businesses are supported by in-house, large-scale energy and logistics 
capabilities. These provide security over the supply and delivery chain 
and, in the case of the Energy Division, low cost power. Together they 
underpin the low cost position of the Group. These are key competitive 
advantages for both the industry and in the Eurasian region.
Growth. The geographical location of the Republic of Kazakhstan, 
adjacent to two key BRIC economies, provides the prospect for future 
strong growth from their demand for infrastructure investment, 
urbanisation and consumption. This opens up the prospect for 
investment in greenfield and brownfield growth and for acquisitions  
in the region. The Group’s core assets expertise can also be carried 
worldwide to strengthen its position in its core businesses.
Management team. Local management in the Republic of Kazakhstan 
has a long history with the assets and has strong technical and 
operational expertise. The Group’s executive management has a long 
association with the assets and the industry. 
In addition the Group’s investment case is underpinned by the relative 
attractions of the Republic of Kazakhstan to international investors 
interested in the Eurasian/CIS region. Most particularly the 
development of commercial laws and taxation, its openness to foreign 
investment and a stable political climate should provide comfort.

We were able to take 
advantage of the growth 
opportunities available in  
the early part of the year and 
to withstand the sudden 
deterioration in the market in 
the autumn. The strength of 
our balance sheet gives us 
resilience and provides us with 
a base from which to grow by 
acquisition. We will evaluate  
all such opportunities with 
great care.”
2008 was an important year for ENRC being the Group’s first full year as 
a listed company. Our inclusion in the FTSE 100 Index in March 2008 
followed from the success of our listing on the London Stock Exchange 
and was a reflection of the efforts of our management and employees 
building up to this outcome. ENRC delivered exceptional results in 2008 
with underlying EBITDA of US$4.2 billion (2007: US$1.9 billion) and 
profit after tax of US$2.7 billion (2007: US$0.8 billion). I would like to 
thank our employees for all their hard work and dedication that made 
this performance possible. 
However, despite the record result, 2008 was a year of mixed fortunes, 
with demand and prices very favourable for most of the year followed 
by a sudden downturn in the autumn. The Group’s management took 
rapid and decisive action to address the change in market conditions. 
The Board feels that it will be some while before the market returns to  
a better balance of demand and supply but our efforts will concentrate 
on retaining our position as a low cost producer, taking full advantage 
of our integrated mining, processing, energy production and logistics 
operations which are well positioned to serve, in particular, the nearby 
growth markets of China and Russia. 
The Board was largely assembled in the run-up to the Initial Public 
Offering and one of the key challenges for a new Board in its first year 
of operation is for the Directors to quickly form a cohesive working unit. 
The Board has made great progress during the year and at the end of 
2008 we engaged external consultants to undertake a full evaluation of 
the Directors’ and the Board’s overall performance. The findings were 
positive and have provided us with a firm basis from which to continue 
to strengthen both our governance processes and the Board as a whole 
has rapidly coalesced since then. 
During the current economic uncertainty it is important that the Board 
provides robust leadership. In 2008 the wide range of experience of  
our Directors has provided a strong platform from which to guide and 
support the Group’s senior management team as it addresses the 
challenges of managing a public listed company and during a period of 
major economic turmoil. 
Strategy
A key responsibility of the Board is to define the Group’s strategy. The 
Board, in response to the current opportunities available to the Group, 
has broadened its view on potential value enhancing acquisition 
prospects. This is made possible by our relatively strong balance sheet 
and earnings potential. The five strategic goals of the Group are:
To maintain and improve on our low-cost operations. > >
To continue expansion and development of the existing reserves > >
and capacity.
To add value and customer diversity by expanding our product > >
portfolio.
To expand our asset portfolio and footprint in the natural resources > >
sector, both within the region and worldwide.
To commit to high standards of corporate responsibility, with > >
particular reference to health and safety. 
The broadening of our acquisitions strategy results from the attractive 
valuations for natural resources assets offered by the current economic 
environment. The Board will carefully assess all opportunities to 
ensure that they offer value accretion to all shareholders and fully 
utilise and broaden the Group’s capabilities.
The strategy is a balanced and flexible combination of enhancing 
existing assets, organic expansion and acquisitions. The strategy aims 
to bridge the Group’s current position as a leading, diversified natural 
resource group largely based in the Republic of Kazakhstan, with  
its aspiration to become a more international mining group. Within  
the strategy is an optionality that enables the Group to respond to 
conditions and opportunities. Growth in shareholder value is achieved 
over time by achieving a higher sustained operational growth rate  
by the businesses which should then be reflected in the share price  
and dividend, as benchmarked against our peer mining companies. 
Management and shareholder interests are aligned through 
appropriate incentives linked to the delivery of value for shareholders.

Our aspirations to grow internationally have been reflected in our 
acquisitions of Serov in Russia and a 50% interest in Tuoli in China, 
both ferrochrome operations, and a 50% interest in BML, which is 
developing an iron ore deposit in Brazil. Since the year end our desire 
to grow in the Republic of Kazakhstan has been demonstrated by our 
acquisition of a 25% interest in Shubarkol, a major semi-coke and 
thermal coal producer and an important supplier to our operations, 
with an option to purchase the remaining 75%.
The proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and our strong cash flow  
in 2008 enabled us to plan major capital expenditure and to make 
acquisitions. We still enjoy a very strong balance sheet, but our plans 
will be tempered by market conditions which, while impacting our cash 
flow on the one hand, should also provide opportunities to make well 
priced acquisitions on the other. We will also press hard to achieve cost 
reductions in our business to keep our competitive edge and to offset 
the relatively high levels of inflation experienced in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan. 
Corporate governance
High standards of corporate governance continue to be a key area of 
focus for the Board. We continue to monitor the Group’s performance 
against established standards so as to ensure that the proper level  
of oversight is provided in order to give the best possible assurances  
to shareholders and other stakeholders. We have very good working 
relationships with our Founder Shareholders and with the Government 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan, both of which are a source of strength 
for the Group. 
In July 2008, the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan replicated 
the minority ownership model it has in ENRC by acquiring a 15% stake 
in Kazakhmys in a share swap exchange for 7.7% of ENRC. Kazakhmys 
subsequently acquired further shares in the market and is now our 
largest shareholder with a 26% holding. However, as a competitor for 
resources in the Republic of Kazakhstan, we do not believe that it is in 
the interest of all shareholders that Kazakhmys should have a seat on 
the Board of ENRC. Since we run our businesses completely separately 
Kazakhmys has no significant influence over the ENRC strategic or 
operating decision making processes. 
Succession
The Board is pleased to announce that Dr Johannes Sittard, Chief 
Executive Officer of the Group, has agreed to extend his contract  
of employment and will remain with the Group up to 30 September 
2010. The Board has initiated the process of finding the successor  
to Dr Sittard and is seeking to recruit his replacement by the end  
of 2009 in order to facilitate an orderly handover to the new Chief 
Executive Officer.
The Board also announces that Mr Miguel Perry, Chief Financial Officer 
of the Group, has given notice of his intention to leave the Group. 
Miguel Perry will step down as Chief Financial Officer and from the 
Board and will leave the Group with effect from 30 June 2009. Following 
the Group’s successful Initial Public Offering, in December 2007, and 
its first full year as a public limited company, Miguel Perry is leaving  
in order to be able to further develop his career, building on his 
experience of preparing a company for a public offering and the 
success he has achieved. The Board would like to thank Miguel Perry 
for his valuable contribution to the Company over the last two years.  
It is the Board’s intention to appoint as his replacement a suitable 
external candidate for the role of Chief Financial Officer. The process  
is well underway and a further announcement is expected to be made 
in the next few weeks.
Outlook
Despite the current uncertainties, we believe that the Group is uniquely 
well-placed to benefit once stability returns to the global economy.  
Our focus for the coming year is to ensure that our strategy continues  
to deliver value to all our shareholders.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
“2008 was a record year for  
the Group. We believe that  
our response to the economic 
downturn will stand us in good 
stead to manage through 2009. 
Most importantly our focus on 
cost management, coupled with 
the strategic location of our 
assets, will ensure that we are 
well positioned to capitalise on 
expected future growth in China 
and Russia. Additionally, our 
strong balance sheet provides 
us with the opportunity to 
exploit value-enhancing 
acquisition opportunities. ”
During the first nine months of 2008 the Group’s financial and 
operational results were outstanding, supported by strong demand  
and high commodity prices for our major products as well as the 
management’s focus on the control of costs. The results reflect the 
value of the Group’s high quality assets, our integrated energy and 
logistics capabilities and strategic location.
Whilst we had anticipated a slowdown, the experience of Q4 2008 was 
far swifter and much greater than we or the industry had anticipated, as 
the travails of the financial sector were transmitted to businesses and 
consumers around the world. As the downturn took effect we kept our 
business operations under review. We responded quickly to match 
supply with the reduced demand from our stainless steel and steel 
customers, to limit inventory buildup and to maintain the advantages of 
our low cost position. We believe that this best secures our financial 
position and sustains the advantage we derive from being a low cost 
producer. The Group’s record results in 2008 are, nonetheless, 
tempered by the more challenging environment continuing into 2009.
Management response to the downturn
The steps we took to address the downturn in Q4 2008 were: 
We announced immediate production cutbacks in the ongoing > >
operations of our Ferroalloys and Iron Ore Divisions of,  
respectively, approximately 35% and 50% (referenced to the  
2007 sales volumes).
We reduced staff costs, with a 10% pay cut for senior management, > >
the suspension of sub-contractors, reduced working hours, job 
shares, unpaid leave and salary and hiring freezes. We managed to 
implement these measures without having to significantly reduce 
the workforce, which will stand us in good stead to rebuild output 
when the environment improves.
We secured a reduction in raw material input costs as a result of the > >
economic turndown.
We reviewed our capital expenditure programme with priority being > >
given to replacement and productivity enhancing projects, limiting 
the active and planned in-progress projects to US$2.4 billion. 
Expansion projects have been delayed and will be reviewed  
as to their timing with the flexibility to reinstate them when 
economic conditions allow. We are also reviewing opportunities  
to reduce delivery times, reduce costs and cut expenditure with 
equipment suppliers. 
Our businesses remain low cost occupying the lower third or in the  
case of ferrochrome, at the bottom of the cost curve. This remains a  
key advantage that we will focus on maintaining and, where possible, 
reinforcing, through the present downturn. Crucial to our success is 
that our businesses remain underpinned by the security of our logistics 
and low cost energy supply. 
2008 Performance
In the full year 2008, Group revenue increased 66.2%, to US$6,823 
million (2007: US$4,106 million). The inclusion of Serov, from Q2 2008, 
Tuoli, from Q4 2008, and new aluminium sales, together added 
revenues of US$782 million. Excluding these new businesses, revenue 
(refer note 36) grew 47.2%, with the increase driven largely by higher 
average sales prices notably for ferrochrome and iron ore, partially 
offset by lower year-on-year volumes, in the Ferroalloys and Iron  
Ore Divisions. Total costs (excluding exceptional items) rose 18.8%,  
to US$2,973 million (2007: US$2,503 million). Excluding the new 
businesses, total costs increased 5.6%. Cost increases, particularly  
in the core operating divisions, were driven by labour and materials 
(reductants and fuel). Cost pressures abated significantly in Q4 2008, 
but in addition we took a number of actions to limit labour costs and  
to maximise our operational flexibility. Underlying EBITDA increased 
116.9%, to US$4,161 million (2007: US$1,918 million) whilst profit 
after tax increased 229.7%, to US$2,684 million (2007: US$814 
million). Earnings per share (before exceptional items) rose 111.3%, to 
205 US cents (2007: 97 US cents). Our first full year dividend (paid and 
proposed) amounts to 31 US cents per share; a payout ratio (dividend 
per share as a proportion of earnings per share) of 15%.

The Group’s performance was underpinned by a steady increase in 
overall production volumes and higher sales for the first nine months  
of 2008. There was a significant downturn in Q4 2008 when we 
announced production cuts in the Ferroalloys and Iron Ore Divisions, 
but for the full year 2008 ferrochrome production (excluding Serov  
and Tuoli) was down only 6.8% whilst primary iron ore concentrate  
fell 7.8%. Production continued to grow in the Alumina and Aluminium 
Division with alumina production at its new target capacity of 1.6 
million tonnes per annum and with 106 thousand tonnes from the new 
aluminium smelter. The Ferroalloys Division, contributing some 67.0% 
(2007: 59.4%) of underlying EBITDA, benefited from strong pricing, as 
well as the first-time contribution of Serov, with overall revenue almost 
doubling and significantly outpacing growth. The Iron Ore Division, 
contributing 22.1% (2007: 24.5%) of underlying EBITDA, was driven by 
strong pricing and good control of costs. The Alumina and Aluminium 
Division, contributing 7.1% (2007: 11.2%) of underlying EBITDA, saw 
total costs rise ahead of revenues due to a weak aluminium price and 
the build up of the new aluminium smelter. The Energy Division’s 
underlying EBITDA contributed 4.3% (2007: 5.6%), benefiting from 
stronger third-party coal sales and better power and coal pricing 
partially offset by an increased proportion of internal power 
consumption by the new smelter. The Logistics Division, contributing 
1.2% (2007: 2.3%) of underlying EBITDA, was impacted by a decline  
in transportation volumes and reduced repairs business.
We maintained a strong balance sheet with gross available funds  
of US$2,768 million (31 December 2007: US$2,921 million) and 
outstanding debt of US$727 million (2007: US$1,424 million). 
Operating cash flow was very strong, increasing 156.3%, to US$2,766 
million (2007: US$1,079 million). We see our funding position as a key 
competitive advantage in the present uncertain times and will continue 
to manage this position prudently.
Health and safety
Health and safety is a key focus for the Group and in 2008 we 
intensified our efforts toward improvement. The Group achieved a 
reduction in fatalities to 9 in 2008, from 15 in the prior year. Any deaths 
are regrettable to us and we express our condolences to the families 
involved. The number of injuries rose to 75 (2007: 63; 2008 exc Serov: 
71). The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) rose to 0.68 (2007: 
0.58; 2008 exc Serov: 0.67) per one million hours worked, reflecting 
improved reporting but also increased injury severity and greater lost 
worktime. We were pleased by the initial response to our review of 
workplaces where protection is required, stricter safety requirements 
being enforced on staff and the retraining of safety managers. In 2008 
safety reporting and procedures were reviewed by international 
consultants, DuPont, and a new safety management system is now 
being implemented. The Group has adopted an aspiration of ‘zero 
injuries’ on which to focus its drive for an improved approach to health 
and safety.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in 2008 amounted to US$1.3 billion (2007: US$0.9 
billion), significantly below our original expectations of US$1.7 billion 
for the year. In H1 2008 capital expenditure was broadly spread across 
our Divisions as we invested to build up our growth profile; the 
highlights of 2008 were the aluminium smelter achieving its Phase 1 
run-rate capacity well ahead of schedule and the refurbishment of a 
power generator.
 
To continue to support the Group’s strategic plan, priority has been 
given to replacement and efficiency projects, amounting to US$2.4 
billion in total. These projects are important to sustaining the Group’s 
relative cost position advantage. The projects that have been delayed, 
amounting to some US$4.3 billion, continue to be a key part of the 
Group’s strategy for our Kazakhstan businesses, however, their timing 
is dependent on future demand.
The current approved ‘in progress’ capital expenditure programme 
includes: 
Ferroalloys Division – the construction of three new Direct Current > >
(DC) furnaces at Aktobe with a capacity of 440 thousand tonnes per 
annum. These will be a mixture of replacement and new production 
with a net increase in production of approximately 170 thousand 
tonnes. The introduction of new furnaces will be staggered to reflect 
market demand. The DC furnaces should enhance productivity by 
their scale, enabling a reduced exposure to coke and allow the 
greater use of chrome ore fines.
Alumina and Aluminium Division – the additional 125 thousand > >
tonnes Phase 2 capacity of the aluminium smelter, due to 
commence production in 2010.
Energy Division – the construction of an additional 325MW turbine > >
to facilitate growth in other Divisions, principally the new aluminium 
smelter, while maintaining a net long position in electricity and 
providing strategic growth optionality.
Logistics Division – the ‘China Gateway’ Project. The project,  > >
for which we won a tender from the Government of the Republic  
of Kazakhstan, is of strategic significance to both the country  
and the Group. The increased capacity will enable us to better  
serve the market in North-West China for which we anticipate  
longer term growth.
For 2009 project capital expenditure is expected to amount to 
approximately US$0.6 billion, with a further US$0.4 billion for capital 
repairs and other projects.
Acquisitions
We completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Serov 
group and certain related entities (‘Serov’) in early April 2008. Serov  
is a ferroalloy producer in Russia. The total acquisition consideration 
amounted to US$210 million. The transaction built up our position in 
low- and medium-carbon ferrochrome, and we acquired additional 
high-carbon capacity. In mid October 2008 the Group announced  
the completion of the acquisition of a 50% stake in Tuoli, a Chinese 
ferroalloys producer, for approximately US$15 million. The acquisition 
of a 50% interest in BML for US$306 million was announced in early 
May 2008. BML is focused on the development of an iron ore deposit  
in the Bahia State of Brazil. The bankable feasibility study for the BML 
iron ore deposit project is expected to be completed in Q3 2009.
In February 2009, we announced the acquisition of a 25% interest  
in Shubarkol Komir JSC (‘Shubarkol’), from a related party, a major 
semi-coke and thermal coal producer based in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, for a cash consideration of US$200 million less 25%  
of net debt. Shubarkol is one of the Republic of Kazakhstan’s largest 
semi-coke and thermal coal producers, producing some 6.1 million 
tonnes of coal in 2007 and with 1,419 million tonnes of measured and 
indicated coal resources within its coal lease. ENRC has entered into  
an off-take agreement with Shubarkol, secured a seat on Shubarkol’s 
Board and has a right of first refusal, combined with a call option, over 
all or part of the remaining shares in Shubarkol. We believe that the 
acquisition of this stake strengthens the integrated business model 
through securing a reliable and cost effective supply of semi-coke and 
relatively high quality thermal coal, enhancing the Group’s position as 
a low cost producer.
Acquisitions are an important element of our strategy and are intended 
to build further on the low cost base of the business. Leveraging our 
knowledge of minerals extraction as well as our integrated energy and 
logistics capacity, the Group will look to develop its presence in other 
natural resources in the Eurasian region and elsewhere in the world.
Taxation
In December 2008 the Republic of Kazakhstan introduced a new Tax 
Code which took effect from 1 January 2009, providing us with greater 
clarity and predictability. Broadly the new Tax Code is designed to 
encourage greater investment in value-added processing by miners in 
the Republic of Kazakhstan. The new Tax Code has three key changes:

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement continued
a phased reduction in the rate of Corporate Income Tax (‘CIT’) from  
30% in 2008 to 20% in 2009, 17.5% in 2010 and, 15% from 2011; the 
introduction of new Minerals Extraction Taxes (‘MET’) with a specific 
rate for each type of mineral, broadly phased to offset the reduction in 
CIT; and revisions to the basis of calculating Excess Profits Tax (‘EPT’). 
The impact of the new Tax Code, going forward, is as we expected; if all 
of the changes were to be incorporated into the 2008 tax charge, on a 
pro forma basis, the impact would be an additional 1 to 2 percentage 
points on the underlying effective tax rate of 33.5%. ENRC’s continued 
commitment to invest in value-added processing in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan should enable us to optimise our future effective tax rate. 
In the short term, in the light of the current environment, we are 
discussing with the Government the possibility of partial or whole 
exemptions from MET.
Industry overview
We expect the outlook for mining and metals across our core 
commodities to remain positive over the longer term. However, in the 
short term, the industry faces considerable uncertainty and business 
sentiment remains appropriately cautious. This is already widely 
evident in the postponement or cancellation of projects by our industry 
peers, cutbacks in capacity in response to weak demand conditions 
and with many spot prices at or below the cost levels of the marginal 
producers. In most commodities, production capacity remains well in 
excess of demand and inventories are high. We expect that in 2009 
discussions for negotiated price commodities will be more protracted. 
Near-term conditions should be gradually eased by the range of 
extensive fiscal stimulus packages implemented by governments 
worldwide. Nonetheless, we believe that the world economy is unlikely 
to see a sustained improvement in industrial production until credit 
conditions ease, the cost of capital declines and after substantial 
private and public sector deleveraging.
Stainless steel production in 2008 amounted to about 26.6 million 
tonnes (2007: 28.5 million tonnes) and may ease further in 2009. 
Downside risk may be limited, as industry ferrochrome capacity has 
been much reduced and there is limited inventory, which should help 
lower cost producers such as ENRC. Iron ore production will be similarly 
depressed and our advantage is our access to the North-West Chinese 
markets, however, there are few signs of recovery evident in the 
Russian steel industry on which we have traditionally focused. Alumina 
and aluminium will remain constrained by high inventory levels, 
however, our location, low cost position and limited scale should help 
our position within the Russian market.
We hold a positive view on the long-term growth prospects for the 
Chinese and Russian economies, which supports ENRC’s strategic

location; China in particular will be key to any turnaround in the 
demand for industrial metals. The potential growth in demand in Russia 
and China, for ferroalloys, iron ore, alumina and aluminium, and in 
other metals is significant, based on their populations, urbanisation 
and infrastructure requirements. The prospects for ENRC in these 
markets are enhanced by structural capacity shortages, particularly  
in China, that are expected to emerge with an economic recovery.  
The Republic of Kazakhstan, and ENRC as a leading company in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, are strategically well positioned to seize  
the opportunities in these key markets over the longer term.
Outlook for 2009
One of management’s key areas of focus has been working capital.  
We have successfully managed to control inventory levels and have 
avoided any significant issues with the recovery of receivables.
As indicated above, we expect that market conditions will remain 
determined largely by demand factors. Whilst sales volumes so far  
in 2009 have been better than expected, it is not clear that this is 
sustainable. Some contractual sales volumes have been reduced to 
date, and this trend may continue in light of overall market conditions. 
We do not expect that we will have certainty on any sustained general 
recovery before 2010 at the earliest.
The Q4 2008 production cutback in Ferroalloys will be maintained at 
35% with iron ore at 40%, at least through H1 2009. We are continually 
reassessing the production plans for the businesses in the light of  
the weak global economic situation and end customer demand but,  
at this time, are comfortable with the scale of the cutbacks we have 
announced, however, their duration is uncertain. We also anticipate 
that pressure on prices will remain. In the present environment 
underlying cost growth pressures are abating somewhat, which should 
help the Group’s efforts to control costs. In 2009 the comparative 
stability of the Energy Division is likely to be evident with a relatively 
more secure demand for coal and power. 
The 25% devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge in February 2009 has 
provided some benefit as a large part of our costs are incurred in tenge. 
The devaluation will help ensure that we maintain our competitive cost 
position. Any benefit from the devaluation will in part be offset by the 
foreign exchange forward hedge we have in place, as well as increased 
cost inflation and the growing incidence of pegging some supply prices 
to the US dollar.
We have made the decision to reaffirm our dividend policy of a payout 
ratio of 15%–20% of earnings, until we have better visibility of the 
business cycle.
We believe that ENRC has all of the essential ingredients for managing 
through the current challenging environment and for future success, 
based on our proximity to key markets, our low costs and growth 
opportunities. Given the current operating environment, we are 
focused on the tight management of cash and of the balance sheet, 
rigorous control of costs in our businesses, the pursuit of a range of 
asset productivity enhancements and replacement, and selective 
acquisition opportunities. All of these are directed towards 
underpinning the performance of the business, providing a solid 
platform for growth and delivering value for all our shareholders.
Our success is ultimately a credit to the operational management team 
in the businesses and to all our employees, to whom we offer our 
sincere thanks for their continuing efforts and for their fortitude and 
accommodation as we manage through the current challenging times. 
We would not have been able to manage through the downturn as well 
without the cooperation of our workforce with whom we have a good 
working relationship.

The Group’s strategy is built on its mission ‘to achieve growth as a 
leading natural resources group and to enhance overall value for  
its shareholders’. 
The strategy is a balanced and flexible combination of: enhancing 
existing assets; organic growth; and acquisitions. The strategy  
aims to bridge the Group’s current position as a leading, diversified 
natural resource group largely based in the Republic of Kazakhstan, to 
its aspiration as a more broadly based international mining  
group. Within the strategy is an optionality that enables the Group  
to respond to growth opportunities and the current challenging 
environment. Growth in shareholder value is achieved over time  
by a higher sustained performance which should then be reflected  
in the share price and dividend as benchmarked against our peer 
mining companies. Management and shareholder interests are 
aligned through appropriate incentives linked to the delivery of  
value for shareholders.
In response to the more challenging economic environment the 
Group’s strategy for its capital expenditure was refocused in Q4 2008 
on replacement and productivity enhancement of existing assets, 
most particularly those projects which reinforce or strengthen  
the Group’s large-scale, low-cost, long-life assets, and exploit its 
strategic location between Russia and China. 
The overall capital expenditure programme, as outlined at the  
2008 Half-year results, remains part of the strategic objective.  
The Group’s current production assets have been at or near  
capacity, and growing capacity over the longer term, by brownfield  
or greenfield growth, is key. In addition there are great opportunities 
for the Group to develop further its value added processing of  
mineral resources. 
In the current economic environment the Group has broadened  
its M&A growth strategy to cover the natural resources sector 
worldwide. This shift recognises that the environment offers 
significant opportunities that the Group, with its strong balance 
sheet, should look at provided that they meet our low cost criteria, 
offer at least our hurdle rate of return and are something that fits  
with our capabilities. Our aspirations for the Eurasian region and for 
core assets worldwide remain but today’s availability of attractively 
valued natural resource assets offers significant opportunities for  
all shareholders and our strategy is flexible enough for us to capitalise 
on this situation.

Business Review
Key Performance Indicators
Description Indicator
Underlying EBITDA is a measure of the underlying profitability of the 
business and as such reflects the cash profits of the business. ENRC 
strives to achieve high margins by taking advantage of its low cost 
base and the advantages of its vertically integrated operations.
EPS tells us how much attributable profit per share is available  
for distribution to shareholders through dividends. Our dividend 
policy was reaffirmed by the Board with a commitment to maintain  
a payout ratio of 15%–20% of earnings until visibility of the business 
cycle improves.
ROCE measures how efficiently the Group’s capital is being used.
Our business is long term and our operations are, by their nature, 
often in remote areas. In a number of towns we are the principal 
employer and we recognise the key economic and social 
responsibilities that we have as a result. We have established ENRC 
Komek, a corporate fund, to focus our community social investment 
within the Republic of Kazakhstan. The investment we make in 
community social projects is an indication of the balanced attitude 
that we have to the way we do business.
2008 shows a reduction in the number of fatalities suffered. The  
Board has adopted an aspiration of zero work-related fatal injuries  
to focus our efforts.
The lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) rose to 0.68 reflecting 
increased injury severity and greater lost worktime but also improved 
reporting. We were pleased by the initial response to our review of 
workplaces where protection is required, stricter safety requirements 
being required of staff and the retraining of safety managers. In 2008 
safety reporting and procedures were reviewed by international 
consultants, DuPont, and a new safety management system is now 
being implemented.

Product costs per unit for the Ferroalloys and Iron Ore Divisions’ 
products were adversely impacted by the Q4 production cutbacks. 
Most of our cost base was impacted by the fact that during the  
year the Kazakhstani consumer price index inflation was running 
above 10% only easing to 9.5% in Q4. Price increases for (inter 
alia) fuel, coke, soda ash, explosives and labour costs resulted in 
our unit costs being significantly higher than in 2007. 
Management has been working on measures to reduce costs 
which have started to show benefits in 2009.

Risk Management
Introduction
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of Risk Management 
and Internal Control and for reviewing effectiveness in operation. This 
review is performed annually and relies on work performed by the Audit 
Committee with respect to the Group’s compliance with the Turnbull 
Guidance. The assessment of risks has been in place during 2008 and 
up to and including the date of approval of the 2008 Annual Report and 
full financial statements. Further details are presented in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 59.

Key Business Risks and the responses by executive management
This section sets out the Key Business Risks being faced by the Group 
and the ways in which executive management have responded to  
these risks.
Slowdown in the growth of the economies of key customers 
The Group’s sales of products from some Divisions are predominantly 
to customers based in Russia and China. In 2008, the Group made in 
total 54.0% of its sales revenue to these countries. The Group made 
31.6% of its ferroalloy sales, 93.1% of its iron ore sales and 62.4% of
its alumina and aluminium sales to customers in Russia and China. 
These economies experienced high rates of growth in the first half of 
2008 but these levels of growth are not expected in 2009. 
The significant slowdown in the global economy as a whole and the 
consequential impact on the export led growth of the economies  
of these countries has brought about a decrease in demand for  
the Group’s products and may also create downward pressure on  
sales prices.
Response to the slowdown in the growth of the economies of  
key customers 
The steps the Group took to address the downturn were: 
Production was cut back in the Ferroalloys and Iron Ore Divisions > >
by, respectively, approximately 35% and 50%. 
Staff costs were reduced by the suspension of sub-contractors, > >
reduced shifts, job shares, unpaid leave and salary and hiring 
freezes, initially on a temporary basis.
Reductions to the costs of raw materials and other Inputs to the > >
production processes were secured.
The capital expenditure programme was reviewed with priority > >
being given to replacement and productivity enhancing projects 
with other projects deferred.

whenever they may arise, for example when the new Tax Code in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan was enacted in December 2008.
Health, safety and environmental exposures and regulations 
The nature of the industry in which we operate means our activities  
are highly regulated by health, safety and environmental laws. As 
regulatory standards and expectations are constantly developing,  
we may be exposed to increased compliance costs and unforeseen 
environmental remediation expenses. 
Response to risks related to health, safety and environmental 
exposures and regulations 
The Corporate Responsibility Review is set out on pages 50 to 55.
Unexpected natural and operational catastrophes 
Our operational processes and geographic locations may be subject  
to operational accidents. Our operations may also be subject to 
unexpected natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and flooding. 
Existing insurance arrangements may not provide cover for all of the 
costs that may arise from such events. The impact of these events 
could lead to disruptions in production and loss of facilities adversely 
affecting our financial results.
Response to the risk of unexpected natural and  
operational catastrophes 
We have commissioned external consultants to complete a detailed 
review of the adequacy of the Group’s insurance contracts and to 
advise on the implementation of more effective contingency plans  
to mitigate the potential impact of these risks. 
Country risks
The Group’s businesses could be adversely affected by any new 
regulations which are introduced by the Government of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, such as:
Controls on imports, exports and sales prices. > >
Terms of mining and other licences. > >
Restrictions on the remittance of funds from the Republic of > >
Kazakhstan.
New forms or rates of taxation, duties and royalties. > >
In addition, any increased requirements relating to regulatory, 
environmental and social approvals could result in significant delays in 
the construction of new investment projects, and may adversely impact 
the economics of those projects, the expansion of existing operations 
and the financial results of the Group’s operations.
Response to country risks 
Senior management of the Group’s operations in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan are engaged in an active dialogue with the Government of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan and with local authorities in many regions 
and towns, as well as directly with the Group’s workforce, to fully 
reflect the Group’s responsibilities to these stakeholders.
The Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan is also a significant 
shareholder in the Group and two representatives of the Government 
are non-executive Directors and attend Board meetings. 
Through these different types of engagement with the Government of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan the Group is able to anticipate likely 
changes in regulations and to put in place plans to respond to changes

Credit default of key customers 
The impact of the current economic downturn has been to place 
increased financial pressure on the Group’s customers and on their 
ability to pay amounts due to the Group in accordance with agreed 
terms of trade.
Response to the risk of credit default by key customers 
The Group continues to maintain its relationships with all its key 
customers but also has plans to develop new customer relationships in 
Russia, China and elsewhere in the region which will have the effect of 
diversifying customer default risk.
The Group maintains credit insurance against the risk of default by 
major customers, where insurance is available, and reviews the 
adequacy of cover regularly. In recent months the availability of credit 
insurance, particularly in respect of Russian customers, has been 
significantly reduced.
The Group sets credit limits and payment terms for all its major 
customers and monitors compliance with these on a daily basis and 
reports weekly to the Chief Financial Officer on developments in 
amounts receivable from customers and average days outstanding.  
If customers fail to comply with credit limits or payment terms the 
shipment of goods may be suspended until a satisfactory payment 
schedule has been received from the customer.
Human resource talent pool 
The Group’s growth and future success depend significantly upon its 
continued ability to attract, retain and motivate key senior 
management. It also depends on the ability to manage succession 
plans effectively. Despite the significant decreases in commodity 
prices and the deferral of expansion projects there still exists an 
increasing demand for skilled personnel and contractors across a range 
of disciplines. An inability of the Group to attract and retain such 
people may adversely impact our ability to adequately resource 
development projects and fill roles and vacancies in existing 
operations. It may also adversely impact the costs and schedule of 
continuing projects.
Response to human resource talent pool risks
We have continued to provide stimulating and challenging 
opportunities for existing and new employees and this is attractive  
for prospective employees . Recently this has had to be balanced with 
the need to manage our cost base during the current economic crisis.  
The Board are committed to the completion of the recruitment 
processes to appoint a new Chief Financial Officer in the short term  
and a new Chief Executive Officer in advance of Dr Sittard’s retirement 
in September 2010. 
Commodity prices 
The Group generates most of its revenue from the sale of commodities, 
primarily ferrochrome, chrome ore, iron ore, alumina and aluminium.  
Historically, the prices for these products have been volatile and have 
fluctuated widely in response to changes in supply and demand, 
market uncertainty, the performance of the global or regional 
economies and cyclicality in industries that purchase these products. 
This was particularly evident in the last quarter of 2008 and first 
quarter of 2009 when prices fell substantially.
These external factors and the volatility of the commodity markets 
make it difficult to estimate future prices. A substantial or extended 
decline in commodity prices would materially and adversely affect  
the Group’s businesses and the financial results and cash flows of 
operations.
Response to commodity price risks 
The Group monitors market prices, global sales volumes and internal 
levels of inventory of key commodities to help inform production and 
sales planning decisions and avoid surplus inventory.
The management of the Sales and Marketing business produce  
regular forecasts of the sales volumes and prices for each of the 
Group’s commodities and discuss and agree appropriate production 
and distribution plans with the management of the Group’s  
operating companies.
The Group does not hedge its exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the 
prices of its commodity products.

Cost pressures arising from reduced production volumes 
In the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 the Group has 
significantly reduced the volume of production in its major operations 
to a level which is consistent with expectations of global sales volumes 
of the relevant commodities in the first half of 2009.
Our production cutbacks have resulted in an increase in fixed costs per 
unit of production. The recent devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge 
against the US dollar, though initially favourable to our cost base, may 
also result in inflationary pressure in the medium term in the Republic 
of Kazakhstan.
Response to the risk of cost pressures arising from reduced  
production volumes 
The Group’s businesses remain relatively low cost typically occupying 
the lower third of the cost curve. This remains a key advantage that  
we will focus on maintaining and, where possible, reinforcing, through 
the present downturn. Crucial to our success is that our businesses 
remain underpinned by the security of our logistics and low cost  
energy supply. 
The Group has secured reductions in staff costs, raw material input 
costs and in many other costs of production and distribution. 
Cost control continues to be an area of great importance for the Group 
and one where action plans to manage reduced production volumes 
have been the subject of very significant management focus in the  
last six months and this will continue throughout 2009.
Procurement 
The Group acquires a significant amount of goods and services from 
suppliers, contractors and other third parties for both operational and 
capital expenditure purposes. In making these acquisitions the Group 
runs the risk that goods or services may not be acquired on the most 
economical terms from suppliers and contractors.
Response to procurement risk 
The Group has issued policy documents and control procedures which 
are applicable to all types of procurement. These procedures seek to 
manage procurement risks by:
the implementation of tendering procedures for all significant > >
contracts;
the creation of an open access ENRC KZ procurement internet > >
website;
the development of a list of approved suppliers; > >
the restriction of the use of intermediaries; and > >
the application of rigorous budgetary cost control. > >
In addition the Group has engaged Boston Consulting Group to carry 
out a wide ranging review of the Group’s procurement procedures and 
to make recommendations for improvements.

Capital projects 
The Group’s mining operations are capital intensive. The development 
and exploitation of mineral reserves and the acquisition of machinery 
and equipment require substantial capital expenditure. 
Capital projects are subject to a number of risks:
The assumptions about future commodity prices, on which the > >
economic case for the investment was based, may prove to be  
too optimistic.
The resources required to complete the project may not be available > >
in the right volume or at the right quality or price.
The implementation of the project may prove to be more complex or > >
technically difficult than originally envisaged and, in extreme cases, 
may not be possible to complete.
The project may be completed but may be delivered late and/or at a > >
significantly higher cost than planned.
Response to capital project risks 
The Group has redesigned the policies which are to be adopted before 
a capital project may obtain approval to proceed. In particular the 
technical and economic aspects of each significant project are subject 
to a detailed feasibility phase of review and those projects that pass 
this review are then further assessed by management.
All existing projects are subject to scrutiny by management at a 
quarterly review meeting to ensure that the bases and assumptions, on 
which the project was originally approved, continue to hold.
The Group continued the approved capital expenditure programme 
until the last quarter of 2008 when, in the light of the changing 
economic conditions, the Group reviewed all its capital expenditure 
plans, with priority being given to continuing with replacement 
investment or efficiency projects. The Group continues to re-evaluate 
the timing of expansion projects and may consider deferrals to the 
planned schedules of expenditure. The Group also plans to use this 
period to seek ways to reduce project costs. 
The Group continues to believe that the relatively low product costs of 
its core commodities, derived from the quality of the Group’s mining 
assets and its captive energy supply, underpin the long-term capital 
projects of the Group.
Integration of acquired businesses
Some of our future growth will stem from acquisitions. There are 
numerous risks which may be encountered in business combinations, 
and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses 
which could negatively impact our financial condition and results  
of operations.
Response to risks in the integration of acquired businesses
We have increased the number, seniority and experience of our 
in-house mergers and acquisitions team and employ external advice on 
occasions to supplement our in-house expertise. For each acquisition 
which the Group has made and for all prospective acquisitions a 
member of the Group’s management team is appointed to take 
responsibility for the integration of the acquired business.
Financial counterparty default 
The Group has significant surplus funds, arising from IPO proceeds  
and from operational cash flows, which it invests with counterparties 
primarily in the UK and the Republic of Kazakhstan. In making  
these investments the Group runs the risk that a counterparty may 
default on the repayment of the invested funds when they fall due.  
At 31 December 2008 the amounts invested with financial institutions 
were US$2,687million.
Response to financial counterparty default risk 
To minimise the risk of the default of a financial counterparty with 
which the Group has invested surplus funds strict criteria for 
investment have been adopted and were approved by the Board in 
December 2008.
Investments may only be made with counterparties which are included 
on a Permitted Investment list. Individual counterparty exposure limits 
are based on published credit ratings or, where these are not available, 
by an internal assessment of the counterparty’s financial strength.
On a monthly basis the Group Treasury Committee reviews the credit 
ratings of all approved counterparties and may propose adjustments  
to the maximum credit limits. Any changes to credit limits require the 
approval of the Chief Financial Officer.
A consolidated counterparty exposure report is recalculated on a 
weekly basis and a monthly report is produced by the Group Treasurer 
for review by the Chief Financial Officer and is also included in the 
Treasury report to each meeting of the Board.
Foreign exchange rate exposure 
The presentational currency of the Group is the US dollar and the 
majority of sales are US dollar denominated. However significant costs 
which are incurred in the Republic of Kazakhstan are denominated in 
the Kazakhstani tenge and the Group has operational exposures to 
other foreign currencies.
Response to foreign exchange rate risks 
The Group considers the exposure to the Kazakhstani tenge to be an 
ongoing economic risk. Although there are hedges in place through to 
2009 that were transacted in 2007 the Group is not currently entering 
into new contracts to actively hedge this exposure. Management review 
economic exposures on a regular basis.

Overview
ENRC is a leading diversified natural resources group, performing 
integrated mining, processing, energy, logistics and marketing 
operations. The operations comprise: the mining and processing  
of chrome, manganese and iron ore; the smelting of ferroalloys; the 
production of iron ore pellets; the mining and processing of bauxite  
for the extraction of alumina and the production of aluminium; coal 
extraction and electricity generation; and the transportation and sales 
of Group products. The Group’s production assets are largely located  
in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Group’s entities, in the period, 
employed approximately 67,000 people (2007: 64,000 people), 
including about 3,000 added in H1 2008 with the acquisition of Serov 
and a further 600 from Tuoli in H2 2008. In 2008, the Group accounted 
for approximately 5% of the Republic of Kazakhstan’s GDP. The Group 
currently sells its products around the world, with the majority of sales 
being to Russia, China, Japan, Western Europe and the United States. 
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the Group had revenue of 
US$6,823 million (2007: US$4,106 million) and profit attributable  
to equity shareholders of the Group of US$2,642 million (2007:  
US$798 million).
In 2008 production in the Group’s ongoing operations saw steady 
growth in the first nine months against the comparable period in 2007. 
For the full year, production was reduced in the Ferroalloys and Iron Ore 
Divisions following the production cutbacks in Q4 2008. Ore grades 
remained broadly consistent. Total Ferroalloys Division production 
benefited from the inclusion of Serov from Q2 2008. Production in both 
the Energy and in the Alumina and Aluminium Division increased, with 
the additional benefit of the new aluminium smelter. Logistics Division 
total shipments fell for the year following the downturn in Q4.
Description of ENRC’s business
The Group has five operating Divisions:
Ferroalloys Division
The Ferroalloys Division primarily produces and sells ferrochrome, as 
well as other ferroalloys for use as alloying products in the production 
of steel, whilst manganese and chrome ore are sold to third party 
producers of ferroalloys as well as the chemical industry. The 
Ferroalloys Division’s chrome ore reserves are believed to be the 
largest in the CIS (183 million tonnes as at 31 December 2008) and  
are believed to have a higher grade of chrome content (41.4%) than 
those of other large scale producers. In 2008, the Ferroalloys Division 
produced 3,629 thousand tonnes of saleable chrome ore (2007: 3,687 
thousand tonnes), 1,024 thousand tonnes of saleable manganese  
ore concentrate (2007: 935 thousand tonnes) and 1,551 thousand 
tonnes of ferroalloys (2007: 1,469 thousand tonnes), including 1,054 
thousand tonnes of its primary product, high-carbon ferrochrome 
(2007: 1,070 thousand tonnes). For the year ended 31 December 2008, 
The Group currently sells its products 
around the world, including Russia,  
China, Japan, Western Europe and the 
United States.

the Ferroalloys Division had revenue of US$4,151 million (2007: 
US$2,178 million), which represented 60.8% (2007: 53.0%) of the 
Group’s consolidated revenue. 
As reported in the Chief Executive’s Statement, in early April 2008 the 
Group announced the completion of the acquisition of a controlling 
interest in Serov, a ferroalloy producer in Russia. The acquisition 
demonstrated a number of important aspects of our strategy. This 
transaction was ENRC’s first acquisition outside of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan and, longer term, reinforced our position in low-carbon and 
medium-carbon ferrochrome, with potential incremental annual sales, 
including high-carbon ferrochrome, of approximately 200 thousand 
tonnes of ferroalloys. In addition, the transaction will allow the Group 
to benefit from further scale within its ferroalloys business and 
provides an important asset base in Russia, supporting the Group’s 
strategy of regional expansion.
In mid October 2008 the Group announced the completion of the 
acquisition of 50% of Tuoli. Tuoli is one of China’s largest ferrochrome 
plants with a potential annual capacity of 120 thousand tonnes of 
high-carbon ferrochrome. The acquisition gave the Group the 
advantage of a direct presence in the Chinese market.
The Ferroalloys Division is vertically integrated, having its own chrome 
ore and manganese ore mines feeding its ferroalloy production in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, Russia and China. As well as having its own 
ore, the Division also benefits from competitively priced electricity 
supplied by the Energy Division, as well as having a gas-fired power 
station at its Aktobe plant.
Competitive position
The Ferroalloys Division has several significant advantages over those 
of its major competitors. First, the Republic of Kazakhstan’s geographic 
location is close to the key economies of China and Russia, which over 
the medium term are expected to achieve higher than average GDP 
growth. Benefiting from secure and relatively low cost transportation 
ENRC is well placed to take advantage of the eventual upturn in 
demand. Secondly, based on 2008 production data, the Ferroalloy 
Division is believed to be the largest producer of ferrochrome on a 
chrome unit basis in the world and this position has been further 
strengthened by the acquisitions in 2008. Thirdly, on a chrome content 
basis, the Group is located at the bottom of the ferrochrome production 
cost curve. This cost advantage is driven, largely, by the relatively low 
cost of electricity consumed by the Group’s ferroalloys plants, with a 
significant proportion of this electricity being derived from the Group’s 
low cost coal reserves and its generating capacity. In addition the 
higher chrome content of the Group’s ore reserves renders its 
ferrochrome more attractive to steel producers as they prefer to limit 
trace elements, reduce the generation of slag and control carbon

content. The Division also has the capability to produce a range of 
chromium products. These products include high-, medium- and 
low-carbon ferrochrome, including speciality grades such as low-
phosphorus, titanium and vanadium bearing material. This allows it to 
supply a diverse customer base with applications in the production of 
steel used in the automotives sector, white goods, construction and 
power generation industries.
Production summary
The table to the left sets out the production volumes for each of the 
Ferroalloys Division’s principal saleable products (including Serov from 
Q2 2008 and Tuoli from Q4 2008) for the years ended 31 December 
2008 and 31 December 2007.
Production of saleable chrome ore remained broadly steady, a 1.6% 
decrease, with growth in the saleable concentrates production of 
manganese ore, 9.5%, and iron-manganese ore, 28.1%. Total 
ferroalloys production increased 5.6%, including ferrochrome, 4.3%. 
The greatest increase was achieved in low- and medium-carbon 
ferrochrome production, as well as in ferrosilicon and ferrosilicochrome 
production. This was mainly as a result of the inclusion of Serov.
Supply and demand
The largest geographic source of ferrochrome supplied to the stainless 
steel industry is South Africa, comprising 45% of 2008 global 
production, with the Republic of Kazakhstan as the second largest 
supplier at 14%. Kazakhstani ferrochrome is differentiated by its higher 
chromium content, approximately 68%, versus South African charge 
chrome with a chrome content of approximately 50% and a higher 
silicon and iron content. This limits the uses of charge chrome, against 
that of high-carbon ferrochrome which can be used universally in all 
types of furnace and steel production. Whilst the relative prices of 
ferrochrome and charge chrome fluctuate according to the supply/
demand balance, the quality and chemistry of Kazakhstani high-carbon 
ferrochrome has consistently commanded a premium to charge 
chrome. 
Ferrochrome consumption is largely driven by stainless steel 
production; otherwise chrome is sourced from scrap. This use of scrap 
is primarily within the production of austenitic (nickel-bearing) steels, 
unlike the ferritic and duplex grades of stainless steel which source 
chrome primarily via the use of ferrochrome. 
Typically, the demand for stainless steel follows overall economic 
growth. The demand for stainless steel had compound growth of more 
than 5% per annum between 1998 and 2007 whilst in China the growth 
in stainless steel production was 44% per annum over the same period. 
To a lesser extent demand from India has also driven an increase in 
ferrochrome consumption through the growing use of stainless steel 
containing manganese. In H1 2008 global economic growth and 
sustained high demand from emerging economies meant stainless 
steel production equalled that of 2007, particularly the demand for 
ferritic and duplex qualities. This benefited ferrochrome demand 
because of the need for a higher chrome content and the limited 
availability of quality scrap. Demand was reinforced by issues over  
the continuity of supply from South Africa as a result of concerns as  
to power generation capacity. 
Due to the deterioration in global economic activity there has been a 
sharp reduction in the demand for steel products as the consumption 
of automotive and white good products fell and construction activity 
declined. As a result of the over-supply a number of producers 
announced production cutbacks in Q4 2008 in order to balance 
inventory and control working capital. The net effect of the downturn  
in demand is that production of stainless steel will show a year-on-year 
drop to about 26.6 million tonnes, a level last seen in 2006. With a 
weak outlook for the global economy in 2009 we expect that stainless 
steel volumes in 2009 potentially may see some further weakness on 
the levels of 2008. 
It is anticipated that growth in global stainless steel production and 
demand for ferrochrome are likely to recover in the medium term and

regain a growth rate of around 6% per annum with a return to capacity 
utilisation of around 90%. ENRC believes that the future supply/
demand balance for chrome ore will depend on three key factors. First, 
India may continue to reduce chrome ore exports to secure supply for 
its domestic ferrochrome producers through increasing existing export 
duties on chromite. Secondly, the scale of South African chrome ore 
exports remains uncertain. Increased production of ferroalloys in 
South Africa will only occur once electricity generating capacity is 
available and markets have recovered sufficiently to justify investment. 
Finally, whilst the production of platinum group metals (‘PGM’) 
continues in South Africa, cheap by-products will continue to enter the 
market whilst margins allow sales to remain profitable.
Sales and pricing
Prices for ferrochrome are typically negotiated on a quarterly basis in 
the European and Japanese markets with volumes covered by long-term 
supply contracts with terms ranging from one to five years. In the US 
prices are adjusted according to published indices for ferrochrome. 
Demand for high-carbon ferrochrome was extremely strong in H1 2008 
as stainless steel production reached record levels. Demand was 
further enhanced by the announcement by ESKOM, the South African 
electricity generator, of generation constraints in South Africa, leading 
to increased security stocking of ferrochrome. The resulting market 
squeeze fuelled the largest ever single quarterly move of the 
benchmark price, rising US$0.72 per pound of chrome in Q2 2008 to 
US$1.92 per pound of chrome. Strong, although waning, demand 
continued into early Q3 2008, despite the effects of a slowing US 
economy, with the benchmark price rising a further 13 US cents. For Q4 
2008 the price fell back 20 US cents to US$1.85 per pound of chrome 
and demand for ferrochrome dropped by around 1 million tonnes, or 
50%. Although the industry initiated production cutbacks these were 
not enough to prevent stock increases and it is estimated that around 
0.5 million tonnes of stock was added during Q4 2008. 2008 stainless 
steel production was estimated at 26.6 million tonnes, down 7% on 
2007. Stainless steel has enjoyed annualised growth of 5% per annum 
over the last 10 years. Production of stainless steel, hence demand for 
ferrochrome, is likely to remain limited by continued destocking at least 
in the short term. Longer-term growth in production of stainless steel 
will likely recover in line with the recovery in the global economy.
Prices for low- and medium-carbon ferrochrome performed well 
through much of 2008 as a result of increased demand, particularly 
from the alloy and engineering steel sectors, with prices more than 
doubling on the back of a tightening supply. Chrome ore also traded at 
historic levels, reflecting the industry’s high level of capacity utilisation 
and the need for high quality ore. Prices softened towards the end of 
2008 in response to the economic downturn and its effect on alloy and 
stainless steel production.
Manganese alloys also saw record demand as a result of high 
production levels of carbon steel. This fuelled prices as material 
supply/demand balance tightened leading to greater demand for ore  
as the alloy industry tried to optimise its capacity utilisation and take 
advantage of market conditions. As with ferrochrome the demand for 
manganese suffered in Q4 2008. 
In 2008, the Ferroalloys Division’s top five customers accounted for 
26.8% (2007: 30.3%) of the Division’s sales revenue to third parties 
and included Taiyuan Iron and Steel (Group) Co. Ltd in China, Pohang

the Far East; and 5.3% (2007: 5.3%) in the Republic of Kazakhstan and 
the rest of the world. 
Key initiatives
The key objectives for the Ferroalloys Division are: to expand 
operations with substantial margins and returns on capital based on 
the low-cost, large scale and high-grade ore resources available to the 
Group; reduce production costs by replacing outdated equipment; 
further strengthen the Group’s leading market position in ferroalloys 
worldwide; and to improve the environmental and safety performance 
of the Division. 
Following revisions to the Group’s capital expenditure programme the 
main projects and schedule for the Division are:
Construction of a second pelletising plant at Donskoy GOK, of 700 > >
thousand tonnes per annum, is on schedule and its completion is 
expected in mid 2009. The pelletising plant will also produce 
saleable products from the output of an enrichment plant. The total 
estimated cost of the project is US$110 million. Construction of a 
second enrichment plant at Donskoy GOK, for completion in mid 
2009, will enable a further expansion of pellet production, and 
allow greater control over mining volumes and operational costs 
while increasing the utilisation of the mined ore. 
Building new DC furnaces at the Aktobe processing plant and  > >
a mine expansion at a cost of approximately US$590 million,  
and with completion planned for 2012. This project is expected  
to enhance productivity, give incremental production of 
approximately 170 thousand tonnes and generate substantial  
cost savings, particularly for key input materials such as reductants, 
including coke. Furthermore, the installation of modern smelting 
furnaces is expected to result in significant environmental and 
safety improvements.
Iron Ore Division
The Iron Ore Division operates the largest iron ore mining and 
processing enterprise in the Republic of Kazakhstan and produces and 
sells iron ore concentrate and pellets primarily to steel producers. On 
the basis of 2008 data it is believed to be one of the world’s significant 
exporters of iron ore and to be in the lowest third of the industry cost 
curve for global iron ore pellet production. The Iron Ore Division’s 
operations include iron ore mines, crushing, beneficiation and 
pelletising plants and a thermal power station.
In 2008, the Iron Ore Division mined 37.8 million tonnes of iron ore 
(2007: 40.2 million tonnes). This was processed into 15.5 million 
tonnes of iron ore concentrate (2007: 16.8 million tonnes), of which 7.5 
million tonnes was sold (2007: 7.4 million tonnes) and the balance was 
used to produce 7.0 million tonnes of iron ore pellets (2007: 8.6 million

tonnes). For the year ended 31 December 2008, the Iron Ore Division 
had revenue of US$1,498 million (2007: US$991 million), which 
represented 22.0% (2007: 24.1%) of the Group’s consolidated revenue. 
Competitive position
The Iron Ore Division has some significant strategic advantages over  
its major competitors. First, the location of the Group’s large scale iron 
ore reserves in Northern Kazakhstan provides access to an important 
customer base, being the steel production plants in Russia, China and 
the Republic of Kazakhstan, with relatively low transportation costs. In 
particular, the Group’s facilities are located within 340 kilometres of its 
key customer, the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works JSC (‘MMK’), and 
this proximity provides significant logistical advantages. Second, the 
Division operates large-scale iron ore mines and processing plants with 
relatively low production costs. Based on 2008 data, the Group is 
located in the lower-third of the industry cost curve for global iron ore 
pellet production. This cost advantage is largely driven by the relatively 
low cost of electricity, benefiting from the Group’s own power 
generation capacity.
Production summary
The table to the left sets out the production volumes for the Iron Ore 
Division’s principal saleable products for the years ended 31 December 
2008 and 31 December 2007.
Annual production decreased 7.1% for total saleable products, 
although within this saleable concentrate production increased  
6.6%. The reduction in saleable pellets in part reflected the planned 
reconstruction of one pelletiser unit in 2008, which was completed at 
the end of Q3 2008. Production in the Division was cut back in Q4 2008 
in response to a significant reduction in customer demand for mined 
ore and saleable products.
Supply and demand
The market for iron ore is primarily regional, as iron ore is a bulk 
commodity and, relative to its value, is expensive to transport. China, 
Australia and Brazil are the largest producers of iron ore, accounting  
for respectively, 37%, 17% and 14% of global output in 2008 based  
on iron content. Other significant producers include the CIS and India. 
Global production of iron ore was 1,985 million tonnes in 2008 as 
compared to 972 million tonnes in 1998; compound annual growth  
of about 7%.
Typically, steel production and, as a result, demand for iron ore, follows 
overall growth in industrial production. Global demand for iron ore  
has slowed recently, primarily as a result of the economic downturn. 
Although demand is expected to stay relatively stable in the BRIC 
countries and the Middle East, steel exports from these regions would 
be affected by the reduced demand from developed countries. Iron ore

producers were optimistic and had initiated numerous expansion 
projects with a risk that, despite recent cancellations, there could  
still be a material surplus supply of iron ore in the short term.
Sales and pricing 
In April 2007, the Group entered into a long-term contract with MMK, 
the Division’s largest single customer, accounting for 64.1% (2007: 
67.4%) of the Iron Ore Division’s sales revenue. The contract extends 
until 2017 and requires MMK to purchase specified quantities at prices 
determined by reference to the published world price benchmarks for 
iron ore concentrate and pellets. Prices are revised annually on 1 April 
by reference to the world price benchmarks.
In light of the current economic downturn and the impact on our 
customer MMK, in Q4 2008 the Group agreed to temporarily waive  
the minimum contractual sales volume. Contractual sales volumes  
will continue to be reviewed on a regular basis, taking into account 
developing market conditions.
The current structure of industry pricing benchmarks have historically 
been set between the three major iron ore producers – BHP Billiton, Rio 
Tinto, and Vale – and the major steel producers in China, Europe and 
Japan, for fines and pellets, and take effect from 1 April annually.
Tightness in the iron ore market abated in H2 2008, with spot prices 
falling below contract prices, and markedly so in Q4 2008. As global 
steelmakers started to reduce production dramatically and defer 
expansions, iron ore producers restrained production and delayed new 
projects. Market expectations anticipate reduced benchmark prices 
from Q2 2009.
The table to the left sets out the Iron Ore Division’s volume of third 
party sales by product for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 
31 December 2007.
Key initiatives
The Iron Ore Division’s strategic objectives are: to maintain production 
capacities; utilise the Group’s access to low cost, large-scale deposits 
of iron ore and low cost energy; and to diversify sales geography, 
product and customer mix. 
The Division is also focusing on finalising the feasibility study in BML, 
the Brazilian iron ore joint venture.
The Alumina and Aluminium Division
The Alumina and Aluminium Division produces and sells alumina to 
aluminium producers and, from the end of 2007, aluminium. ENRC 
believes, based on 2008 data, that the Alumina and Aluminium 
Division is the world’s ninth largest supplier of traded alumina by 
volume and is at the lower end of the global industry cost curve for  
both alumina and aluminium.
The Alumina and Aluminium Division’s vertically integrated operations 
include two bauxite mines, a limestone mine, an alumina refinery, an 
aluminium smelter, and a power station. The new aluminium smelter 
allows the Alumina and Aluminium Division to process its alumina  
into aluminium. The smelter presently has an annual capacity of  
125 thousand tonnes achieved in Q2 2008. The Group will complete 
construction of Phase 2 of the smelter which will increase the 
production capacity of aluminium to 250 thousand tonnes per annum 
in 2010.
In 2008, the Alumina and Aluminium Division mined 5.2 million tonnes 
of bauxite (2007: 5.0 million tonnes) and produced 1.6 million tonnes 
of alumina (2007: 1.5 million tonnes) and 106 thousand tonnes (2007: 
12 thousand tonnes) of aluminium. For the year ended 31 December 
2008, the Alumina and Aluminium Division had revenue of US$864 
million (2007: US$607 million) representing 12.7% (2007: 14.8%) of 
the Group’s consolidated revenue.

Competitive position
2008 was the first full year of operation of ENRC’s new primary smelter 
– the Kazakhstan Aluminium Smelter (KAS), in Pavlodar – which 
reached its run rate capacity of 125 thousand tonnes per annum in Q2 
2008. Construction of a further 125 thousand tonnes capacity, bringing 
the total capacity to 250 thousand tonnes, is well under way.
The Division’s focus on cost control, with the implementation of  
several cost-reduction programmes in 2008, enabled ENRC to retain  
its competitive cost position. The Group’s bauxite reserves guarantee 
an ongoing low-cost supply of raw material for alumina production. 
Alumina and aluminium production benefit from the ability to buy 
low-cost energy from internal Group sources. As a result ENRC’s 
alumina and aluminium are both at the lower end of the industry  
cost curves which enables us to be one of RUSAL’s preferred suppliers.
Production summary
The table to the left sets out the production volumes for each of the 
Alumina and Aluminium Division’s principal saleable products for  
the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
Alumina production grew in line with the approved capacity expansion 
plan with growth of about 4% in bauxite mining and alumina 
production. The new aluminium smelter achieved its Phase 1 capacity 
run rate of 125 thousand tonnes in Q2 2008, well ahead of schedule. 
Despite the impact of the economic downturn on the aluminium 
industry worldwide, stable demand for alumina from the Division’s 
main customers – UC RUSAL and ENRC’s own Kazakhstan Aluminium 
Smelter – supported the production and expansion programme. 
Supply and demand
Global alumina production reached 77.7 million tonnes in 2008 (2007: 
73.0 million tonnes). Total aluminium production was 40.0 million 
tonnes of which the largest part, 13.2 million tonnes, or 33%, 
originated from China. 
After a promising start to the year demand weakened significantly in  
H2 2008. Demand is anticipated to have grown only 2%, outpaced by 
supply which is estimated to have risen by as much as 5%. As a result 
worldwide aluminium stocks (London Metal Exchange (‘LME’)) stood at 
2.3 million tonnes at the end of 2008, rising 1.6 million tonnes over the 
year. Total inventories at the year end were equivalent to around six 
weeks of estimated current worldwide demand. Significant reductions 
in planned capacity expansions have been announced by the 
aluminium producers
ENRC believes that in 2009, an even larger production surplus, 
potentially 2 million tonnes, is possible, driven by a decline in 
worldwide demand of about 4%. Since aluminium has a heavy 
exposure to both the construction and transportation sectors,  
with approximately 50% of end use, demand looks set to slow in  
the coming year. Further production cutbacks will be necessary to  
avoid a significant inventory build-up, and are likely to come first from 
high-cost operations. 
Sales and pricing
In 2008 the Group shipped 1.4 million tonnes of alumina to United 
Company RUSAL (‘UC RUSAL’) under a long-term supply contract 
expiring in 2016. The pricing under this contract is linked to the LME 
price of primary aluminium. As a result ENRC is not exposed to the 
alumina spot price. In 2008 UC RUSAL, the Division’s largest single 
customer, accounted for 60.2% (2007: 79.5%) of the Division’s  
sales revenue.
Sales of aluminium via Glencore International represented 30.3% of  
the Division’s revenue in 2008. The Group shipped approximately  
104 thousand tonnes of primary aluminium, almost all of which was 
distributed by Glencore International which acts as our agent. The LME 
cash price is the basis for the pricing of all aluminium contracts.

LME aluminium prices showed unusually high volatility in 2008. Prices 
were driven higher in the early months of 2008 by Chinese weather-
related production closures and power issues in South Africa. The 
average sales price was US$2,571 per tonne (2007: US$2,639 per 
tonne); the LME aluminium price reached a record high in early July 
2008 at US$3,292 per tonne with the lowest closing level in the year  
of US$1,430 per tonne in mid-December. Prices fell with falling demand 
in key sectors, commodity fund deleveraging and increasing LME 
inventory. The demand outlook remains weak and prices can be 
expected to remain under pressure in the short term. 
Key initiatives
The Alumina and Aluminium Division’s principal strategic objectives 
are: to increase the capacity of aluminium production in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan; to exploit the surplus of low-cost electricity, bauxite and 
alumina; and to provide internally produced anodes. 
Following revisions to the Group’s capital expenditure programme the 
main projects and schedule for the Division are:
Increasing the annual capacity of the aluminium smelter by an > >
additional 125 thousand tonnes to start-up 2010 (Phase 2) at a  
cost of US$305 million. As part of the smelter expansion we are 
constructing an anode plant at an additional cost of US$200 million, 
which will allow the Group to be independent of third-party 
suppliers and, from 2011, to provide enough anodes for the 
increased aluminium production.
Energy Division
The Energy Division is one of the largest electricity providers in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, accounting for approximately 14.5% of the 
country’s recorded electricity production in 2008. The Energy Division 
provides a cost-effective energy supply to the Group’s principal 
operating divisions as well as producing a surplus for sales to third 
parties in the Republic of Kazakhstan. In 2008 the Energy Division 
produced 11,640 GWh (2007: 12,121 GWh) of which 68.5% (2007: 
58.0%) was used internally within the Group. The share of internal 
consumption increased as the new aluminium smelter increased  
its production to its full Phase 1 run rate capacity. Coal production 
increased 7.6% to 19.8 million tonnes (2007: 18.4 million tonnes).  
In addition to sales of surplus electricity, the Energy Division also sold 
8.0 million tonnes of coal to third parties (2007: 6.4 million tonnes) 
which represented 40.4% of total coal mined (2007: 34.7%). For the 
year ended 31 December 2008, the Energy Division had revenue of 
US$436 million (2007: US$314 million), of which US$203 million was 
derived from third party sales (2007: US$181 million), representing 
3.0% (2007: 4.4%) of the Group’s consolidated revenue.

In February 2009, the Group announced the acquisition of a 25% 
interest in Shubarkol Komir JSC (‘Shubarkol’), a major semi coke and 
thermal coal producer based in the Republic of Kazakhstan, for a cash 
consideration of US$200 million less 25% of net debt. Shubarkol is  
one of the Republic of Kazakhstan’s largest thermal coal producers, 
producing some 6.1 million tonnes of coal in 2007 and with 1,419 
million tonnes of measured and indicated coal resources within its  
coal lease, of which there were 365 million tonnes of probable coal 
reserves. The Group has a right of first refusal and a call option to 
purchase the remaining 75% of Shubarkol. Shubarkol products are 
used for gasification in alumina production and could potentially  
be used to produce synthetic gas in the event we were to build DRI 
production facilities.
Production summary
The table on the left sets out the production volumes for each of the 
Energy Division’s principal saleable products for the years ended 
31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
The Energy Division is focused on both supplying other ENRC Divisions 
with coal and electricity and sales of coal and electricity to third 
parties. Annual coal production and sales increased 7.3% due to strong 
demand for coal, both in the Republic of Kazakhstan and in export 
markets. Power generation capacity was limited in 2008 with one 
turbine down for planned maintenance until Q4 2008. In addition, with 
the impact of the economic downturn in Q4 2008, electricity demand  
in the Republic of Kazakhstan fell and electricity generation decreased 
4.0% for 2008. Whilst the electricity consumption of other ENRC 
Divisions increased 13.4%, primarily as a consequence of the new 
aluminium smelter, third party sales fell 32.6%.
Sales and pricing
The table on the left sets out the Energy Division’s volume of third

Electricity
Supply constraints were anticipated for 2008, as the new ENRC 
aluminium smelter increased production to its Phase 1 run rate of 125 
thousand tonnes per annum. This was attained in Q2 2008, creating 
the largest ever single increase in electricity demand in the Republic of 
Kazakhstan. An electricity deficit for the country continued for the first 
nine months of 2008. However, any increase in electricity prices was 
limited as the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, in order  
to control inflation, advised producers to maintain 2007 prices from  
1 January 2008. Electricity producers were permitted to adjust prices 
from Q2 2008. Following the recommendations of the Government, the 
Energy Division increased prices for companies involved in the supply 
and transmission of electric power by 13.6% from 1 April 2008 whilst

securing a larger increase from the industrial sector. The average sales 
price to third parties increased 27.2% to KZT2.65 (2.20 US cents) per 
kWh (2007: KZT2.12 (1.73 US cents) per kWh). The economic downturn 
forced domestic power producers to cut output and electricity 
consumption in Q4 2008, moving the domestic electricity market back 
into surplus. Despite a moderate decline in electricity consumption in 
the Republic of Kazakhstan in Q4 2008, over the year the market grew 
approximately 4.4% to 80.0 billion kWh. Due to the economic climate,  
a surplus of electricity is likely to persist in the Republic of Kazakhstan 
in 2009 creating more competition in the sale of excess electricity to 
third parties. 
Coal
In the Republic of Kazakhstan, ENRC sold 3.1 million tonnes of coal to 
third parties (2007: 2.5 million tonnes) at an average sales price of 
KZT721 (US$5.99) per tonne (2007: KZT688 (US$5.61) per tonne), an 
increase of 4.8%. Prices for the sale of coal in the domestic market are 
subject to government regulation. In Russia, as a result of gas prices 
rising 27% in early 2008, the cost efficiency of coal-fired power 
generation improved compared to gas powered generation, eventually 
leading to stronger coal demand from heat and power stations. Growth 
of consumption in Russia resulted in the Group selling additional coal. 
The Energy Division sold 5.0 million tonnes of coal to Russia (2007: 3.9 
million tonnes). In 2008 Omskenergy, the Division’s largest single 
customer, accounted for 25.7% (2007: 25.5%) of the Division’s 
revenue. The average annual selling price for Russian customers 
increased 18.8% to US$24.6 per tonne (2007: US$20.7 per tonne). With 
gas prices still forecast to grow in Russia, it is expected that further 
increases in domestic prices will be experienced in 2009. However, 
coal consumption could be constrained due to warmer than expected 
weather in Russia and in the Republic of Kazakhstan during the 
2008/09 winter and prolonged economic slowdown with production 
cuts and a consequent fall in electricity consumption.
Key initiatives
The Energy Division’s principal objectives are: to provide low-cost 
power and coal for the Group’s existing operations, utilising its large 
scale coal reserves; and a progressive expansion of production in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. Additional energy capacity will ensure power 
supply to Group’s Divisions and allow it to maintain its presence on the 
Republic of Kazakhstan power market where it sells electric energy into 
the wholesale market.
Following revision to the Group’s capital expenditure programme the 
main projects and schedule for the Division are:
Install overburden stripping equipment at a cost of US$85 million, > >

Invest approximately US$200 million to construct a new turbine and > >
generator by 2011. It is expected that this will increase total 
installed electricity generating capacity by 325MW.
Logistics Division
The Logistics Division provides transportation and logistics services  
to the Group’s operating Divisions and to third parties. The Division’s 
operations include freight forwarding, wagon repair services and 
railway construction and repair services. The availability of these 
services within the Group mitigates many of the risks associated with 
the supply of raw materials and delivery of products to customers.  
In addition, the Division operates a railway transfer and reloading 
terminal on the Republic of Kazakhstan/China border, facilitating the 
Group’s access to the Chinese market.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the Logistics Division 
transported 58.5 million tonnes of goods (2007: 60.9 million  
tonnes), of which 80.7% (2007: 87.7%) was intra-Group. Reduced 
transportation volumes for the year reflected a slowdown in Q4 2008  
in the key commodities: iron ore, chrome ore and ferroalloys. For the 
year ended 31 December 2008, the Logistics Division had revenue of 
US$229 million (2007: US$232 million), of which US$107 million (2007: 
US$149 million), derived from third party sales representing 1.6% 
(2007: 3.6%) of the Group’s consolidated revenue. A significant factor 
impacting the 2008 revenue and cost of sales was that the main

customer, the Kazakhstani State railway company, used its own 
material for some railroad repair works. In addition there were delays  
in the tendering process for some contracts. 
Key initiatives
On 21 March 2008, ENRC Logistics won the Republic of Kazakhstan 
open tender for the concession for the construction and running of 
about 300 kilometres of a new railway line in South-East Kazakhstan 
(the ‘China Gateway Project’), connecting the Republic of Kazakhstan 
with China. The new railway will facilitate an increased cargo capacity, 
by up to 30 million tonnes per annum, and will provide ENRC’s 
operations with a secure transportation route for products to be sold 
into the Chinese market. The construction period is estimated to be 
approximately four years with a required investment of approximately 
US$910 million. The operational period of the concession is 24 years 
from the completion of construction. The design review and financial 
and technical report are expected to be completed in Q2 2009. 
Sales and Marketing 
The Group’s Sales and Marketing function provides ENRC’s operating 
divisions with a fully integrated and centrally organised sales and 
marketing resource. This facilitates the efficient coordination of  
the Group’s external sales, monitoring of key markets and general 
production strategy. The sales and marketing function performs the 
following key functions: strategy and planning; commercial contract 
terms and customer relations; market research; and coordinating 
logistics. The centralisation of this function provides significant 
operational advantages to the Group including the identification  
and exploitation of market synergies and improved operational 
efficiencies. In addition, as the markets in which the Group operates 
are geographically diverse and complex, the size, scope and expertise 
of the sales and marketing function enables it to gather significant 
market information that is not otherwise generally available.

Capital expenditure
Our businesses are capital intensive. Managing projects efficiently and 
effectively is a key skill for our industry. The successful implementation 
and commissioning of assets is very important to our success and our 
delivery of shareholder value. Our capital expenditure projects are 
designed to address our strategic aims which include maintenance and 
improvement of low cost operations, expansion and development of 
existing reserves and capacity, and expanding our product portfolio. 
As mentioned in the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement (page 13) two 
of the highlights achieved in 2008 were the aluminium smelter (covered 
in the 2007 Annual Report) achieving its phase 1 run-rate capacity  
well ahead of schedule and secondly the refurbishment of a power 
generating unit.  
Reconstruction of Power Generating Unit 1 at Aksu Power Station of 
JSC EEC 
During 2008, we completed the refurbishment of one of the Energy 
Division’s power generating units ahead of the planned completion 
date. The refurbishment included the installation of new turbines and 
two Alstom electrical filters with 99.6% end-gas purification efficiency 
as well as replacement of a generator, transformers and other key 
elements. In addition to the refurbishment of the power generating 
unit, a new automated turbine control system was installed. As a result 
of the refurbishment, we managed to increase the power generating 
unit’s capacity in line with international efficiency levels. 
Despite the significant cost pressures for key equipment, labour and 
materials, management successfully managed to complete the 
refurbishment in line with the original budget of US$100 million.
The successful refurbishment of the power generating unit is part of  
a long-term refurbishment programme designed to ensure that we 
increase the Group’s electricity generating capacity and maintain  
our competitive advantage by being self sufficient in electricity for  
the Group’s power intensive ferroalloys and aluminium smelting 
operations. Also it will allow us to maintain our strong presence in  
the Republic of Kazakhstan’s wholesale power market.

Financial Review
Year ended 31 December 2008 compared 
to the year ended 31 December 2007
Group
The Group continued its growth in 2008, achieving record financial 
results. Commodity prices rose strongly throughout the first nine 
months of the year underpinning this growth, partially offset by 
production cutbacks impacting in Q4 2008 introduced in response  
to the economic downturn.
Revenue increased US$2,717 million, or 66.2%, to US$6,823 million 
(2007: US$4,106 million). Higher sales prices accounted for 104.4%  
of this growth, whilst reduced sales led to a fall of 4.4%. The inclusion 
of Serov, the new aluminium smelter and Tuoli added revenues of, 
US$496 million, US$280 million and US$6 million respectively. 
Like-for-like revenue increased US$1,937 million, or 47.2% to 
US$6,040 million. The Ferroalloys Division accounted for 76.0% of  
the increase; and the Iron Ore Division for 26.2%. 
Whilst benefiting from strong commodity prices, the Group maintained 
a good control of operating costs. Cost of sales rose US$387 million,  
or 22.8%, to US$2,088 million (2007: US$1,701 million). Like-for-like 
Group cost of sales increased US$121 million, or 7.1%, to US$1,819 
million (2007: US$1,698 million). Higher materials and labour costs 
were the main factors driving this increase. The Alumina and Aluminium 
Division experienced the largest underlying cost increase, mainly due 
to a significant increase in raw materials prices. The inclusion of Serov, 
the new aluminium smelter and Tuoli increased the cost of sales by, 
respectively, US$155 million, US$103 million and US$11 million. 
Distribution costs increased US$58 million, or 15.5%, to US$431 
million (2007: US$373 million). There was an increase of US$29 million 
in the Ferroalloys Division, a consequence of increased transportation 
costs mainly due to increases in certain costs that are set in relation to 
sales price (duties, commissions and insurance), higher freight costs 
driven up by increased fuel costs and the adverse impact of a strong 
euro. There was an increase of US$17 million in the Iron Ore Division, 
as proportionally more product was transported to China.
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined US$184 million, 
or 30.4%, to US$422 million (2007: US$606 million). This decline was 
principally due to US$182 million of expenses attributable to the IPO  
in 2007.
Group operating profit increased US$2,429 million, or 170.9% to 
US$3,850 million (2007: US$1,421 million). The Ferroalloys Division 
contributed 68.0% of this growth, or US$1,651 million (including 
US$197 million from Serov). The Iron Ore Division contributed 19.6%, 
or US$476 million. Exchange rates did not have a material impact on 
the Group’s financial results.
Group finance income increased US$74 million, or 127.6%, to US$132 
million (2007: US$58 million) primarily due to interest income on IPO 
proceeds invested in money market securities and increased bank 
interest income. Group finance costs decreased US$15 million, or 9.5%, 
to US$143 million (2007: US$158 million) primarily due to the paying 
down of the trade finance facility offset by foreign exchange losses. 
Impairment
Due to the global economic crisis and the consequent impact on 
commodity prices and demand, we have considered the recoverability 
of long-term assets. We have adopted the value-in-use approach and 
used our strategic planning models, which are on a life-of-mines basis, 
to calculate future discounted cash flow for each cash-generating unit. 
The impairment review concluded that no impairment provisions were 
required.
Ferroalloys Division
The Ferroalloys Division achieved outstanding results in the year, 
although the heightened pressures of the economic slowdown began  
to impact in Q4 2008. The results reflected much higher average sales 
prices for the year and a good control of costs.
In response to the significant weakening in demand following the 
economic slowdown, production was cut back in Q4 2008 by 
approximately 35% (referenced to the 2007 sales volumes run rate),

or 85 thousand tonnes, principally high-carbon ferrochrome, with an 
accompanying reduction in chrome ore extraction. In addition the 
Group cut back production in the higher cost operations of Serov, by 
approximately 40% against Q3 2008, and in Tuoli, where production 
was suspended. Late in 2008 the Division cut back a further 15 
thousand tonnes, sales being supplied from inventory, in order to 
minimise stock being carried forward. In Q4 2008 total ferroalloys 
production (excluding Serov and Tuoli) declined 34.4% relative to Q3 
2008, reducing full year production of the ongoing businesses to below 
that of the prior year. Manganese related production, a product of 
opportunity for the Group although not a significant business, was 
reduced in response to the market environment.
Despite these cutbacks in Q4 2008 production volumes achieved a 
solid performance compared to the prior year, largely due to the strong 
results achieved in the first nine months of 2008.
Chrome ore extraction declined 5.6% to 4,331 thousand tonnes,  
or 4,207 thousand tonnes excluding Serov (2007: 4,590 thousand 
tonnes). The underlying decline reflected a reduction in open pit 
mining, ahead of planned growth in underground mining in the years 
ahead. The decline in extraction was partially offset by a 4.9% growth 
in the processing of low-grade stockpiled ore. The internal consumption 
of saleable chrome ore rose to 71.5% (2007: 69.1%). A modest decline 
of 1.6% was evident in the production of saleable chrome ore from 
3,687 thousand tonnes in the year ended 31 December 2007 to 3,629 
thousand tonnes in the year ended 31 December 2008 (of which Serov 
added 77 thousand tonnes). Saleable manganese ore and iron 
manganese production achieved good growth. 
Ferroalloys production achieved solid growth, with additional volume 
coming from the acquisition of Serov and Tuoli. Ferrochrome production 
increased 5.6% to 1,551 thousand tonnes (2007: 1,469 thousand 
tonnes), including 178 thousand tonnes from Serov in the period  
from Q2 2008. Serov provided additional high-carbon ferrochrome  
and ferrosilicon-chrome capacity, but its greatest impact on the scale 
of the business was additional medium- and low-carbon ferrochrome 
production. The acquisition of Tuoli, completed in Q4 2008, had little 
impact on volumes or revenues as production was suspended in 
response to market conditions. Tuoli added 4 thousand tonnes of 
high-carbon ferrochrome in Q4 2008.
The Ferroalloys Division’s third party revenue increased US$1,973 
million, or 90.6%, to US$4,151 million (2007: US$2,178 million). Higher 
prices led to a US$2,202 million growth in revenue. Average ferroalloy 
prices increased 2.2 times to US$1.85 per pound of chrome (2007: 
US$0.85 per pound of chrome). In addition higher chrome ore prices 
were realised, which increased to US$533 per tonne (2007: US$250). 
The Group reallocated production capacity in response to this 
opportunity. A 10.1% drop in ferroalloys sales volumes and a 40.4% 
decrease in external chrome ore sales, reflecting the consolidation  
of Serov, were partially offset by a 22.4% growth in manganese 
concentrate sales and a two-fold growth in iron-manganese 
concentrate sales; together these accounted for a US$223 million fall  
in revenue. Sales from Serov were consolidated by the Group from  
early April 2008 and added revenue of US$496 million. 
Cost of sales increased US$263 million, or 34.9%, to US$1,017 million 
(2007: US$754 million). Serov and Tuoli cost of sales contributed, 
respectively, US$155 million and US$11 million to this increase.  
The underlying increase was mainly due to higher material costs 
(principally coke), energy and labour costs. The average unit cost of 
high-carbon ferrochrome was US$0.42 per pound of chrome (2007: 
US$0.28 per pound of chrome). This increase mainly reflected the 
higher costs of Serov where the unit cost is about three times higher 
than in Kazchrome with a unit cost of chrome ore of US$22 per tonne 
(2007: US$20 per tonne). As well as increased material and labour 
costs there was a change in the product mix towards greater 
manganese content which also added to refining costs. 
Distribution costs increased US$29 million, or 11.7%, to US$277 
million (2007: US$248 million). Serov’s distribution costs contributed 
US$20 million to the increase.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased US$18 million, 
or 12.8%, to US$159 million (2007: US$141 million). Serov’s selling, 
general and administrative expenses contributed US$20 million. 
The Division’s operating profit increased US$1,651 million to US$2,689 
million (2007: US$1,038 million). Serov contributed US$195 million to 
the increase from April 2008. Tuoli had no material impact in Q4 2008.
Iron Ore Division
Iron ore extraction volumes during the first nine months of 2008 
exceeded those in the comparable period of 2007. However, in 
response to the significant weakening in demand as a result of the 
economic slowdown, production of primary concentrate was cut in Q4 
2008 by approximately 50% (referenced to the 2007 sales volumes), or 
approximately 2 million tonnes, with an accompanying reduction in iron 
ore extraction. In Q4 2008 ore extraction declined 43.3% relative to Q3 
2008 reducing the full year performance to below that of the prior year. 
Extraction of iron ore fell 6.1% to 37,751 thousand tonnes (2007: 
40,222 thousand tonnes).
From the extracted ore, primary concentrate production decreased 
7.8% to 15,487 thousand tonnes (2007: 16,791 thousand tonnes), with 
extraction also affected by a marginally lower grade of mined ore and  
a reduced yield of concentrate. Primary concentrate is used for either 
saleable concentrate or pellet production; saleable concentrate rose 
6.6% against a decline of 18.9% in saleable pellets. The reduced pellet 
production largely reflected the reconstruction of a pelletiser unit 
which was not in operation for much of 2008. 
The Iron Ore Division’s third party revenue increased US$507 million,  
or 51.2%, to US$1,498 million (2007: US$991 million). Of this increase 
124.0% reflected higher sales prices. Iron ore concentrate and pellets 
price rises contributed 23.1% to the Group’s revenue increase. The 
average price of iron ore concentrate rose 78.5% to US$79.6 per tonne 
(2007: US$44.6 per tonne). The iron ore pellets price rose 73.6% to 
US$126.2 per tonne (2007: US$72.7 per tonne). 
Cost of sales increased US$51 million, or 12.2%, to US$468 million 
(2007: US$417 million). The increase largely reflected higher material 
prices, labour and energy costs. The unit cost of iron ore concentrate 
was US$26 per tonne (2007: US$20 per tonne) whilst the unit cost of 
iron ore pellets was US$36 per tonne (2007: US$27 per tonne). The 
increase in unit costs was mainly caused by increased material prices 
and higher maintenance and transportation costs.

Distribution costs increased US$17 million, or 17.7%, to US$113 
million (2007: US$96 million) reflecting higher labour and 
transportation costs and greater depreciation and amortisation. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased US$12 million, 
or 14.0%, to US$74 million (2007: US$86 million); 2007 included an 
impairment charge of US$12 million.
The Division’s operating profit increased US$476 million, or 132.6%,  
to US$835 million (2007: US$359 million). 
Alumina and Aluminium Division
The Alumina and Aluminium Division achieved 4.0% growth in bauxite 
extraction to 5,160 thousand tonnes (2007: 4,963 thousand tonnes). 
This growth resulted from a development programme to secure the 
supply of bauxite for the planned expansion in alumina production  
to 1,600 thousand tonnes per annum in 2008 (2007: 1,537 thousand 
tonnes), an increase of 4.1%. 
Production at the new aluminium smelter commenced in December 
2007. In 2008 the new smelter consumed 209 thousand tonnes, or 
13.1%, of internal alumina production. The new aluminium smelter 
achieved its Phase 1 run-rate production target of 125 thousand tonnes 
per annum in Q2 2008, well ahead of its scheduled year-end date. 
The Alumina and Aluminium Division’s third party revenue increased 
US$257 million, or 42.3%, to US$864 million (2007: US$607 million). 
This was principally due to new aluminium sales revenue of US$280 
million. The underlying US$23 million reduction in revenue was due  
to a 7.1% decline in third-party alumina sales volumes, partially offset 
by higher prices.
Cost of sales increased US$199 million, or 56.5%, to US$551 million 
(2007: US$352 million). Excluding the new aluminium smelter, cost  
of sales increased US$99 million, or 28.4%, to US$448 million (2007: 
US$349 million). The underlying increase was due to higher materials, 
labour and other costs, partially offset by lower inventory. On a per 
tonne basis, the cost of sales of alumina rose to US$244 per tonne 
(2007: US$205 per tonne). 
Distribution costs increased US$12 million, or 40.0%, to US$42 million 
(2007: US$30 million), principally transportation costs related to the 
new aluminium production. 
The Division’s operating profit increased US$59 million, or 37.1%,  
to US$218 million (2007: US$159 million).

Energy Division
In 2008 the Energy Division extracted 19,790 thousand tonnes (2007: 
18,442 thousand tonnes) of coal from the Vostochny mine, in line with 
the planned expansion. The Division’s internal coal consumption fell 
3.7% to 7,148 thousand tonnes, or 36.1% of total extraction (2007: 
7,423 thousand tonnes; 40.3%), as one power generation turbine was 
taken off-line for planned refurbishment. The turbine was back on-line 
in Q4 2008.
Sales of coal to other Group Divisions saw solid growth, rising 4.1%  
to 4,773 thousand tonnes, or 24.1% of total extraction, (2007: 4,584 
thousand tonnes; 24.9%). There was growth in external coal sales  
to 8,044 thousand tonnes (2007: 6,397 thousand tonnes). Electricity 
generation fell 4.0% to 11,640 GWh (2007: 12,121 GWh), with lower 
capacity due to the planned maintenance of one turbine for much of the 
year that came back on stream in Q4 2008 and reduced demand in Q4 
2008 with the effects on demand of the economic downturn. Sales of 
electricity to other Group Divisions increased to 68.5% of electricity 
generated (2007: 58.0%), reflecting the impact of the new aluminium 
smelter. 
The Energy Division’s third party revenue increased US$22 million,  
or 12.2%, to US$203 million (2007: US$181 million). This growth was 
due to a US$44 million increase in revenue from sales of coal to third 
parties, resulting from growth of 25.7% in the volume of coal sold and  
a 13.3% increase in the average price achieved. A 29.4% increase in 
the average electricity tariff led to additional revenue of US$13 million. 
This was offset by a 32.6% reduction in the volume of electricity sold 
as more electricity was consumed within the Group and, as mentioned 
previously, because of reduced generator capacity. The Division’s sales 
to other Group entities increased US$100 million, or 75.2%, to US$233 
million (2007: US$133 million). 
Cost of sales increased US$33 million, or 20.5%, to US$194 million 
(2007: US$161 million). The increase was driven largely by growth  
in labour costs, partially offset by reduced material costs.
Distribution costs increased US$16 million, or 29.1%, to US$71 million 
(2007: US$55 million). This was due to higher tariffs imposed by the 
Republic of Kazakhstan state railroad. 
The Division’s operating profit increased US$75 million, or 105.6%,  
to US$146 million (2007: US$71 million). 
Logistics Division
During the first nine months of 2008 there was a solid growth in the 
tonnage of the Group’s internal products transported by railway by the 
Logistics Division. In Q4 2008 transportation volumes dropped 16.7% 
compared to Q3 2008. In 2008 the Logistics Division transported 
58,489 thousand tonnes (2007: 60,855 thousand tonnes), a decline  
of 3.9%. The volume of third-party freight forwarding rose 50.1% to 
11,248 thousand tonnes (2007: 7,495 thousand tonnes). 
External railroad repair services volumes decreased 22.9% to 408 
kilometres (2007: 529 kilometres). This was due to delays in the 
tendering process for some contracts. In addition the Kazakhstani state 
railway company, the major customer, used its own materials for some 
railroad repair works which impacted revenue and related cost of sales.
The Division’s third party revenue declined US$42 million, or 28.2%, to 
US$107 million (2007: US$149 million), mainly due to a reduced volume 
of railway repairs. Sales to other Group Divisions increased US$39 
million, or 47.0%, to US$122 million (2007: US$83 million). 
Cost of sales decreased US$27 million, or 15.1%, to US$152 million 
(2007: US$179 million), mainly as a result of reduced volumes of 
railroad repairs and customers’ own materials being utilised in some 
projects, reducing costs incurred for repairs and maintenance.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased US$18 million, 
or 62.1%, to US$47 million (2007: US$29 million). 
The Division’s operating profit increased US$5 million, or 18.5%,  
to US$32 million (2007: US$27 million). 
Corporate
The Group has corporate offices in the United Kingdom (London)  
and the Republic of Kazakhstan (Astana). The London office was 
established in mid-2007 and through 2007/08 staff numbers were 
increased to meet the requirements of a public limited company. The 
increase in Corporate’s costs largely reflects this growth although, in 
addition, the increase also reflected the introduction of a Long Term 
Incentive Plan during 2008. Corporate costs in 2007 included US$182 
million of exceptional items relating to the IPO.
Income tax expense
The Group’s income tax expense for the year ended 31 December 2008 
is US$1,143 million (2007: US$507 million) an effective tax rate of 
29.9% (2007: 38.4%).
The tax expense in 2008 benefited from a release of deferred tax 
liabilities of US$177 million. This arose from the new Tax Code of  
the Republic of Kazakhstan effective 1 January 2009, announced  
in mid-December 2008, which reduced the future rates of Corporate 
Income Tax. This was partly offset by a higher charge for Excess Profit 
Tax, arising from increased revenue, amounting to US$90 million 
(2007: US$38 million). 
Excluding the one-off benefit from the release of the deferred tax 
liability and the effects of one-off statutory provisions the effective  
tax rate was 33.5%.
The tax rate in 2007 was adversely affected by non-allowable 
IPO-related costs and other disallowed expenses. 
Liquidity 
The Group aims to manage liquidity risk through the maintenance of 
sufficient cash to finance the ongoing operating and investing activities 
of the Group. Healthy production volumes and record prices in many of 
our key commodities during 2008 has resulted in the generation of 
strong cash flows throughout our operations.
Overview
The table on the left provides a summarised cash flow statement for the 
years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.
Net cash generated flow from operating activities
The Group generated cash of US$2,766 million (2007: US$1,079 
million) from operating activities. The increase of US$1,687 million was 
largely due to the rise in revenue from higher commodity sales prices in 
the first nine months of 2008.
Net cash used for investing activities
In 2008 the Group utilised US$1,919 million for investing activities 
(2007: US$1,351 million), an increase of US$568 million, or 42.0%.  
This largely consisted of purchases of property, plant and equipment 
amounting to US$1,479 million, and the acquisitions of Serov: US$72 
million; BML, US$317 million; and Tuoli, US$15 million. 
Net cash flow used for financing activities
The Group used cash resources of US$854 million for its financing 
activities in 2008, primarily for the repayment of bank borrowings  
of US$704 million and dividends paid to shareholders in the period  
of US$148 million.

Contractual obligations
Long-term supply agreements
The Group has the following key long-term supply agreements:
Alumina – ENRC has a contract with UC RUSAL, a large aluminium > >
producer, to supply a minimum of 1.2 million tonnes of alumina per 
annum, plus an option to supply an additional 200 thousand tonnes 
per annum. The contract expires on 31 December 2016. Pricing is 
determined by a formula linked to the LME aluminium price.
Iron ore – ENRC has a contract with MMK, a large Russian steel > >
producer, to supply, up to 15 million tonnes per annum of saleable 
iron ore concentrate and pellets. This contract expires in 2017. 
Pricing is determined by reference to published price indices for  
iron ore concentrates and pellets.
Factors affecting comparability
Key factors affecting comparability of the Group’s results of operations 
and financial condition include:
Relationship with MMK
MMK has been one of the Group’s principal customers. In Q1 2007  
the results of operations of the Iron Ore Division were materially and 
adversely affected by protracted contractual negotiations with MMK, 
which resulted in reduced prices. 
The Group and MMK reached agreement and signed a long-term  
supply contract that became effective in April 2007 and will expire in 
2017. Under this agreement, MMK is required to purchase specified 
quantities of iron ore products at prices determined by reference to 
published world price indices for concentrates and pellets. Prices are 
revised each year on 1 April. 
In light of the current economic downturn and the impact on our 
customer MMK, in Q4 2008 we agreed to temporarily waive the 
minimum contractual sales volume (refer to Operating Review).
Initial Public Offering (‘IPO’)
The Group undertook an Initial Public Offering in Q4 2007. This resulted 
in the receipt of US$ 3.1 billion of cash proceeds in December 2007. In 
2007 costs amounting to US$278 million were incurred in connection 
with the IPO. Of these US$96 million were recorded in the share 
premium account as directly attributable to the equity cost and US$182 
million were recorded within ‘selling, general and administrative 
expenses’ in the Income Statement. Given the non-recurring nature  
of these costs, they have been classified in the Income Statement  
as ‘exceptional items’ and hence excluded from underlying EBITDA.
Production cutbacks in Q4 2008
In the Ferroalloys Division, in response to the significant weakening  
in demand following the economic slowdown, ferrochrome production 
volumes were cut in Q4 2008 by approximately 35% (referenced to the 
2007 sales volumes), or 85 thousand tonnes, principally high-carbon 
ferrochrome, with an accompanying reduction in chrome ore extraction. 
In addition the Group cut back production in the higher cost operations 
of Serov, by approximately 40% against Q3 2008, and in Tuoli where 
production was suspended. Late in 2008 the Ferroalloys Division  
cut back a further 15 thousand tonnes, sales being supplied from 
inventory, in order to minimise stock being carried forward. In Q4  
2008 total ferroalloys production (excluding Serov and Tuoli) declined 
33.9% relative to Q3 2008, reducing full year production of the 
like-for-like businesses to below that of the prior year. Manganese 
related production, a product of opportunity for the Group  
although not a significant business, was reduced in response  
to the market environment.
In the Iron Ore Division, production of primary concentrate was cut in 
Q4 2008 by approximately 50% (referenced to the 2007 sales volumes 
run rate), or approximately 2 million tonnes, with an accompanying 
reduction in iron ore extraction. 
Acquisitions
We completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Serov 
group and certain related entities (‘Serov’) in early April 2008. Serov is 
a ferroalloy producer in eastern Russia. In mid-October 2008 the Group 
announced the completion of the acquisition of a 50% stake in Xinjiang 
Tuoli, a Chinese ferroalloys producer.
The acquisition of a 50% interest in BML was announced on 19 May 
2008. BML is focused on the development of an iron ore deposit in the 
Bahia State of Brazil.

Corporate Responsibility Review
Introduction
We believe that corporate responsibility means ensuring that we 
conduct our operations in a way that brings benefits to our employees, 
customers, wider stakeholders and the communities in which we 
operate. We believe that it encompasses elements such as trust  
and reliability and the process of reducing costs and identifying and 
mitigating risks within the corporate strategy. For us, sustainable 
development is about managing the total impact of our business  
for the longer term. 
We are committed to improving our performance over the long term  
so as to operate in line with international expectations and mining 
practices. We use the International Council for Mining and Metals 
(ICMM) to guide our action plans as we move towards international 
standards. We already operate to the standards consistent with best 
practice in the Republic of Kazakhstan, but as we develop our 
international presence there are increased expectations that we move 
away from emerging market standards to achieve international 
standards. This is an ongoing objective for the Group and one that will 
continue to remain in focus for the foreseeable future.
Governance
The Group believes it is important to have a high standard of 
governance with clear line of sight objectives in order to achieve  
its sustainable strategy. The Health, Safety, Environment and 
Sustainability Committee (HSES) is a Committee of the Board  
and was established in late 2007. The Committee is chaired by  
Dr Johannes Sittard, the Chief Executive Officer. The other members 
include two non-executive Directors, Mr Eduard Utepov and  
Mr Abdraman Yedilbayev, and Mr Felix Vulis, the Chief Operating  
Officer of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
During the year the HSES Committee met three times. In particular  
the Committee focused upon:
 
formulating a policy on health, safety and environmental issues, > >
with a particular emphasis on health and safety; 
monitoring the development of the governance framework in the > >
Republic of Kazakhstan and strengthening the divisional reporting 
lines; and
initiating a review of areas of corporate responsibility where new  > >
or revised policies are required.
The HSES Committee is supported by the HSES Working Group which 
comprises the Group Heads of Environment, Health and Safety, Human 
Resources and Social Policy. The Working Group has responsibility  
for monitoring HSE programme implementation, changing regulatory 
requirements, the development of action plans and proposals for 
operational improvements. During the year new terms of reference  
for the Working Group were adopted.

The responsibilities of divisional heads for sustainable issues were 
increased during the year to facilitate wider implementation of new 
policies and standards and develop consistent standards of reporting 
to senior management. There was a particular focus on responsibility 
for health and safety issues in accordance with the implementation of 
new safety standards across all operating sites.
The Board adopted a Code of Conduct during 2007 which sets the 
required standards of behaviour for each employee throughout the 
Group. In addition, a number of policies including a whistleblowing 
policy and a new procurement policy were established and rolled out 
during 2008 and early in 2009 with the intention of reinforcing the  
high ethical standards which the Group expects of all its employees.
ENRC was the first organisation in the Republic of Kazakhstan to 
become a signatory to the UN Global Compact and this has provided  
a framework for greater interaction with other corporations in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. ENRC is also an active member of the 
Kazakhstan Business Council for Sustainable Development which  
was formed in line with the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development and progress continues to be made in developing the 
remit of the Business Council in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Key areas for HSES governance developments in 2009
Our goals for 2009 are to:
continue to monitor the implementation of the new safety > >
management programme and performance under the programme  
at the nominated operational sites;
incorporate sustainable development risk management into the > >
governance structure;
further strengthen the divisional reporting of performance to the > >
HSES Committee and achieve consistency in the provision of key 
management information; and
establish a framework to set measurable targets for selected > >
sustainable development indicators in line with GRI/ICMM.
Health and safety
Safety
Mining is a hazardous industry and the failure to adopt high  
standards of health and safety impacts on both our employees and  
the communities in which we operate. Safety was identified as a key 
area of focus during 2007 and has continued to be so during 2008.
There were nine fatal accidents at ENRC sites during 2008 (2007: 15). 
Whilst any fatality is a major disappointment to the management  
team, we believe that the significant reduction in fatal accidents is  
an indication of the impact of the increased level of focus on safety  
within the Group. This provides us with an added incentive to continue

During the year the Group engaged the services of DuPont in order  
to carry out a full safety management evaluation at a number of our 
operational sites in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The work carried out 
by DuPont included detailed investigation of safety standards, quality 
of equipment and cultural and behavioural attitudes towards safety. 
DuPont identified a strong commitment at senior management and 
divisional management level to improve safety at operational sites. In 
addition, comprehensive training programmes and physical inspection 
programmes were operating and safety departments were well 
organised and staffed by well qualified people. There were established 
safety procedures and several locations had been awarded or were in 
the process of applying for OSHAS 18001 accreditation. However, 
cultural and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the 
number of accidents and DuPont identified that the majority of 
accidents at ENRC sites were due to behavioural issues or as a result  
of violations of safety rules. 
As a result of the DuPont findings, the Safety Policy was reviewed  
and the following changes made:
The goal of zero fatalities was changed to one of zero injuries. > >
Whilst management recognises that this is extremely difficult to 
achieve in a hazardous industry such as mining, they also believe 
that implementing this objective will raise aspirations amongst  
the workforce to improve safety at all levels.
A clear statement was issued that safety is deemed to be equal in > >
priority to production and other business parameters and that 
safety principles will not be sacrificed for business gain.

In addition, DuPont recommended the introduction of corporate safety 
standards to be used by each operating company by the use of a formal 
risk assessment standard to be applied at all locations. The risk 
assessment standard would be used to reduce the level of risk in the 
operation and set a maximum acceptable level of risk for any activity. 
In order to develop an established culture of safe working, 
management selected Kazchrome to function as a pilot site where  
new levels of safety management will be introduced. This second  
stage involves implementing new safety standards at all levels  
within the plant and the development of a formal safety performance 
appraisal system with specific, measurable objectives for all managers 
and the achievement of the safety objectives to be linked to bonus, 
salary and promotion. 
It is intended that once sustained change in behavioural attitudes 
towards safety standards has been established in Kazchrome, these 
practices will then be rolled out across all the Group’s operational sites 
in order to develop a higher standard of safety culture in ENRC and 
significantly reduce the number of accidents. It is anticipated that it  
will take approximately two years to complete the transition process.
As part of the ongoing focus on improved safety standards, two  
health and safety training modules were developed by the Group  
and introduced to all Divisions. These modules have been designed  
in line with the UK National Examination Board of Occupational Safety 
and Health (NEBOSH). To date 59 managers have received training 
under these modules.
Looking ahead
Safety will remain an area of key focus during 2009 and will include:
Implementation of the new safety management standards in > >
Kazchrome and preparatory work to establish a framework to  
roll the standards out to all operational sites.
Further training of employees to NEBOSH standards. > >
Development of safety performance appraisal systems and risk > >
assessment standards.
Further develop reporting procedures to align against  > >
international norms.
Health
The provision of employee health and medical programmes is an 
expected element of corporate duties and these programmes have 
been a core element of management focus for a number of years.  
We provide extended programmes to our employees and their families 
on a voluntary basis and we believe the programmes we operate are 
amongst best practice in the Republic of Kazakhstan. No major health 
concerns have arisen during the year.

There is an ongoing focus on reducing the health risk to our employees 
by replacing old equipment with equipment featuring enhanced  
health and safety design. In addition, new policies to enforce the  
use of personal protective equipment have been adopted during  
the year as part of the new safety management system.
Looking ahead
Goals for occupational health improvement in 2009 will include:
Continued investment in improved preventative measures to reduce > >
occupational health exposures in areas of dust control, ventilation,

Further focus on training to reduce occupational health risks. > >
Social policy
The Group has a solid reputation in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 
being a socially orientated and responsible business. It works closely 
with the Kazakh Government to implement governmental agreements, 
programmes and initiatives related to implementing the Law of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan ‘On Social Partnership’.
During the year ENRC has produced a social framework to replace 
separate operating site policies. The social policy focuses on two  
key areas: Employees and Communities.
Employees
ENRC is one of the largest employers in the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
During 2008 the Group employed 66,567 employees (2007: 64,150).  
As a consequence, our success as a Group depends significantly  
on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key management and 
employees and this is an area of focus for senior management.  
In particular, management is keen to introduce innovative training 
programmes to help develop employees and encourage them to  
reach their maximum potential.
As part of the development of a corporate culture throughout  
the organisation, members of senior management regularly visit  
the Republic of Kazakhstan to meet with employees at the  
operational sites. 
The Group benefits from good labour relations and has not experienced 
any material strikes or stoppages at any of its operating sites since it 
acquired its operating assets. The majority of employees in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan are members of trade unions and the Group 
makes significant efforts to engage and work with the trade unions.  
As a result, the Group has well-balanced industrial agreements and 
these serve as a basis for the collective agreements each Group 
company has signed with employees. In addition to the social rights 
and benefits guaranteed by the Kazakhstani Labour Code, these 
agreements provide for free medical treatment, loans at favourable 
mortgage rates, training of employees and their children and 
preferential packages to sanatoriums, recreation centres and children’s 
recreation camps. Special social programmes are developed for both 
young people and pensioners.
The impact of the current economic downturn started to be felt most 
keenly by the Group during the fourth quarter of 2008. The imposition 
of production cuts, particularly during the winter, and the resulting 
effect on our employees has been an area of concern for senior 
management. Steps have been taken to try and mitigate the impact of 
production cuts on employees by utilising shorter working hours, job 
sharing and unpaid leave. A number of the Group’s plants are located  
in remote and inaccessible areas in the Republic of Kazakhstan and  
the community infrastructure, including housing, is largely provided  
by ENRC. Management is particularly focused on ensuring that no 
employee loses the right to housing during the current difficulties.
In addition to the social programmes provided for employees in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, ENRC has continued to develop the Talent 
Management Programme during the year. This was introduced in  
order to provide training and development related programmes for 
employees. The main training programmes seek to develop the skills  
of employees to better equip them for their current roles and to 
upgrade their capabilities so as to enable them to progress within  
the organisation.

The Talent Management Programme is also designed to accelerate the 
development of management skills within the Group. The Programme 
offers training for junior management via the ENRC Manager Standard; 
the ENRC Mini-MBA for middle management and the MBA programme  
of Moscow State University Higher School of Business for senior 
management. During the year 650 employees benefited from 
management training under one of the above schemes and the  
Group intends to maintain the level of participation during 2009.
During 2008 the Company made the first awards under its Long Term 
Incentive Plan. The Plan is designed to incentivise and retain key 
employees, many of whom work at operational sites in the Republic  
of Kazakhstan or in ENRC’s Astana office. 
Looking ahead
During 2009 the areas for focus will include:
Continuation of the Talent Management Programme. > >
Development of skills improvement upgrades. > >
Re-training where appropriate. > >
Ethics training. > >
Communities
ENRC operating sites are often located in remote areas of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan and frequently the Group is the only industry operating 
in that area. Maintenance of a responsible social contract with these 
communities is an established practice in ENRC because many of the 
towns and cities rely on the infrastructure development provided by  
the Group. 
Each year the Group signs agreements with regional Governors in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan and provides financial support, latterly through 
the funds Umit Oty and Kokzhiek, and during 2008 through Komek. 
The ENRC Komek Corporate Foundation was established during  
2008 and is a non-commercial and charitable organisation which  
will finance cultural, educational and other social activities in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. Its long term focus is on the implementation  
of programmes aimed at supporting ENRC’s own workforce, such as 
improvements to housing conditions, professional staff training and 
education, as well as the programmes aimed at improving the welfare 
of the general public, such as development of scientific, technical and 
artistic creativity, protection of public health, supporting children’s 
homes, schools and higher education institutions, as well as 
environmental protection.
The Foundation signed agreements with the Governors of Aktobe, 
Kostanai, Karaganda and Pavlodar regions to finance social projects  
in these regions during 2008. 
In Aktobe the projects included donations to Alginsk Orphanage, 
support to families and the construction of churches and mosques in 
Chromtau and Aktobe. In Kostanai the contributions included support 
for several sports initiatives, including the development of ice hockey 
facilities. In Karaganda most of the funds were allocated to the 
provision of housing and in Pavlodar the funds were used for the 
development of sports facilities and the provision of housing in 
Ekibastuz and Aksu.
The Group expenditure for Community Social Investment in 2008 
amounted to US$31 million (2007: US$34 million).
Looking ahead
During 2009 we will continue to focus on:
the continued development of Komek; > >
continued social housing construction in collaboration with  > >
local authorities; and
closer engagement with local NGOs and other stakeholders  > >
to identify community needs and social projects.
Environment
Improvements in environmental protection have been an area of focus 
for ENRC management for a number of years. ENRC commenced the 
phased implementation of formal management systems in 2003 
including the implementation of ISO 9001 systems for all operations 
and ISO 14001 environmental management systems for Ferroalloys, 
Iron Ore, Alumina and Aluminium and Energy divisions. ENRC was  
the first organisation in the Republic of Kazakhstan to implement  
an environmental management system certified for ISO 14001. 
As the Group develops internationally, it is keen to raise its 
environmental standards to match international norms. A new 
environmental code was adopted in the Republic of Kazakhstan in 
2007 and it is anticipated that environmental regulations will tighten in 
future to correspond with tightening regulations across the world. The 
Group hopes to anticipate such regulations by investing in projects to 
reduce its environmental impact. These include:
Investing in new technologies to replace older technologies  > >
and minimise environmental impact.
Resource conservation – use less to produce more. > >
Improving performance measurement systems. > >
ENRC monitors its air emissions, wastewater discharges and the 
amount of waste generated and tests the quality of ambient air,  
nearby surface water, soil and groundwater. Renewal of environmental 
permits requires the submission of an annual statistical report on the 
monitoring results to the Republic of Kazakhstan’s environmental 
authorities. The provision of such permits may require an 
environmental payment to be made in respect of routine operations 
and non-compliance may result in penalties. 
The environmental authorities in the Republic of Kazakhstan conduct 
regular inspections of ENRC site operations and penalties may be 
imposed as a result of the findings. In 2008 the amount of state 
inspection penalties was US$31,000 (2007: US$ 42,000).
During the year, ENRC made progress in respect of wastewater 
management and waste disposal. A new Chemicals Policy was  
adopted during 2008 and management focused on reducing  
the impact of hazardous waste by introducing a chemical waste 
management system. 
There were no major environmental incidents during 2008. 
Looking ahead
In 2009 we will focus on:
maximising reuse and recycling water at operational sites  > >
to reduce consumption of fresh water;
reducing energy consumption; > >
designing a framework for setting targets in relation to  > >
waste management, air emissions and water discharges;
continue to focus on replacing older technology with new > >
technology with improved air emissions standards; and
developing the existing environmental database, performance > >
indicators and benchmarks to move towards common international 
approaches for reporting.

Corporate Information Reserves Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Group Overview
Amendments to the articles of association
The Company’s articles of association may only be amended by a 
special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. A special 
resolution proposing further amendments to the articles of association 
required as a result of the Companies Act 2006, and to amend the 
Company’s borrowing powers to reflect current practice, will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Conflicts of interest
The articles of association were amended at the 2008 AGM with effect 
from 1 October 2008 to accommodate the changes implemented by the 
Companies Act 2006 relating to Directors’ conflicts of interest. The new 
articles permit the Board to consider and, if it sees fit, to authorise 
situations where a Director has an interest that conflicts, or may 
possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company. The Board has a 
formal system in place for Directors to declare any conflicts or potential 
conflicts and for these to then be considered for authorisation by the 
Nomination Committee. In deciding whether to authorise such conflicts 
or potential conflicts, the Nomination Committee members must act in 
the way they consider would be most likely to promote the success of 
the Company and they may impose limits or conditions when giving 
authorisation or subsequently if they think this is appropriate. The 
Nomination Committee will provide a formal report to the Board on 
conflicts of interest on an annual basis.
Major interests in shares
The Company has been notified that as at 31 March 2009, the  
following shareholders own more than 3% of the issued share capital

Relationship agreements
On 7 December 2007, Mr Chodiev, Mr Ibragimov and Mr Mashkevitch 
entered into a separate relationship agreement with the Company to 
regulate the ongoing relationship between each Founder Shareholder 
and the Company. The principal purpose of the relationship 
agreements is to ensure that transactions and relationships between 
the Group and the Founder Shareholders are at arm’s length and on a 
normal commercial basis. Under the terms of the relationship 
agreements, each Founder Shareholder has a right to appoint a Director 
to the Board as detailed in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 
59 to 63. As at the date of this Report, only Mr Ibragimov has exercised 
this right.
Branches outside the UK
The Group operates sales and marketing offices in Beijing, Dubai, 
Moscow and Zurich.
Employees
Detailed information about employees is disclosed in the Corporate 
Responsibility Review on pages 48 to 55.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of trading with suppliers in 
advance and to make payment in accordance with these terms. 
Suppliers in the Republic of Kazakhstan often require prepayment and 
the average number of creditor days outstanding for the Group as at  
31 December 2008 was 34 days (2007: 24 days). The average creditor 
days outstanding as at 31 December 2008 for the Company was nil 
days (2007: nil days).
Post balance sheet events
The Company acquired an interest in Shubarkol Komir JSC which was 
announced 16 February 2009. Details can be found in note 37 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 115 and 116.
Political and charitable donations
Sponsorship and donations amounted to US$31 million (2007: US$34 
million). During the year, the Group provided the bulk of its charitable 
financial support through ENRC Komek, a corporate foundation 
established in the Republic of Kazakhstan during 2008. Komek is a 
non-commercial and charitable organisation which will finance cultural, 
educational and other social activities in the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
The Group regards the provision of charitable donations as an 
important part of its strategy to maintain good working relationships 
with local authorities.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, certain Kazakh operating 
entities of the Group made charitable donations to the ‘Umit Oty’ fund 
and the ‘Kokzhiek’ fund registered in the Republic of Kazakhstan and 
controlled by the Founder Shareholders. The total donated to these 
funds amounted to US$22.1 million.
A further description of donations can be found in the Corporate 
Responsibility Review.

policies, together with details of financial instruments are described  
in the Risk Management section on pages 22 and 25 notes 19 and 34

Value of land
Most of the Group’s interests in mining properties and leases, and in 
other land and buildings have been included in the financial 
statements at cost in accordance with its accounting policies. It is not 
possible to estimate the market value of such interests in land as this 
will depend on product prices over the long term which will vary with 
market conditions
Significant agreements
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of a 
change of control of the Company.

Corporate Governance continued
Directors’ Report continued
Article 71 of the Kazakhstan Subsurface Law
The Republic of Kazakhstan may be entitled to exercise pre-emptive 
rights over certain issuances or sales of ordinary shares or assets 
shared by the Group. Article 71 of the Kazakhstan Subsurface Law 
provides that the Republic of Kazakhstan has pre-emptive rights to 
purchase certain subsurface use rights or indirect or direct interests  
in companies having subsurface use rights for sale. This pre-emptive 
right permits the Republic of Kazakhstan to purchase any such 
subsurface use rights or equity interests being offered for sale on  
no less favourable terms than those offered by other purchasers.
Structured Trade Finance Facility
On 15 December 2006, ENRC Marketing AG entered into a Structured 
Trade Finance Facility with ABN AMRO Bank NV, Barclays Capital and 
Deutsche Bank AG Amsterdam Branch as Arrangers and Original 
lenders, Deutsche Bank AG Amsterdam Branch as Agent and Deutsche 
Bank AG Amsterdam as Security Trustee to borrow up to US$1,000 
million from a syndicate of lenders. By a Supplemental Agreement 
dated 12 April 2007 the Facility was increased to US$1,480 million.  
If one of the following events occurs:
(i) the Founder Shareholders together no longer have Shareholder 
Control or Effective Control; or
(ii) a person or persons acting in concert had Effective Control or 
Shareholder Control or owns more shares in the relevant holding 
company of the Group than are held by the Founder Shareholders 
at the date of the Facility; or
(iii) ENRC Marketing and Kazchrome cease to be subsidiaries of the 
same holding company,
then any Lender may decline to fund a drawdown and any Lender may 
cancel its commitment under the Facility and require its portion of any 
outstanding loans be due and payable in full at the end of the then 
current interest period.
For these purposes, ‘Shareholder Control’ means holding directly or 
indirectly shares in the issued share capital of ENRC Marketing carrying 
the rights to exercise more than 30% of the votes exercisable at a 
general meeting of the shareholders of ENRC Marketing, and ‘Effective 
Control’ means the ability to give directions with respect to the 
operating and financial policies of a company with which the directors 
or equivalent officers of such company are obliged to comply (ignoring, 
for the avoidance of doubt, the powers of any sub-committee of the 
board of directors or equivalent to which the board of directors have 
delegated certain of their powers).
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
The Group’s external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have 
indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution 
seeking to re-appoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Each of the Directors at the date of approval of this report  
confirms that:
(i) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
(ii) the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as  
a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of the 
information.
The confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance  
with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.

The Group’s statement on Corporate Governance is included  
in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 59 to 63 of these

Corporate Information Reserves Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Group Overview
Compliance with the Combined Code
ENRC is committed to high standards of corporate governance. This report details how the Company has applied the principles and provisions of 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the ‘Code’) published in June 2006. ENRC has complied fully with the Code during the financial 
year ended 31 December 2008.
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for promoting the long-term success of the Company and ensuring that its principal goal is to enhance the Company’s 
long-term value for the benefit of shareholders, whilst having regard to the interests of other stakeholders. At its regular meetings the Board 
reviews the Company’s long-term strategic direction, capital expenditure and budget plans and monitors on a regular basis the Company’s 
operating and financial performance and its approach to risk management. The Board also reviews management performance and assesses 
whether the Company has the necessary resources in place to meet its objectives. The Board has established a formal schedule of matters which 
are reserved for its attention and which are published on the Company’s website.
Board composition
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are clearly separated and their responsibilities have been set out in writing. The Board is 
chaired by Sir David Cooksey and he is responsible for leading the Board and ensuring it functions effectively. Dr Johannes Sittard is the Chief 
Executive Officer and he is responsible for the operational management of the Group and the execution of the Group’s strategy.
The Board currently comprises, in addition to the Chairman, two executive Directors and ten non-executive Directors, seven of whom are 
independent according to the definition in the Code.
Mr Utepov and Mr Beketayev are representatives of The State Property and Privatisation Committee of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic  
of Kazakhstan, and as such are not considered by the Board to be independent under the provisions of the Code.
Under the Relationship Agreements between the Company and each of the Founder Shareholders (as disclosed in the Directors’ Report on pages 
56 to 58), each of the Founders Shareholders has the right to appoint one Director to the Board, for so long as his shareholder group controls 10% 
or more of the voting rights exercisable at general meetings of the Company. Pursuant to this right, Mr Ibragimov has appointed Mr Yedilbayev to 
the Board. He is not considered to be independent under the Code.
Sir Richard Sykes has been appointed as Senior Independent Director and his principal duty in this capacity is to evaluate the performance  
of the Chairman and address any shareholders’ concerns that have not been resolved through the normal channels of communication with the 
Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief Financial Officer, or in cases when such communications would be inappropriate.
Details of the individuals’ skills and experience are contained within the Directors’ biographies on pages 10 and 11.
Directors’ attendance at Board and Committee meetings during 2008
During 2008 there were eight formal Board meetings and attendance at these meetings and the meetings of the Board’s main Committees was

Corporate Governance continued
Corporate Governance Report continued
Information and professional development of the Board
The Board is supplied with regular and timely information in a form  
that enables it to discharge its duties. Board papers are generally 
distributed five days in advance of meetings to enable Directors to 
obtain a thorough understanding of the matters to be discussed. The 
Board also holds at least one formal meeting per year in the Republic  
of Kazakhstan to enable Directors to gain a greater understanding of 
the Group’s operating environment.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising  
the Board on corporate governance matters and ensuring that Board 
procedures and applicable laws and regulations are followed. The 
General Counsel and Company Secretary provides regular updates to 
the Board on the legal and regulatory environment and is responsible 
for ensuring that any other training needs are identified and met. On 
appointment, Directors are provided with adequate information to 
ensure that they fully understand the business of the Group and their 
legal and regulatory responsibilities as a Director of the Company.  
The appointment and removal of the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary is a matter for the Board.
The Board has put in place a procedure whereby all Directors have 
access, through the General Counsel and Company Secretary, to 
independent professional advice at the expense of the Company. The 
Company also maintains an appropriate level of Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance. An indemnity was put in place during 2008 for the 
benefit of current Directors and Officers of the Company and those of 
its subsidiaries to enable the Company to fund the costs incurred by 
Directors in defending certain claims against them in relation to their 
duties as Directors. The indemnity operates only to the extent that the 
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance does not afford protection.
Board Evaluation
As 2008 was the first full year in which the Board worked together, the 
decision was taken to appoint an external consultant to carry out the 
first annual Board Evaluation. This was facilitated by means of an 
in-depth structured interview with each Director. Questions focused  
on the operation of the Board and its committees, the contributions  
of individual Directors and a review of the Chairman’s performance.  
The results of the review were then considered with the Chairman and 
subsequently discussed collectively by the Board.
The Board was satisfied that considerable advances had been made 
during the first year of working together but additional progress was  
to be expected over time. There will be additional follow-up meetings 
during the early part of 2009 to ensure that further improvements  
in effectiveness are implemented during the year and in 2010.
The non-executive Directors, led by Sir Richard Sykes as Senior 
Independent Director, carried out an evaluation of the Chairman.
Re-election of Directors
All the Directors offered themselves for election at the AGM held in June 
2008 because this was the first general meeting to take place since 
incorporation. Under the current articles of association, a minimum of 
one-third of the Directors retire by rotation each year. This ensures that 
each Director is re-elected at least every three years. Details of the 
Directors retiring by rotation at the forthcoming AGM are contained in 
the Notice of Meeting which accompanies the Report & Accounts. The 
Board remains satisfied that each Director proposed for re-election is 
competent to carry out his responsibilities as a member of the Board.
Board committees
The Board has established four principal committees.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr Gerhard Ammann, who is 
considered to have recent and relevant financial experience. The other 
members of the Audit Committee are Mr Michael Eggleton, Sir Paul 
Judge, Mr Kenneth Olisa and Mr Roderick Thomson, all of whom are 
independent non-executive Directors. Each member is considered to 
have extensive commercial and business leadership experience.
Under its terms of reference the Audit Committee is required to meet at 
least four times a year at appropriate times in the reporting and audit 
cycle. Meetings are timed so as to enable the Committee to review  
the Group’s key financial announcements prior to release. The Audit 
Committee Chairman provides a verbal update on the Committee 
findings and recommendations at the next Board meeting, identifying 
any matters in respect of which action or improvement is required.
Invitations to attend Audit Committee meetings are extended to the 
Chief Financial Officer, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the Head of 
Internal Audit, the General Counsel and Company Secretary and the 
Group Risk Manager, none of whom attend by right. In addition, the 
external auditors attend each Committee meeting and also meet 
separately with the Committee to facilitate discussions without the 
presence of management.
The primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee include  
the following:
To monitor the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting. > >
To review the Group’s internal control and risk management > >
systems.
To monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function. > >
To oversee the relationship with the Group’s external auditors. > >
Committee activities
The Committee met five times during 2008.
During the year the Committee reviewed the Company’s Preliminary 
and Interim announcement of results and received regular reports from 
the internal audit function, the external auditors and updates on risk 
management and internal controls. The Committee also reviewed the 
2008 Budget and financial reporting procedures to be operated by  
the Group.
External audit
The overall performance of the auditors is reviewed annually by the 
Audit Committee. Since 2008 was the first full year since the Company’s 
IPO, this review was carried out shortly after the year end so as to 
enable full consideration to be given to performance over the year  
in question.
The Audit Committee is responsible to the Board for ensuring that the 
external auditor remains independent of the Company in all material 
respects and that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as external auditors, 
are adequately resourced so as to enable the delivery of an objective 
audit to the shareholders. The Audit Committee is also responsible for 
making formal recommendations each year to the Board in respect of 
the continuation of the external auditor in office.
The Audit Committee also reviews the level and nature of any non-audit 
work to be performed during the year and considers whether it is 
appropriate for this work to be carried out by the external auditors. The 
auditors are precluded from engaging in non-audit services that would 
compromise their independence or violate any laws or regulations 
affecting their appointment as auditors.

Corporate Information Reserves Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Group Overview
Internal Audit
During the first half of 2008 the internal audit function was in a 
developmental stage and the Audit Committee appointed Deloitte  
& Touche to assist with some of the internal audit work whilst the 
recruitment of a full team of internal auditors was completed. Deloitte 
& Touche carried out internal audit work in accordance with the initial 
annual internal audit plan which was approved by the Audit Committee 
in February 2008 and regular updates on progress were provided to the 
Committee during the year.
During the second half of 2008 a new Head of Internal Audit was 
appointed and his team continued to develop its working practices.  
The 2009 Internal Plan was approved in December 2008. The Head of 
Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee at each of its meetings 
and provides assurance, independent of the assurance provided by the 
Chief Financial Officer, that control activities, which have been subject 
to audit by his team, are operating effectively.
Whistleblowing
The whistleblowing policy approved by the Board in July 2007 was 
disseminated throughout the Group during 2008. The policy enables 
employees to raise any concerns they may have about workplace fraud 
or mismanagement with local management on a confidential basis. The 
complaint will then be investigated in the first instance and a decision 
taken about further steps. Feedback is provided to the person making 
the complaint. Written records are kept of all whistleblowing incidents 
and a regular status report is presented to the Board.
Health, Safety, Environment & Sustainability Committee  
(HSES Committee)
The HSES Committee is chaired by Dr Johannes Sittard. The other 
members comprise Mr Abdraman Yedilbayev and Mr Eduard Utepov 
who are both non-executive Directors of the Company and Mr Felix 
Vulis, the Chief Operating Officer for the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The primary role of the HSES Committee is to assist the Board in its 
oversight of health, safety and environmental risks and to monitor  
the Group’s health and safety performance and its compliance with 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Further details of the work of the HSES Committee are set out in the 
Corporate Responsibility Review on pages 48 and 55.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Sir David Cooksey. The other 
Committee members are Mr Gerhard Ammann, Mr Mehmet Dalman,  
Mr Michael Eggleton, Sir Paul Judge, Mr Kenneth Olisa, Sir Richard 
Sykes and Mr Roderick Thomson.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the size, structure and 
composition of the Board, taking into account the skills, knowledge 
and experience of Directors and for recommending to the Board any 
potential new candidates. The Committee also gives consideration as 
to whether non-executive Directors have sufficient time to devote to  
the proper performance of their duties and makes recommendations in 
relation to the retirement and re-election of Directors at the Company’s 
AGM. In addition, the Committee has assumed day to day responsibility 
for monitoring Directors’ situational conflicts of interest or potential 
conflicts of interest in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
will provide a formal report to the Board on an annual basis. However, 
the actual approval of any conflicts or potential conflicts remains the 
responsibility of the Board.
The Committee is required to meet at least twice a year and during 
2008 it met four times. One of these meetings was to consider a 
replacement non-executive Director representing the Government  
of the Republic of Kazakhstan following the resignation of Mr Daulet 
Yergozhin on 20 February 2008. Accordingly, Mr Marat Beketayev  
was recommended and subsequently appointed to the Board.
At its other meetings during the year, the Committee reviewed the 
composition of the Board and considered the succession planning 
process for the senior management team, including the process  
around the extension of the CEO’s contract and the CFO’s decision  
to step down in June 2009.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the  
Company’s website.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Sir Richard Sykes and the 
other members are Mr Mehmet Dalman, Sir Paul Judge and Mr Kenneth 
Olisa all of whom are independent non-executive Directors. The 
Company complies with the Code recommendations regarding 
membership of the Remuneration Committee.
The main roles of the Remuneration Committee are as follows:
To determine and recommend to the Board the broad policy for the > >
remuneration of Executive Directors and members of the senior 
management team.
To determine the policy and scope for pension rights for each > >
Executive Director.
To approve the design of any performance related pay schemes > >
operated by the Group and determine the relevant performance 
targets as well as approving annual payments made under such 
schemes.
To review the design of any share incentive plans for approval by the > >
Board and shareholders and to determine the performance targets 
and the appropriate level of annual awards to be made.
To ensure that any compensation payments made in respect of > >
termination of contracts are fair to the individual but do not reward 
failure and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised.
The remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive Directors is a 
matter for decision by the full Board.
During 2008 the Remuneration Committee met four times. The 
Committee met to approve the bonus payments awarded in respect of 
performance in 2007 and to determine and approve the performance 
targets for bonus arrangements in respect of 2008. The Committee also 
determined the performance targets for the Long Term Incentive Plan 
and approved the awards made under the Plan in May 2008.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 64 to 67.  
A resolution to approve the Remuneration Report will be proposed  
at the forthcoming AGM.
The Group’s approach to Risk Assessment, Management and  
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s approach to Risk Management 
as described in the Risk Management section on pages 22 to 25.
Risk assessment
Assessment of the risks which may adversely affect the achievement  
of the Group’s objectives operates throughout the Group. Management 
reviewed the Key Business Risk Assessment in June 2008 and reports 
on Risk Management have been provided to the Audit Committee at 
each meeting during 2008. Management reviews the risk assessment 
on a regular basis.

Corporate Governance continued
Corporate Governance Report continued
As part of the risk assessment process the Group has adopted the 
following approach during 2008:
Management considers risks to the Group under the headings of:
Strategic Objectives – these relate to the Group’s long term > >
business objectives.
Operational Objectives – these relate to effectiveness and > >
efficiency of the Group’s operations, including performance and 
profitability goals and safeguarding resources against loss.
Compliance Objectives – these relate to adherence to the laws  > >
and regulations to which Group companies are subject.
Financial Objectives – these relate to the financial status of the > >
Group and Group companies and their arrangements for financial 
reporting, including the prevention of fraudulent public financial 
reporting.
This approach considers the potential impact of each risk and the 
likelihood of the risk materialising at an ‘inherent’ level, for example, 
before considering any controls which may be in place to manage or 
mitigate the risk.
Response to key business risks
The output of each risk assessment meeting of management is an 
updated list of key business risks which are those risks which have  
a high overall risk rating and therefore most critically require an 
appropriate response; this will require control procedures to be 
implemented to manage or mitigate those risks to a level which  
is consistent with the Group’s overall risk appetite.
The Group recruited a Group Risk Manager in May 2008 to co-ordinate 
the process of responding to Key Business Risks and to report on these 
matters to the Chief Financial Officer and the Audit Committee. Each 
significant Group Company has appointed a Business Risk Manager to 
be the principal point of contact on matters of risk and control within 
that business.
A list of the Key Business Risks arising from the assessment process, 
and the responses to those risks, is maintained by the Business Risk 
Managers. The Group risk matrices are tabled annually for review and 
adoption by the Audit Committee and the Committee receives quarterly 
reports on the risk management activities.
Assurance on the operation of systems of internal control
The Board considers risk assessment and internal control to be 
fundamental to achieving the Group’s strategic corporate objectives. 
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Key elements of the internal control process are as follows:
The Board regularly reviews and updates the Group’s strategy  > >
and those of its operating companies.
The Board reviews performance through a system of reporting, > >
based on an annual budget with monthly business reviews  
against actual results.
The Board seeks assurance that effective control is being > >
maintained and deficiencies addressed through regular reports 
from the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee, on the basis of delegated authority from the 
Board, has completed an annual assessment of the effectiveness of the 
systems of internal control of the Group as required by the Code. The 
2009 assessment represented the first time this process had been 
carried out.
The Group decided to focus the annual assessment on workshops 
which took place in February 2009 and which were attended by the 
General Directors and Financial Directors of each of the Group’s 
operations, supported by senior financial, sales and marketing, legal 
and operational management from throughout the Group.
The workshops focused on policies and guidelines designed to address 
areas identified by management and Internal Audit during 2008  
as requiring improvement as well as the control procedures which  
the Group had already established to manage Key Business Risks. 
These included:
Financial reporting – the adoption of more focused monthly > >
management reporting formats, increased interaction between 
London, Astana and operational business units before each month 
end and by improved monitoring controls in London and Astana.
Procurement – the development of a list of approved suppliers, the > >
implementation of tendering procedures for all significant contracts, 
the creation of an open access procurement website, the restriction 
of the use of intermediaries and the application of rigorous 
budgetary cost control.
Customer credit default – the use of credit insurance for certain > >
commodities, the setting of strict credit limits for each customer, 
the production of weekly information on outstanding receivables 
and close monitoring by the Finance Director of Sales and Marketing 
and the Chief Financial Officer.
Financial counterparty default – creating a list of approved > >
counterparties on the basis of their credit ratings, or where these 
are not available, by an internal assessment of the counterparty’s 
financial strength and by restricting the amounts which may be 
placed with each counterparty.
Capital projects – adopting new procurement policies for all > >
projects, by greater use of external technical advice at the feasibility 
stage of a new project, by subjecting all existing and proposed 
projects to scrutiny by the management of the Group on a regular 
basis and by challenging the inclusion of project spending within 
the 2009 Budget process.
The Audit Committee has reviewed a report from the Chief Financial 
Officer setting out the contents and proceedings of the workshops  
and explaining the basis on which he has obtained assurance as to
the operation of the Group’s systems of internal controls.
The workshops enabled the Group to make progress in the 
development of systems of internal control. The Board recognises  
that there is still significant progress to be made to achieve improved 
and consistent standards of internal control across the Group.
Relations with shareholders
During 2008 the Group met with a large number of investors in the 
United Kingdom, continental Europe and the United States  
of America.
As part of its investor relations programme, the Group aims to provide  
a high level of transparency and communication to investors and 
analysts on a regular and timely basis, through announcements, 
meetings and seminars. The Group seeks to develop a regular  
dialogue with investors and analysts and to respond to their challenges 
and to understand their sentiments and concerns. The Group has  
a comprehensive investor relations website which has up to  
date information available to all shareholders and investors. All 
shareholders have the opportunity to attend and raise questions  
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.

Corporate Information Reserves Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Group Overview
The Group aspires to have an investor relations programme that is 
ranked highly amongst its peers for its accessibility, responsiveness 
and disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
aim to meet all major shareholders at least twice a year and, with other 
senior management, to meet with a wide range of shareholders and 
prospective investors in the United Kingdom, continental Europe, 
Russia and the United States of America during the year. These 
discussions will focus on the results and businesses of the Group  
but will also seek to learn of any concerns amongst investors. The 
Group will also seek to meet with sell-side analysts to raise the Group’s 
profile and to build the research coverage.
Information on investor relations activity and analysts’ and brokers’ 
reports are regularly circulated to the Board. The Chairman and 
non-executive Directors are free to attend investor relations meetings 
or to request meetings with investors or analysts independent of the 
Group’s management.
The second Annual General Meeting is due to be held on 10 June 2008 
and the Board welcomes the opportunity to answer questions put 
forward to them by shareholders of the Company.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectations 
that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Remuneration Report
Introduction
The Remuneration Report has been prepared by the Remuneration 
Committee and approved by the Board and sets out the Group’s 
remuneration policy for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a formal committee of the Board. Its 
remit is set out in terms of reference formally adopted by the Board in 
2007 and which were reviewed and amended in April 2008. The terms 
of reference are designed to enable the Committee to comply with the 
requirements relating to remuneration policy set out in the Code. A 
copy of the terms of reference can be found on the Company’s website.
The principal responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are:
to determine and recommend to the Board a broad framework  > >
for the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Chairman,  
the General Counsel and Company Secretary and other senior 
executives of the Group;
to monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s remuneration policy; > >
to approve the design and performance targets of any performance > >
related pay schemes operated by the Group and to approve the  
total annual payments made under such schemes; and
to review the design of share based incentives and determine the > >
level and extent to which awards are made during the year.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee, all of whom are independent non-
executive Directors and were appointed on 6 December 2007, are  
as follows:
Sir Richard Sykes (Chairman) > >
Mehmet Dalman > >
Sir Paul Judge > >
Kenneth Olisa > >
The General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as Secretary to  
the Committee. The Chief Executive Officer and the Head of Human 
Resources also attend Committee meetings by invitation, but none  
is present when the Committee discusses issues relating to their  
own remuneration.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee
During the year, the Committee retained New Bridge Street Consultants 
and Kepler Associates to provide advice in relation to the Long Term 
Incentive Plan. Neither advisor provided any other service to the 
Group during the year. In making its decisions, the Committee has 
consulted with the Chief Executive Officer and the General Counsel 
and Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is focused upon providing a level  
of remuneration which attracts, retains and motivates Directors  
and senior executives of sufficient calibre to achieve the Group’s 
strategic goals and enhance shareholder value, whilst ensuring  
that remuneration is consistent with best practice and provides an 
appropriate alignment with personal and business performance. The 
Committee recognises that there is a competitive market for successful 
executives with experience in the mining industry and that the 
provision of appropriate rewards for superior performance is important 
for the continued growth of the business. The Committee’s aim in 
formulating remuneration policy is to assess relevant benchmark data 
from sources such as other FTSE 100 companies of a similar size and 
complexity, international mining companies and the market generally. 
In setting remuneration within this framework, the Committee aims to 
give senior executives every encouragement to enhance the Group’s 
performance whilst ensuring that they are fairly, but responsibly, 
rewarded for their personal contributions.
The Committee believes that it is important to benchmark the 
remuneration packages of senior executives, particularly during the 
current economic turmoil. Accordingly, at the beginning of 2009, the 
Committee instructed Kepler Associates to carry out a full review of 
senior executive remuneration packages. As a consequence of this 
review, the Committee has decided to make some changes for 2009  
to the Annual Performance Bonus as disclosed in the relevant  
section below.
Components of Executive Directors’ remuneration
Remuneration packages are structured to provide an appropriate 
balance between fixed and variable elements. The main components  
of the two Executive Directors’ remuneration and the percentage of 
each element as part of the total package are detailed below.

Base Salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee and take account 
of the relevant benchmark data (as described above), and pay quantum 
and structure more generally throughout the Group.
Annual Bonus
During the year ended 31 December 2008, Executive Directors 
participated in an annual bonus arrangement with performance 
measures based on Group financial performance (80% of bonus 
potential), personal performance (10% of bonus potential) and health 
and safety performance (10% of bonus potential). Specific financial 
targets have not been disclosed as they are considered to be 
commercially confidential but they are deemed to be appropriately 
challenging by the Committee and will only pay out in full for 
exceptional performance.
The maximum bonus potential for 2008, payable for exceptional levels 
of performance, was set at 100% of base salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 100% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer. Half of 
the maximum bonus potential was payable at target performance 
levels. Details of the actual amounts paid for 2008 are set out in the 
Directors’ emoluments table on page 65.
For the year ending 31 December 2009, the performance measures for 
the annual bonus arrangements have been amended slightly so that 
they are based on Group financial performance (75% of bonus 
potential), health and safety performance (15% of bonus potential) and 
personal performance (10% of bonus potential).
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP awards made on 7 May 2008 had a performance condition 
based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return performance 
measured against a comparator group of 22 other international mining 
companies. The comparator companies are BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, 
Xstrata, Alcoa, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, Teck Cominco, 
Vedanta Resources, Mount Gibson, Antofagasta, Cameca, Kazakhmys, 
Peabody Energy, Forescue Metals, CVRD, Grupo Mexico, Ferrexpo,

Corporate Information Reserves Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Group Overview
Aricom, Portman, Aluminium Corp of China, Mitsubishi Materials Corp, Outokumpo OYJ and Cleveland Cliffs Inc. Of these comparator companies, 
Portland was acquired by Cleveland Cliffs Inc on 11 December 2008 and awards made in 2009 will be measured against a resulting comparator 
group of 21 companies. The performance condition will be measured over the three year period from 1 January 2008 until 31 December 2010 and 
the final number of shares released to employees will depend on the final ranking of the Company against its comparators in terms of Total 
Shareholder Return. If the ranking is equal to the upper quartile then 100% of the allocated shares will be released; if the ranking is equal to the 
median ranked company then 25% of the allocated shares will be released. Between these two levels of performance, vesting is on a pro-rata 
basis. No shares will be released if the ranking is below median.
In addition to the above, the awards will not vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Company’s Total Shareholder Return 
over the performance period reflects the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The Committee considers that Total Shareholder Return remains the most appropriate measure of long-term Company performance, providing 
alignment of interests between management and shareholders, and therefore intends that 2009 LTIP awards will be subject to the same 
performance condition. Any acquired comparator companies will be dropped from the comparator group.
In 2008, the maximum level of award under the LTIP was set at 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 150% of base salary for 
the Chief Financial Officer, based on the average market value of the shares over the five days preceding the date of grant.

 The average market value of the Company’s ordinary shares over the five days preceding the date of grant was £12.01.
Pensions and benefits
Both Executive Directors are members of the ENRC Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution pension scheme. An employer contribution of 
10% of base salary is made to the Plan on behalf of each Executive Director, subject to the UK Government’s annual cap on such contributions. 
Accordingly, for the year ended 31 December 2008 amounts of £150,000 and £60,000 were paid into the Plan in respect of the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer respectively.
Benefits comprise life assurance, private healthcare, travel insurance and income protection insurance. The Chief Executive Officer receives a 
fully funded car and driver, and a gardener. The taxable value of these benefits is included in the emoluments table below.

Directors’ contracts
Executive Directors
Both Executive Directors have service agreements which can be 
terminated by either the Group or the Executive Director giving 12 
months’ notice. Under the terms of the contracts, the Group reserves 
the right, in its absolute discretion, to terminate an Executive Director’s 
employment by making a payment in lieu of notice. In the event of a 
contract being terminated, the Remuneration Committee would 
determine the level of any compensation to be paid, normally by 
reference to fixed elements of remuneration and the notice period.  
Any annual bonus payment or vesting of shares under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan would be at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee. Payments would normally be pro-rated and subject to  
the performance conditions under which the awards were granted.
Dates of the service agreements are:
Name Date of contract Notice period
Dr Johannes Sittard 1 May 2007 12 months
Miguel Perry 12 March 2007 12 months
The Company announced on 25 March 2009 that the Chief Executive 
Officer had agreed to extend his contract of employment and will 
remain with the Group up until 30 September 2010. The Company also 
announced that Mr Miguel Perry would step down as Chief Financial 
Officer and from the Board and will leave the Group with effect from 
30 June 2009.
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to accept 
outside appointments on external boards or committees so long as 
these are not deemed to interfere with the business of the Company. 
Any fees in respect of those appointments are retained by the Executive 
Directors concerned. During 2008, the Chief Executive Officer received 
US$200,000 in respect of external directorships (2007: US$2,036,074).
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts with the 
Company, but each has a Letter of Appointment. These specified that 
each non-executive Director would be appointed until the conclusion  
of the Company’s AGM in June 2008. They retired and were all duly 
re-elected at this meeting. Each appointment was then continued a 
further three years from the date of the 2008 AGM. Details of the 
Letters of Appointment are summarised below.

Copies of all Executive Directors’ service contracts and the Letters of 
Appointment of the non-executive Directors are available for inspection 
during normal business hours at the registered office of the Company.
Non-executive Directors’ fees
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors (other than the 
Chairman) is a matter for the Chairman and the Executive Directors. 
Fees are designed to ensure that the Company attracts and retains high 
calibre individuals. They are reviewed on an annual basis and account 
is taken of the level of fees paid by other companies of a similar size 
and complexity. Non-executive Directors do not participate in any 
annual bonus plan, long-term incentive plan or pension arrangements. 
The Company reimburses the reasonable expenses that non-executive 
Directors incur in carrying out their duties as Directors.
The fees payable to the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee and following a review, the level of fees remain unchanged 
for 2009.
During 2008 the base fee for non-executive Directors was £100,000  
per annum. There was no increase in this fee for 2009.
Additional fees of £20,000 per annum are payable to Gerhard Ammann 
as chairman of the Audit Committee and additional fees of £150,000 
per annum are payable to Sir Richard Sykes in relation to his 
chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee and his role as Senior 
Independent Director. There was no increase in these additional fees 
for 2009.
As members of the Kazakh Government, neither Mr Beketayev nor 
Mr Utepov are permitted to receive their fees personally. The fee for 
Mr Beketayev and Mr Yergozhin was donated to the London School of 
Economics and Political Science. As part of a larger and already 
ongoing engagement with the Republic of Kazakhstan to facilitate the 
training and development needs of its Government, the School kindly 
offered to support two study visits for small groups of government 
officials from the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2009. Mr Utepov intends to 
donate his fee to a charitable organisation to be determined in 2009.
Performance graph
As required by Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, the Company’s 
TSR performance is shown against a recognised share index. ENRC 
became a constituent of the FTSE 100 index on 28 March 2008 and this 
index is considered to be the most appropriate. The following graph 
charts the total cumulative shareholder return of ENRC compared with 
the FTSE 100 since 12 December 2007 (being the first date of trading 
for ENRC shares).
The mid-market price of ENRC shares at 31 December 2008 was 330p 
and between 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008, the lowest 
and highest share price was 183p and 1,550p respectively.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of  
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Eurasian 
Natural Resources Corporation PLC for the year ended 31 December 
2008, which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, 
the Consolidated Statement of Change in Equity and the related  
notes to the consolidated financial statements. These consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting  
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC for the year 
ended 31 December 2008 and on the information in the Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  
by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the consolidated financial statements  
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, 
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the 
company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this 
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the consolidated financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the consolidated 
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the consolidated financial 
statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes 
that specific information presented in the Chairman’s Statement,  
the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement, the Business Review and the 
Corporate Governance Report that is cross referred from the Business 
Review section of the Directors’ Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received  
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the 
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined Code 
(2006) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required  
to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover  
all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness  
of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and  
control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider 
whether it is consistent with the audited consolidated financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement, the Business 
Review, the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Remuneration 
Report and all other information referred to on the contents page.  
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of  
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
consolidated financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend 
to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices  
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence 
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates 
and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information 
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide  
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the 
consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our 
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the consolidated financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view,  > >
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and  
of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared > >
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the > >
consolidated financial statements.

1. Principal accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation 
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC (the ‘Company’) was incorporated and registered under the laws of England and Wales  
on 8 December 2006. The address of the Company’s registered office is 16 St. James’s Street, London, SW1A 1ER, United Kingdom.  
The consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2008 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries  
(the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interest in joint ventures.
The accounting policies used in preparing these consolidated financial statements (‘financial statements’) are described below and are based on 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’), the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Financial 
Services Authority (‘FSA’) and Article 4 of the European Union IAS Regulation. These standards are subject to interpretations issued from time to 
time by the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (‘IFRIC’). These consolidated financial statements have also been prepared 
under the historical cost convention as modified for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. 
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also necessitates management to exercise 
its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas 
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 2.
The financial statements have been drawn up on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements for  
the year ended 31 December 2007. The Group has made certain presentational changes to further improve comparability of its results and certain 
comparative amounts have been reclassified accordingly. New accounting policies and pronouncements and the effects of these policies have 
been outlined in note 3. 
b) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are those companies and other entities in which the Group, directly or indirectly, has an interest of more than one half of the voting 
rights or otherwise has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities. The existence 
and effect of potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or presently convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group 
controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group (acquisition date) and are deconsolidated from the date 
that control ceases.
c) Joint ventures 
Joint ventures are all entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for 
strategic financial and operating decisions. The Group has elected to use the equity method to account for interests in jointly controlled entities, 
which are disclosed as joint ventures in the financial statement and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment in joint ventures 
includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
 
The Group’s share of its joint ventures’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in reserves is recognised in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the 
investment. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, including any other unsecured 
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint 
ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures unless the transaction provides evidence 
of an impairment of the asset transferred. If an asset is sold at a loss and the loss provides evidence of impairment, then the full amount of the 
loss is recognised.
d) Minority interests
Minority interests are that part of the net results and of the net assets, including the fair value adjustments, which are attributable to interests 
which are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the parent. Minority interests form a separate component of the Group’s equity.
The Group has adopted the ‘parent company method’ and applies a policy of treating transactions with minority interests as transactions with 
parties external to the Group. Gains or losses arising from disposals of minority interests are recorded in the income statement. Goodwill arising 
from purchases of minority interests is recorded on the balance sheet. The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the book value 
of the minority interest represents goodwill.
e) Functional and presentational currency
All amounts in these financial statements are presented in millions of US$, unless otherwise stated.
The functional currency of the significant operating entities is either the Kazakhstani tenge (‘KZT’) or the Russian rouble (‘RUB’), whilst for the 
Sales and Marketing entities it is the US dollar (‘US$’). The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which it operates. The functional currency for the Company is the US$.

f) Foreign currency translation
Transactions in currencies other than the local functional currency are translated to the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions and the translation of 
monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the income statement. 
g) Translation from functional to presentational currency
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated 
into the presentational currency as follows: 
Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet. > >
Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable > >
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at 
the dates of the transactions). 
All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. > >
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and > >
translated at the closing rate at the date of acquisition. When a subsidiary is disposed of through sale, liquidation, repayment of share capital 
or abandonment of all, or part of, that entity, the exchange differences deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement. 
h) Revenue recognition 
A significant portion of production is sold under the contract of sale. Revenue is only recognised on individual shipments when persuasive 
evidence exists that the following criteria are satisfied:
the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer. If it is arranged that the goods are > >
transported to a specified location, revenue is recognised when the goods are passed to the customer at the destination point. The revenue 
from sales of many products is subject to adjustment based on an inspection of the product by the customer. In such cases, revenue is initially 
recognised on a provisional basis using the Group’s best estimate of the quantity/quality of the product. Any subsequent adjustments to the 
initial estimate of quantity/quality of the product is recorded in revenue once they have been determined;
neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold has been > >
retained;
the amount of revenue and respective costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably; and > >
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group. > >
Revenues from sales of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered by reference to the stage of 
completion of the specific transaction, assessed on the basis of the actual services provided, as a proportion of the total services to be provided. 
Revenues are shown net of VAT and discounts. 
Revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. When the fair value of goods received in a barter transaction 
cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or service given up. 
i) Finance income and costs 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and gains and income on investment and trading securities. Finance costs comprise 
interest expense on borrowings, the accumulation of interest on provisions, interest expense from the unwinding of discount on provisions for 
asset retirement obligations and losses on the revaluation and disposal of investments designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Finance income and costs include foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to loans receivable, borrowings, cash and cash equivalents,  
term deposits and financial assets.
All interest and other costs incurred in connection with borrowings are expensed as incurred as part of financial expenses unless incurred  
on borrowings to finance the construction of property, plant and equipment in which case they are capitalised during the period of time that  
is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Interest income and expenses are recognised on a time proportion basis,  
using the effective interest method.

j) Income tax
Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates 
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Kazakhstani excess profits tax, as defined in the note 
below, is treated as an income tax and forms part of the income tax expense.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred assets to be utilised. 
Deferred excess profits tax is calculated with respect to temporary differences arising on assets allocated to contracts for subsurface use at the 
expected rate of excess profits tax to be paid under the contract.
k) Excess profits tax
Excess profits tax is payable under subsurface use contracts where the internal rate of return during the year is in excess of 20%. Liability for 
excess profits tax is recorded in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies for current and deferred tax and based on management’s 
understanding of the provisions of the subsurface use contracts and tax regulations. 
Where the Group’s operations, within one production cycle, along with operations conducted under a subsurface use contract (subsurface use 
operations) include also other operations (eg processing of products derived from subsurface use operations), for the purpose of the excess 
profits tax calculation, revenue resulted from the internal transfer of a product from the subsurface use operations to such other operations is 
assumed to be equal to the cost of extraction of the product. In all other cases, for the purposes of the excess profits tax calculation, revenue 
from external sales of a product from subsurface use operations is taken at the price at which the product was sold.
 
l) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on the 
balance sheet date. Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or when declared after the balance 
sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
m) Finance leases and hire purchase commitments
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased items, are capitalised at the inception of the 
lease. Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The capital elements, net of finance 
charges, of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as current- or long-term payables in the balance 
sheet, as appropriate. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the income statement. Capitalised lease assets 
are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset.
n) Operating leases
Where the Group is a lessee in a lease which does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership from the lessor  
to the Group, the total lease payments, including those on expected termination, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the period of the lease. For operating leases relating to the use of mining facilities, the rental expense is recognised in the cost of sales.  
For operating leases relating to the use of administrative facilities, the rental expense is recognised in the selling, general and administrative 
expense in the income statement.
Where the Group is a lessor under an operating lease, the lease payments receivable are recognised as rental income on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
o) Exploration and evaluation 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure related to an area of interest are written off as incurred. At the time that it is considered probable that 
future costs will be recovered through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively through its sale, they are 
carried forward as an asset in the balance sheet and are included within mining assets.
Capitalised costs include costs directly related to exploration and evaluation activities in the relevant area of interest. Selling, general and 
administrative costs are allocated to an exploration or evaluation asset only to the extent that those costs can be related directly to operational 
activities in the relevant area of interest. All capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is assessed for impairment if facts and 
circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.
Identifiable exploration assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised as assets at their fair value, as part of a  
business combination.

1. Principal accounting policies continued
p) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Depreciation is recorded 
over the useful life of the asset, or over the expected remaining life of the mine if shorter, as follows:
Buildings and mining constructions: 20 to 50 years on a straight-line basis. > >
Mining assets: on a units of production basis. > >
Plant and equipment: 6 to 15 years on a straight-line basis. > >
Motor vehicles: 5 to 15 years on a straight-line basis. > >
Land is not depreciated. > >
Estimates of residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually, and any change in estimate is taken into account in the determination of 
future depreciation charges.
The individual significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment (components), whose useful lives are different from the useful life of 
the asset as a whole, are depreciated individually, applying depreciation rates reflecting their anticipated useful lives. The cost of replacing major 
parts or components of property, plant and equipment items is capitalised and the replaced part is retired. 
Subsequent costs are included in an asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and 
maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Specialised spare parts and servicing equipment with a significant initial value and a useful life of more than one year are recognised as items of 
property, plant and equipment. Other spare parts and servicing-related equipment are recognised as inventories and accounted for in the income 
statement on utilisation.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement 
when the asset is retired.
Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, in accordance with the 
impairment policy below.
(i) Mining assets
Once a project has been established as commercially viable, expenditure is capitalised under ‘mining assets’ together with amounts transferred 
from ‘exploration and evaluation’. Mining assets include expenditure incurred to establish or expand productive capacity, costs to conduct 
mining construction and mining capital works, as well as costs arising from mining preparation works during the development or mine 
reconstruction phase.
Development expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the Group is accumulated separately for each area of interest in which economically 
recoverable resources have been identified. Such expenditure comprises costs directly attributable to the construction of a mine and the related 
infrastructure, including the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
When further development expenditure is incurred in respect of a mining asset after the commencement of production, such expenditure is 
carried forward as part of mining assets when it is probable that additional future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow  
to the Group. Otherwise such expenditure is recognised as a cost of production.
Once a project has been fully commissioned, depreciation is charged using the units of production method, based on proved and probable 
reserves, with separate calculations being made for each area of interest. The units of production basis results in a depreciation charge 
proportional to the depletion of proved and probable reserves. 
Mining assets are included within the category ‘Buildings and mining construction’ of property, plant and equipment.
(ii) Assets under construction
Assets under construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. Self-constructed assets include  
the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category. Assets under construction are not depreciated.  
Depreciation commences on the earlier of the date when the assets are brought into service or the assets are available for use.
(iii) Stripping costs
Stripping costs comprise the removal of overburden and other waste products from a mine. Stripping costs incurred in the development of mines 
and open pits before production commences are capitalised as part of the cost of constructing the mines and open pits, and depreciated using 
the unit of production method over the lives of the mines or open pits.
Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of operations are expensed as a production cost and included within the cost of inventory.

1. Principal accounting policies continued
q) Impairment 
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and all other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if facts and circumstances 
indicate that impairment may exist.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of ‘value in use’ (being the net present 
value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit) and ‘fair value less costs to sell’ (the amount obtainable from the sale of 
an asset or cash generating unit in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal). Where there 
is no binding sale agreement or active market, fair value less costs to sell is based on the best information available to reflect the amount the 
Group could receive for the cash-generating unit in an arm’s length transaction. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets 
that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
The estimates used for impairment reviews are based on detailed mine plans and operating budgets, modified as appropriate to meet the 
requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Future cash flows are based on:
estimates of the quantities of the reserves and mineral resources for which there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction; > >
future production levels; > >
future commodity prices (assuming the current market prices will revert to the Group’s assessment of the long-term average price, generally > >
over a period of three to five years); and
future cash costs of production, capital expenditure, close down, restoration and environmental clean up. > >
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income 
statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally resulted in the impairment. This reversal  
is recognised in the income statement and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
r) Business combinations and goodwill
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for business combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the 
assets given up, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition. The date of exchange is the acquisition date where a business combination is achieved in a single transaction and is the date of each 
share purchase where a business combination is achieved in stages by successive share purchases. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities  
of the acquiree, represents goodwill. Any excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and  
contingent liabilities acquired over the cost of acquisition (‘excess of acquirer’s interest’ or ‘negative goodwill’) is recognised immediately in  
the income statement. 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to groups of cash-generating units that are being managed as a combined 
business. These groups of cash-generating units represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes and these groups are not larger than the Group’s reporting segments which are its product groups.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in accordance with the impairment policy described in the note above. Goodwill is measured at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses.
s) Intangible assets 
Intangible assets, which are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised at fair value when the fair value can be measured reliably 
on initial recognition. Intangible assets are tested for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, in accordance 
with the impairment policy described above.
t) Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: loans and receivables, financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and held-to-maturity financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
(i) Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are unquoted non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments other than those that the Group intends 
to sell in the near term. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are 
classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise ‘loans receivable’, ‘trade and other liabilities’ and ‘cash and cash 
equivalents’ in the balance sheet.
(ii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.

Corporate Information Reserves Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Group Overview
1. Principal accounting policies continued
(iii) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. 
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
(iv) Held-to-maturity financial assets
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Group’s 
management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group were to sell other than an insignificant amount of held-to-
maturity financial assets, the whole category would be tainted and reclassified as available-for-sale.
Recognition and measurement 
Purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognised on the relevant settlement date, which is the date that an asset is delivered to or by 
the Group. The change in value between the trade date and settlement date is not recognised for assets carried at cost or amortised cost. The 
change in value between the trade date and settlement date is recognised in the income statement for financial assets as ‘at fair value through 
profit or loss’. 
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, loans and receivables are stated at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Where a loan is provided at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is remeasured at 
origination at its fair value, which is represented by future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market interest rates for 
similar loans. The difference between the fair value of the loan at origination and its cost (fair value of the contribution to the borrower, net of 
transaction costs) represents an origination gain or loss. The origination gain or loss is recorded in the income statement within finance income/
costs unless it qualifies for recognition as an asset, liability or a charge to equity in accordance with the substance of the arrangement. 
Subsequently, the carrying amount of the loans is adjusted for amortisation of the origination gain or loss and the amortisation is recorded as 
finance income/costs using the effective interest method.
Available-for-sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit 
or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Available-for-sale financial assets and 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Changes in fair value of available-for-sale financial assets, other than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on available-for-sale 
monetary items, are recognised directly in equity. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to  
the income statement.
Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
The Group derecognises financial assets when: (i) the assets are redeemed or the rights to cash flows from the assets have otherwise expired;  
(ii) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets; or (iii) the Group has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership but has not retained control. Control is retained if the counterparty does not have the 
practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party without needing to impose additional restrictions on the sale.
u) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group holds derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, to hedge its foreign currency exposure in relation  
to operating costs. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement 
when incurred on the date a derivative contract is entered into. Derivative financial instruments are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. 
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the 
nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or unrecognised firm commitment (fair value hedge); > >
hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability  > >
or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). > >
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes  
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Management policy has been to hedge a proportion of foreign exchange risk associated with highly probable forecast transactions denominated 
in foreign currencies, refer note 34 for details.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.  
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within ‘Net other operating expense’.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for instance 
when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of forward currency contracts hedging export 
sales is recognised in the income statement within ‘cost of sales’.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in equity at the time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to 
the income statement.
Movements on derivatives not designated as hedge derivatives are taken to ‘Net other operating expense’ in the income statement. 
Refer notes 33 and 34 for disclosure of derivatives and financial risk management.
v) Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Cost for raw 
materials is purchase price or extraction cost and for work in progress and finished goods is the cost of production, including the appropriate 
proportion of depreciation and overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to 
completion and disposal.
w) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not  
be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the 
carrying amount and the recoverable amount, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
The movement in the provision from the previous reporting period is recognised in the income statement. Significant financial difficulties of the 
debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered 
indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘selling, general 
and administration expenses’ in the income statement. 
x) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. Balances restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date are included in other non-current assets, 
while balances restricted for more than three months but less than 12 months after the balance sheet date are included in trade and other 
receivables. Restricted balances are excluded from cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.
y) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference 
between the proceeds net of transaction cost and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings 
using the effective interest method. 
Where a loan is obtained at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is remeasured at origination to its fair value, which is calculated as 
future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market interest rates for similar loans. The difference between the fair value of 
the loan at origination and its cost (fair value of the contribution to the borrower, net of transaction costs) represents an origination gain or loss. 
The origination gain or loss is recorded in the income statement within finance income/costs unless it qualifies for recognition as an asset, 
liability or a charge to equity in accordance with the substance of the arrangement. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the borrowings is 
adjusted for amortisation of the origination gain or loss and the amortisation is recorded as finance income/cost using the effective interest 
method on the asset/liability.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least  
12 months after balance sheet date.
z) Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Where there are 
a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations 
as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations 
may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of 
time is recognised as a part of finance costs.

Corporate Information Reserves Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Group Overview
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate 
asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
aa) Asset retirement obligations and other environmental provisions
An obligation to incur asset retirement costs occurs when environmental disturbance is caused by exploration, evaluation, development or 
ongoing production. Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan and are subject to regular review.
Asset retirement costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their net present value, are provided 
when the obligation to incur such costs arises and are capitalised into the cost of the related asset. These costs are charged against profits 
through depreciation of the asset and unwinding of the discount on the provision. Depreciation is included in operating costs while the unwinding 
of the discount is included as a financing cost. Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning or site rehabilitation of 
plant and other site preparation work are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset.
ab) Employee benefit obligations
Defined benefit plans
The Group provides long-term employee benefits to employees in the Republic of Kazakhstan before, on and after retirement, in accordance with 
a labour union agreement. Such benefits are valued consistent with an unfunded defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits. There are no post retirement/long-term service benefits provided in any other country where the Group operates.
The future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, is discounted to determine the present 
value. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the 
Group’s benefit obligations. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified, independent actuary.
The expected costs of the benefits associated with one-off retirement payments are accrued over the period of employment using the same 
accounting methodology as used for defined benefit post-employment plans. For defined benefit post-employment plans, the difference between 
the fair value of the plan assets (if any) and the present value of the defined liabilities obligations is recognised as an asset or liability on the 
balance sheet. Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are taken to the income statement. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses 
comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous 
actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including current service cost, any past service cost and 
the effect of any curtailments or settlements.
Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. Obligations for 
contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Other post-retirement/long-term service benefits
The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the completion of a minimum service period. The expected cost of these benefits is 
accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for the defined benefit plans.
Payroll expense and related contributions
Wages, salaries, and social insurance funds, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in 
which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group. On behalf of its employees, the Group pays those statutory pension 
and post-employment benefit amounts prescribed by the legal requirements of the countries in which it operates. These payments are expensed 
as incurred. 
Share-based bonus awards
The Group operated an equity-settled share-based bonus award scheme in respect of the Directors, management, senior employees and 
professional advisers’ contribution to the Group’s preparations for admission to the London Stock Exchange. The fair value of the employee 
services received, measured by reference to the fair value of the shares granted at the grant date less nominal value, is recognised as initial 
public offering cost in the income statement.
The Group has introduced a separate equity-settled, share-based compensation plan, under which the Group receives services from qualifying 
employees as consideration for equity instruments. The employee services received in exchange for the grant of the equity-settled payments are 
measured at fair value and are recognised as expenses, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the awards subject to the Group’s estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, due to the employees leaving the 
Group prior to vesting. The amount recognised in the income statement as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that 
vest. The fair values of equity-settled payments are measured at the dates of grant using a Monte Carlo pricing model. 
ac) Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
ad) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction 
from the proceeds.
ae) Financial guarantees
Financial guarantees are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of the guarantee for a loss it incurs 
because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantees are initially 
recognised at their fair value adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Financial guarantees 
are recognised when premiums are paid or in the case of premium-free guarantees when the borrower received the money from the financing 
entity. When the Group issues premium-free guarantees or guarantees at a premium different from the market premium, the fair value is 
determined using valuation techniques (eg market prices of similar instruments, interest rate differentials, etc). Losses at initial recognition  
of financial guarantee liabilities are recognised in the income statement within ‘net other operating expenses’. Financial guarantee liabilities  
are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee with the respective income presented within ‘net other operating expenses’. 
At each balance sheet date, the guarantees are measured at the higher of: (i) the unamortised balance of the amount at initial recognition;  
and (ii) the best estimate of expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
a) Ore reserve estimates
The Group’s ore reserves are based on its best estimate of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the relevant mining 
properties. Estimates are developed after taking into account a range of factors including quantities, ore grades, production techniques and 
recovery rates, forecast commodity prices and production costs.
The Group’s estimates are supported by geological studies by independent mining engineering consultants and drilling samples to determine  
the quantity and grade of each ore body. Significant judgement is required to generate an estimate based on the geological data available.
Ore reserve estimates are calculated based on the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  
of December 2004 (the JORC code) which requires the use of reasonable assumptions, including:
future production estimates – which include proved and probable reserves, resource estimates and committed expansions; > >
expected future commodity prices, based on current market price, forward prices and the Group’s assessment of the long-term average  > >
price; and
future cash costs of production, capital expenditure and rehabilitation obligations. > >
Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period. This may impact the Group’s financial results. Such changes in reserves may impact 
depreciation charges, asset carrying values and asset retirement obligation provisions.
b) Life of mines
Contracts for subsurface use expire between 2017 and 2041. Management expects that the subsurface use contracts will be extended at  
nominal cost until the end of the lives of the related mines. Any change to this assumption may impact the Group’s financial results by affecting 
depreciation charges, asset carrying values and asset retirement obligations, as these have been recorded on the assumption that the 
subsurface use contracts will be extended until the end of the mine life. During 2007, the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan confirmed by 
letter, addressed to the Group, that the Group is entitled to prolong the contracts under the contractual terms and the subsurface use legislation. 
If the contracts are not renewed at their current expiry dates, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment existing at the expiry date to 
be written off at the date of expiry is valued at US$757 million as at 31 December 2008 (2007: US$450 million). 
c) Provision for asset retirement obligations 
Provision is made for asset retirement obligations when the related environmental disturbance takes place. Provisions are recognised at the net 
present value of future expected costs as outlined in note 27.
The provision recognised represents management’s best estimate of the costs that will be incurred but significant judgement is required as many 
of these costs will not crystallise until the end of the life of the mine. Estimates are reviewed annually and are based on management’s 
interpretation of compliance with current environmental legislation in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Significant changes in environmental 
legislation, restoration techniques and estimates of contamination will result in changes to provisions from period to period.
The engineering estimates evaluated by management are reviewed annually by independent mining engineering consultants.
The inflation rate currently applied in the calculation is 7.0%–8.6% as at 31 December 2008 (2007: 8.3%) being the estimate of the rate of 
inflation over the mine lives. The discount rate currently applied in the calculation is 10.6%–11.4% at 31 December 2008 (2007: 7.4%) being the 
estimate of the risk-free pre-tax cost of borrowings over the life of mines. Rehabilitation expenditure is largely expected to take place at the end of 
the respective mine lives, which varies from 14 to 40 years, with an average, weighted by the estimated closure date, of 32 years.

Corporate Information Reserves Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Group Overview
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued
d) Impairment
As stated in note 2 (f) below, the Group considers, at least annually, the recoverability of the values of goodwill recognised in its financial 
statements. The Group also considers the recoverability of all assets if there have been any indications of impairment and the recent significant 
fall in commodity prices constitutes such an indication for the Group.
The recoverability of the value of current assets is addressed through the Group’s usual procedures, for example the assessment of counterparty 
default risk, both customer and financial counterparties, and is not part of this impairment review.
Long-term assets require there to be a reasonable expectation of recoverability of the carrying value of those assets through profitability and 
cash flow. Accordingly the Group’s approach has been to consider the ability of its groups of cash-generating units, which have no goodwill or 
other intangible assets in their financial statements, to generate future economic benefits which exceed the value of the related tangible assets 
in the financial statements.
The Group’s strategic planning models, which are on a life of mines basis, were used to calculate an appropriate value of the future economic 
benefits for each of these cash-generating units in terms of discounted future cash flows.
The impairment review, as at 31 December 2008, concluded that no impairment provisions are required for long-term tangible assets. 
e) Tax legislation
Kazakhstani tax legislation is subject to varying interpretations (refer note 32).
f) Business combinations and goodwill
The Group made a number of acquisitions during the year. Where necessary, the Group hired external valuation consultants to advise on the fair 
value and asset lives of acquired assets, otherwise these were estimated internally.
The portion of the purchase price not allocated to specific assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as identified by management has been 
attributed to goodwill. 
The Group considers, at least annually, the recoverability of goodwill recognised in its financial statements. 
For groups of cash-generating units the Group’s strategic planning models were used to calculate discounted future cash flows (using the 
‘value-in-use’ method as defined under IAS 36) and thus assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the goodwill. The models were 
prepared on a life of mines basis as this period properly reflects the long-term nature of the Group’s assets, as is described in the report on Ore 
Reserves and Mineral Resources on pages 123 to 130. 
The key assumptions which formed the basis of forecasting future cash flows in the models are:
commodity prices, which are based on internal forecasts by the management of the Group’s sales and marketing business. These internal > >
forecasts are consistent with the forecasts of industry market researchers;
that long-term costs will be in line with current operational performance, as adjusted for future inflation rates in the Republic of Kazakhstan > >
and, where applicable, the expected movements in key input costs; 
the successful extraction, processing and sale of reserves in accordance with the quantities described in the report on Ore Reserves and > >
Mineral Resources;
that the long-term US inflation rate will average 2.5% per annum, in line with external forecasts; and > >
in calculating the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows the Group consulted with external advisors. The rate which was used, > >
applied to pre-tax cash flows, was the equivalent of a post tax rate of 14.1% which is the advisor’s opinion on the Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital for the Group. 
g) Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
In May 2008, the Group introduced the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) which covers the Executive 
Directors and selected senior management. In the normal course of events, the LTIP awards vest on the third anniversary of the award date 
subject to achievement of the performance target described below. 
 
The performance target is based on the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), ranked against a comparator group of 22 other international 
mining companies over a three year period from 1 January 2008 through 31 December 2010. 
The estimated fair value of each share granted is calculated by applying a Monte Carlo pricing model. The assumptions adopted to arrive at the 
estimated fair value are disclosed in note 12.

3. New accounting pronouncements 
The Group has adopted the following standard and interpretation: 
IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’, which provides guidance on whether share-based transactions involving treasury 
shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over a parent’s shares) should be accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled 
share-based payment transactions in the standalone accounts of the parent and group companies. This interpretation does not have an impact 
on the Group’s financial statements.
The following interpretation to published standards is mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 but is not relevant 
to the Group’s operations:

The effective interest rate for short-term deposits for the year ended 31 December 2008 is 8.4% (2007: 8.4%). Cash and cash equivalents held  
at Eurasian Bank JSC bear zero interest rate (2007: zero). 
In 2007 the Group agreed to maintain certain existing term deposits with Eurasian Bank JSC until October 2008. As at 31 December 2007 such 
deposits amounted to US$123 million and had been fully withdrawn at 31 December 2008. There were no restrictions on the balance of US$320 
million in cash and cash equivalents and term deposits at 31 December 2008. 
Acquisitions
The Group acquired Serov from companies controlled by the Founder Shareholders. Connected with this transaction pre-acquisition dividends  
of US$57 million were paid to the Founder Shareholders and US$4 million was paid to an associated company (related to coal profits which were 
not included in the acquisition). The Group paid a ‘finders fee’ of US$9 million in respect of the acquisition of the BML stake. The Group also  
paid US$1 million consideration for the acquisition of Metallurg to a company controlled by the Founder Shareholders. Further related party 
transactions were made after the balance sheet date. Refer note 37. 
 
In the period since acquisition, several loan facilities have been granted to BML and Ardila Investments NV to finance certain capital and 
operating expenditure. Refer note 35.
Shareholders’ Settlement Agreement
During June 2007, the Group undertook a series of transactions to consolidate a number of assets and liabilities outstanding with various 
companies under the control of the Founder Shareholders. There was a settlement of the overall outstanding balance to eliminate amounts  
owing from Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC subsidiaries to the shareholder group.
As a result of the above transactions, the inter-company balances within the ENRC Group were significantly reduced. The inter-company balances 
(excluding certain balances, which existed with the immediate shareholders of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC on formation of the 
Group) now exist entirely between the subsidiaries of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC as opposed to being in place between the 
Founder Shareholders of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC and its subsidiaries.
The following loans were settled as part of the Shareholders’ Settlement Agreement: 
Kherson Holding BV
The Group received financing loans from Kherson Holding BV, a related party, for the amount of US$54 million. The loan agreements specified  
an interest rate of 0% and that the principal was to be repaid by 2010. As at 31 December 2007, these loans had been reassigned to ENRC NV  
as a part of the reassignment process resulting from the Shareholders’ Settlement Agreement.
CIM Global Investments BV
During December 2006, CIM Global Investments BV provided a short-term loan of US$47 million to the Group for the purpose of financing the 
construction of the aluminium smelter. The loan bore interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum and as at 31 December 2007 had been settled in full 
as part of the Shareholders’ Settlement Agreement.
ENRC Kazakhstan Holding BV
During December 2006, ENRC Kazakhstan Holding BV provided a short-term loan of US$139 million to the Group for the purpose of financing the 
construction of the aluminium smelter. The loan bore interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 1.0% and as at 31 December 2007 had been settled in full 
as part of the Shareholders’ Settlement Agreement.
Kazakhstan Minerals Resource Corporation (‘KMRC’) 
The Eurasian Energy Corporation JSC (‘EEC’) concluded an Investment Agreement with KMRC according to which KMRC had committed to invest 
US$5 million annually from 2000 until 2009 and US$20 million annually from 2010 until 2024. The total amount to be invested was equal to 
US$344 million. In light of the legal restructuring, the State Property and Privatisation Committee of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan (the ‘Committee’) agreed to annul KMRC’s obligation, during 2007, on condition that Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC 
committed in writing to the planned capital expenditure investment programme at EEC.

Long Term Incentive Plan 
In May 2008 the Group made awards under the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC LTIP to the Executive Directors and selected senior 
management. In the normal course of events, the LTIP awards vest on the third anniversary of the award date subject to achievement of 
performance targets. The performance target is based on the Group’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’), ranked against a comparator group of 22 
other international mining companies over a three-year period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010.
The estimated fair value of each share granted is £8.47 (US$16.64). This was calculated by applying a Monte Carlo model. The model inputs were 
as follows at grant date: the share price at grant date of £12.10, expected volatility of 42%, expected dividend yield of 1.01% based on the 
dividend yield of an appropriately comparable peer group as there was no ENRC history of paying dividends at the grant date, and a risk-free 
interest rate of 2.55%. The Group’s expected volatility is based on the historical average annualised volatility of the comparator group mining 
companies and reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the awards is indicative of future trends, 
which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

Factors affecting future tax charges
Future tax charges are affected by the mix of profits in the various tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates, and by the level of excess profits 
tax payable in the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
Reconciliation between the expected and the actual taxation charge is provided below.
         Years ended 31 December
In millions of US$          2008 2007
Profit before income tax          3,827 1,321

Other          6 (5)
Income tax expense for the year, an effective rate of 30% (2007: 38%)      1,143 507
Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned in the period. The effective tax rate is equal to the statutory rate at which  
the Group predominantly pays tax in the Republic of Kazakhstan of 30% primarily due to the compensating effects of tax losses which are 
unrecognised for tax purposes, excess profits tax, the effects of different tax rates in other countries and the impact of changes in Kazakhstani 
tax rates leading to a reduction in the rate at which deferred tax is calculated. The tax charges above arise mainly outside of the United Kingdom.
The Republic of Kazakhstan announced a phased reduction to its corporate income tax rate: with effect from 1 January 2009 the rate reduces 
from 30% to 20%; a further decrease to 17.5% on 1 January 2010; and 15% from 1 January 2011.
Deferred taxation
The tax effect of the movements in these temporary differences is detailed below and is recorded at rates of 15%, 17.5% or 20% at 31 December 
2008 (2007: 30%). The rate depends on when the temporary difference is expected to reverse.
Temporary timing differences comprise of deferred tax on provisions against receivables, employee bonuses, benefits and pensions, and other 
similar short-term deposits.
The Group has not recorded a deferred tax liability in respect of taxable temporary differences of US$4,354 million (2007: US$2,164 million) 
associated with investments in subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of those temporary differences and does  
not intend to reverse them in the foreseeable future.
 
The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same 
tax jurisdiction, is as follows:

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences of US$65 million for the year ended 31 December 
2008 (2007: US$89 million). It is probable that future taxable profits will not be available to utilise the benefits of these temporary differences.
In the context of the Group’s current structure, tax losses and current tax assets of different Group companies may not be offset against current 
tax liabilities and taxable profits of other Group companies and, accordingly, taxes may accrue even where there is a consolidated tax loss. 
Therefore, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when they relate to the same taxable entity. 
16. Earnings per share (‘EPS’) and dividends per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all diluted potential ordinary shares.
The following reflects the income and adjusted share data used in the EPS computations:
       As at 31 December
In millions of US$        2008 2007

of £1 each, the resulting 50,000 ordinary shares of £1 each were consolidated into one ordinary share of £50,000 and then the ordinary share 
was redesignated as a special share.

Structured Trade Finance Facility
On 15 December 2006, ENRC Marketing AG entered into a US$1,000 million Structured Trade Finance Facility (the ‘Facility’). By a Supplemental 
Agreement dated 12 April 2007, the Facility was increased to US$1,480 million. 
The Facility is secured principally by grants of security over certain sales contracts entered into by ENRC Marketing AG and third party buyers  
(and all receivables thereunder). The associated accounts receivable balance at 31 December 2008 was US$178 million (2007: US$261 million). 
All monies payable by the end purchasers under the sales contracts are required to be paid into bank accounts which are also used to secure  
the Facility. Withdrawals from these bank accounts are subject to restrictions imposed under the terms of the Facility Agreement. The Group 
agreed to certain restrictive covenants in respect of Kazchrome, as guarantor of the loan, which prohibit Kazchrome from lending more than 
US$100 million and having total debt of greater than US$1,500 million outstanding at any time during the duration of the Facility. In addition,  
the guarantee provides for other restrictions on Kazchrome including on payment of dividends, giving guarantees or indemnities creating security 
interests or changing its business.
During 2008, the Group made accelerated repayments of the Structured Trade Finance Facility for a total amount of US$300 million.  
As at 31 December 2008, US$686 million of the Facility was drawn down (2007: US$1,374 million). Repayment of the balance occurs in  
equal and consecutive monthly instalments, with final payment scheduled for December 2010. 
The interest rate applicable to the loan is one-month LIBOR plus 1.35% per annum.

27. Asset retirement obligations
The Group has a legal obligation to landfill site restoration during the mining operations and decommissioning of its mining property after its 
expected closure. The timing of decommissioning activity is subject to reassessment at the same time as the revision of the Group’s proved and

In accordance with the contracts on subsurface use, the Group makes annual obligatory contributions to form a deposit fund for the closure costs 
which will take effect upon exhaustion of the mineral deposits between 2010 and 2063.
The amount of the provision for asset retirement obligations is determined using the nominal prices effective at the reporting dates by applying 
the forecasted rate of inflation for the expected period of the life of the mines. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes 
in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and the level of discount and inflation rates.

31. Cash generated from operations continued
Non-cash transactions
Investing and financing transactions that did not require the use of cash and cash equivalents were excluded from the cash flow statement. 
Non-cash transactions consisted of:
(i) The acquisition of property, plant and equipment in exchange for inventory of US$3 million for the year ended 31 December 2008  
(2007: US$3 million).
(ii) In May 2008, the Group completed the acquisition of a 50% interest in BML for a consideration of US$306 million which included  
US$6 million of interest income on a pre-acquisition loan.
(iii) In April 2008, the Group acquired a controlling interest in Serov and subsequently US$21 million of loans issued by the Group were 
eliminated on consolidation.
32. Contingencies, commitments and operating risks
Legal proceedings
From time to time and in the normal course of business, claims against the Group are received, including those arising from tax inquiries. On the 
basis of management estimates and both internal and external professional advice, it is not anticipated that any material losses will be incurred 
in respect of claims in excess of provisions that have been made in these financial statements.
Tax legislation
Kazakhstani tax legislation and practice are in a state of continuous development and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and 
frequent changes which may be applied retroactively. The interpretation of tax, transfer pricing and excess profit tax legislation by the 
Kazakhstani tax authorities as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may not coincide with that of management. As a result, tax 
authorities may challenge transactions and the Group may be assessed additional taxes, penalties and fines. Tax periods remain open to review 
by the Kazakhstani tax authorities for five years.
Following the recent completion of tax audits focused on excess profit tax, the risks reported in prior years relating to potential interpretational 
differences in respect of excess profit tax no longer apply. Pending completion of tax audits focused on transfer pricing policies applied in the 
past, there continues to be a risk that the Kazakhstani tax authorities may challenge past practice. Whilst any challenge may result in material 
claims being made against the Group, management believes that, based on clarifications obtained from the relevant authorities, they would be 
successful in defending any such challenge.
At 31 December 2008, no provision had been recorded (2007: nil).
Tax legislation in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom may impose additional tax liabilities due to the low rate of tax in certain jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates. Management believe they will be successful in defending any challenge from these tax authorities and therefore no 
provision for potential liabilities is required.

Insurance policies
The Republic of Kazakhstani entities within the Group purchased a primary insurance programme which is placed with a local insurance company 
in the Republic of Kazakhstan, as required by Kazakhstani law. ENRC do not utilise the services of an insurance broker. Facultative reinsurance 
cover is then placed into the European insurance market via Marsh Insurance Brokers in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The primary insurance programme covers such risks including:
property damage, business interruption and machinery breakdown; > >
medical expenses; > >
employers’ liability; and > >
various logistics cover. > >
Supply commitments
ENRC Marketing AG has a contract with UC RUSAL, a large aluminium producer, to supply a minimum of 1.2 million tonnes of alumina per annum, 
plus an option to supply an additional 200 thousand tonnes per annum. The contract expires on 31 December 2016. Pricing is determined by a 
formula linked to the LME aluminium price.
In April 2007, the Group entered into a long-term contract with MMK, a large Russian steel producer, to supply saleable iron ore concentrate and 
pellets. The contract extends until 2017 and requires MMK to purchase specified quantities at prices determined by reference to the published 
world price benchmarks for iron ore concentrate and pellets. Prices are revised annually on 1 April by reference to the world price benchmarks.
In light of the current economic downturn and the impact on our customer MMK, in the fourth quarter 2008 the Group agreed to temporarily waive 
the minimum contractual sales volume. Contractual sales volumes will continue to be reviewed on a regular basis, taking into account developing 
market conditions.
Environmental matters
The enforcement of environmental regulation is evolving and the enforcement posture of the Kazakhstani Government authorities is continually 
being reconsidered in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Group periodically evaluates its obligations under environmental regulations. As 
obligations are determined, they are recognised immediately. Potential liabilities, which might arise as a result of changes in existing regulations, 
civil litigation or legislation, cannot be estimated but could be material. In the current enforcement climate under existing legislation, 
management believes that there are no significant liabilities for environmental damage.

All derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value and reported as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair 
value is negative.
The table below analyses the Group’s derivative financial instruments. The amounts disclosed in the table are the carrying balances of the 
liabilities as at balance sheet date.

Total derivative financial instruments          54 70
In June 2007, SSGPO JSC (‘SSGPO’) and Aluminium of Kazakhstan JSC (‘AoK’) entered into forward foreign exchange contracts with Deutsche Bank 
AG London (‘Deutsche Bank’) to hedge part of their foreign currency risks. Under the terms of the contracts, SSGPO and AoK are required to pay 
Deutsche Bank amounts of US$25 million and US$15 million, respectively, on a monthly basis up to December 2009. Deutsche Bank is required 
to pay SSGPO and AoK on a monthly basis, Kazakhstani tenge at fixed forward rates up to December 2009. The average forward rate on these 
contracts is 121.14 KZT/US$1 (2007: 120.88 KZT/US$1).
In September 2007, these forward foreign exchange contracts were formally designated as hedge instruments to hedge the foreign exchange 
currency risk arising from related highly probable forecast transactions expected to occur on a monthly basis up to December 2009.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 
12 months and, as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the hedge item is less than 12 months. There is no non-current portion of the 
hedge as of December 2008.
The amount of net unrealised loss on the hedges taken to equity is US$21 million as of 31 December 2008 (2007: US$17 million). The net 
unrealised loss taken to equity on the forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during 
which the actual cash flows occur and the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement. The total amount of realised gain on cash 
flow hedges recognised in cost of sales is US$17 million for the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: US$4 million). Refer note 7.
There were no significant ineffective cash flow hedges.
34. Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to partially hedge foreign exchange exposure.
Financial risk management is the responsibility of the treasury function which identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close 
cooperation with the Group’s operating units. The Treasury Policy outlines principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies 
covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative 
financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
Credit risk
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets. The Group has credit insurance for the majority of its sales and credit limits 
are set by the credit insurance company for each customer. For those sales where credit insurance is not available, the Group operates a policy of 
‘cash on delivery’ and ‘letters of credit’. The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts, in order to minimise their exposure. In 2008 the 
top 10 customers as a proportion of the outstanding balances of the Group’s trade receivables accounted for 51% (2007: 58%).
The Group has established relationships with a number of international and domestic banks in the areas in which the Group operates to diversify 
financial counterparty default risk. During the year a mixture of bank deposits, liquidity funds, asset management funds and sovereign debt were 
used within the Group’s investment portfolio to manage credit exposure.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be as follows:

34. Financial risk management continued
Foreign currency risk
The production costs are predominantly denominated in Kazakhstani tenge (KZT) and Russian roubles (RUB) while sales are denominated  
in US dollars (US$). The Group is therefore exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates will affect both its net income and cash flows.
The Group’s foreign currency exposure arises from:
Highly probable forecast transactions (sales/purchases) denominated in foreign currencies; and > >
Monetary items (mainly inter-company receivables, payables and borrowings) denominated in foreign currencies. > >
The Group is exposed to currency fluctuations through its normal operations. The main exposure is to KZT/US$ and approximately 25% of this 
exposure for 2008 was hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts which were already in place at the beginning of the year. Management 
estimate that the hedge contracts effectively provide for an average rate of 120KZT/US$1. There were no additional foreign exchange hedges 
transacted during the year.
The forward exchange contracts entered into during 2007 were formally designated as hedges at 18 September 2007 and accordingly hedge

The above tables exclude the impact of forward foreign exchange contracts which have been hedged.
Commodity price risk
The Group generates most of its revenue from the sale of commodities, primarily ferrochrome, chrome ore, iron ore, alumina and aluminium. 
Historically, the prices for these products have been volatile and have fluctuated widely in response to changes in supply and demand, market 
uncertainty, the performance of the global or regional economies and cyclicality in industries that are end users of these products.
Prices may also be affected by Government actions, including the imposition of tariffs and import duties, speculative trades, the development  
of product substitutes or replacements, recycling practices, an increase in capacity or an oversupply of the Group’s products in its main markets. 
These external factors and the volatility of the commodity markets make it difficult to estimate future prices. A substantial or extended decline  
in commodity prices would materially and adversely affect the Group’s business and the financial results and cash flows of operations.
ENRC does not hedge its exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the price of its products.

Iron ore           72
Alumina           26
Aluminium           13
Interest rate risk
The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates. These assets and liabilities are exposed to 
cash flow interest rate risk or fair value interest rate risk depending on whether they are subject to variable or fixed rates of interest. The Group’s 
significant interest bearing assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 20, 23, 24, and 26.
The Group analyses its sensitivity to interest rates by movements of 1% and the pre-tax impact on the profit or loss for the year ended  
31 December 2008 is approximately US$17 million (2007: US$15 million).
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns  
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
As at 31 December 2008, following the receipt of the proceeds from the IPO in 2007, the Group had a strong balance sheet and a conservative 
capital structure. Going forward, the Group intends to maintain a capital structure in line with industry’s norms and practices which will be 
achieved over a period of time, taking into account investment opportunities and availability of debt finance.
The Group considers the following balances as a part of its capital management.

 Reserves include retained earnings, translation reserve, revaluation reserve of financial assets available-for-sale and hedge reserves.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to manage its debt level.
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management means maintaining sufficient cash to finance the ongoing operating and investing activities of the Group.
In 2008, the Group did not make any new draw down under credit facilities (2007: US$1,374 million). Refer note 26.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial assets and liabilities which will be settled on a gross basis into relevant maturity groups based on

35. Acquisition of subsidiaries and joint venture
Serov
On 3 April 2008 a controlling interest in the Serov group and certain related entities (‘Serov’) (see below) was acquired by the Group.  
The purchase price was US$210 million.
Serov’s principal activity comprises the mining of chrome ore, processing and sale of ferroalloys.
The acquisition of Serov consisted of the following ownership interests:
         Effective ownership interest
Serov Ferroalloy Plant JSC           95.3%
Saranovskaya Mine ‘Rudnaya’ JSC           88.2%

IMR Marketing AG           100.0%
DDK Services Limited           100.0%
Since the date of acquisition up to 31 December 2008, Serov contributed US$496 million of revenue and US$156 million of profit after tax.  
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2008, Serov would have recorded US$632 million of revenue and profit after tax of US$197 million.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2008, Group consolidated revenue and Group consolidated profit after tax for the year ended 
31 December 2008 would have been, respectively, US$6,917 million and US$2,726 million.
Details of the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows:

Goodwill           76
Goodwill to the amount of US$67 million was allocated to Kazchrome, in the Ferroalloys Division, on the basis of economic benefits arising  
from the assets acquired. The goodwill is attributable to the value derived by the Group from additional pricing power in the low-carbon 
ferroalloys market.

In October 2008, the Group completed the acquisition of a 50% interest in Tuoli, a Chinese ferroalloys producer, for a cash consideration of 
US$15 million. The Group has consolidated Tuoli, reflecting the control it exercises over the operations.
Net assets acquired were US$7 million; this is equivalent to the fair values. Goodwill in the amount of US$8 million was allocated to Kazchrome, 
in the Ferroalloys Division, on the basis of economic benefits arising from the assets acquired. Xinjiang Tuoli Taihang Ferro-Alloy Co. was later 
renamed Xinjiang Tuoli ENRC Taihang Chrome Co. Ltd.
Metallurg LLP (‘Metallurg’)

35. Acquisition of subsidiaries and joint venture continued
The feasibility study for the extraction of the iron ore deposit is currently being undertaken and is expected to be completed in the third quarter  
of 2009.
On 19 May 2008, the Group entered into a Shareholder Loan Agreement with BML to finance capital and operating expenditure. Under this 
agreement, the Group loaned US$34 million to BML to match loans granted by Ardila Investments prior to the joint venture being established.
The Shareholder Loan Agreement provides a further loan facility to BML of which the drawn down amount at 31 December 2008 is US$11 million.
Both loans are reported as related party loans (refer note 20) and are interest free at 31 December 2008. The loans are repayable out of the 
profits and or the free cash flows of BML and in any event on the date falling nine years after the date of the Shareholder Loan Agreement.
On 19 May 2008, the Group provided a secured loan facility of up to US$400 million to Ardila Investments to finance their share of certain capital 
and operating expenditure of BML. The facility, which is secured by Ardila Investments’ shares in BML, is available to 31 December 2009, bears 
interest at LIBOR plus 4.5% per annum and is repayable over the 3 years following the first draw down under the facility (August 2008). As at 
31 December 2008, US$11 million has been drawn down against this facility and is reported as loans receivable from third party (refer note 20).

Acquisition of 100% of ENRC PMZ LLP (‘ENRC PMZ’)
On 8 January 2009 the Group acquired a 100% interest in ENRC PMZ LLP, an unlisted company based in the Republic of Kazakhstan, for a cash 
consideration of US$20 million. ENRC PMZ owns 100% interest in Pavlodar Machinery Plant JSC, a producer of overhead factory cranes in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. ENRC PMZ was acquired from the Founder Shareholders of ENRC.
Purchase of an option to acquire 70% interest in Masalskoe GOK LLP (‘Masalskoe’)
On 8 January 2009 the Group purchased an option, for a cash consideration of US$10 million, from a company owned by Mr Abdraman 
Yedilbayev, one of the Group’s non-executive Directors, to acquire a 70% interest (‘Offered Interest’) in Masalskoe GOK LLP. Masalskoe is a 
company with the rights for exploration and production of iron ore of the Masalskoe deposit in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Consideration paid for the option will be used by Masalskoe to finance its exploration works during the eight months from the date of payment. 
Upon completion of this period, the Group will be provided with the exploration results and may exercise the call option at any time during the 
four month period from the completion of exploration works and provision of all documents supporting the exploration results. The price payable 
on the exercise of the call option is US$100 million. The purchase price is subject to change should the results of exploration works reveal that 
the available reserves deviate by more than 10% from the amount stipulated in the contract. If the parties disagree with the results of a new 
appraisal conducted by an independent expert, either of them may refuse to complete the sale of the Offered Interest. In such an event, the 
US$10 million is not refundable, however, the Group shall instead receive an interest in Masalskoe equivalent to the share of US$10 million in the 
value of the Offered Interest.
Acquisition of 25% of Shubarkol Komir Joint Stock Company (‘Shubarkol’)
On 16 February 2009 the Group acquired a 25% interest in Shubarkol Komir JSC, a major semi-coke and thermal coal producer in Kazakhstan, for 
a cash consideration of US$200 million.
Shubarkol is majority owned by Eurasian Finance-Industrial Company JSC (‘EFIC’), a private company wholly-owned by the three Founder 
Shareholders of ENRC who together hold 43.77% of the Group’s issued share capital. The acquisition constitutes a ‘smaller related party 
transaction’ for the purposes of the Listing Rules of the FSA.
In connection with the acquisition, the Group has entered into an off-take agreement with Shubarkol, secured a seat on Shubarkol’s board and 
entered into a shareholders agreement with EFIC. In addition the Group has a right of first refusal, combined with a call option, over all or part of 
the remaining shares in Shubarkol held by EFIC. The call option is exercisable (at the Group’s discretion) at any time until 31 January 2011 and is 
expected to be subject to the approval of the Group’s shareholders with any required regulatory approvals having been obtained. The price 
payable on any exercise of the call option is the aggregate value of the shares to be transferred, assuming Shubarkol has a total value of US$800 
million on a fully diluted basis, less any net debt at the time of the transfer. The Group’s management believes that the transaction, agreed on an 
arm’s length basis, creates value for all of the Group’s shareholders.
The 25% interest in Shubarkol was acquired through a public auction process on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (‘KASE’). The settlement of the 
shares through KASE was completed on 19 February 2009.

Corporate Information Reserves Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Group Overview
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Eurasian 
Natural Resources Corporation PLC for the year ended 31 December 
2008 which comprise the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC 
Balance Sheet and the related notes. These parent company financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out 
therein. We have also audited the information in the Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the consolidated financial statements 
of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC for the year ended  
31 December 2008.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report and the parent company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) 
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the 
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company 
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent 
company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report 
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the 
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent 
company financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ 
Report includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer’s 
Statement, the Business Review and the Corporate Governance Report 
that is cross-referred from the Business Review Section of the 
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the parent company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider 
whether it is consistent with the audited parent company financial 
statements. The other information comprises the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Chief Executive Officers’ Statement, the Business 
Review, the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Remuneration 
Report and all other information referred to on the contents page. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent 
company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An 
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the 
amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made  
by the Directors in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate  
to the parent company’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information 
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent 
company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report 
to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information  
in the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Report to be audited.

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 
1. Principal Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards  
and generally accepted accounting practices in the United Kingdom (‘UK GAAP’). 
The comparative prior period amounts presented in the financial statements were from 8 December 2006 (date of incorporation) to  
31 December 2007.
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is US dollars. At 31 December 2008, the exchange rate was £1 = US$1.450  
(2007: £1 = US$1.996) and the average rate for the year was £1 = US$1.855 (2007: £1 = US$2.004).
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairment. Investments are tested  
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.  
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the higher of net realisable value and the discounted  
future earnings from the investment.
Financial assets and liabilities
Interest and non-interest bearing amounts owed by Group companies are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently remeasured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Finance income is accounted for on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in currencies other than US dollars, including the issue of shares, are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated using the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
IPO costs
Costs related directly to the issuance of shares have been deducted from equity. Attributable IPO costs have been allocated between the share 
premium and profit and loss in proportion to the number of new shares issued compared to the existing number of shares. Other costs attributed 
to the listing have been expensed.
Taxation including deferred tax
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that 
deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is recognised on an 
undiscounted basis.
Share-based payments
In 2008, the Company has adopted a Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) designed to reward senior management employees of the Group for 
achieving the Group’s strategic objectives and provide an appropriate level of long-term performance related pay. Each year, participants will 
receive conditional awards of shares in the Company which will normally vest three years after they are awarded. This is subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions, measured over a three-year performance period and continued service. 
The share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the Company’s financial statements and is measured at fair value of the 
equity instruments at the date of grant. The fair value was calculated by applying the Monte Carlo model.
In accordance with UITF 44 and FRS 20, where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such 
share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to 
record an expense for such compensation with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent. Consequently, in 
the financial statements of the parent, the Company is required to record an addition to the Company’s investment in ENRC Management (UK) 
Limited, with a corresponding increase recognised in other reserves.
In 2007, the Company adopted an equity-settled share-based bonus award scheme for the Directors, management, senior employees and 
professional advisors for their contribution to the Company’s preparations for admission to the London Stock Exchange. The fair value of services 
received under the scheme was measured by reference to the fair value of the shares granted less par value at the grant date and was recognised 
in the profit and loss account. 
Further details on the share-based payments can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report section of this Annual Report and notes to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Dividends
Dividends payable are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on 
the balance sheet date. Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or when declared after the balance 
sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.

2. Cash flow statement, related party and financial instruments disclosures 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 (Revised) and presenting 
financial instruments disclosures under the terms of FRS 29. A consolidated cash flow statement has been presented in the consolidated financial 
statements of the Company. 
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 which states that disclosure of related party transactions is not required in parent company 
financial statements when those statements are presented together with its consolidated financial statements. 
3. Directors’ emoluments and employee information
The Company has two employees in 2008 and 2007, who are also Directors of the Company. Emoluments of all the Directors are borne by ENRC 
Management (UK) Limited. Full details of the remuneration and share interests of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2008 are set out 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report section of this Annual Report.
4. Auditors’ remuneration
The fee for the statutory accounts audit of the Company for 2008 is £15 thousand. This fee has been borne by a fellow Group company and 
subsequently recharged to the Company.
5. Tax
The Company has unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences of US$3 million. The standard rate of 
Corporation tax in the United Kingdom changed to 28% on 1 April 2008. There are no material factors affecting future tax charges.

In December 2006, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of ENRC NV (a Dutch company). Under sections 131 and 133 of the 
Companies Act 1985, the share premium on these shares was not recognised. The cost of the investment was recorded as the par value of 
20,000,000 shares of US$10 each and a promissory note of US$1,000 million. In March 2007, the Company exchanged shares held in ENRC NV  
for 100% of the share capital of ENRC Finance Limited and as such ceased to recognise its investment in ENRC NV and recognised an equivalent 
investment in ENRC Finance Limited.
In 2007, the Company acquired 100% of the share capital of ENRC Management (UK) Limited. 
In accordance with UITF 44 and FRS 20, the cost of investment in ENRC Management (UK) Limited was increased by US$3 million during 2008 to 
reflect the cost of the conditional awards of shares granted to the employees of ENRC Management (UK) Limited. Full information on the fair value 
calculations is given in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Both ENRC Finance Limited and ENRC Management (UK) Limited were incorporated in the United Kingdom.
7. Receivables and payables to Group companies
The amount owed by ENRC Finance Limited bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.056%. It is repayable on demand.
The balance payable to ENRC Management (UK) Limited at 31 December 2008 relates to management recharges. At 31 December 2007, the 
balance comprised IPO costs paid on behalf of the Company. The amounts are non-interest bearing and repayable on demand.

8. Share capital continued
The Company was incorporated and registered in England and Wales on 8 December 2006 as a public limited company with a share capital of 
£50,000 divided into two ordinary shares of £1 each and 49,998 non-cumulative redeemable preference shares of £1 each. The share capital  
was one-quarter paid. On 19 December 2006, the Board resolved to effect the transfer of the two ordinary shares and 49,998 non-cumulative 
redeemable preference shares to The State Property and Privatisation Committee of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the 
‘Committee’). On the same day, the authorised share capital of the Company was increased from £50,000 to £50,000 and US$200,000,000 by 
the creation and issuance of 20,000,000 new ordinary shares of US$10 each as part of the acquisition of ENRC NV (refer note 6). In addition, the 
49,998 non-cumulative redeemable preference shares of £1 each held by the Committee, were re-designated as ordinary shares of £1 each, the 
resulting 50,000 ordinary shares of £1 each were consolidated into one ordinary share of £50,000 and then the ordinary share was redesignated 
as a special share. 
Share split 
At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 8 November 2007, each of the issued, and each of the authorised but unissued, 
ordinary shares of US$10.00 par value each in the capital of the Company was subdivided into 50 ordinary shares of US$0.20 par value each.  
On the same day, the authorised share capital of the Company was increased to 2,000,000,000 ordinary shares.
Issuance of shares on IPO
On 12 December 2007, the Company successfully completed its IPO and Listed on the London Stock Exchange. A total number of 277,750,000 
shares were issued at £5.40 with a par value of US$0.20 each for total proceeds of about £1,500 million. Costs related to the issuance of new 
shares and attributable IPO costs taken against share premium amounted to US$96 million.
A further 10,000,000 ordinary shares with a par value of US$0.20 each were awarded to Directors, management, senior employees and 
professional advisers as part of the IPO Bonus Plan on 12 December 2007. The fair value of the services received was measured at the fair value 
of the shares at the grant date of £5.40 per share less par value. The share awards were subject to a restriction period of one year from the date  
of the IPO, during which any dealings were prohibited.
Redemption of special share
Pursuant to the Company’s articles of association, the one special share of nominal value of £50,000 held by the Committee was cancelled  
upon admission of the Company’s shares to the London Stock Exchange. As the share was only one-quarter paid up, £12,500 was paid to the 
Committee upon cancellation.

10. Guarantees and commitments
In September 2007, the Company entered into an investment agreement with Eurasian Energy Corporation JSC (‘EEC’), its subsidiary, to finance 
the expansion of its production capacity, including that of its operating Divisions, amounting to a total of US$309 million until 2011.
In April 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with ENRC Finance Limited and EEC, whereby ENRC Finance Limited undertook obligations 
to carry out on behalf of the Company, the Company’s investment commitments to EEC.
11. Post balance sheet events
ENRC Finance Limited has declared on 23 March 2009 and paid on 24 March 2009 a dividend of US$300 million to the Company. In accordance 
with FRS 21, these financial statements do not reflect this dividend receivable at 31 December 2008, which will be accounted for as dividend 
income in 2009.
A final dividend of US$0.19 per share has been recommended by the Board of Directors amounting to US$245 million, giving a total dividend in 
respect of 2008 of US$0.31 per share or US$400 million in aggregate. This is payable on 17 June 2009 to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 3 April 2009. The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 10 June 2009

Corporate Information Corporate Governance Business Review Group Overview Financial Statements Reserves
Reserves
Independent Expert Ore Reserves Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2008
SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd. (‘SRK’) has reviewed the Mineral Resource and 
Ore Reserve Statements as of 31 December 2008 of the mining assets 
of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC (‘ENRC’) and restated 
these in accordance with the terms and definitions given in the 2004 
Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves (the ‘JORC Code’) as published by the Joint 
Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and 
Metallurgy. 
SRK has reviewed the Company’s GKZ ‘reserve’ statements as prepared 
in accordance with the local regulatory requirements of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan. SRK has then modified and translated these for reporting 
in accordance with the JORC Code without recourse to fundamental 
recalculation. 
In 2007, SRK prepared an independent mineral experts’ report (‘MER’) 
on the mining, processing, smelting and power generating assets of 
ENRC. An abridged version of this MER was included in the prospectus 
published by the Company in connection with the admission of the 
Ordinary shares of the Company to trading on the London Stock 
Exchange plc’s market for listed securities in December 2007  
(the ‘IPO’). The MER contained Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve 
Statements in accordance with the JORC code, dated 1 July 2007.
In 2008, SRK carried out a desktop review of the Mineral Resources and 
Ore Reserves, and provided an updated statement in line with the JORC 
Code, based on a review of the depletion of the Reserves from the 
annual submissions to the state (the 5GR forms), the actual production 
figures from the mines and any information on significant changes to 
the operations provided to SRK by ENRC. No site visits were undertaken.
For 2009, considering the significant changes to commodity prices and 
demand/production profile for many of the products produced by ENRC, 
this update has been carried out in significantly more detail than  
the 2008 review. Visits to Kazchrome’s Donskoy GOK ferrochrome 
operations and Zhairemsky GOK’s iron/manganese operations were 
undertaken in February 2009. The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve 
Statements as of 31 December 2007, as prepared by SRK during the 
2008 review, form the basis for the current update. 
SRK have reviewed the Ore Reserve Statements in conjunction with the 
current consensus market forecasts, which in turn are derived from the 
median of long-term price assumptions as reported by various analysts 
during Q1 2009. The consensus market forecasts used to support the 
current Ore Reserve declarations are:
Chromite at US$200/tonne and HCFeCr at US$0.80/lb. > >
Manganese concentrate products between US$56 and 193/tonne > >
and iron concentrate products between US$25 and 36/tonne.
Iron ore at US$1.26/dmtu (dry metric tonne units) for pellets,  > >
and US$0.77/dmtu for concentrates. 
Alumina of US$291/tonne. > >
SRK has relied on ENRC and its technical representatives to ensure  
all technical information provided to SRK is accurate. A detailed 
information request list was submitted by SRK and ENRC provided  
data up to the week of 17 March 2009.
The Resource and Reserve statements for 31 December 2008 are based 
on the following assumptions, assessments, recommendations and 
material changes:
Ferroalloys Division
Kazchrome
Donskoy GOK. In 2008 the group produced 5.5Mt ore, 4.3 from both 
open pit and underground mines and 1.3 from stockpiles. The majority 
of production has been and will come from the 10th Anniversary and 
Molodezhnaya Underground Mines. The unconditioned stockpiles have 
now been depleted and the Poiskovoye open pit exhausted. The current 
mining Contract expires on 21 March 2041 and the Reserves are based 
on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2041. The Resources can support 
operations continuing beyond 2041. A significant portion of Reserves 
are dependent on successful application of new mining methods for 
both near surface and deposits at depth, which have not been trialled 
and which will be at a higher cost than the current method. In addition, 
exploitation of under-pit Reserves in certain areas is dependent on new 
methods of access and transportation which require more detailed 
studies and costings. 
Kazmarganets. The current mining Contract for Tur expires on 7 October 
2021. The Reserves are based on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2017. 
The Resources will support operations continuing beyond 2017. The 
current mining Contract for Vostochny Kamys expires on 28 June 2018. 
The Reserves are based on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2013.
Zhairemsky GOK. There has been an overall increase in Mineral 
Resources (132Mt) and Ore Reserves (12Mt) as a result of additional 
technical studies and exploration for Ushkatyn III underground, 
Perstenevsky and Zapadny Zhomart/Zhomart operations. Only limited 
production was being carried out at the time of the site visit in February 
and the bulk of the mines operation is on care and maintenance 
pending improvement of the spot prices for the products produced.  
SRK has however undertaken sufficient work to demonstrate that the 
Reserves are economic based on the assumed consensus market 
forecasts for the long-term prices of the various products.
The current mining Contract for Ushkatyn III expires in June 2015 and for 
Zhomart in June 2013. The Reserves for the Zhairem deposit are based 
on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2024. SRK has declared the Reserves 
on the understanding that Zhairemsky GOK can extend these licences 
under similar terms for periods that match their Life of Mine plans.
Iron Ore Division – SSGPO
In 2008 SSGPO produced 37.8Mt of iron ore at 32.4% iron, from four 
open pits and one underground mine. The current mining Contract 
expires in May 2015. SRK has declared the Reserves on the assumption 
that SSGPO will apply for, and be granted, at least one 25-year 
extension of this Contract until 2040 under similar terms and 
conditions. The Reserves are based on an overall ‘Life of Mine’ plan for 
SSGPO until 2040. The Resources can support operations continuing 
beyond 2040. 
Aluminium Division – AoK
In 2008 the two Divisions of AoK produced 5.2Mt of bauxite, 4.5Mt from 
10 open pits in three areas of KBRU and 0.67Mt from three open pits of 
TBRU. All mining licences expire on 21 January 2017, with the exception 
of the mining licence for Vostochno-Ayatskoye which expires on 26 July 
2031. SRK has declared the Reserves on the understanding that AoK 
can extend these licences under similar terms for periods that match 
their Life of Mine plans. The Reserves are based on an overall Life of 
Mine Plan for AoK to the end of 2041. SRK notes that the economic 
viability of TBRU is dependent on the production from KBRU. The 
Reserves are also based on the assumption that AoK maintains ongoing 
contracts for some 75% of production to third party sales of alumina 
through the Life of Mine period. 
Energy Division – EEC
Vostochny Open Pit Coal Mine produced almost 20Mt coal in 2008.  
The current mining Contract expires on 18 March 2022. The Reserves 
are based on a Life of Mine Plan to the end of 2045 and on the 
understanding that EEC can extend the Contract under similar terms  
for a period that matches the Life of Mine plan. The Resources can 
support operations continuing beyond 2045.

Ore Reserves/Mineral Resources Estimates
Ore reserves and mineral resources for ENRC Divisions are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration 
Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2004 (the ‘JORC Code’). Codes or guidelines similar to JORC with only minor regional 
variations have been adopted in South Africa, Canada, the United States, Chile, Europe and some other countries. Together these represent 
current best practice for reporting ore reserves and mineral resources. 
The JORC Code envisages the use of reasonable investment assumptions, including the use of projected long-term commodity prices,  
in calculating reserve estimates.
Ore Reserve and Mineral Resources information in the tables below is based on Ore Reserve and Mineral Statements of the individual entities  
as audited and re-stated as at 31 December 2008 in accordance with the JORC Code by SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd (‘SRK’).
The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resources estimate figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2008. Summary data for year-end 2007 are 
shown for comparison. No significant changes with respect to the classification of the Mineral Reserve and Ore Resource have occurred in 2008.
Mineral Resources are inclusive of Ore Reserves. Metric units are used throughout.

mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and 
modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that 
extraction could reasonably be justified. A Probable Ore Reserve has a lower level of confidence than  
a proved ore reserve but is of sufficient quality to serve as the basis for a decision on the development of

Notes Kazakhstan – A Powerhouse in Central Asia
Since its independence in 1991, the Republic of Kazakhstan has 
emerged as a strong economic force, with average annual GDP growth 
of 9.5% to US$135 billion in 2008 from US$21.6 billion in 1998, 
underpinned by the country’s vast oil, mineral and metal resources. 
The country is geographically well positioned to benefit from the 
rise of a resource-hungry China and the emerging economy of 
Russia, the Republic of Kazakhstan’s largest trade partners.
Building upon this strong foundation, the Government of  
the Republic of Kazakhstan has for some years been taking 
active measures to promote and sustain economic 
growth in more diverse sectors, providing 
additional attractive opportunities for 
foreign investors despite the current 
challenging economic environment. 
It has adopted the ‘Kazakhstan-2030’ 
strategy, which sets out a roadmap 
for the country’s domestic and foreign 
policy, as well as the improvement 
of legal and tax systems.
The natural resources sector is the main 
destination for foreign investment in Kazakhstan 
and will remain a significant contributor into the 
economy of the country. Oil and gas constitute 
more than 60% of Kazakhstan’s total exported 
goods, while the country possesses around 3% 
of the world’s proven coal reserves, more than 
25% of the world’s total uranium reserves and 
about 30% of the world’s chrome reserves.
There are a number of investment opportunities 
outside the extractive sectors of the economy, 
such as energy and transport. The Government 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan supports and 
encourages development of infrastructure projects.  
The country plays a crucial role in the establishment 
of security and stability in Central Asia. The 
Government of Kazakhstan is currently working 
to acquire observer status at the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) and to 
become a member of the World Trade Organisation 
(WTO). In 2010 the Republic of Kazakhstan will 
take over the presidency of the Organisation for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
In order to mitigate the implications of the current 
global financial crisis on the economic and social 
situation in the Republic of Kazakhstan, the 
Government has announced the implementation  
of the Action Plan on Stabilisation of the 
country’s economy and financial system for 
2009–10. The main efforts will be directed to 
support the country’s banks and their lending 
activities. The construction, manufacturing and 
agricultural sectors are also to receive support.

Review of Operations
Operational Issues in 2010
Both of Roxi’s active subsidiary 
operating companies, Galaz and 
Company LLP and BNG Ltd LLP 
have experienced a difficult year from 
an operational perspective. There 
have been three extraordinary events 
which have adversely affected 
operational performance. 
In February 2010 the Ministry of 
Energy and Mineral Resources 
(MEMR) was disbanded by the 
Government of Kazakhstan and 
responsibilities for overseeing oil  
and gas exploration and production 
contracts was put in the hands of  
the newly formed Ministry for Oil  
and Gas (MOG) and the Ministry of 
Industry and New Technology 
(MINT). The hand-over of supervision 
was completed by October 2010, and 
shortly following this the Company 
received approval of the NW  
Konys, and South Yelemes Pilot 
Development Schemes from the 
MOG and MINT in December 2010.
In April 2010 Roxi announced that it 
had executed an Agreement to sell a 
40% interest and operational control in 
Galaz and Company LLP to LG 
International Corporation of Korea. 
However it was not until January 2011 
that Roxi had received all the 
necessary consents and waivers from 
the Government to complete the sale, 
and release the funds available to 
resume operations.
In June 2010 The Republic of 
Kazakhstan introduced new 
legislation covering the regulations 
governing oil and gas companies 
in Kazakhstan. These regulations  
had the most impact on areas of 
procurement procedures, Kazakh 
content, gas flaring permissions and 
environmental emissions permits. 
The effect was that all operating 
subsidiaries had to familiarize 
themselves with new procedures  
and recruit the necessary staff to 
comply with the new procurement 
and permitting regulations, together 
with Government officials. In some 
cases this meant having to 
retrospectively apply for permits 
which were not required under  
the previous legislation. 
The cumulative effect of these 
developments was to delay progress 
at both Galaz and BNG. However, 
these events are unlikely to be 
repeated in the near term and  
should not significantly impact  
future operations.

RXP2635 - AR10 Front AW11.indd   2 20/05/2011   16:50 03 Roxi Petroleum plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Business Review
Roxi acquired a 50.15% interest in 
Galaz and Company LLP in 2008. 
The block covers an area of 30 
square kilometers and lies directly 
north of the Konys fi eld operated by 
KAM. The block is towards the south 
edge of the Turgai basin, and has 
access to export by pipeline to China 
and by rail to Russia.
Contract Status
On 16 February 2011 Ministry of Oil 
and Gas extended exploration 
contract of Galaz and Company LLP 
for two more years up to 14 May 2013. 
Exploration
In February 2010 Galaz completed 
well NK22 on the SW corner of the 
block, to test the “North Konys” 
structure on eastern side of the 
Karatau fault system to a depth of 
2800m. Hydrocarbons were 
interpreted from logs in the Arskum 
Formation and a hydrocarbon 
gradient was measured in the 
formation. As a result of a failed 
cement job in the original hole, an 
offset well (NK20) was spudded by 
the contractor in December 2010, 
and drilled to a total depth of 1,550m 
with the objective of re-testing the 
Arskum Sands. The well failed to fi nd 
hydrocarbons in the Arskum but 
cored thin (non-commercial) oil 
bearing sands in the Upper Jurassic.
Well NK22 and subsequently NK20 
confi rm the migration and entrapment 
of hydrocarbons on the North Konys 
Structure, consequently in August, 
Galaz applied for and has been 
subsequently awarded an extension 
of the Contract Area to approximately 
180 square kilometers to the 
southeast of the block.
NW Konys Field Pilot 
Production
The block contains the NW Konys 
satellite structure which was 
successfully appraised in 2008 and 
2009; following which the Company 
submitted an application for Pilot 
Production in November 2009. 
The Company received confi rmation 
from the Ministry that Pilot Production 
for NW Konys was sanctioned in late 
December 2010. However, one 
impact of the new oil and gas 
legislation is to delay the start of Pilot 
production until completion of 
Facilities Design Project, EIA and 
issuance of Emissions Permits, from 
the Environmental Agency, expected 
in the second half of 2011.
In June 2010, a reserves audit was 
announced by Roxi undertaken by 
McDaniel and Associates Inc. Gross 
Proven plus Probable (2P) reserves of 
7.5mmbbls were estimated for the NW 
Konys fi eld. This was the fi rst reserves 
update since the appraisal drilling in 
2009, and will be updated following 
further drilling likely to be in 2012. 
Forward Programme
Roxi’s main priority in 2010 was to 
secure fi nancing for the development 
of NW Konys, which was successfully 
achieved by the sale of 40% interest 
to LGI by Roxi and partners. Over the 
next twelve months Galaz is planning 
the appraisal and production drilling 
campaign on the fi eld, together with 
facilities and infrastructure, which will 
be of great signifi cance to Roxi, 
providing the Company’s fi rst 
consistent revenue stream, and 
further reserves growth.
Notifi cation about contract two year 
extension period should result in 
sanction and amendment to the 
Sub-Soil User Contract (SSUC) by 
June 2011, enabling the start of 
production from NW Konys as early 
as October 2011.

Roxi acquired a 58.41% interest in 
BNG Ltd LLP in 2008, and in 2009 
entered into a farm-out agreement 
with Canamens to fund the work 
programme for the initial exploration 
period. The block covers an area of 
1,561 square kilometers and lies in the 
South Emba Sub-basin 40 kilometers 
to the southeast of Tengiz fi eld. 
Contract Status
The initial period of the Sub-Soil User 
Contract (SSUC) terminates in May 
2011. In 2010 the operating 
Company, BNG Ltd LLP, applied for 
the fi rst two year extension of the 
SSUC, which should, after review, be 
granted by the Ministry of Oil and 
Gas.
South Yelemes Pilot Production
The primary focus of operations in 
2010 has been to appraise the South 
Yelemes discovery in the north of the 
block. The Pilot Production Project 
was submitted to the Ministry for 
approval in 2009, however, due to 
re-structuring of the Ministry the 
approval was delayed until November 
2010, with fi nal project, environmental 
and procurement approvals expected 
in the second half of 2011. 
Well NSA-54 was re-entered and put 
onto three month test in the fi rst half 
of the year, producing a cumulative 
4,130 barrels of oil. Later in the year 
appraisal wells 805 and 806 
(classifi ed as exploration wells) were 
drilled to evaluate the Jurassic 
potential in the fi eld, with the 
objective of booking SPE initial 
reserves for the fi eld in 2011. The 
wells yielded mixed results, delineating 
limited potential in the Jurassic 
reservoirs but striking new pay in the 
lowermost Cretaceous. Well 806 
encountered an Oil-Water Contact in 
the Jurassic, but well 805 tested dry 
oil at 226 barrels of oil per day from 
the Jurassic and Cretaceous tests 
indicate that this new reservoir should 
be capable of producing at 
commercial rates on pump. The 
Company is currently updating 
reserves and evaluating how to bring 
the Cretaceous into production under 
the existing development scheme, 
and thereby raise Pilot Production 
from South Yelemes Field at the 
earliest opportunity.
During the testing phase oil is being 
sold at the wellhead at domestic 
prices, but after stable production 
is established the Company will look 
for export options for the sales, which 
will result in a marked increase in 
BNG revenue. 
Exploration
BNG has continued the strategy of 
3D seismic acquisition across the 
block in 2010. In August 2010 BNG 
completed a further 800 square 
kilometer acquisition programme, 
which brings the total 3D coverage 
on BNG block to 1,376 square 
kilometers. The data was processed 
in Almaty and merged in with the 
data acquired in 2009. 
BNG continues to gather and assimilate 
historical and surrounding analogue 
data to fully evaluate the exploration 
potential of the block, including the 
highly prospective Carboniferous and 
Lower Permian formations, and the 
Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous 
reservoirs, all of which produce in the 
areas surrounding the block (the initial 
fi ndings of the analysis of the 3D 
seismic information gathered is 
expected to be available during the 
second quarter of 2011).
A drilling contract was signed at the 
end of 2009 with a local drilling 
contractor to drill up to 7 wells on BNG. 
After drilling two South Yelemes 
appraisal wells a third (exploration) well 
135 was spudded at the end of the 
year on the North Yelemes prospect. 
This small structure was chosen as a 
potential satellite development to South 
Yelemes, with the objective of early 
production. The well was plugged and 
abandoned with uncommercial oil 
shows in fi rst quarter of 2011. 
Consequently, and as a result of the 
initial results of the 3D seismic BNG  
has suspended the drilling programme 
on the BNG block to focus on the 
exploration potential currently being 
interpreted on the 3D seismic.
Forward Programme
By mid 2011 BNG should receive the 
Ministry of Oil and Gas confi rmation of 
the extension of the SSUC, after 
which the Company plans to prepare 
for a deep well to test the Paleozoic 
potential on BNG block. In the 
meantime, the Company will focus on 
bring South Yelemes fi eld into pilot 
production. If successful, the 
development of the Lower Cretaceous 
reservoir in South Yelemes would have 
a signifi cant impact on BNG and Roxi. 
Roxi should complete SPE reserves 
and resources update in 2011.

05 Roxi Petroleum plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Roxi acquired a 50% interest in 
Ravninnoe Oil LLP in 2007, and 
in 2008 entered into a farm-out 
agreement with Canamens to 
fund the fi rst well the Ravninnoe 
structure. The block covers an area 
of 121 square kilometers and lies in 
the South Emba Sub-basin 60 
kilometers to the northeast of the 
BNG Contract Area. 
In April 2010, newly drilled well 20 
was tested at rates of 240 barrels of 
oil per day from the Carboniferous 
dolomite reservoir. After acidisation, 
little or immaterial increase in 
production was observed. The rate
 of 500 barrels of oil per day was 
envisaged as being the commercial 
cutoff for development of Ravninnoe, 
due to the high costs of drilling this 
deep high pressure reservoir. Despite 
the potential to apply horizontal 
drilling and fracturing, in October 
2010 in order to conserve funding 
for BNG Roxi (together with our 
Ravinnoe farm-in partner Canamens) 
announced that it had agreed to sell 
its entire interest in Ravninnoe Oil
 LLP to Beimar Oil LLP.
Roxi acquired a 50% interest in Beibars 
Munai LLP in 2007 , which operates the 
Beibars Contract area on the Caspian 
shoreline south of the city of Aktau. 
While acquiring 3D seismic in 2008 the 
Contract was put into Force Majeure 
when the acreage was awarded as a 
military exercise area, and the Kazakh 
forces notifi ed Beibars Munai LLP that 
it would not be permitted access to the 
area. Agreement was reached with the 
military to fi nish the seismic acquisition, 
and since that time there has been no 
operational activity.
The Company plans to resolve the 
access issue with the army and then 
seek farm-in partners to explore 
Beibars contract area.
Roxi acquired a 58.41% interest in 
Munaily Kazakhstan LLP in 2008, 
which operates the Munaily fi eld in 
the Atyrau oblast. That year two 
wells were drilled on the fi eld and one 
well was re-entered. The Company 
estimated that approximately 1.1 
million barrels of by-passed reserves 
were recoverable from the old fi eld. 
Despite the success of these 
operations the Board of Roxi 
decided that the scale of the project 
was too small, and entered into an 
Agreement to sell its entire interest to 
BTC, a local drilling Company in 
December 2008. The sale of Munaily 
has not yet completed and Roxi has 
not participated in any operations on 
the block since 2008. Further details 
of the current position is set out in 
the Chief Executive’s report.

07 Roxi Petroleum plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Proved Reserves
Proved Reserves are those quantities 
of petroleum which, by analysis of 
geosciences and engineering data, 
can be estimated with reasonable 
certainty to be commercially 
recoverable, from a given date 
forward, from known reservoirs and 
under defined economic conditions, 
operating methods, and government 
regulations. If deterministic methods 
are used, the term reasonable 
certainty is intended to express a 
high degree of confidence that the 
quantities will be recovered. If 
probabilistic methods are used, there 
should be at least a 90% probability 
that the quantities actually recovered 
will equal or exceed the estimate.
Probable Reserves
Probable Reserves are those 
additional Reserves which analysis  
of geosciences and engineering  
data indicate are less likely to be 
recovered than Proved Reserves  
but more certain to be recovered 
than Possible Reserves. It is equally 
likely that actual remaining quantities 
recovered will be greater than or less 
than the sum of the estimated Proved 
plus Probable Reserves (2P). In this 
context, when probabilistic methods 
are used, there should be at least  
a 50% probability that the actual 
quantities recovered will equal  
or exceed the 2P estimate.
Contingent Resources
Contingent Resources are those 
quantities of petroleum estimated,  
as of a given date, to be potentially 
recoverable from known accumulations, 
but the applied project(s) are not yet 
considered mature enough for 
commercial development due to one  
or more contingencies. Contingent 
Resources may include, for example, 
projects for which there are currently  
no viable markets, or where 
commercial recovery is dependent 
on technology under development, or 
where evaluation of the accumulation 
is insufficient to clearly assess 
commerciality. Contingent Resources 
are further categorized in accordance 
with the level of certainty associated 
with the estimates and may be 
sub-classified based on project 
maturity and/or characterized by  
their economic status.
Category C1 
C1 reserves are computed on the 
basis of results of geological 
exploration work and production 
drilling and must have been studied 
in sufficient detail to yield data from 
which to draw up either a trial 
industrial development project in the 
case of a natural gas field or a 
technological development scheme 
in the case of an oil field. 
Category C2 
C2 reserves are preliminary 
estimated reserves of a deposit 
calculated on the basis of geological 
and geophysical research of 
unexplored sections of deposits 
adjoining sections of a field 
containing reserves of higher 
categories and of untested deposits 
of explored fields. The shape, size, 
structure, level, reservoir types, 
content and characteristics of the 
hydrocarbon deposit are determined 
in general terms based on the results 
of the geological and geophysical 
exploration and information on the 
more fully explored portions of a 
deposit. Category C2 reserves are 
used to determine the development 
potential of a field and to plan 
geological, exploration and 
production activities. 
Category C3 
C3 resources are prospective reserves 
prepared for the drilling of (i) traps 
within the oil-and-gas bearing area, 
delineated by geological and 
geophysical exploration methods 
tested for such area and (ii) the 
formation of explored fields which have 
not yet been exposed by drilling. The 
form, size and stratification conditions 
of the assumed deposit are estimated 
from the results of geological and 
geophysical research. The thickness, 
reservoir characteristics of the 
formations, the composition and the 
characteristics of hydrocarbons are 
assumed to be analogous to those for 
explored fields. Category C3 resources 
are used in the planning of prospecting 
and exploration work in areas known  
to contain other reserve bearing fields.

Galaz
On the positive side, we recently 
completed the much anticipated 
farm-out of part of our interest at 
Galaz to LGI, the Korean multi-
national corporation. The funds 
released both to develop the Galaz 
asset and for Roxi day to day use 
were well timed.
Development work is expected to 
commence in earnest at Galaz in 
the second quarter of 2011 
following the receipt of a final 
clearance under the new Kazakh 
environmental law. We believe that 
this should allow production to 
commence by October 2011.
BNG Seismic evaluation
Also on the positive side we have 
almost completed the interpretation of 
the seismic data collected at the BNG 
Contract Area (“BNG”) over the past 
couple of years. This is being 
evaluated by our external consultants, 
Gaffney, Cline and Associates Ltd, the 
results of which should be announced 
during the second quarter 2011.
Drilling results at BNG
Our drilling activity on South Yelemes 
has resulted in some positive oil 
shows from the first three wells drilled 
there in 2010, for which we received 
notification of our pilot production 
license in December 2010. 
On the negative side in February 
2011 on the North Yelemes, one of 
our smaller prospects on BNG, we 
announced that, based on wire 
logging, there were no zones of 
commercial interest at Well 135 and 
that it would be plugged and 
abandoned. This was clearly a 
disappointment having drilled to a 
depth of almost 3,000 metres but the 
exercise provided a considerable 
amount of information which we 
believe will assist in our further 
development of this area.
Canamens
In March 2011 we announced that 
Canamens BNG BV (“Canamens”), 
our farm-out partner at BNG and 
before that at Ravninnoe, had 
informed us that they would not be 
making the final payments due 
under the farm-out arrangements 
approved by Roxi shareholders in 
November 2009. These amount to 
some $12 million. 
We had been aware for some  
time that the principal shareholders 
 in Canamens were conducting a 
strategic review of Canamen’s 
investments and future commitments. 
While we thought that Canamens’s 
shareholders may not wish 
Canamens to fund the development 
of the BNG asset following the end of 
the arrangements entered into in 
November 2009, we were surprised 
Chairman’s Statement
Year in Review
Roxi Petroleum plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 10
RXP2635 - AR10 Front AW11.indd   10 20/05/2011   16:50 they have decided not to pay the 
amounts set out in the agreement 
signed at that time.
Under the terms of the farm-out 
agreement the failure by Canamens 
to make these payments results in 
the forfeiture of 6.23 percent of BNG 
LLP, the entity owning the rights to 
BNG.  Accordingly Roxi’s interest in 
BNG LLP would have increased from 
23.41 per cent to 29.64 percent and 
Canamens would have fallen from 35 
percent to 28.77 percent.  
In the short-term Canamens’ decision 
not to advance the funds for the 
development of BNG has had little 
operational impact as much of the 
seismic acquisition and processing 
work has been completed and as 
mentioned above the publication of 
an audited portfolio of BNG 
prospectivity is expected in the 
second quarter of 2011.
On 10 May 2011, we announced that 
we had agreed with Canamens to 
cancel the original BNG farm-out. 
Accordingly Roxi will own 58.41 
percent at the BNG Contract Area. 
Additionally Canamens have agreed 
to novate its loans from BNG Ltd LLP 
to Roxi, other than US$ 2.5 million 
which will be repaid by BNG Ltd LLP, 
in return for Roxi granting a 1.5 
percent royalty on its gross value of 
future production from the BNG 
Contract Area. I am delighted to 
report that as well as regaining 
majority control of this asset Roxi has 
resumed operational and financial 
control of all development operations 
at the BNG Contract Area.
The significance of this for Roxi, is 
that BNG Energy BV can now seek a 
new farm out partner by farming out 
an interest in BNG LLP in exchange 
for the new partner providing 
additional funding into the operating 
asset. This will allow for the BNG to 
explore some of the deeper horizons 
identified from recently performed 3D 
seismic work carried out across the 
license area. Roxi will also now be 
entitled to US$23.6 million of loans 
that were previously due to 
Canamens, representing their share 
of historical funding provided to the 
BNG asset, which have now been 
novated to Roxi as part of the deal.
Management
As previously reported during the year 
under review we strengthened the 
Board by the appointment in February 
2010 of Edmund Limerick, as a non 
Executive Director and in June 2010  
of Hyunsik Jang, as Chief Operating 
Officer. I am pleased to report that 
they are making a strong contribution 
to the running of the Company and 
that in David Wilkes we have a very 
competent Chief Executive well 
equipped to lead us through some 
potentially challenging times.
Kazakhstan
During the period under review there 
have been important changes to both 
the subsoil and taxation legislation. In 
addition there have been changes in 
the senior personnel at some of the 
regulatory authorities with which we 
deal. Inevitably, such a scale of 
change has resulted in delays in 
receiving regulatory approvals and 
consequently, our operations.
What has been pleasing is the way in 
which our team has responded to 
these challenges. I believe this is a 
direct result of our policy of employing 
principally Kazakh nationals and of 
working with our Kazakh partners to 
develop our assets. We continue to 
maintain good relations with both our 
local partners and the local 
authorities; this remains core 
strength of our business.
Employees
Once again I would like to thank all  
of our employees for their continued 
hard work. It is never easy working 
for a Company such as ours in 
difficult times. The progress that 
has been made is principally the 
result of their sustained efforts in 
uncertain times.
Outlook
Now we have concluded an 
acceptable exit from the current 
arrangements with Canamens on 
BNG, we look forward to developing 
our principal assets to move both into 
production later in 2011.

Update
In summary, I would say that we have 
consolidated our position during 2010 
and have made steady progress in 
moving the development of our core 
assets forward. At the same time we 
have de-risked our portfolio by 
moving away from those non-core 
assets that presented higher risked 
returns at higher costs than we could 
realistically afford.
We faced some challenges with delays 
in obtaining the necessary licenses to 
move our core asset’s operations 
forward during the year, particularly for 
Galaz, due to the re-organization at the 
Government’s Ministries that occurred 
part way through the year, which added 
to the normal timeframe for obtaining 
the necessary approvals to progress 
our projects.  We also more recently 
were informed by our partner 
Canamens that they decided not to 
provide all of the funding under their 
agreement to acquire an interest in 
BNG LLP . This presents us with some 
short term challenges in meeting our 
immediate cash obligations which will 
be met through an additional financing 
arrangement that we have now agreed 
with Vertom International NV via a new 
loan facility of US$6 million. 
As well as the new financing 
arrangement that we have put in place 
with Vertom, we have also recently 
agreed with Canamens to cancel the 
sale of the 35% interest in BNG. This 
was considered to be in the best 
interests of both parties and will allow 
Roxi to seek alternate financing 
solutions for the continued 
development of the BNG asset. 
Canamens also agreed to novate their 
loans back to Roxi Plc in return for 
Roxi agreeing to pay to Canamens a 
form of royalty payment based on 
future production achieved from BNG 
LLP. All of these arrangements will 
ensure that we are able to achieve our 
aim to further develop the potential 
from the BNG asset and at the same 
time clear the way for a new financing 
solution to be put in place for BNG.
We also recently received final 
approvals for the extension of the NW 
Konys license area as well as the 
exploration license itself has been 
approved and extended for a further 
two years as well as the pilot 
production license being awarded to 
us, so we are well placed together 
with our new farm-out partner LGI, to 
move this asset to production later 
this year. We are in a similar position 
on BNG with our pilot production 
license on South Yelemes recently 
being awarded to us. Our plan is to 
move both assets to pilot production, 
as soon as the emissions licenses 
have been granted to us by the 
Ministry of Oil and Gas.
We are still waiting for final approval 
and completion for the sale of our 
interest in Ravninnoe and expect that 
this will complete during 2011. In 
respect of the sale of Munaily, we are 
currently re-negotiating the sale to 
BTC which when first negotiated, 
wanted to acquire 59% of Munaily. 
We are now looking to sell our entire 
interest in this asset and are 
re-negotiating our terms with the 
buyer. The Group’s remaining focus 
will be on Beibars where we plan to 
farm-out part of our interest to an 
investor willing to fund the drilling of 
exploratory wells that will enable us to 
assess the potential of this asset.
We continue to maintain our focus on 
cost reduction initiatives and are 
currently reviewing the possible 
restructuring of our holding 
companies structure in 2011. This will 
enable a much more efficient and 
transparent legal structure going 
forward and should enable further 
cost reductions to be achieved in 
addition to those put in place in 2010.
Strategy
Our strategy in the near-term remains 
committed to finding new farm-out 
partners for BNG and Beibars as well 
as achieving production from BNG 
and Galaz, which are now close to 
achieving pilot production, with oil 
discoveries having already been 
made on both assets and with the 
majority of the licensing and 
associated permits now in place to 
start pilot production in the latter part 
of 2011. This will allow us to develop 
Galaz and move onto exploration of

RXP2635 - AR10 Front AW11.indd   12 20/05/2011   16:50 deeper horizons in BNG where  
we believe much greater potential 
can be exploited based on the 
results from our recent 3D seismic 
work completed.
As we move to pilot production from 
our two core assets we will also look 
for further acquisitions into producing 
assets in Kazakhstan.
Financing Arrangements
The completion of the previously 
announced LG deal in January 2011 
provided not only the funding 
necessary for the further 
development of the NW Konys field 
but also funds that helped Roxi 
repay some of its short term loans 
as well as much needed additional 
short-term financing for Roxi’s fixed 
costs going forward. 
In terms of the financing of BNG, 
now that we have cancelled the deal 
with Canamens this will allow us to 
find an alternative financing solution 
for the BNG project. This will remain 
a priority in the near term to enable 
us to fund the exploration and 
development of the BNG operations 
going forward.
Financial Highlights
The Consolidated Income Statement 
on page 25 still reflects the fact that we 
have historically been an exploration 
company with no commercial 
production to date. The results for the 
year were impacted by the impairment 
of our Ravninnoe asset after our 
decision to sell our Ravninnoe interest. 
Additionally the partial disposal of our 
interest in BNG to Canamens released 
some of the unrealized currency 
translation losses that had been 
capitalized prior to the devaluation of 
the national currency. 
The advances received from the LGI 
deal which completed in January 
2011 enabled us to repay some of 
our loans to shareholders that fell 
due during the course of 2010. This 
was important to protect shareholder 
value and prevent the possibility of 
further dilution of the shareholder 
interests in Roxi. At the same time 
the proceeds from the disposal of 
the 40% interest in Galaz and 
Company LLP, provided useful cash 
injection into the Group that will 
sustain us whilst we prepare for pilot 
production from our two core assets 
in the latter part of 2011. These 
factors, together with the cost 
reduction initiatives put in place 
during 2010, will mean that we are in 
a much better position to finance our 
transition to production and 
cashflows than in the past and have 
managed to convert some of our 
historical short term financing 
arrangements to longer  
term debt with our partners that will  
be repaid out of initial production  
from our assets.
Infrastructure
Roxi’s activities are run out of our 
principal office in Almaty. 
Staffing
The Roxi Group now employs in total 
86 staff, all of whom are based in 
Kazakhstan. We have 62 in Almaty 
and 24 in the regional and field 
offices. Of these employees 9 are 
technical staff, 17 are financial staff, 
14 are operational staff and 46 fulfil 
other activities. 79 of our staff are 
Kazakh nationals.
Changes to the Board and executive 
management team have been 
summarised in the Chairman’s report. 
Social Programmes
Under Kazakh regulations part of our 
obligations under various work 
programmes on the assets in which 
we have interest are paid in the form 
of contributions to local social 
programmes. In 2010 Roxi made 
significant contributions to: 
•	 Kyzylorda region social fund  
$211,500 (Galaz); and
•	 Mangistau regional social 
obligation fund $625,000 (BNG).
These contributions, while 
mandatory, help secure the good 
standing of the Company with the 
local regional authorities and with 
centrally based regulators. Roxi is 
pleased to have assisted in the 
developments of these projects. 
Environmental
No significant environmental issues 
have surfaced at any of the properties 
acquired to date. Compliance with 
environmental regulatory bodies is 
being managed from both the 
Kyzyl-Orda and Almaty offices.
Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan continues to develop  
and is constantly improving its legal 
framework and tax legislation to 
achieve the right balance between  
the need to encourage new 
investment into Kazakhstan and 
existing companies who operate 
business in Kazakhstan and the 
State. Operating in Kazakhstan in 
such times of evolution can from time 
to time present challenges. 
As a Kazakh based operation, with a 
majority of Asian investors we believe 
we are ideally placed to deal with any 
issues as they arise and see, in the 
medium-term, some of the difficulties 
being encountered by other less 
integrated international companies 
 as an opportunity for growth.
Outlook
We look forward with confidence as 
both of our core assets move closer 
to production in 2011, bringing 
much more stability to Roxi’s 
operations going forward. We will 
continue to be challenged with 
finding the right financing solutions 
for the exploration of some of the 
deeper prospects on BNG, however, 
we believe that with this in place, 
together with the ongoing 
development of the NW Konys field, 
the transformation process for Roxi 
will be complete, moving us from an 
exploration Company to an oil 
producer and ultimately realizing 
value for our shareholders.

The Directors present their fourth annual report on the 
operations of the Company and the Group, together  
with the audited financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2010. The Chairman’s statement and the 
Chief Executive’s Statement form part of the business 
review for this year.
Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is set out on  
page 25 and shows the loss for the year. The Directors  
do not recommend the payment of a dividend. The 
position and performance of the Group is discussed below 
and further details are given in the Business Review.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the Company and the Group is to 
build a diversified portfolio of oil and gas exploration and 
production assets in Central Asia. The Group’s focus is 
currently on Kazakhstan as a result of numerous niche 
onshore opportunities available under the prevailing 
contract regime and the extensive operational experience 
of the management of the Group in the country.
Group overview
On Admission to AIM in May 2007, the Company raised 
US$78 million from institutional investors to pursue a 
strategy of building a diversified portfolio of oil and gas 
exploration and production assets located in Central Asia 
within three to five years. At that time, the Company had 
agreements to buy three principal assets, Ravninnoe, 
Beibars, and North Karamandybas.
Following the acquisition of 59% of Eragon Petroleum Plc  
which was approved by shareholders on 29 February 2008  
the Group had controlling interests in three additional 
Contract Areas: the BNG Contract Area, the Galaz 
Contract Area and the Munaily Contract Area, which are 
located in the Kyzyl-Orda region and Western Kazakhstan 
in the Pre-Caspian and Turgai Basins.
During 2009, 2010 and 2011 farm-out agreements have 
been negotiated into selling down the Group’s interests in 
the BNG and Galaz assets to provide funding to allow the 
Group to meet its work programme commitments in 
respect of its primary assets. The Group also progressed 
the de-risking of the portfolio of assets by progressing the 
sale of its interests in Ravninnoe Oil LLP and Munaily 
Kazakhstan LLP.
Strategy and future developments
The Group’s strategy is to build a diversified portfolio of oil 
and gas exploration and production assets in Central Asia 
which, in the opinion of the Directors, have potential for 
near-term production and increases in the stated reserves. 
The Company is focused on developing our existing 
portfolio of assets against the backdrop of an oil price 
which has been rising in recent months. 
The key components of the Group’s strategy are 
summarised as follows:
•	 The Group seeks to optimise its core assets by 
achieving early production, securing finance to  
develop its BNG asset and building the infrastructure 
to maximize shareholder value in the near-term;
•	 In the medium-term the Group will identify new 
opportunities for underdeveloped oil and gas assets 
with a view to developing them by sourcing new forms 
of finance and partners to leverage the expertise that 
Roxi has acquired through developing assets within 
Kazakhstan; and
•	 In the longer-term the Group will maximise production 
and export routes to ensure shareholder value is 
progressively increased over time. 
Current trading and prospects
Since its first admission the Company has received only 
minimal income. The Directors are focused on seeking 
early production from the two core Contract Areas. 
For the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group  
reported an after tax loss of US$54.1 million and had  
total equity of US$58.4 million.
The Directors intend to manage the activities of the 
Company in a conservative manner. 
Key	str engths
The Directors believe that the Company’s strengths will 
enable it to pursue a strategy to become a significant 
independent oil Company in Central Asia. The Directors 
believe the Company’s key strengths include:
•	 Experienced team
 The Company benefits from an experienced team of 
proven oil and gas executives who also have in-depth 
experience of operating in Kazakhstan and extensive 
contacts in the region. The Company intends to utilise 
these contacts through their joint venture partners to 
maximise the benefit to the Group’s operations and 
acquisitions.
•	 Significant near-term production
 The Directors believe the Company’s existing reserves 
can be exploited to achieve further near term 
production that will drive early cash flows and will allow 
the business to achieve profitability and the continued 
expansion of the Company’s business.
•	 Significant possibility of additional reserves
 In addition to existing reserves, the Directors consider 
there is a good chance that the actual recoverable 
reserves will prove to be significantly higher, that the 
Contract Areas have historically been inadequately or 
poorly explored, and that the Contract Areas offer 
outstanding development potential.

RXP2635 - AR10 Front AW11.indd   16 20/05/2011   16:50 Governance
17 Roxi Petroleum plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
•	 Further acquisition opportunities
 The Directors consider that with its experienced  
team the Company is well placed to access and 
successfully negotiate oil and gas assets in 
Kazakhstan at competitive prices and to further add to 
its portfolio of oil assets in the future.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Company and the Group is subject to various risks 
relating to political, economic, legal, social, industry, 
business and financial conditions. The following risk 
factors, which are not exhaustive, are particularly relevant 
to the Company and the Group’s business activities:
•	 Financing risks
 The Group continually monitors the financing 
arrangements to ensure the continuation of the 
operational activities. Although the Group has 
secured adequate financing of Galaz and Company 
LLP for 2011 and 2012, it is still in the process of 
seeking financing for BNG LLP for the following two 
to three years.
•	 Exploration risk
 There is no assurance that the Group’s exploration 
activities will be successful. Accordingly, the Group 
seeks to reduce this risk by reviewing the level of 
investment made in each project, as well as engaging 
qualified personnel to undertake detailed assessments 
of the areas under exploration. 
•	 Environmental and other regulatory requirements
 Existing and possible future environmental legislation, 
regulations and actions could cause additional expense, 
capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the 
activities of the Group, the extent of which cannot be 
predicted. Before exploration and production can 
commence the Group must obtain regulatory approval 
and there is no assurance that such approvals will be 
obtained. No assurance can be given that the new rules 
and regulations will not be enacted or existing 
legislations will not be applied in a manner which could 
limit or curtail the Group’s activities.
•	 Operational risks
 The Group currently operates primarily in Kazakhstan. 
The nature of the Group’s investments requires the 
commitment of significant funding to facilitate 
exploration and evaluation expenditure in Kazakhstan. 
It is the nature of oil and gas operations that each 
project is long-term. It may be many years before the 
exploration and evaluation expenditures incurred are 
proven to be viable and for progress to reach 
commercial production. To control these risks the 
Board arranges for the provision of technical support, 
directly or through appointed agents and also 
commissions technical research and feasibility studies 
both prior to entering into these commitments and 
subsequently in the life of these projects.
In addition, operational risks include equipment failure, well 
blowouts, pollution, fire and the consequences of bad 
weather. Where the Group is project operator, it takes an 
increased responsibility for ensuring that the Company is 
compliant with all relevant legislation.
The Group has hired competent people with appropriate 
skills to manage such risks at the appropriate levels within 
the Group structure.
Financing and treasury
The Group’s cash position at 31 December 2010 was 
US$5.0 million (2009:US$ 4.0 million).
The bulk of the Group’s cash balances are held in US 
Dollar denominated accounts.
Events after the reporting period
Other than as disclosed in this annual report, including 
Note 32 to the financial statements, there have been no 
material events between 31 December 2010 and the date 
of this report, which are required to be brought to the 
attention of shareholders. 
Dividend policy
The Directors do not intend to declare or pay a dividend in 
the immediate foreseeable future but, subject to the 
availability of sufficient distributable profits, intend to 
commence the payment of dividends when it becomes 
commercially prudent to do so.
Charitable and political donations
During the year the Group made no charitable or 
political contributions.
Corporate social responsibility
The Company will implement various social investment 
programmes throughout the Group. The Company is 
committed to contribute to improving the quality of life and 
education of the local workforce and communities. The 
Company plans to work with its employees and local 
residents to determine the most effective ways to 
implement the social and community programmes.
Supplier payment policy
It is in the Group’s policy to pay suppliers in accordance 
with the terms and conditions agreed with them. The 
average number of days to pay suppliers in the year under 
review as calculated in the prescribed manner is 100 days 
(2009: 189 days).

Directors’ Report and Business Review continued
Employees
Staff employed by the Group are based primarily  
in Kazakhstan. The recruitment and retention of  
staff, especially at management level, is increasingly 
important as the Group continues to build its portfolio  
of oil and gas assets.
As well as providing employees with appropriate 
remuneration and other benefits together with a safe and 
enjoyable working environment, the Board recognises the 
importance of communicating with employees to motivate 
them and involve them fully in the business. For the most 
part, this communication takes place at a local level but 
staff are kept informed of major developments through 
e-mail updates and access to the Company’s website.
The Company has taken out full indemnity insurance on 
behalf of the Directors and officers.
Health, safety and environment
It is the Group’s policy and practice to comply with health, 
safety and environmental regulations and the requirements 
of the countries in which it operates, to protect its 
employees, assets and environment.
Key performance indicators (“KPIs”)
The Directors are of the opinion that finding prospective 
accumulations of hydrocarbons is the appropriate KPI at 
this stage of the Group’s business.
The Group, together with its partners, has developed a 
balanced scorecard system. The Directors consider that 
the organisation and its operations have developed 
sufficiently for such a system to improve the overall 
operational efficiency and performance and at the same 
time link to the performance, evaluation and remuneration 
scheme across the Group.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis based upon projected future cash flows  
and planned work programmes. 
On 26 April 2011 the Group entered into a binding 
unsecured loan agreement with one of its related parties, 
Verom International NV, for up to US$6,000,000 (see Note 
32.7). In the opinion of the Directors this will cover the 
working capital needs until pilot production from South 
Yelemes commences. From this point operations will be 
cash generative. 
 In the longer term the Company will need to secure a 
farm-out partner to fund the ongoing work programme 
on BNG, for which the major part of this is expected to 
arise in 2013 when the Group drills the deeper horizons 
identified from the recent seismic work undertaken on the 
license area.

Auditors
The Company’s auditors, BDO LLP, have indicated their 
willingness to continue in ofﬁ ce and a resolution 
concerning their reappointment will be proposed at the 
next Annual General Meeting. 
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁ nancial 
statements for each ﬁ nancial year. Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare the Group and Company 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under Company law the Directors must 
not approve the ﬁ nancial statements unless they are 
satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Company and of the proﬁ t or loss 
of the Group and Company for that period. The Directors 
are also required to prepare ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange 
for companies trading securities on the Alternative 
Investment Market. 
In preparing these ﬁ nancial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the ﬁ nancial statements;
•  prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufﬁ cient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the ﬁ nancial statements 
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual 
report and the ﬁ nancial statements are made available on 
a website. Financial statements are published on the 
Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements, which may vary 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Company’s website is the 
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the 
ﬁ nancial statements contained therein.

Petroleum plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 
which comprise the consolidated income statement, the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and parent Company statement in changes 
in equity, the consolidated and parent Company statement 
of financial position, the consolidated and parent Company 
cash flow statement and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s

A description of the scope of an audit of financial 
statements is provided on the APB’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm. 
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion: 
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and the parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2010 and of the Group’s loss for 
the year then ended;
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union;
•	 the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
•	 the parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or

31 Roxi Petroleum plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
General
Roxi Petroleum plc (“the Company”) is a public Company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The address 
of its registered office is 21 John Street, London, WC1N 2BP. These consolidated financial statements were authorised 
for issue by the Board of Directors on 19 May 2011.
The principle activities of the Group are exploration and production of crude oil.
1. Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
1.1 Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)  
as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis based upon projected future cash flows and 
planned work programmes. 
On 26 April 2011 the Group entered into a binding unsecured loan agreement with one of its related parties, Vertom 
International NV, for up to US$6,000,000 (see Note 32.7). In the opinion of the Directors this will cover the working capital 
needs until pilot production from South Yelemes commences. From this point operations will be cash generative. 
In the longer term the Company will need to secure a farm in partner to fund the ongoing work programme on BNG, for 
which the major part of this is expected to arise in 2013 when the Group drills the deeper horizons identified from the 
recent seismic work undertaken on the license area.
The Company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own income 
statement in these financial statements. The Group loss for the year included a loss on ordinary activities after tax of 
US$26,637,000 in respect of the Company which is dealt with in the financial statements of the parent Company.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts in the financial statements. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions or estimates are significant to the 
financial statements are disclosed in note 2.
1.2 Accounting standards issued but not adopted
The IFRS financial information has been drawn up on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in 
the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2009. The following standards, interpretations and amendments to 
existing standards have been adopted for the first time in 2010:

Subsidiary undertakings are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists where the Group 
has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The 
consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed 
a single entity. InterCompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the Group. The 
cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred 
or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any 
minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Where the Group holds interests in a number of jointly controlled entities, it accounts for its interests using proportionate 
consolidation. The share of each of the jointly controlled entity’s assets, liabilities, income and expenses are combined 
on a line-by-line basis with those of the Group. The results of joint ventures are included from the effective dates of 
acquisition and up to the effective dates of disposal.
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and jointly controlled entities are recognised only to the 
extent of unrelated investors’ interests in the entity. The investor’s share in the jointly controlled entity’s profits and losses 
resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the asset or liability of the jointly controlled entity arising on the 
transaction.
The Group includes the assets it controls, its share of any income and the liabilities and expenses of jointly controlled 
operations and jointly controlled assets in accordance with the terms of the underlying contractual arrangement.
1.4 Operating Loss
Operating loss is stated after crediting all operating income and charging all operating expenses, but before crediting or 
charging the financial income or expenses.

1.5 Foreign currency translation
1.5.1 Functional and presentational currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in US Dollars (“USD”), which is the Group’s presentational currency, unless otherwise stated. RS Munai LLP, 
Beibars Munai LLP, Munaily Kazakhstan LLP, Galaz and Company LLP, Roxi Petroleum Services LLP and Roxi Petroleum 
Kazakhstan LLP, subsidiary undertakings of the Group and Ravninnoe Oil LLP and BNG Ltd LLP being jointly controlled 
entities, undertake their activities in Kazakhstan and the Kazakh Tenge is the functional currency of these entities. The 
functional currency for the Company, RS Munai BV, Beibars BV, Ravninnoe BV, Galaz Energy BV and BNG Energy BV is 
USD as the significant transactions and assets and liabilities of these companies are in USD.
1.5.2 Transactions and balances in foreign currencies
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (“foreign currencies”) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items, including the parent’s share 
capital, that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are 
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 
1.5.3 Consolidation
For the purpose of consolidation all assets and liabilities of Group entities with a foreign functional currency are translated 
at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The income statement is translated at the exchange rates approximating 
to those ruling when transaction took place. Exchange difference arising on retranslating the opening net assets from the 
opening rate and results of operations from the average rate are recognised directly in equity (the “cumulative translation 
reserve”).
1.6 Current tax
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
1.7 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided 
for: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business 
combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and current 
tax losses have not been recognised since it is uncertain that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.

1.8 Unproven oil and gas assets
The Group applies the full cost method of accounting for exploration and unproven asset costs, having regard to the 
requirements of IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’. Under the full cost method of accounting, 
costs of exploring for and evaluating oil and gas properties are accumulated and capitalised by reference to appropriate 
cost pools. Such cost pools are based on license areas. The Group currently has five cost pools. 
Exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised within ‘Intangible assets’. Such exploration and evaluation 
costs may include costs of license acquisition, technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploration drilling 
and testing, but do not include costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area, which are 
expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred. 
Tangible assets acquired for use in exploration and evaluation activities are classified as property, plant and equipment. 
However, to the extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible exploration and evaluation asset, 
the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset.
The amounts included within unproven oil and gas assets include the fair value that was paid for the acquisition of 
partnerships holding subsoil use in Kazakhstan. These licenses have been capitalised to the Group’s full cost pool in 
respect of each license area. 
Exploration and unproven intangible assets related to each exploration license/prospect are not amortised but are 
carried forward until the existence (or otherwise) of commercial reserves has been determined. 
Exploration and unproven intangible assets are reviewed for impairments if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and as at the balance sheet date. Intangible exploration and evaluation 
assets that relate to exploration and evaluation activities that are not yet determined to have resulted in the discovery 
of the commercial reserve remain capitalised as intangible exploration and evaluation assets at cost less accumulated 
amortisation, subject to meeting a pool-wide impairment test as set out below. 
Such indicators include the point at which a determination is made as to whether or not commercial reserves exist. 
Where the exploration and evaluation assets concerned fall within the scope of an established full cost pool, the 
exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment together with all development and production assets 
associated with that cost pool, as a single cash generating unit. The aggregate carrying value is compared against 
the expected recoverable amount of the pool, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows 
expected to be derived from production of the commercial reserves. Where the exploration and evaluation assets to 
be tested fall outside the scope of any established cost pool, there will generally be no commercial reserves and the 
exploration and evaluation assets concerned will generally be written off in full. Any impairment loss is recognised in 
the income statement as an impairment and separately disclosed.
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the related exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment 
on a cost pool basis as set out below and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. The carrying 
value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant exploration and evaluation assets is then reclassified as development and 
production assets within property, plant and equipment. Development and production assets are amortised on a unit of 
production basis over the life of the commercial reserves of the pool to which they relate. 
1.9 Abandonment
Provision is made for the present value of the future cost of the decommissioning of oil wells and related facilities. This 
provision is recognised when the asset is installed. The estimated costs, based on engineering cost levels prevailing 
at the balance sheet date, are computed on the basis of the latest assumptions as to the scope and method of 
decommissioning. The corresponding amount is capitalised as a part of tangible fixed assets and is amortised on a 
unit-of-production basis as part of the depreciation, depletion and amortisation charge. Any adjustment arising from 
the reassessment of estimated cost of decommissioning is capitalised, while the charge arising from the unwinding of 
the discount applied to the decommissioning provision is treated as a component of the interest charge.
1.10 Restricted use cash
Restricted use cash is the amount set aside by the Group for the purpose of creating an abandonment fund to cover the 
future cost of the decommissioning of oil and gas wells and related facilities and in accordance with local legal rulings. 
Under SSUC contract the Group must place 1% of the value of exploration costs in an escrow deposit account. At the end 
of the contract this cash will be used to return the field to the condition that it was in before exploration started.

1.11 Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost or fair value on acquisition less depreciation. Depreciation is 
provided on a straight-line basis, at rates calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of each asset 
over its expected useful economic life. The residual value is the estimated amount that would currently be obtained 
from disposal of the asset if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life. 
Expected useful economic life and residual values are reviewed annually.
The annual rates of depreciation for class of property, plant and equipment are as follows:
– motor vehicles over 7 years
– buildings over 10 years 
– other over 2-4 years
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that any of its property, plant and 
equipment has been impaired. If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to 
its carrying value.
1.12 Investments (Company)
Non-current asset investments in subsidiary and associate undertakings are shown at cost less allowance for 
impairment. The cost of acquisition includes directly attributable professional fees and other expenses incurred in 
connection with the acquisition. 
1.13 Financial instruments
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts on initial recognition, as a financial asset, a financial 
liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual agreement.
The Group’s financial assets consist of cash, available for sale financial assets and other receivables. Cash and cash 
equivalents are defined as short-term cash deposits which comprise cash on deposit with on original maturity of less 
than 3 months. Other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
The Group’s financial liabilities are non-interest bearing trade and other payables, other interest bearing borrowings and 
warrants. Non-interest bearing trade and other payables and other interest bearing borrowings are stated initially at fair 
value and subsequently at amortised cost. Warrants are recognised on a fair value through the profit or loss basis.
There are long-term loans between Group entities and from related parties which bear interest at a rate lower than that 
which the Directors consider the Group would bear if the facility had been granted by a third party. Such borrowings 
are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. 
Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fair value is calculated by discounting 
the non-current borrowings and receivables using a market rate of interest.
Financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
1.14 Inventories 
Inventories are initially recognised at cost, and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all 
costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
1.15 Other provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability.
1.16 Share capital
Ordinary and deferred shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

1.17 Share-based payments
The Group has used shares and share options as consideration for goods and services received from suppliers and employees. 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at fair value at the 
date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of such an equity-settled share-based instrument is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with other parties are measured at the fair value of the goods or services 
received, except where the fair value cannot be estimated reliably or excess fair value of the identifiable goods or services 
received, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the 
entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service. The fair value determined at the grant date of such an 
equity-settled share-based instrument is expensed since the shares vest immediately. Where the services are related to the 
issue of shares, the fair values of these services are offset against share premium.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations.
1.18 Warrants
The warrants are separated from the host contract as their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of 
the host contracts. Due to the exercise price of the warrants being in a different currency to a functional currency of the 
Company, at each reporting date the warrants are valued at fair value with changes of fair value recognised in profit and 
loss as they arise. The warrants and host contracts are presented under separate heading on the balance sheet, the fair 
values of the warrants are calculated using Black-Scholes model. 
1.19 GEM facility
The GEM facility is classified as an available for sale asset. The asset recognised relates to future economic benefits of 
the Group being able to obtain funding via share issue to GEM Global Yield Fund Limited at a 10 per cent discount of the 
market price for the last 15 trading days. This asset has been initially recognized at fair value and at each reporting date 
the available for sale asset is fair valued with changes of fair value recognised in profit or loss as they arise.
1.20 Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for oil 
and gas products provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes to third party 
customers. Revenues are recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership together with effective control are transferred 
to the customer and the amount of the revenue and associated costs incurred in respect of the relevant transaction can 
be reliably measured. Revenue is not recognised unless it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sales 
transaction will flow to the Group. Revenues from test production are credited to the unproven oil and gas assets.
1.21 Cost of sales
During test production cost of sales cannot be reliably estimated and therefore a cost of sales equal to revenue is recognised. 
1.22 Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments and making strategic decisions, has been identified as the Board of Directors. 
On this basis the Group has one segment, oil exploration in Kazakhstan.
1.23 Interest receivable
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate method.
1.24 Accounts not presented in sterling
For reference the year end exchange rate from sterling to US$ was 1.55 and the average rate during the year was 1.54.

2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, management has made 
the following judgements and key assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements.
2.1 Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs
Under the full cost method of accounting for exploration and evaluation costs, such costs are capitalised as intangible 
assets by reference to appropriate cost pools, and are assessed for impairment on a concession basis when 
circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable value and, therefore, there is a potential risk 
of an impairment adjustment. This assessment involved judgment as to: (i) the likely future commerciality of the asset and 
when such commerciality should be determined; (ii) future revenues and costs pertaining to any concession based on 
proved plus probable, prospective and contingent resources; and (iii) the discount rate to be applied to such revenues 
and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value. 
2.2 Income taxes
The Group has significant carried forward tax losses in several jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in 
determining deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the probability that taxable profits will be available against 
which carried forward losses can be utilised.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences 
will impact the income statement in the period in which such a determination is made.
2.3 Decommissioning
Provision has been in the accounts for future decommissioning costs to plug and abandon wells. The costs of 
provisions have been added to the value of the unproven oil and gas asset and will be depreciated on the unit 
of production basis. The decommissioning liability is be stated in the accounts at discounted present value and 
accreted up to the final liability by way of an annual finance charge.
The Group has potential decommissioning obligations in respect of its interests in Kazakhstan. The extent to which a provision is 
required in respect of these potential obligations depends, inter alia, on the legal requirements at the time of decommissioning, the 
cost and timing of any necessary decommissioning works, and the discount rate to be applied to such costs.
2.4 Share-based compensation
In order to calculate the charge for share-based compensation as required by IFRS2, the Group makes estimates 
principally relating to the assumptions used in its option-pricing model as set out in Note 28.
3 Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments and making strategic decisions, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
The Group operates in one operating segment (exploration for oil in Kazakhstan); therefore no additional segmental 
information is presented.

10 Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period including shares to be issued.
In order to calculate diluted loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares according to IAS33. Dilutive potential ordinary shares include share 
options granted to employees and Directors where the exercise price (adjusted according to IAS33) is less than the average 
market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the period. During the year the potential ordinary shares are anti-
dilutive and therefore diluted loss per share has not been calculated. At the balance sheet date there were 70,655,264 
(2009: 88,966,145) potentially dilutive ordinary shares consisting of share options and warrants (notes 28 and 29). 
The calculation of earnings per share is based on:

Unproven oil and gas assets represent the acquisition cost and subsequent exploration activities in respect of five licenses 
held by Kazakh Group entities. The carrying values of those assets at 31 December 2010 were as follows: Beibars Munai 
LLP US$ nil (2009: US$ nil), BNG Ltd LLP 23,41% share US$ 35,185,000 (2009 100% consolidated: US$133,959,000), 
Galaz and Company LLP US$ 41,113,000 (2009: US$37,393,000), Munaily Kazakhstan LLP US$ nil (2009: US$ 428,000) 
and Ravninnoe Oil LLP 30% share classified as assets held for sale US$ 7,595,000 (2009: US$ 15,828,000).
The Directors have carried out an impairment review of these assets on a field by field basis. In carrying out this review 
the Directors have taken into account the potential net present values of expected future cash flows and values implied 
by farm-in agreements / sale and purchase agreements (“SPA”s) entered into during the current year and following the 
year end. Due to the early stage of development of these assets, the Directors consider the values implied by the SPAs 
to be the best indicator of value currently available. Accordingly where the value implied by these SPAs is below the net 
book value, a provision has been made to reduce the carrying value of that asset to the value implied by the relevant SPA.
As a result of military training activities the Group currently cannot access the Beibars license area which resulted in a 
force-majeure situation. Due to this ongoing force-majeure situation and the uncertainties surrounding the Beibars asset 
the Directors have made a full provision against this asset. 
As a result of the impairment review, the Directors have made provisions of US$10,354,000 in respect of the Ravninnoe 
asset, with an offsetting release of deferred tax of US$1,494,000. In the prior year provisions totaling US$79,294,000 
were made, comprising Ravninnoe (US$51,524,000), BNG (US$14,281,000), Beibars (US$11,882,000) and Munaily 
(US$1,607,000), with an offsetting release of deferred tax of US$11,066,000.

Ravninnoe interest that is expected to occur in the nearest future. Following the completion of the sale the Company will 
have no further interest in Ravninnoe Oil LLP. 
The assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position. The

BNG Ltd LLP disposal:
During 2009 the Company entered into a sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”) to dispose of 35% of its interest in BNG 
Ltd LLP. The structure of the deal was in two stages, as follows:
(a) Stage 1
On 15 January 2009, the Group and Canamens BNG BV (part of Canamens Group) signed a farm out agreement for 
BNG Ltd LLP. This agreement was amended during 2009 in April, July, September and December.
Under the terms of the restated agreement, Canamens BNG BV agreed to purchase 23% of the equity and 23% of the 
loan receivables of BNG Ltd LLP for a total consideration of US$34 million (“Stage 1”) payable to BNG Energy BV.
Under the terms of the SPA BNG Energy BV is required to loan (“BNG Loan 1”) to BNG Ltd LLP US$27 million of the 
proceeds. Although the funds are passed down in full by BNG Energy BV, 23% of the repayments are required to be 
made to Canamens. This loan was restated on completion of Stage 2, so that 35% of the amount loaned was repayable 
to Canamens and remaining 65% being repayable to BNG Energy BV.
This stage of the transaction was completed on 11 January 2010.
(b) Stage 2
Additionally under the farm out agreement Canamens acquired an option to purchase a further 12% of the equity and the 
loan receivables (including BNG Loan 1) of BNG Ltd LLP for a total consideration of US$23 million (“Stage 2”) payable to 
BNG Energy BV.
On 30 April 2010 Canamens exercised this option.
Under the terms of the agreement BNG Energy BV is required to loan (“BNG Loan 2”) to BNG Ltd LLP all US$23 million of 
the proceeds. Although the funds are passed down in full by BNG Energy BV, 35% of the repayments are required to be 
made to Canamens with the remaining 65% being made to BNG Energy BV.
This stage of the transaction was completed on 30 April 2010.
Following the completion of Stage 2 above, the Company retains an effective interest in BNG Ltd LLP of 23.41% (see note 
32.1 for further information).
The Company has subsequent to the year end agreed to cancel the SPA for the purchase of shares in BNG Ltd LLP by 
Canamens (see note 32.8 for further information).

represents the proportion of previously capitalised translation losses attributed to the proportion of interest sold, now written off during the period. 
Of the US$57,000,000 purchase consideration US$4,501,954 was withheld by Canamens Energy BV in order to pay 
withholding tax on the capital gain. 
Until the date of disposal, BNG Ltd LLP was treated as a subsidiary and was fully consolidated into the financial 
statements of the Group. From the date of disposal, BNG Ltd LLP was treated as a jointly controlled entity and 
proportionally consolidated.

amortised cost. On 14 May 2010, Kuat Oraziman agreed to extend the repayment of this loan to July 2011, as a 
result the loan was fair valued at this date and subsequently accounted for at amortised cost. On 26 April 2011,

28 Share option scheme
During the year the Company issued equity-settled share-based instruments to its Directors and certain employees. 
Equity-settled share-based instruments have been measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based instrument is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on an estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. Options generally vest in four equal tranches over the 
two years following grant.

The range of exercise prices of share options outstanding at the year end is 12p – 65p (2009: 12p – 65p). The weighted 
average remaining contractual life of share options outstanding at the end of the year is 7.51 years (2009: 8.21 years).
Fair value is measured using a binomial lattice model that takes into account the effect of financial assumptions, including 
the future share price volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rates. The expected volatility was determined based 
on both the volatility of the Company’s share price since flotation and the volatility of similar quoted companies. Employee 
exit rates and the expected period from vesting to exercise are also considered, based on historical experience. The 
principal assumptions are:
2010 2009
Expected volatility (%) 80 80
Expected life (periods) 5 5
Risk-free rate (%) 2.84 2.51-2.84

1. The Company entered into a £15,000,000 equity line of credit with GEM Global Fund Limited in return for 9,000,000 warrants. The Company can require 
GEM to subscribe for shares over a 3 year period at an issue price of 90% of an average close bid price for the 15 trading days following the delivery of  
the subscription notice. The warrants were initially recognised at a fair value of US$1,106,000 and have been re-valued at the year end to US$309,000  
(2009: US$644,000) with the difference being credited to the income statement due to the exercise price of the warrants being in sterling and the 
functional currency being US dollar. 
2. Kuat Oraziman agreed to subordinate $14,550,000 of loans made to the Group to the US$5,000,000 loan entered into with Altius Energy Limited. 
US$10,000,000 of the loans were restated on similar terms as Altius Energy Limited’s loan, including the issue of 36,000,000 warrants which were 
valued at US$2,953,000. This amount has reduced the fair value of US$10,000,000 loan to Galaz Energy BV (Note 23). On 29 June 2009 Kuat Oraziman 
transferred his 36,000,000 warrants to Altius Energy Limited. During the year 3,600,000 warrants were exercised (2009: 3,132,500). Also pursuant to 
the terms of the deeds of warrant 56,335 additional warrants were issued during the year. At the year end the outstanding warrants were revalued to 
US$23,000 (2009: US$986,000) with the difference being credited to the income statement due to the exercise price of the warrants being in sterling and 
the functional currency being US dollar. 
During the period ended 31 December 2007 the Company issued warrants over 10,023,112 Ordinary shares of the 
Company. These warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for Ordinary shares for cash consideration of 38p per Ordinary 
Share, and were issued as consideration for corporate and advisory services to the Company prior to its flotation. Warrants 
over 7.5 million shares may be exercised at any time prior to 21 May 2017, while the remaining 2.5 million shares expired on

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
At 31 December 2009 and 2010, the fair value and the book value of the Group and Company’s financial assets and 
liabilities was as follows:

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged 
in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation situation.
The available for sale asset was initially recognised to fair value the benefit derived from the group having access to the 
GEM facility which can be utilised immediately at the request of the Company.  Initially, the asset was recognised the 
same value as the underlying warrants (see Note 29.1) issued to secure the asset facility. Subsequently, the fair value was 
reduced to nil as the Directors do not anticipate the utilisation of the facility prior to expiry.  
The fair value of the warranty liability was initially recognised utilising the Black-Scholes model based on the underlying 
contract terms.  The fair value is recalculated when warrants are issued, exercised, expired or at year end utilising the 
Black-Scholes model. The model takes into account the effect of financial assumptions, including the future share price 
volatility, risk-free interest rates and expected life. 
During 2010 and 2009 the movement in Group and Company’s financial assets and liabilities was as follows:

Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group and Company, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
•	 other receivables
•	 cash at bank
•	 trade and other payables
•	 borrowings
General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group and Company’s risk management objectives and 
policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating 
processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group and Company’s finance 
function. The Board receives regular reports from the finance function through which it reviews the effectiveness of the 
processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the 
Group and Company’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:
Credit risk
Credit risk arises principally from the Group’s other receivables. It is the risk that the counterparty fails to discharge its 
obligation in respect of the instrument. The maximum exposure to credit risk equals the carrying value of these items in 
the financial statements. 
When commercial exploitation commences sales will only be made to customers with appropriate credit rating. 
Credit risk with cash and cash equivalents is reduced by placing funds with banks with high credit ratings.
Capital
The Company and Group define capital as share capital, share premium, deferred shares, shares to be issued, capital 
contribution reserve, other reserves, retained earnings and borrowings. In managing its capital, the Group’s primary 
objective is to provide a return for its equity shareholders through capital growth. Going forward the Group will seek to 
maintain a gearing ratio that balances risks and returns at an acceptable level and also to maintain a sufficient funding 
base to enable the Group to meet its working capital and strategic investment needs. In making decisions to adjust its 
capital structure to achieve these aims, either through new share issues or the issue of debt, the Group considers not 
only its short-term position but also its long-term operational and strategic objectives.
There has been no other significant changes to the Group’s management objectives, policies and processes in the year.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group and Company’s management of working capital and the amount of funding 
committed to its exploration programme. It is the risk that the Group or Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its 
financial obligations as they fall due. 
The Group and Company’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when 
they become due. To achieve this aim, it seeks to raise funding through equity finance, debt finance and farm-outs 
sufficient to meet the next phase of exploration and where relevant development expenditure. 
The Board receives cash flow projections on a periodic basis as well as information regarding cash balances. The Board 
will not commit to material expenditure in respect of its ongoing exploration programmes prior to being satisfied that 
sufficient funding is available to the Group to finance the planned programmes.
Trade and other payables are repayable on demand. The purchase consideration received in advance was mainly settled 
in January 2011 as disclosed in note 32. For maturity dates of current and non-current borrowings see notes 24 and 26. 
For maturity dates of the warrants please see note 29.
Interest rate risk
The majority of the Group’s borrowings are at variable rates of interest linked to LIBOR. As a result the Group is exposed 
to interest rate risk. An increase of LIBOR by 1% would have resulted in an increase in finance expense of US$378,000 
(2009: US$136,000).
There is no significant interest rate risk on the cash and cash equivalents as the Group does not have significant surplus 
cash balances to hold in interest bearing accounts.

Roxi Petroleum plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 66
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
Currency risk
The Group and Company’s policy is, where possible, to allow Group entities to settle liabilities denominated in their 
functional currency (primarily US Dollar and Kazakh Tenge) in that currency. Where Group or Company entities have 
liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency (and have insufficient reserves of that currency to 
settle them) cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from elsewhere within the Group.
In order to monitor the continuing effectiveness of this policy, the Board receives a periodic forecast, analysed by the 
major currencies held by the Group and Company.
The Group and Company is primarily exposed to currency risk on purchases made from suppliers in Kazakhstan, as it is 
not possible for the Group or Company to transact in Kazakh Tenge outside of Kazakhstan. The finance team, along with 
its advisors, carefully monitors movements in the US Dollar / Kazakh Tenge rate and chooses the most beneficial times 
for transferring monies to its subsidiaries, whilst ensuring that they have sufficient funds to continue its operations. The 
currency risk relating to Tenge is insignificant.
31 Related party transactions
The Company has no ultimate controlling party.
31.1 Acquisition of Eragon Petroleum Plc (now Eragon Petroleum Limited (“Eragon”))
The Eragon Acquisition in March 2008, details of which were set out in the Company’s 2008 annual report and accounts, 
comprised certain related party transactions because:
•	 A Director of the Company, Kuat Oraziman, had a beneficial interest in 42.5% (currently 62.88%) of the issued capital 
of Baverstock GmbH (“Baverstock”) and was (and remains) a Director of and holds 50% of the issued share capital of 
both Vertom International N.V. (“Vertom”) and Vertom International BV.
•	 Dae Han New Pharm Co Limited (“Dae Han”) had a beneficial interest in 17 per cent of the issued share capital of 
Baverstock (currently 25.15%). 
As a result of the Eragon Acquisition, the Group entered into related party transactions which include but are not limited 
to the following transactions:
a)  Consulting Services Agreement
On 30 January 2008, the Company entered into a consulting service agreement with Vertom. Pursuant to this agreement, 
the Company allotted 46,153,846 ordinary shares in the Company to Vertom following the extension to the contract area 
of the BNG SSUC, on 7 May 2009. 
31.2 Loan agreements 
a)  Loan from Kuat (as at the date of the Eragon Acquisition)
 At the date of the Eragon Acquisition, in Galaz Energy BV there was a US$10,000,000 loan borrowed from Kuat 
Oraziman in July 2007, initially repayable together with interest accrued at LIBOR plus 3% in July 2009. As at 
31 December 2010 the outstanding loan in amount of US$5,000,000 remained payable from the Group, and has 
been classified within short-term borrowings (note 24). 
 Under an agreement between the Company and Baverstock made on 30 January 2008, Baverstock agreed to take 
responsibility for the payments of the sums due under that loan and to fully and effectively discharge, indemnify and hold 
harmless the Company, Eragon Petroleum Limited, and as applicable Galaz Energy BV and BNG Energy BV from any 
obligation or liability arising from the terms of, or in connection with, of the Loan Agreement. Accordingly, an asset equal to 
the fair value of the liability under the Loan Agreement has been recognised on the acquisition of Eragon (see note19).
 In August 2010 Galaz Energy BV has provided Baverstock with a loan facility of up to US$10,000,000 at LIBOR +7%. 
The amounts borrowed under this loan agreement should be used exclusively for repayment of Kuat Oraziman’s 
US$10,000,000 loan received in July 2007. The facility is to be repaid by paying back future dividends receivable 
by Baverstock from Eragon. In December 2010 the first tranche of US$5,000,000 under the facility agreement was 
transferred to Kuat Oraziman directly by Galaz Energy BV to be repaid by Baverstock. 
b) Other loans from Kuat Oraziman 
 In January 2010, Altius Energy provided a loan of US$3,000,000 to the Company. In order to repay the loan of 
US$3,000,000 on time, the Group entered into a loan arrangement with Kuat Oraziman on 19 March 2010 for 
US$3,000,000 which was lent on an interest free basis to Galaz and Company LLP and used to repay the above 
disclosed Altius Energy convertible loan. The loan was repaid to Kuat Oraziman on 12 May 2010.
 The Company has another loan outstanding as at 31 December 2010 and 2009 with Kuat Oraziman, details of which 
have been summarised in Note 24. 
RXP2635 - AR10 BACK AW11.indd   66 20/05/2011   16:49 Financial Statements
67 Roxi Petroleum plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
c) Vertom loan to Ravninnoe Oil LLP 
 At the date of acquisition (16 May 2007) of Ravninnoe BV and its then 50% subsidiary Ravninnoe Oil LLP there was 
a loan US$7,500,000 due from Ravninnoe Oil LLP to Vertom International BV under a loan agreement dated 11 May 
2007. No repayments have been made in respect of this loan agreement to date.
 On 24 June 2009, pursuant to the amended sale and purchase agreement made between the Company, Ravninnoe 
B.V., Kuat Oraziman, Vertom and Canamens as described in note 16, Ravninnoe Oil LLP agreed to the assignment 
by Vertom to Canamens of 26.2% of the loan receivable of US$7,500,000 and that the loan would be repayable on a 
joint demand by Canamens and Vertom.
d) Transactions with Canamens
 As part of the 2 joint ventures entered into by the Group with Canamens in relation to Ravninnoe Oil LLP and BNG 
Ltd LLP, details of which are set out in Note 16, various loans were entered into:
i) Ravninnoe Farm-in
As disclosed in notes 16 and 31.2 the Group has entered into and completed a farm-in with Canamens in respect 
of Ravninnoe Oil LLP. 
ii) BNG Farm-in 
As disclosed in note 16 the Group has entered into and completed a two stage farm in with Canamens Energy 
BV in respect of BNG Ltd LLP. 
e) Loans in relation to LGI 
 As described in notes 26 and 32.2 Galaz and Company LLP and LG International entered into a Facility Agreement of 
US$34.4 million pursuant to the SPA entered into on 27 April 2010.
31.3 The Inter-Conditional Agreement
In January 2009, the Company announced a proposed farm-out with Canamens whereby the Company and Baverstock 
together would sell 35% of the BNG Contract area to Canamens in return for a commitment to fund some of the BNG 
Contract area work programme costs. The proposed transaction was subsequently amended and it was agreed 
between the Company and Baverstock that the Company would solely sell in 2 stages 35% of the Company’s 58.41% 
interest in BNG Ltd LLP to Canamens. Details of the transaction are set out in note 16. 
In return for Baverstock retaining its 40.59% interest in the BNG Contract area, the Company, Baverstock, the beneficial 
owners of Baverstock including Kuat Oraziman, Eragon Petroleum Limited, Galaz Energy BV and BNG Energy BV 
entered into an Inter-Conditional Agreement in October 2009 whereby. Baverstock agreed that the remaining work 
programme funding from the original US$100 million funding commitment made by the Company to Baverstock at the 
time of the Eragon Acquisition will be US$8.4 million. 
Further, the Inter-Conditional Agreement restates that Baverstock and (where applicable) the beneficial owners of 
Baverstock continue to be bound by the operative provisions of the various agreements entered into at the time of the 
Eragon Acquisition including the Baverstock Indemnity referred to in note 31.2 above.
The Inter-Conditional Agreement also deals with the proceeds of sale received from Canamens and the distribution of the 
loans. Under this agreement, the Company and Baverstock agreed that the proceeds of the sale would be to the benefit 
of the Company, in return for Baverstock retaining its effective interest in BNG Ltd LLP. This results in the Company 
ultimately benefiting from 65% of the funds to be invested into BNG Ltd LLP by Canamens. 
31.4  Key management remuneration
Key management comprises the Directors and details of their remuneration are set out in note 6. 
In September 2008 the Directors and senior management agreed to deferral of their salaries and fees until such time that 
the restatement and the refund would not materially affect the Company’s ability to continue to comply with existing work 
programme commitments. This policy continued throughout 2009 and 2010.
As at 31 December 2010, the amount due to the Directors in respect of this deferral was approximately US$ 60,000 
(2009-US$ 294,000).
32 Events after the reporting period 
32.1 BNG change in ownership 
On 3 March 2011 Canamens BNG BV has informed the Group that it will not make the final payments of US$11.9 million 
under the second stage of the sale and purchase agreement in connection with BNG Ltd LLP. As a consequence under 
the terms of the SPA, Canamens will forfeit approximately a 6.23 per cent interest in the BNG Contract Area to the Group.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
As a result, Group’s interest in the BNG Contract Area increased from 23.41 per cent to 29.64 per cent and Canamens 
holding decreased from 35 per cent to 28.77 per cent, subject to receipt of the necessary government waivers under 
Kazakh law. 
32.2 Galaz SPA
(a) LGI Farm-in
On 27 April 2010 Galaz Energy BV entered into a SPA with LG International Corp (“LGI”) for the sale of 40% of the 
equity in Galaz and Company LLP for US$15.6 million. 
As part of this transaction LGI agreed to provide a loan of US$34.4 million to Galaz and Company LLP. Under the 
terms of the loan agreement the first tranche of US$20 million was applied as follows:
(i) US$8.5 million for the repayment of historical debt associated with drilling wells in the North West Konys field;
(ii) US$8.4 million for the partial refinancing of loans due to the Company and general corporate purposes, and
(iii) US$3.1 million for financing the ongoing operational costs.
The second tranche of the loan is to be used for investment for ongoing development costs under the current work 
programme.
On 12 May 2010 the first tranche of US$20 million under the loan agreement was received as an advance by Galaz and 
Company LLP.
The sale of 40% of the equity in Galaz and Company LLP was finalised on 20 January 2011. 
32.3 Galaz area and contract extension
On 10 January 2011 the Ministry of Oil and Gas extended the contract territory under exploration of Galaz and Company LLP . 
On 16 February 2011 the Ministry of Oil and Gas extended the exploration contract of Galaz and Company LLP for two 
more years up to 14 May 2013. 
32.4 Warrants expired
On 31 March 2011 29,323,835 warrants issued to Altius Energy had not been exercised and expired.
32.5 Options issued to Directors
The Company issued a further 11,540,000 options to the Company Directors as disclosed in the Remuneration report 
to these consolidated financial statements and 1,550,000 options to other employees on 12 January 2011 at an exercise 
price of 13p.

contract, on 1 May 2011 at an exercise price of 13p.
32.6 Loans due to Kuat Oraziman
The repayment dates for the loans of US$4,550,000 and US$5,000,000 due to Kuat Oraziman described in Note 24, 
were amended and agreed between parties on 26 April 2011 to be extended from July 2011 to July 2012. Also the loan of 
US$4,550,000 was changed from non-interest bearing to interest bearing with an annual rate of 12%. 
32.7 Loan due to Vertom International NV
The group entered into a two year unsecured loan facility agreement with Vertom International NV on 26 April 2011, 
whereby Vertom International NV agreed to lend up to US$6 million to the Group with an associated interest of12% per 
annum. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds from subsequent farm-out arrangements or from first production from 
its operating assets.
32.8 Cancellation of Deal with Canamens on BNG
On 10 May 2011 the Company came to an agreement with Canamens to cancel the SPA referred to in Note 16, whereby 
the 35% interest previously held by Canamens BV in BNG LLP will be returned to BNG Energy BV. This agreement was 
reached as a result of Canamen’s decision not to comply fully with the terms of the original SPA and decided that it was 
in their strategic interests, as well as that of Roxi’s, to terminate the deal. Canamens also agreed to novate its loans of 
US$23.6 million to BNG Energy BV in return for Roxi providing a commitment to pay a royalty of 1.5% of gross revenue 
from production on the BNG license area going forward.

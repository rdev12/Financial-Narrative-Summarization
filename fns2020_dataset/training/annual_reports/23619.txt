Letter from the Chairman
Dear Shareholder
Our 2016 Annual Report reﬂects the successful 
and substantial start to our new transformation 
programme.
For 2016, the board’s priority has been to 
oversee the development and implementation 
of the new medium-term strategy generated by 
Andrew Rashbass, our new CEO. He presented 
our strategy at the March 2016 Investor Day 
and it is outlined in his Strategic Report.
Our strategy is to invest around major sector 
themes, transform the operating model and 
actively optimise the business portfolio. The 
early signs of achievement provide conﬁdence 
in Euromoney’s ability to harness organic and 
acquired growth from the longer-term trends 
in asset management, price discovery, data 
analytics, capital markets and the broadly 
deﬁned ﬁnancial services industry.
In line with Andrew’s strategic review, the board 
has moved to a more traditional structure, 
including the creation of the CEO role and my 
appointment as non-executive chairman. This 
sharpens the board’s focus and governance 
and improves the company’s management 
structure. To that end, Christopher Fordham, 
Diane Alfano, Bashar Al-Rehany, Neil Osborn 
and Jane Wilkinson, all previously executive 
directors of the company, did not seek re-
election at the AGM, but they have continued 
to play the same vital role in the development 
of the company and execution of our new 
strategy.
The company’s dividend policy is to distribute 
a third of its after-tax earnings. Although 
adjusted diluted earnings a share have 
decreased by 5% to 66.5p, in view of our 
strong balance sheet and operating cash 
ﬂows the board has approved an unchanged 
ﬁnal dividend of 16.4p a share to be paid on 
February 9 2017, giving a total dividend for the 
year of 23.4p.
2017 will continue to be a year of transition 
in our three-year programme, with a clear 
focus on delivering the new business priorities. 
Encouraging progress has been achieved and 
the group will look to build on this momentum 
in spite of expected, demanding business 
and market conditions. Both our industry 
and customer base will be adjusting to the 
implications of Brexit, the new administration in 
the USA and the change in dynamics inherent 
in the underlying digitalisation process.
Our board is fully focused on delivering 
sustainable medium-term value by supporting 
the management team in the execution of our 
new strategy. We believe that Euromoney is 
becoming well positioned for this economic 
environment.

Overview ❯ LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN The strategy we unveiled in March is working. 
It’s a tough environment for our customers, 
and therefore for us, but we are beginning 
to see the results of the strategy, for instance 
in the acceleration in subscription growth, 
which constituted a record 58% of our 
business in 2016, and in the ﬂow of successful 
product launches. Focusing the company on 
delivering growth through investing in areas 
of opportunity and disinvesting from areas 
that are structurally and cyclically challenged 
remains my priority. Our return to acquiring 
excellent businesses, like FastMarkets, after a 
break from acquisitions in 2015, also increases 
my optimism about the future. Despite lower 
year-on-year proﬁts, our strong balance 
sheet means that we are recommending to 
shareholders that we maintain the dividend 
at 2015 levels. This is a mark of our measured 
conﬁdence about the future.
STRATEGY
At the Investor Day in March 2016, we 
presented the new strategy for Euromoney. We 
categorise our businesses into four quadrants 
depending on the position in the business cycle 
of their customers and the strength of their 
business model and take necessary actions in 
each quadrant. See page 10.
This leads to three pillars of strategic activity:
Investing around big themes such as 
the information and services to support 
the asset management industry, price 
discovery and others.
Ensuring an effective operating model 
that marries the best of the company’s 
entrepreneurial culture (closeness 
to customers, passion for brands, 
knowledge of products and accountability 
for revenue and proﬁt) with, for example, 
modern marketing techniques, group-
wide talent management, seeking 
economies of, and opportunities from, 
scale and adopting a strategic approach 
to developing each business.
Actively managing the portfolio, 
disinvesting in businesses where the 
market is weak and the business model 
structurally challenged and investing 
where the businesses are structurally 
strong and there are market tailwinds.
Progress with implementing the strategy has 
been good, partly because the organisation 
has adopted the strategy more effectively and 
more quickly than we had assumed and partly 
because we have been able to use the beneﬁts 
of the strong dollar compared with sterling 
to accelerate investment while still delivering 
results in line with board’s expectations. This 
is despite tougher trading conditions than we 
had expected during the year and our bottom-
left businesses performing worse than we had 
forecast 12 months ago.
Our three-pillar and four-quadrant strategy 
helped to identify the businesses that were 
dragging us backwards and the businesses 
where we have the greatest opportunities. 
We began to deal with the former and invest 
in the latter. We have removed the bottom-
left proﬁt drag from Gulf Publishing and 
Petroleum Economist (which we sold) and 
from Euromoney Learning Solutions (which 
we restructured). In addition, we began to 
reduce any operational deﬁcit (as we call it) 
to get as many of our businesses as possible 
performing better (introducing, for example, 
sophisticated pricing policies and market-led 
product development techniques).
With this new focus on market-led product 
development, we launched numerous new 
products. Some examples:
 ● BCA research reports and analysis on US 
equities, US Equity Trading strategy and US 
Technology sector strategy;
 ● Institutional Investor RIA and European 
Alternative Investment Institutes created;
 ●
Institutional Investor Research All-
America Trading Team survey and rankings;
 ● Ned Davis Research research data solutions 
with access to all NDR’s data and charts and 
Explorer which provides interactive content 
distribution; and
 ● Airﬁnance database and ﬂeet analysis tools 
for Airﬁnance Fleet Analyst.
As well as disposals, we have become more 
active once again in our search for excellent 
businesses to add to our existing ones but with 
a greater focus on their strategic ﬁt than before. 
During the year, we acquired FastMarkets, 
a metals news and prices platform which 
becomes part of the Metal Bulletin Group and 
accelerates its strategy of becoming the leading 
metals price reporting agency. We also bought 
Reinsurance Security, which rates reinsurance 
companies, and which now sits alongside, 
and complements, Insurance Insider. We also 
acquired a ﬂeet database which now sits at the 
heart of our ﬂeet-valuation toolset.
The continuing strong cash generation – 
conversion of adjusted operating proﬁt to cash 
in the year at 105% continues our decades-
long record – shows that, in the face of tough 
market conditions, the business can be both 
strategic and tightly and effectively managed.
PERFORMANCE FOR THE YEAR
Despite tougher than expected trading 
conditions, the group’s performance was at 
the top end of the board’s expectations. The 
drag from bottom-left businesses was worse 
than expected; however, favourable currency 
movements, in particular following the UK’s 
referendum decision on EU membership 
enabled accelerated investment in the strategy. 
It is also encouraging that the beneﬁts from 
the strategy are coming through earlier than 
anticipated. 
Euromoney’s performance reﬂects the 
continuing headwinds experienced by its 
customers, particularly within the investment 
banking sector. Revenues were down by 4% 
on an underlying
1
 basis, with reported revenues 
ﬂat reﬂecting the beneﬁt of a stronger US 
dollar relative to the British pound.
The pressures on banking and ﬁnance and on 
commodity events, which together constituted 
26% of revenue continued to offset the 
improving performance in its operating 
companies focused on price discovery, data 
and market intelligence and those serving the 
asset management sector.

04 Subscription revenues continued to grow, 
supported by a strong asset management 
market, and were up an underlying
1
 1%. 
Advertising revenues deteriorated through the 
year and declined at a faster rate than in 2015, 
reﬂecting continued budgetary pressures in 
global ﬁnancial institutions and were down an 
underlying
1
 11%. Large events, particularly in 
the ﬁnance sector run by the IMN business and 
those in the telecoms sectors, performed well 
but smaller events fared less well. Overall event 
sponsorship was down by an underlying
1
 2%. 
Revenue from non-training event delegates 
was down 8%.
Adjusted operating proﬁt fell by 3%. As 
expected, the adjusted operating margin fell 
from 26% to 25%, reﬂecting the impact of 
higher property and investment costs as well as 
the impact of the loss of contribution from the 
sale of the Capital DATA joint venture which 
formed part of the Dealogic transaction.
During the year, Euromoney increased its 
investment in developing and launching 
new products to enhance organic revenue 
growth. M&A activity remains an important 
feature of the group’s strategy to supplement 
organic growth and to manage the portfolio 
more actively. As part of that, Euromoney 
disposed of Gulf Publishing during the year 
to reduce exposure to the energy market and 
to advertising, and acquired FastMarkets to 
become part of the Metal Bulletin Group and 
Reinsurance Security to add to its portfolio of 
services aimed at the reinsurance market.
PRIORITIES FOR 2017
In the year ahead we expect to continue to 
implement the strategy, investing in our big 
themes, making sure we have an effective 
operating model which combines Euromoney’s 
entrepreneurial culture with a more strategic 
approach, sharing best practice and achieving 
economies of scale. We will continue to 
manage the portfolio actively, buying where 
we see value-creating and strategically sensible 
opportunities to do so and selling when we 
believe a business is more valuable to someone 
else than to us.
OUTLOOK
We do not expect markets to improve in the 
year ahead and our plans are built around 
them not doing so. We said at the Investor 
Day that our strategy would not change the 
trajectory in 2016; that we expected, subject to 
the usual caveats, to return to growth in 2018; 
and that 2017 would be a year of transition. 
This remains our view.

Overview ❯ CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT RECONCILIATION OF 
CONSOLIDATED INCOME 
STATEMENT TO ADJUSTED RESULTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 
SEPTEMBER 30 2016
The directors believe that the adjusted proﬁt 
and earnings per share measures provide 
additional useful information for shareholders 
to evaluate the performance of the business. 
The group’s non-IFRS measures are intended 
to remove from reported earnings volatility 
associated with the following types of one-off 
income and charges:
Adjusted ﬁgures are presented before the 
impact of amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets (comprising trademarks and brands, 
databases and customer relationships), 
exceptional items, share of associates and joint 
ventures’ acquired intangibles amortisation, 
exceptional items and tax, and net movements 
in deferred consideration and acquisition 
commitments. In respect of earnings, adjusted 
amounts reﬂect a tax rate that includes the 
current tax effect of the goodwill and intangible 
assets. Many of the group’s acquisitions, 
particularly in the US, give rise to signiﬁcant 
tax savings as the amortisation of goodwill and 
intangible assets on acquisition is deductible 
for tax purposes. The group considers that the 
resulting adjusted effective tax rate is therefore 
more representative of its tax payable position. 
Further analysis of the adjusting items is 
presented in notes 5, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 14 to the 
group ﬁnancial statements.
The group has consistently applied this deﬁnition 
of adjusted measures as it has reported on its 
ﬁnancial performance in the past and it is the 
group’s intention to continue to consistently 
apply this deﬁnition in the future. 
UNDERLYING RESULTS
When assessing the performance of the group’s 
businesses, the board considers the adjusted 
results. The year-on-year change in adjusted 
results may not, however, be a fair like-for-like 
comparison as there are a number of factors 
which can inﬂuence growth rates but which do 
not reﬂect underlying performance.
When calculating underlying growth, 
adjustments are made to give a like-for-like 
comparison. For example, the adjusted results 
in 2016 beneﬁted from the strengthening of 
the US dollar relative to sterling. To calculate 
underlying growth, the comparatives are 
restated using 2016 exchange rates. Similarly, 
adjustments are made to exclude acquisitions 
and disposals from both years. The timing of 
events can also be a distortion. To give a fair 
like-for-like comparison when calculating 
underlying growth, biennial events are 
excluded from the year in which they were 
held.
The reconciliation below sets out the adjusted 
and underlying results of the group and 
the related adjustments to the statutory 
Income Statement that the directors consider 
necessary to provide useful information about 
the group’s trading performance.

Business Model
HOW WE MONETISE OUR ACTIVITIES
Subscription/Content Sponsorship Delegates Advertising
revenues are the fees that 
customers pay to receive access 
to the group’s information, 
through online access to 
various databases, through 
regular delivery of soft copy 
research, publications and 
newsletters or hard copy 
magazines. Subscriptions are 
also received from customers 
who belong to Institutional 
Investor’s exclusive membership 
groups.
 revenues represent fees paid 
by customers to sponsor an 
event. A payment of  
sponsorship can entitle the 
sponsor to high-profile  
speaking opportunities at the  
conference, unique branding 
before, during and after the 
event and an unparalleled 
networking opportunity to 
invite the sponsor’s clients and 
representatives.
 revenues represent fees paid 
by customers to attend a 
conference, training course or 
seminar.
 revenues represent the fees 
that customers pay to place an 
advertisement in one or more 
of the group’s publications, 
either in print or online.
The group’s costs are tightly managed and the group benefits from having a flexible cost base, hiring external venues for events and using 
freelancers, contributors, external trainers and speakers to help deliver its products. Other than its main offices, the group does not incur fixed 
costs of offices in most of the markets in which it operates; this allows the group to scale up or reduce overheads as the economic environment  
in which it operates demands.

EUROMONEY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR PLC WWW.EUROMONEYPLC.COM Euromoney has a global customer base with 
revenue derived from almost 200 countries. 
Approximately 60% of total revenue is 
derived from subscriptions and other recurring 
sources. Around a third of revenue comes 
from emerging markets and over 85% of 
revenue is generated outside the UK. Our 
customer base predominantly consists of 
global ﬁnancial institutions, investment banks, 
commodity traders, miners and asset managers; 
governments, agencies and corporates; and 
service providers including lawyers, consultants 
and technology providers. 
The group’s total addressable market is driven 
by customers’ capital and trading activities. 
The group’s EDEN marketing database holds 
two million active names of which more than 
600,000 have bought Euromoney’s products in 
the past three years. However, more important 
than the size of the market is its propensity 
to spend, which is driven by the proﬁtability 
of our clients, their expectations of market 
developments and, increasingly, the regulatory 
environment. They spend more willingly where 
there is market share to be won than they do 
in a market in structural decline. Although total 
headcount in ﬁnancial markets has been on 
a downward trend for the past ﬁve years, the 
group’s strategy is driven by growing revenue 
per customer.

NO CHANGE
Euromoney needed to revise its strategy because of challenges to the business model facing some of its businesses and changing dynamics within its 
markets. The performance over the year, especially in the ﬁrst half, reﬂects these challenges. The group’s new strategy is to actively manage a portfolio 
of businesses in asset management, price discovery and other sectors where information, data and convening market participants are valued. We 
deliver products and services that are critical to our customers’ businesses.
The group has always had a structured approach to capital allocation, but ﬁnancial performance in future will come from a more rigorous allocation 
of capital, in line with the following quadrants:
All businesses within the Euromoney portfolio have been assessed and classiﬁed according to this framework and strategic activity for each quadrant 
prioritised.
The ‘invest’ quadrant is where new product development, sales and marketing initiatives and acquisitions will be prioritised. In contrast, in the ‘use the 
time wisely’ quadrant investment will be directed towards areas which are most likely to move businesses to the top quadrant, with a clear focus on 
shorter-term proﬁt and cash generation. In some cases as represented by the ‘disinvest’ quadrant, the group will consider restructuring or divestment 
of part of or whole individual businesses and minimal capital will be allocated to these areas. The ‘prepare for upturn’ quadrant is populated by strong 
businesses in cyclically challenged areas. Here, capital allocation will be focused on protecting and enhancing the group’s competitive position with 
careful, selective investment, tight cost control and, where possible, exploiting revenue opportunities. 
This assessment leads to our three pillars of strategic activity – see page 11:

EUROMONEY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR PLC WWW.EUROMONEYPLC.COM During 2016, encouraging progress has been 
made around each area, as can be seen below:
INVEST AROUND BIG THEMES
The big themes such as the information and 
services to support the asset management 
industry, price discovery and other areas will 
drive investment decisions. Existing asset 
management-related brands, Institutional 
Investor, BCA and Ned Davis Research all 
provide an excellent platform for investment to 
drive growth. The group’s asset management 
product development and investments are 
aligned with the key market trends such as the 
shift from traditional active towards passive 
fund management, specialist/alternative asset 
management and the unbundling of sell-side 
research. Euromoney’s businesses operating 
in sectors such as air ﬁnance, telecoms and 
insurance, together with price discovery 
businesses such as Metal Bulletin, are among 
the group’s other key areas of investment.
TRANSFORM THE  
OPERATING MODEL
To ensure that the best of the group’s 
entrepreneurial culture is aligned with a strong 
operating model, various initiatives have been 
instigated in 2016 to form a ﬁrm foundation 
for future growth, including a new emphasis 
on modern marketing techniques, group-wide 
talent management, seeking economies of, 
and opportunities from, scale and adopting a 
more strategic approach to developing each 
business. Each of these strategic development 
areas are explained in more detail:
 ● Modern marketing techniques: a central 
marketing team has been established as 
a resource for all our businesses. Their 
specialist marketing skills and capabilities 
are already being used in areas ranging from 
creating pricing structures for new products 
through to developing YouTube and other 
video content to promote new services. The 
YouTube Rival Advocates advertisement is 
a good example of the effective, specialist 
support provided to the Euromoney 
businesses.
 ● Group-wide talent management: in order 
to develop the strong entrepreneurial culture 
throughout Euromoney, a structured talent 
development programme needs to be more 
effectively established. Co-ordinated by the 
recently appointed group-wide HR director, 
Euromoney will develop a range of talent 
initiatives including leadership coaching and 
management training to ensure the group 
has the right specialist skill set to harness the 
opportunities in our current marketplaces.
 ● Seeking economies of scale through 
sharing best practice around the business: 
the new approach to product development, 
pricing structures and marketing skills are 
examples of this which are now prevalent 
across the group.
 ● Adopting a more strategic approach to 
developing each business: each Euromoney 
business has now adopted the new 
quadrant capital allocation framework and 
prioritises monitoring progress to achieving 
its strategic goals.
ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO
The group’s portfolio management focus is 
now centred on investing where businesses 
are structurally strong and there are market 
tailwinds. It will consider disinvesting 
businesses where the market is weak and 
the business model is structurally challenged. 
In April, the group completed the sale of 
Gulf Publishing and Petroleum Economist 
for US$18m. In August and September, the 
group completed two acquisitions in the 
strategically important areas of price discovery 
and insurance. The acquisition of Reinsurance 
Security has extended the insurance and 
reinsurance information portfolio into the 
high-value counterparty risk market. The 
acquisition of FastMarkets for £13.3m will 
extend Metal Bulletin’s capabilities into real-
time data delivery and will be an integral part 
of its extensive portfolio of digital pricing 
products.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report ❯ STRATEGY The group monitors its performance against its strategy using the following key performance indicators:
KPI Relevance Performance Narrative
UNDERLYING 
REVENUE 
GROWTH
Link to strategic 
pillars:

1 2
 
3
Underlying revenue growth 
compares revenues on a like-for-
like basis and is an important 
indicator of the health and 
trajectory of the individual 
segments and the group as a 
whole.
Underlying revenues fell by 4% 
as trading remained challenging, 
particularly in the banking and 
commodities sector.
SUBSCRIPTION 
BOOK OF 
BUSINESS
Link to strategic 
pillars:
1
Book of Business (BoB) represents 
the annual contracted values for 
subscriptions across the group 
and reﬂects the impact of new 
sales, price increases, upgrades, 
downgrades and full cancellations. 
It is a key indicator of the group’s 
subscriptions growth.
The subscription BoB increased by 
an underlying 1.4%, reﬂecting the 
slow improvement achieved across 
the year as the group’s new strategy 
starts to take effect. 
SUBSCRIPTION 
SHARE OF TOTAL 
REVENUES
Link to strategic 
pillars: 
1
Subscription-based products usually 
have the advantage of premium 
prices, high renewal rates and high 
margins.
The group has increased the 
proportion of revenues derived from 
subscription and content-related 
products to almost 60% of its total 
revenues.
ADJUSTED 
PROFIT BEFORE 
TAX (£m)
Link to strategic 
pillars:

1 2
 
3
Euromoney actively manages its 
portfolio and allocates capital to 
increase adjusted proﬁt before tax 
over the long term. The deﬁnition 
of adjusted proﬁt before tax is 
included in the appendix to the 
Chief Executive’s Statement.
Adjusted proﬁt before tax decreased 
by 5% to £102.5m consistent 
with the fall in adjusted operating 
proﬁt reﬂecting the challenging 
market conditions in 2016, and 
the increased investment from the 
group’s new strategic initiatives 
offset by favourable exchange 
movements.
ADJUSTED 
OPERATING 
MARGIN
Link to strategic 
pillars:
1
 
1 2
 
The movement in adjusted 
operating margin measures the 
efﬁciency of the group. Consistent 
operating margin improvement is 
a business imperative, driven by 
investment choices, our focus on 
driving out costs and improving 
mix.
The adjusted operating margin 
fell from 26% to 25% in 2016 as 
a result of a number of factors, 
including higher property costs 
from the full year impact of the 
London ofﬁce move, the loss of high 
margin ﬂow-through advertising and 
delegate revenues, the drag from 
the bottom-left-quadrant businesses 
and investment in new products, 
pricing and sales to drive the strategic 
initiatives. These factors were 
partially offset by one-off favourable 
exchange gains.

DILUTED 
EARNINGS PER 
SHARE
Link to strategic 
pillars:
1
 
Management seeks sustained long-
term growth in adjusted diluted 
earnings per share to maximise 
overall returns to our shareholders.
The 5% decrease in adjusted diluted 
earnings per share reﬂects the fall 
in adjusted operating proﬁt and an 
underlying tax rate of 18%, consistent 
with 2015. 
CASH 
CONVERSION

Cash conversion is a measure of the 
quality of Euromoney’s earnings. The 
objective is to achieve consistently 
a high conversion of earnings into 
cash in excess of 100%. This KPI 
measures the percentage by which 
cash generated from operations 
covers adjusted operating proﬁt.
The operating cash conversion rate 
was 102% (2015: 105%). The rate 
in prior year was more favourably 
impacted by the rent-free period 
on the new London ofﬁces. After 
adjusting for this timing difference 
and exceptional items, the underlying 
operating cash conversion rate was 
105% (2015: 104%).

The group’s strategic priority is to 
keep net debt below three times 
EBITDA. The amount of the group’s 
net debt to adjusted operating proﬁt 
and share of results in associates and 
joint ventures before depreciation 
and amortisation of licences and 
software, is adjusted for the timing 
of acquisitions and disposals.
The group has net cash of £83.8m at 
September 30 (2015: £17.7m). 
The key performance indicators are all within the board’s expectations adjusted throughout the year to take into account the challenging market 
conditions and these indicators are discussed in detail in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 4 and 5, and in the operating and ﬁnancial review 
from page 25. 
A detailed reconciliation of the group’s adjusted and underlying results is set out in the appendix to the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages  
6 and 7.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report ❯ KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Principal Risks
The principal risks and uncertainties the group 
faces vary across the different businesses 
and are identiﬁed in the group’s risk register. 
Management of signiﬁcant risk is the 
responsibility of the board and is overseen by 
the risk committee. 
The group’s risk register identiﬁes the principal 
risks facing the business. The register is put 
together following a group-wide assessment of 
risks reported in its business risk registers. Each 
business risk register considers the likelihood 
of a risk occurring and both the monetary and 
reputational impact of the risk crystallising. 
The risk assessment process also considers risk 
velocity, the speed with which a risk manifests 
itself, and the group’s appetite for the risk. 
Following the risk assessment process this year, 
the risk committee agreed to include an explicit 
risk for ‘exposure to US dollar exchange rate’ 
which was previously included under risks from 
treasury operations, and a small number of 
other changes to risk descriptions.
The risk committee has completed a robust 
and detailed assessment of both the group’s 
risk management processes and the group 
risk register and has considered the impact of 
signiﬁcant risks to the group in the context of 
providing the company’s viability statement. 
Further details of the group’s risk management 
processes, the governance structure for 
risk and the risk committee can be found 
in the Corporate Governance Report. The 
geographical spread and diverse portfolio of 
businesses within the group help to dilute the 
impact of some of the group’s key risks.
The group uses a number of tools to analyse 
its risks and facilitate discussions at the board, 
executive committee and risk committee. The 
risk matrix below shows the relative impact 
and likelihood of the group’s principal risks. 
The group also considers the extent to which 
each risk arises from external or internal 
factors, and whether each risk is established 
and understood or is an emerging risk and 
therefore less understood. The risk radar below 
maps the group’s principal risks using this 
criteria, with increasing risk indicated by the 
larger data points. Arrows are used to indicate 
directional movement.

 ● Exposure from the translation of

remains committed to active 
management of this risk. 
Board’s view:
The group’s controls are regularly

challenges. During 2016, group 
businesses were faced with 
terrorist incidents in Jakarta, 
extreme weather disruption in 
Asia and the US, and a system

VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the Corporate Governance Code, the directors have assessed the viability of the group and 
have selected a period of three years for the assessment.
The group operates in volatile sectors and geographical markets but has more than half of its revenues based on annual subscriptions with strong 
renewal rates, has no outstanding debt and few long-term ﬁnancial obligations. The group uses a three-year strategic planning cycle and the directors 
have determined that three years is also an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement.
The assessment conducted considered the group’s operating proﬁt, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, cash ﬂows, dividend cover and other key ﬁnancial ratios 
over the three-year period. These metrics were subject to severe downside stress and sensitivity analysis over the assessment period, taking account 
of the group’s current position, the group’s experience of managing adverse conditions in the past and the impact of a number of severe yet plausible 
scenarios, based on the principal risks set out in the Strategic Report. The stress testing considered the principal risks assessed to have the highest 
probability of occurrence or the severest impact, crystallising both individually and in combination. The assessment modelled a signiﬁcant downturn in 
the world economy affecting all three years of the assessment period and a number of successive product and business failures, including the failure 
of a new acquisition.
In making the assessment, the directors have considered the group’s robust capital position, the cash-generative nature of the business, the ability of 
the group to cut costs quickly, the access to available credit, the absence of signiﬁcant pension and M&A liabilities and the group’s ability to restrict 
dividends. Based on the results of this analysis, the directors conﬁrm that they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.

The asset management segment includes the brands and businesses that serve the global 
asset management industry. It provides independent research that enables our clients to make 
informed investment decisions; it runs networks and conferences that bring asset allocators and 
asset managers together in an effective and efﬁcient way; and it provides news and data that 
are critical for the industry to stay informed and visible in an increasingly complex world. Its main 
brands include BCA, Ned Davis Research (NDR) and the Institutional Investor family of businesses. 
Approximately 80% of the segment revenues are derived from subscriptions to its research and 
data products and annual membership fees. 
Asset management is a key strategic focus and signiﬁcant investment was made during 2016 to 
grow the product portfolio, especially at BCA and Institutional Investor Research (II Research), and 
we continued to launch new Institutional Investor forums and memberships.

Total asset management revenues increased by 9% to £164.5m, with underlying revenues up by

reﬂects the tightening of budgets across the sector during 2016. Underlying revenues were ﬂat in 
the ﬁrst half, followed by a more encouraging 1% increase in the second, largely from the strategic 
initiatives undertaken for new products, pricing and sales. Institutional Investor’s subscription-
based memberships performed strongly throughout 2016, while BCA and NDR ended the year on 
a positive note with Q4 performance showing encouraging signs of returning to growth.
The adjusted operating margin remained at 34%, reﬂecting headcount investment in BCA and 
Institutional Investor’s memberships to drive new product and sales initiatives offset by cost 
reductions in the more challenged parts of the group’s portfolio. Adjusted operating proﬁt fell by 
an underlying 3%, largely due to the headcount and new product investment.

BCA Research has been the leading provider of independent macroeconomic investment 
research for nearly 70 years. 
As BCA conducted extensive market research to support its future product strategy, 
it became evident that investors required a way to link macro investment strategies 
with individual investment decisions, and that the more speciﬁc the investment 
recommendation is to individual instruments, the more valuable it is for investors.
Working with clients, BCA developed Equity Trading Strategy (ETS), a product for 
investors that combines BCA’s top-down macro research with company fundamental and 
quantitative analysis to deliver a 360-degree view of stocks. 
Launched in December 2015 covering US equities only, ETS has been a huge success  
with clients and is becoming one of BCA’s best-selling products. Following this success, 
ETS was further extended in October 2016 with the launch of European and  
Asian market coverage.
The launch of ETS illustrates Euromoney’s strategy of responding to a market need and 
bringing new and exciting products to market efﬁciently and effectively.
The development of a research ballot 
platform and the launch of the new 
All-American Trading Team Survey this 
year demonstrated Euromoney’s strategy 
of investing around big themes and  
effective, efﬁcient product development.
Driven by MiFID II and the unbundling 
of sell-side services, the II Research 
team identiﬁed that it could provide 
more targeted, actionable insight to its 
customers without asking for materially 
more time from its voters. 
The approach adopted was also highly 
cost effective, agile and licensed best-in-
class technology in preference to building 
in-house.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report ❯ SEGMENT REVIEW PRICING, DATA AND MARKET INTELLIGENCE
The pricing, data and market intelligence segment houses businesses spanning many industries 
that provide information and analysis critical for our clients’ business processes and workﬂows. The 
segment’s largest business is Metal Bulletin, a leading price reporting agency for the metals and 
mining industries, but also includes our businesses active in the telecoms, insurance, airline and 
banking industries. Two-thirds of the segment’s revenues are derived from subscriptions.
Price discovery is a key strategic theme for Euromoney and it is expected to grow signiﬁcantly as 
most industries are seeking more transparency around prices and risks they face in their traditionally 
opaque markets. During 2016 we signiﬁcantly enhanced our capabilities through the acquisitions 
of FastMarkets, a pricing platform in the metals industry, and Reinsurance Security, a provider of 
risk ratings for the reinsurance sector.

The segment’s adjusted operating margin increased by one percentage point to 33% reﬂecting 
an improvement in the mix driven by the strong performances of TelCap and CEIC, and cost 
savings from streamlining marketing and event logistics teams. Adjusted operating proﬁt fell by

 INVESTING TO TRANSFORM A TRADITIONAL NEWS AND INFORMATION PROVIDER INTO A DATA-DRIVEN 
 PRICE REPORTING AGENCY
The Metal Bulletin business is today deﬁned by the integral position of its data within the markets it serves. Over time, the prices assessed and 
published by Metal Bulletin have become established benchmarks used by the industry as reference pricing in contracts and enabling trading in 
many markets to function effectively. 
The market shift towards benchmark pricing has also brought greater scrutiny to the processes in terms of compliance. Metal Bulletin has 
applied industry-wide principles that have been laid down principally for the oil and energy markets and now is able to use that as an additional 
competitive advantage underlining the credibility and integrity of the business and the data it provides.
The proliferation of the use of its data as benchmarks has allowed Metal Bulletin to go through a rapid business change across the organisation 
that puts the emphasis on being a Price Reporting Agency (PRA). This has led to a shift in the way our data and content is monetised and has 
allowed us to adopt a new data licensing strategy alongside the traditional subscriptions model. 
To augment the high-quality data produced, the acquisition of FastMarkets allows Metal Bulletin to provide key exchange data to complement the 
physical price assessments it provides through a highly versatile and conﬁgurable desktop application that can be scaled into the vertical sectors of 
the markets it serves.
The investment and changes that the group is making in Metal Bulletin are examples of the strategy of investing in big themes,  
such as price discovery, to position the group for future growth.

banking sector, which – through its awards for excellence – has been the arbiter of status for banks 
for over 45 years. Its conferences across the Euromoney and IMN brands are the pre-eminent

Adjusted operating margin 15% 22%
Reported revenues decreased by 7% to £74.6m, with underlying revenues down 13% largely 
reﬂecting the group’s decision to reduce the number of conferences held due to continued 
weakness in banking and capital markets, and the strategic decision to focus on in-house 
training while signiﬁcantly reducing the number of public training courses held. Weakness in the 
group’s ﬁnancial publishing titles was an additional drag on the segment’s performance given 
their dependence on bank advertising. In contrast, large events, particularly, in structured ﬁnance 
performed well.
The adjusted operating margin fell seven percentage points to 15% due to the drag from the poor 
performance of the training business and the reduction in event volumes. As a result, adjusted 
operating proﬁt fell by an underlying 46%.
TRANSFORMING RIVALS INTO ADVOCATES
Some careful research this year led us to a ground-breaking discovery: a bank’s immediate rivals are unintentionally a key determinant of that 
bank’s credibility among clients, via a process we called Rival Advocacy™. The concept is simple: the process of describing yourself  
by comparison to peers validates the peer in the listener’s mind.  
Euromoney magazine is now pivoting its business model by creating multi-platform thought leadership packages around the Rival 
Advocacy™ concept that will enable it to reduce its reliance on conventional advertising spend and create a content marketing platform  
for its clients.
Through its leading, high-quality journalism and awards, which are widely recognised as the key benchmarks of excellence in the global 
banking industry, Euromoney is perfectly placed to provide this valuable process of peer-to-peer reputation management.  
The launch of the Rival Advocacy™ concept at Euromoney magazine is in line with our strategy of moving businesses in our four-quadrant 
model by investment in product development and implementing a more effective operating model.

TRADING EVENTS STRATEGY
Global Grain Events organises a series of world-leading events for the global grain trading industry. The business has delivered strong growth 
since acquisition, driven by its high quality content and extensive networking opportunities for delegates.
The challenge for Global Grain is how to continue to grow as it already attracts most of the key players in the industry to its events.
Global Grain’s response is to promote more trading activity at its events and move from a content-led model to a trading event strategy. This 
will be achieved through new pricing structures to enable customers to send their whole deal teams; facilitating trading activity by providing 
better meeting rooms and price discovery; and improving the customer experience throughout the event.
These changes are in line with Euromoney’s strategy of investing in growth areas and implementing changes to the operating model to build 
stronger businesses.

EUROMONEY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR PLC WWW.EUROMONEYPLC.COM Underlying subscriptions and content revenues 
increased by 1%. Asset management 
subscription revenues were up an underlying 
2% largely from the strategic initiatives 
undertaken for new products, pricing and 
sales. Institutional Investor’s subscription-based 
memberships performed strongly throughout 
2016, while BCA and NDR ended the year 
on a positive note with Q4 performance 
showing encouraging signs of returning to

subscription revenues were up an underlying 
2% reﬂecting strong performances from 
the group’s insurance and ﬁnancial data 
businesses together with the emerging market 
information and data provider, CEIC. 
Underlying advertising revenues remained 
weak and declined by 11%. The largest decline 
was felt by the group’s banking and ﬁnance 
businesses, reﬂecting the cost pressures on 
global investment banks. 
Underlying event revenues fell by 9%, with 
the banking and ﬁnance and commodity 
events segments creating a signiﬁcant drag 
on revenue growth due to the structural and 
cyclical headwinds in those markets. The steep 
ﬁrst half decline of 13% was followed by a 
lower rate of decline of 4% in the second, 
reﬂecting easier comparatives after the 
commodities crisis in the ﬁrst half of 2015. 
Underlying event sponsorship was down 2%. 
Large events, particularly in the structured 
ﬁnance and telecoms sectors, remained robust 
but smaller events fared less well. Underlying 
delegate revenues fell by 14%, largely due to 
weakness in the ﬁnancial training business. 
Following a strategic review the decision was 
taken to focus on in-house training and reduce 
signiﬁcantly the number of public training 
courses held. Revenue from event delegates 
(excluding the drag from training) fell by an 
underlying 2% in the second half after a 13% 
decline in the ﬁrst.
The adjusted operating margin fell from 25.8% 
to 25.2% due to the accelerated investment 
in the strategy. The drag from the bottom-
left-quadrant businesses was offset by the 
favourable currency mix. Adjusted operating 
proﬁt fell by £2.8m to £101.4m. 
ADJUSTED AND STATUTORY 
RESULTS
Adjusted proﬁt before tax decreased by 5% to 
£102.5m, consistent with the fall in adjusted 
operating proﬁt and adjusted diluted earnings 
per share. 
The statutory proﬁt before tax of £43.9m is 
lower than the adjusted proﬁt before tax due 
to exceptional items of £37.3m and acquired 
intangible amortisation of £16.7m. A detailed 
reconciliation of the group’s adjusted and 
statutory results is set out in the appendix to 
the Chief Executive’s Statement.

intelligence and those serving the asset management sector. Trading conditions have remained challenging throughout the year, but the group is 
starting to reap the beneﬁts from strategic initiatives focused on new products, pricing and sales. On a reported basis, the drag from businesses in the 
disinvest quadrant has been offset by favourable exchange rates. Underlying revenue decreased by 4%.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report ❯ OPERATING & FINANCIAL REVIEW During the period, the group recognised 
£28.7m of goodwill and intangibles 
impairment charges relating to Mining Indaba 
(recorded in the ﬁrst half) (£12.9m), HedgeFund 
Intelligence (£5.9m), Total Derivatives (£8.2m) 
and Euromoney Indices (£1.7m) to reﬂect the 
challenging market conditions in the energy 
and ﬁnancial sectors and the overall weakness 
in commodity markets. The performance 
of these businesses has been disappointing 
since last year-end and the group’s level of 
investment reﬂects that they do not form a 
core part of the new strategy. 
In April 2016, the group sold 100% of 
the equity share capital of Gulf Publishing 
Company, Inc. (Gulf) and The Petroleum 
Economist Limited (PE) for $18m (£12.5m) 
giving rise to a proﬁt on disposal of £7.1m. 
The provision for overseas sales tax of £7.9m 
reﬂects the group’s best estimate of the 
additional provision required for a potential 
sales tax exposure (including interest) relating 
to prior periods following an adverse tax ruling 
in June 2016. The group is in the process of 
challenging this judgement.
At September 30 2016, the group recognised 
its share of deﬁcit in the Harmsworth Pension 
Scheme (HPS), a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. This 
is the result of the change in accounting policy 
by the group’s parent company, Daily Mail and 
General Trust plc (DMGT), to allocate the assets 
and liabilities of the DMGT group’s deﬁned 
beneﬁt plan on a buy-out basis (note 27).
Restructuring and other exceptional costs 
mostly comprise one-off costs incurred as 
a result of the strategic review undertaken 
during the year and professional fees from 
the legal dispute with the previous owners of 
Centre for Investor Education (CIE). The costs 
relating to the strategic review include one-off 
acquisition and integration costs, the major 
reorganisation of certain businesses and other 
professional fees relating to development of 
the group’s new strategy.

the favourable exchange movement of £55.5m from the predominantly US dollar denominated balance, partially offset by impairment of £28.7m 
for Mining Indaba, HedgeFund Intelligence, Total Derivatives and Euromoney Indices, together with the disposal of goodwill for Gulf Publishing and 
Petroleum Economist of £5.3m and amortisation of £20.4m.
 ● Property, plant and equipment – includes the ﬁt-out of BCA and other recurring expenditure of £3.8m offset by depreciation of £2.8m. 
 ● Investments – includes £1.7m share of loss in Dealogic during 2016 and £0.6m reduction from the transfer of the World Bulk Wine associate to 
a subsidiary.
 ● Acquisition commitments and deferred consideration – the increase is mainly due to a £2.4m exchange and interest movement on the NDR 
commitment, together with the recognition of £1.2m relating to FastMarkets and World Bulk Wine’s acquisition offset by a £0.3m fair value 
adjustment on the NDR commitment and an asset of £0.5m from the disposal of Gulf Publishing and Petroleum Economist.
 ● Deferred income – the movement excluding exchange differences, acquisitions and disposals fell by £1.0m mainly due to the continued pressure 
on event revenues.
 ● Other non-current assets and liabilities – includes the increase of £8.0m in the pension deﬁcit from the change in discount rate and recognition 
of the group’s share of the deﬁcit of the Harmsworth Pension Scheme offset by a reduction in net deferred tax liabilities.
 ● Other current assets and liabilities – the increase is largely from the redemption of £14.4m of preference shares held in Dealogic, the recognition 
of an overseas sales tax provision of £7.9m and a movement of £7.2m on the marked to market valuation of short-term derivative contracts.

Closing net cash 83.8 17.7 66.1
Net cash at September 30 2016 was £83.8m 
compared with £55.9m at March 31 and 
£17.7m at last year-end. This balance sheet 
position reﬂects the group’s strong operating 
cash ﬂows, as well as the £14.4m proceeds 
from the redemption of preference shares 
as part of the Dealogic transaction and the 
£10.8m cash consideration from the disposal 
of Gulf Publishing and Petroleum Economist. 
This was offset by acquisition spend of £14.3m 
for FastMarkets and Reinsurance Security. The 
underlying operating cash conversion rate was 
105% (2015: 104%). 
In April 2016, the group extended its $160m 
multi-currency borrowing facility from DMGT, 
the group’s parent, to November 2018 
(see note 20). The group has no signiﬁcant 
outstanding acquisition commitments payable 
in 2017.
CURRENCY
The group generates approximately two-thirds 
of both its revenues, including approximately 
a third of its UK revenues, and proﬁt before 
tax in US dollars. The exposure to US dollar 
revenues in its UK businesses is hedged using 
forward contracts to sell US dollars, which 
delays the impact of movements in exchange 
rates for at least a year. However, the group 
does not hedge the foreign exchange risk on 
the translation of overseas proﬁts. 
The average sterling–US dollar rate for the year 
to September 30 was $1.41 (2015: $1.55). 
This improved headline revenue growth rates 
for the year by approximately ﬁve percentage 
points and adjusted proﬁt before tax by £6.7m. 
Each one cent movement in the US dollar rate 
has an impact on proﬁts on translation of 
approximately £0.6m on an annualised basis. 
The group also beneﬁted from the revaluation 
of non-sterling denominated balance sheet 
items resulting in a gain of £1.9m (2015: 
£2.5m loss). 
DIVIDENDS
The company’s policy is to distribute a third 
of its adjusted after-tax earnings by way of 
dividends. Although adjusted earnings have 
declined, the company’s strong balance sheet 
means the board is able to recommend an 
unchanged ﬁnal dividend of 16.4p a share to 
be paid to shareholders on February 9 2017, 
giving a total dividend for the year of 23.4p per 
share (2015: 23.4p).
TREASURY 
The treasury department does not act as a proﬁt 
centre, nor does it undertake any speculative 
trading activity, and it operates within policies 
and procedures approved by the board. 
In order to hedge its exposure to US dollar 
revenues in its UK businesses, a series of forward 
contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus 
US dollars. The group hedges 80% of forecast 
US dollar revenues for the coming 12 months 
and up to 50% for a further six months. As 
a result of this hedging strategy, any proﬁt or 
loss from the strengthening or weakening of 
the US dollar will largely be delayed until the 
following ﬁnancial year and beyond. The group 
does not hedge the foreign exchange risk on 
the translation of overseas proﬁts. Details of 
the ﬁnancial instruments used are set out in 
note 19 to the group ﬁnancial statements. 
TAX 
The adjusted effective tax rate based on 
adjusted proﬁt before tax and excluding 
deferred tax movements on intangible assets, 
prior year items and exceptional items is 18% 
(2015: 18%). The group continues to beneﬁt 
from reductions in the UK corporate tax rate 
and the tax effects of acquisitions made prior 
to July 2015. The tax rate in each year depends 
mainly on the geographic mix of proﬁts and 
applicable tax rates. The group’s reported 
effective tax rate increased to 29% compared 
to 14% in 2015. A reconciliation is set out in 
note 8 to the group ﬁnancial statements. 
Signiﬁcant reconciling items include: non-
taxable income of £0.4m (2015: £6.4m) from 
a non-taxable gain on disposal of shares in a 
subsidiary; goodwill and intangibles of £2.6m 
(2015: £0.2m) from non-deductible goodwill 
impairment; and other items deductible for 
tax purposes of £5.3m (£5.5m) that results 
from ﬁnancing arrangements that give rise to 
asymmetrical tax treatment in the territories 
involved. 
The net deferred tax liability held is £10.3m 
(2015: £18.4m) and relates primarily to 
capitalised intangible assets and tax deductible 
goodwill, net of short-term temporary 
differences and tax losses. The reduction in the 
net deferred tax liability relates to increased 
tax losses arising from the impairment of tax 
deductible goodwill and increased assets on 
short-term temporary differences resulting 
from increased deferred interest and tax-
deductible provisions in the US. These 
movements are partially offset by foreign 
exchange movements on capitalised intangible 
assets.
HEADCOUNT 
The number of people employed is monitored 
monthly to ensure there are sufﬁcient 
resources to meet the forthcoming demands 
of each business and to make sure that the 
businesses continue to deliver sustainable 
proﬁts. During 2016, the directors have 
focused on maintaining headcount at a similar 
level to that in 2015, hiring new heads only 
where it was considered essential or for 
investment purposes. Headcount has fallen 
by 53 since September 2015 to 2,244 mainly 
attributable to the disposal of Gulf Publishing 
and Petroleum Economist in April 2016 and 
the cost reduction review undergone in the 
second quarter of 2015, offset by the increase 
in headcount investment in the group’s asset 
management businesses and the acquisitions 
of FastMarkets and Reinsurance Security.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report ❯ OPERATING & FINANCIAL REVIEW The group is diverse and operates through a 
large number of businesses in many locations. 
Each business provides important channels of 
communication to different sections of society. 
The success of the group’s businesses owes 
much to understanding and engaging with 
the communities they serve both locally and 
globally. Below are some explanations on key 
areas of corporate responsibility:
PEOPLE
People are a key part of our strategy. We 
couldn’t do what we do without our people 
and we believe people capability is a key 
differentiator and growth driver for the group. 
The group has started to invest heavily in the 
people agenda this year and will continue to 
do so. Having created a new role, group-wide 
HR director, the focus will be on the global 
strategic talent agenda, ensuring that going 
forward we have the right people in the right 
jobs, doing the right things at the right time. 
Work has commenced on remuneration and the 
group has started a global talent and succession 
management process this year. The key priority 
of remuneration (refer to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 46) was to 
enable future incentives for executive directors 
and other members of executive management 
to be more closely aligned with the group’s key 
strategic, ﬁnancial and operational objectives. 
This includes transitioning away from the proﬁt 
share scheme used widely across the group 
for many years and implementation of the 
Annual Bonus Plan, widening the adoption of 
the existing 2015 Performance Share Plan to 
replace the CAP 2014 scheme and introducing 
shareholding guidelines which will require 
executive management to build up and retain 
shares in the company.
We have created a people strategy for 2017 
which includes:
 ● a robust succession planning and talent 
identiﬁcation process globally;
 ● a global resourcing strategy including 
internal mobility; and
 ● a global talent development strategy.
In 2016 we continued to run various training 
and development interventions:
 ● Management Development Programme 
(MDP): this is a three-day intensive workshop 
focusing on innovation and launching new 
businesses, followed by three months of 
group work to develop new business ideas, 
which are then presented to a judging panel. 
 ● Hackathon: the group ran its second hack 
event, TechSprint, in October last year in 
its search for the next generation of top 
tech talent. Thirty recent  graduates from 
across the UK were placed in teams of ﬁve, 
and tasked to solve and build solutions 
to real-life business problems. Each team 
researched, designed, coded and then 
presented a variety of tech products to a 
panel of judges. The group sees this kind 
of event as evidence of its commitment 
to innovation and investment in technology, 
and also an invaluable source of graduate 
talent. The third event is expected to be run 
early in 2017.
 ● Graduate Programme: graduate trainee 
journalists join the group on a six-month 
training programme. The scheme combines 
on-the-job training with classroom-based 
learning to equip participants for a career 
in ﬁnancial and business journalism. The 
technology graduate training programme 
recruits skilled graduates for roles including 
developer, business analyst and quality 
assurance tester. Graduates are supported 
by a team of mentors and gain hands-
on experience working on projects across 
the group alongside divisional heads of 
technology and project managers.
 ● DMGT’s Leadership Development 
Programme (LDP): this is a comprehensive 
programme developed and delivered 
in partnership with the University of 
Cambridge. It allows the sharing of insights 
in leadership areas such as markets and 
competitive landscapes and advances in 
technology. 
 ● DMGT’s Early Careers Leadership 
Programme: the group is committed to 
developing those at an early stage in their 
career. The aim is to identify and support 
future leaders within the operating 
companies. Through mentorship, structured 
career paths and challenging assignments 
we look to grow and develop our future 
leaders. Two pilot programmes took place 
this year in the US.
 ● DMGT’s Finance Conference: this is an 
annual conference where ﬁnancial 
professionals from each business come 
together to discuss industry updates, share 
expertise and network.
We want to retain and foster our 
entrepreneurial spirit while also bringing to 
fruition the beneﬁts of some company-wide 
initiatives and ensuring we deliver the best of 
both worlds from a people perspective. 
Diversity is a key focus through all our people-
related activities and is instrumental for our 
business. The group is an equal opportunity 
employer. It seeks to employ a workforce 
which reﬂects the diverse community at large, 
because the contribution of the individual is 
valued, irrespective of sex, age, marital status, 
disability, sexual preference or orientation, 
race, colour, religion, ethnic or national 
origin. It does not discriminate in recruitment, 
promotion or other employee matters. The 
group endeavours to provide a working 
environment free from unlawful discrimination, 
victimisation or harassment.
The board believes that diversity is important for 
board effectiveness. However, diversity is much 
more than an issue of gender, and includes a 
diversity of skills, experience, nationality and 
background. Diversity will continue to be a 
key consideration when contemplating the 
composition and refreshing of the board as 
well as senior and wider management. The 
board recognises that while the overall balance 
of gender is good within the group, with 47% 
of employees being female (2015: 47%), there 
is still more work to be done to fulﬁl overall 
diversity ambitions and this will be a key focus 
for 2017.

ENVIRONMENT
The group does not operate directly in 
industries where there is the potential for 
serious industrial pollution. It does not print 
products in-house or have any investments 
in printing works. It takes its environmental 
responsibility seriously and complies with all 
relevant environmental laws and regulations 
in each country in which it operates. Wherever 
economically feasible, account is taken of 
environmental issues when placing contracts 
with suppliers of goods and services and these 
suppliers are regularly reviewed and monitored. 
For instance, the group’s two biggest print 
contracts are outsourced to companies which 
have environment management systems 
compliant with the ISO 14001 standard. The 
paper used for the group’s publications is 
produced from pulp obtained from sustainable 
forests, manufactured under strict, monitored 
and accountable environmental standards. 
The group is not a heavy user of energy; 
however, it does manage its energy 
requirements sensibly using low-energy ofﬁce 
equipment where possible and uses a common 
sense approach to ofﬁce energy management. 
Each ofﬁce within the group is encouraged 
to reduce waste, reuse paper and only print 
documents and emails where necessary. The 
main ofﬁces across the group also recycle 
waste where possible. 
The directors are committed to reducing 
the group’s absolute carbon emissions and 
managing its carbon footprint. Further details 
of the carbon footprint are set out in the 
Directors’ Report.
SOCIAL INVESTMENT
The group continues to expand its charitable 
activities and raised over £0.3m for local 
and international charitable causes during 
the year. These contributions came from its 
own charitable budget, individual employee 
fundraising efforts and also from clients who 
generously made donations in support of 
the company’s charitable projects. The group 
also continues to encourage employees to 
be involved actively in supporting charities by 
fundraising themselves which it then matches. 
Further details can be found on the company’s 
website, www.euromoneyplc.com/corporate-
social-responsibility.
The group works and partners with recognised 
charitable organisations that have expertise 
within certain sectors, thus ensuring that 
the implementation and management of a 
charitable project is carried out efﬁciently and 
that donated funds reach the communities at 
which the charitable cause is aimed. At the 
same time, the charity committee is careful 
to address the sustainability aspects of each 
charitable project to ensure a long-lasting 
beneﬁcial impact.
The group also tries to adopt a company-wide 
charity and support it for a year or more. In 
2015 the group went through a selection 
process and the decision was made to support 
both Afghan Connection, a charity with over 
ten years’ experience successfully funding 
education and sports projects in Afghanistan, 
and Haven House, an independent charity 
supporting over 300 families in the UK 
with children who have life-limiting or life-
threatening conditions. 
This year’s efforts included a company-wide 
challenge involving the UK and Hong Kong 
ofﬁces to raise funds for Afghan Connection 
and Haven House. The aim was to run, walk 
and cycle a total of 6,485km to the site in 
Afghanistan where Kezer Primary School 
will be built in 2017 through Euromoney’s 
support of Afghan Connection. The challenge 
involved a mixture of a fun run, a virtual cycle 
competition and a dedicated core team of 
runners and cyclists, with the ﬁnal distance 
reached at 11,211km, almost double the 
original target. Employees raised £6,735 which 
was split between the two charities.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report ❯ CORPORATE & SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY A second initiative saw six Euromoney 
employees take part in the Royal Parks Half 
Marathon in support of Haven House with the 
aim to raise funds for their family counselling, 
toy loan and palliative social work services. 
Alongside generous donations from friends, 
family and colleagues, the team also hosted 
a bake sale and a charity breakfast, serving 
cooked breakfasts and bagels from the ofﬁce 
kitchen, and as a result raised a total of £2,330 
for the charity.
Euromoney has been supporting Little Rock 
since 2011 and has fundraised over £0.7m 
which was instrumental in building a new 
school in 2012 and enabling it to support 
children and their families to become a beacon 
of inclusion in Kenya. 
On the outskirts of Nairobi, in Kibera slum, you 
will ﬁnd Little Rock Inclusive Early Childhood 
Education Centre. Alongside are 2.5m people 
living in an informal settlement with limited 
access to water, healthcare and education; the 
majority of children in Kibera do not have the 
life opportunities to break the cycle of poverty. 
Little Rock was founded in 2003 to give 
Kibera children a solid foundation for life, 
and takes a unique approach of providing 
an inclusive education, teaching disabled 
children alongside their non-disabled peers, 
which is changing community attitudes 
towards disability. Little Rock provides a unique 
opportunity for education for children from 
the Kibera community. Every day over 450 
children aged six months to 11 years attend 
the kindergarten and learn together in an 
inclusive environment. As well as learning to 
read, write and communicate the kindergarten 
children receive a nutritious meal, on-site 
physio and occupational therapy and a very 
active programme of music, sport and play. 
Little Rock continues to supports children 
to transition to local primary and secondary 
schools, with over 200 children attending 
their after-school programme which provides 
a meal, tutoring and access to the library 
resources and therapy services.

Chief Executive  
November 24 2016
Melody, who was born with Cerebral 
Palsy, was brought to Little Rock when 
she was six years old. Despite her parents’ 
doubts that she would ever learn to 
read and write, Melody excelled in her 
studies under the specialist teaching 
and occupational therapy provided at 
Little Rock. However, when Melody tried 
to enrol in local primary schools she 
was rejected. At 13 years old, Melody 
remained at Little Rock alongside other 
older disabled children who were also 
rejected from primary schools. Little 
Rock decided to change this, and began 
working with local primary schools to 
change the attitudes of teachers through 
training and mentoring. This year, Melody 
was enrolled in a mainstream government 
primary school and on seeing her ability, 
she was fast-tracked to a higher grade, 
next year she will start preparing for 
secondary school entrance exams.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance ❯ BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Corporate Governance Report is designed 
to provide shareholders with an explanation 
of how the company has applied the main 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’). We have used the key 
themes of the Code as the framework for 
articulating the board’s activities during the 
year:
 ● Leadership and effectiveness are on page 33.
 ● Accountability: The reports on the audit and 
risk committee are set out on pages 37 to 41.
 ● Relations with shareholders on page 41.
 ● Remuneration is set within the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 58. 
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The company continues substantially to comply 
with the Code. However, since its formation 
in 1969, the company has had a majority 
shareholder, Daily Mail and General Trust plc 
(DMGT). As majority shareholder, DMGT retains 
two non-executive positions on the board. 
These non-executive directors are not regarded 
as independent under the Code. In addition, 
the company’s founder, president and ex-
chairman, Sir Patrick Sergeant, remains on the 
board but is not regarded as an independent 
director under the Code. As a result, the 
company failed to comply throughout the 
ﬁnancial year ended September 30 2016 with 
certain provisions of the Code as set out below. 
The company has, however, made signiﬁcant 
strides over the past few years to bring the 
board structure more in line with best practice. 
In particular, the number of executive directors 
reduced to two compared to eight in 2015, 
resulting in a position where the majority of 
the board comprises non-executive directors. 
The board believes this allows for clearer 
delineation of responsibilities between the 
board and the executive management team.

The appointment of (i) A Rashbass on October 1 2015 as executive chairman and then (ii) JC Botts on 
November 18 2015 as interim non-executive chairman did not meet the Code’s independence criteria. During 
the year the company undertook a search for an independent non-executive Chairman and concluded that 
the company would be best served by JC Botts continuing to act as the permanent non-executive chairman.
A.4.1 Composition of the 
board
The board has not identiﬁed a senior independent director but intends to do so in the near future to ensure 
compliance with the Code. DP Pritchard carries out a similar function to a senior independent director by 
acting as a sounding board for the non-executive chairman and an intermediary for the other directors.
B.1.2 Composition of the 
board
Less than half the board are independent non-executive directors. However, there are clear divisions of 
responsibility within the board such that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision. The company 
reduced the number of executive directors following the AGM and aims to be more in line with best practice 
in the near term in relation to the number of non-executive independent directors.
B.2.1 Composition of 
the nominations 
committee
The nominations committee does not comprise a majority of independent non-executive directors. The 
committee comprises three non-executive and one executive director, none of whom are considered 
independent under the Code, but all are considered by the board to be the most appropriate members. 
B.3.2 Terms and 
conditions of 
appointment of 
non-executive 
directors
JC Botts, DP Pritchard, ART Ballingal and TP Hillgarth have terms and conditions of appointment. However, 
The Viscount Rothermere, PA Zwillenberg and Sir Patrick Sergeant operate under the terms of their 
employment contracts with DMGT and Euromoney respectively.
C.3.1 Composition of the 
audit committee
The audit committee does not comprise at least three independent non-executives directors. The committee 
comprises four members, only two of whom are considered independent under the Code. Of the others, one 
is the chairman of the company and the other is the ﬁnance director of DMGT. Both are considered by the 
board to be valuable and independently minded members of the committee.
C.3.2 Risk committee 
approach
The risk committee does not comprise of at least three independent non-executive directors. The committee 
comprises six members, only one of whom is considered independent under the Code. As explained on 
pages 40 and 41 the role and responsibilities of the risk committee, including its membership, are considered 
appropriate and well suited to reviewing the company’s risk management approach. The risk committee and 
the audit committee work collaboratively and include members common to both committees, to ensure that 
the principles of the Code are achieved within this structure.
D.2.1 Composition and 
chairmanship of 
the remuneration 
committee
The remuneration committee does not comprise at least three independent non-executive directors. The 
committee comprises three non-executive directors, only one of whom is considered independent under 
the Code. JC Botts is the chairman of the remuneration committee and following the board changes on 
November 18 2015 is also the chairman of the company. The chairman of the committee will be reviewed 
in due course.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance ❯ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BOARD COMPOSITION AND ROLES
The board comprises a non-executive chairman, two executive directors and six non-executive directors. There are clear divisions of responsibility 
within the board such that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision. There is a procedure for all directors in the furtherance of their duties 
to take independent professional advice, at the company’s expense. They also have access to the advice and services of the company secretary. Their 
key responsibilities are set out in the table below:

shareholder to the board
CHC Fordham, NF Osborn, DE Alfano, JL Wilkinson and B AL-Rehany did not seek re-election as executive directors of the company at the AGM on 
January 28 2016. 
INDEPENDENCE
The board has determined that DP Pritchard, 
ART Ballingal and TP Hillgarth are independent 
within the meaning of the Code. JC Botts 
has been on the board for more than the 
recommended term of nine years under the 
Code and the board believes that his length 
of service enhances his role as a non-executive 
director and that he remains independently 
minded. However, due to his length of service, 
JC Botts is not considered to be independent. 
Sir Patrick Sergeant has served on the board 
in various roles since founding the company in 
1969 and has been a non-executive director 
since 1992. However, due to his length of 
service, Sir Patrick Sergeant is not considered 
to be independent.
The Viscount Rothermere has a signiﬁcant 
shareholding in the company through his 
beneﬁcial holding in DMGT and because of this 
he is not considered independent. The Viscount 
Rothermere and PA Zwillenberg are also 
executive directors of DMGT, an intermediate 
parent company. However, the company is 
run as a separate, distinct and decentralised 
subsidiary of DMGT and these directors have 
no involvement in the day-to-day management 
of the company. They bring valuable experience 
and advice to the company and the board does 
not believe these non-executive directors are 
able to exert undue inﬂuence on decisions 
taken by the board, nor does it consider their 
independence to be impaired by their positions 
with DMGT. However, their relationship with 
DMGT means they are not considered to be 
independent.
EFFECTIVENESS
Each year, the performance of the board and 
its committees is evaluated. The Code requires 
an externally facilitated evaluation of the 
board to be concluded every three years. The 
last external evaluation was conducted by a 
company independent to the group in 2014. 
The evaluation indicated a highly cohesive 
board and there were no outlying scores to 
suggest any signiﬁcant issues needed to be 
addressed. 
As a result of the initial stage of the strategic 
review carried out by A Rashbass in 2015, it 
was concluded that the company would be 
better served through a more traditional board 
structure, including the appointment of a non-
executive chairman and the creation of the 
new role of CEO. As this structure has only 
been in place for six months, the evaluation 
of the performance of the board was limited 
to informal interviews and meetings carried 
out by JC Botts, with the view that an external 
evaluation will be completed in 2017.
The nominations committee separately 
reviewed the performance of JC Botts as 
interim chairman of the company and 
recommended his permanent appointment in 
this role to the board. 
During the year, each of the main committees 
completed a questionnaire encompassing key 
areas of their mandates. It was concluded 
that the board and its committees had been 
effective throughout the year.
BOARD MEETINGS AND 
ATTENDANCE
The board meets at least every two months and 
there is frequent contact between meetings. 
At least once a year, the company’s chairman 
meets the non-executive directors without 
the other executive directors being present. 
The non-executive directors meet without the 
company’s chairman present at least annually 
to appraise the chairman’s performance and on 
other occasions as necessary.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance ❯ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT
FAIR, BALANCED AND 
UNDERSTANDABLE
The directors have responsibility for preparing 
the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts and for 
making certain conﬁrmations concerning it. In 
accordance with the Code provision C.1.1 the 
board considers that, taken as a whole, it is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. The 
board reached this conclusion after receiving 
advice from the audit committee.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK 
MANAGEMENT 
See pages 15 to 20 for the group’s principal 
risks and mitigating actions
The board as a whole is responsible for the 
oversight of risk, the group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
Such a system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The 
board has implemented a continuing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
material risks faced by the group. The board 
has delegated the day-to-day responsibility for 
internal controls to the audit committee and 
for risk management to the risk committee. 
The directors completed a review of the 
effectiveness of the group’s system of risk 
management and internal controls covering 
all material controls, including ﬁnancial, 
operational and compliance controls. The 
majority of controls operated throughout the 
year, though some additional controls were 
implemented during the year. The review 
did not identify any signiﬁcant weaknesses 
in the system of internal control and risk 
management. Where weaknesses were 
identiﬁed, they were localised and speciﬁc 
to individual businesses and not considered 
generic or signiﬁcant at an overall group level. 
The controls to prevent an information security 
breach or cyber-attack are being regularly 
reviewed and where appropriate updated. 
Cyber and other information security risks 
are increasing and the mitigation of these 
risks continues to be a key focus for the risk 
committee and the board. 
The diverse range of products and the many 
geographic markets that the group operates 
in makes regular testing of business continuity 
plans a challenge. The group is committed to 
improving its testing regime and is rolling out 
a new business continuity testing programme 
during 2017.
Key procedures which the directors have 
established with a view to providing effective 
internal control, and which have been in place 
throughout the year and up to the date of this 
report, are as follows: 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
 ● has overall responsibility for the group 
and there is a formal schedule of matters 
speciﬁcally reserved for decision by the 
board; 
 ● reviews and assesses the group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties at least annually and 
has performed a robust assessment of those 
principal risks;
 ● seeks assurance that effective control is 
being maintained through regular reports 
from business group management, the 
risk and audit committee and various 
independent monitoring functions;
 ● approves the annual budget after performing 
a review of key risk factors. Performance is 
monitored regularly by way of variances 
and key performance indicators to enable 
relevant action to be taken and forecasts are 
updated each quarter. The board considers 
longer-term ﬁnancial projections as part 
of its regular discussions on the group’s 
strategy and funding requirements; and
 ● proposals for investments and capital 
expenditure beyond speciﬁed limits are put 
to the board for approval.
RISK AND AUDIT COMMITTEE
The board has determined that having separate 
audit and risk committees, each with speciﬁc 
terms of reference, is required to provide the 
challenge and review necessary across the 
range of businesses the group operates. The 
audit and the risk committees collaborate with 
one another, as appropriate, with members 
possessing the requisite skills and experience 
to allow each committee to meet its obligation 
and to provide the relevant assurance to the 
board. This ensures that matters of mutual 
interest raised in either of the committees are 
discussed in the other committee and also 
cascaded down to the operating businesses. 
ENTITY LEVEL CONTROLS
Each operating business is responsible for 
the identiﬁcation and assessment of risks, 
understanding the risk return strategy and 
operating appropriate controls. A signiﬁcant 
amount of work has been undertaken in the year 
to enhance and update the company’s ﬁnancial 
controls at business level. A set of new tools 
has also been designed to provide guidance on 
each control area to help businesses within the 
group align their processes within the group’s 
ﬁnancial control framework. To support these 
tools, a training schedule and programme 
is in development. Each operating business 
conﬁrms the operation of key controls to 
central management annually. The purpose of 
the assessment is to conﬁrm the operation of a 
framework of internal controls, including anti-
fraud controls, which are expected to be in 
place in each business unit. They are intended 
to provide standards against which the control 
environments of the group’s business units can 
be monitored. An annual bribery and fraud 
risk assessment is completed at the same time, 
detailing risks and mitigating controls. In each 
case, the central management team follows-up 
these submissions as appropriate.
The executive committee meets monthly to 
discuss strategic, operational and ﬁnancial 
issues. The group’s tax, ﬁnancing and foreign 
exchange positions are overseen by the 
tax and treasury committee. Controls and 
procedures over the security of data and 
disaster recovery are periodically reviewed 
and are subject to internal audit. Accounting 
controls and procedures are regularly reviewed 
and communicated throughout the group. 
Particular attention is paid to authorisation 
levels and segregation of duties.
INTERNAL AUDIT 
The group’s internal audit function described 
on page 40 is managed by DMGT’s internal 
audit function, working closely with the 
company’s ﬁnance director and the chairman 
of the audit committee. It undertakes internal 
control reviews across the group and reports its 
ﬁndings to the audit committee.

Appointed as director of the company and 
member of the committee on June 1 2016
KEY ACTIVITIES 
The committee meets when required and this 
year met three times, and informal discussions 
were held at other times during the year. The 
main focus for 2016 was the restructure of 
the board and the appointment of a new non-
executive chairman. 
The following changes were proposed by 
the committee and agreed by the board in 
November 2015: 
 ● the chairman of the board be changed to 
a non-executive role and that JC Botts be 
appointed as the non-executive chairman 
in an interim capacity until such time 
as the company appoints a permanent 
independent non-executive chairman; 
 ● A Rashbass’s role as executive chairman be 
changed to the new role of CEO; 
 ● A Rashbass to step down as chairman of 
the nominations committee and JC Botts 
to replace A Rashbass as chairman of the 
nominations committee until a permanent 
non-executive chairman has been appointed; 
 ● CHC Fordham to step down from the 
nominations committee; and
 ● the number of executive directors on 
the board to reduce and accordingly  
CHC Fordham, NF Osborn, JL Wilkinson, 
B AL-Rehany and DE Alfano not to seek 
re-election at the company’s next AGM in 
January 2016.
Following the changes agreed by the board 
in November 2015, a thorough search 
process was undertaken by the committee 
for the recruitment and appointment of a 
new independent non-executive chairman. 
The committee ensured that the appointed 
executive search agency was independent 
and had no other connections with the group. 
The committee concluded that although 
the objective was to ﬁnd an independent 
non-executive chairman, the most suitable 
candidate was JC Botts due to his knowledge 
of the company and his skill and experience on 
the board and in many of the markets that the 
group serves. JC Botts was not involved in any 
decision regarding his own appointment.
FOCUS FOR 2017
The key activities for the year ahead will be:
 ● reviewing the composition of the board, 
including diversity, to ensure that the right 
skills and experience to support the group’s 
strategy are represented;
 ● reviewing the balance of independent non-
executive directors with the view that at 
least half of the board will be independent 
in the near term; and
 ● continuing to review succession planning.
DIVERSITY
The committee believes that diversity is 
important for board effectiveness. However, 
diversity is much more than an issue of gender 
and includes a diversity of skills, experience, 
nationality and background. Diversity 
will continue to be a key consideration 
when contemplating the composition and 
refreshing of the board as well as senior and 
wider management. Following the board 
restructure during the year, the number of 
female board members fell to nil from two at 
the start of the ﬁnancial year. The committee 
remains supportive of the principles stated 
in the Davies Report and views the current 
status as temporary. As part of its review of 
the composition of the board in 2017, the 
diversity position will be reviewed in light of 
best practice. The group’s gender diversity 
information is set out in the Strategic Report 
on pages 28 and 29.
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The audit committee is responsible for oversight 
of the group’s ﬁnancial reporting processes 
and the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements. 
It scrutinises the work of the external auditor 
and any signiﬁcant judgements made by 
management. The committee reports on its 
operations to the board to enable the directors 
to determine the overall effectiveness of the 
group’s internal controls system.
COMMITTEE MEMBERS
DP Pritchard (chairman of the committee, 
independent)
JC Botts
SW Daintith (ﬁnance director of DMGT)
TP Hillgarth (independent)
Three of the four members are non-executive 
directors. All members of the committee have 
a high level of ﬁnancial literacy, SW Daintith 
and TP Hillgarth are chartered accountants and 
members of the ICAEW, and DP Pritchard has 
considerable audit committee experience. 
RESPONSIBILITIES
The committee meets at least three times each 
ﬁnancial year and is responsible for:
 ● monitoring the integrity of the interim 
report, the Annual Report and Accounts and 
other related formal statements, reviewing 
accounting policies used and judgements 
applied;
 ● reviewing the content of the Annual Report 
and Accounts and advising the board on 
whether, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced

information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the company’s performance, business 
model and strategy;
 ● considering the effectiveness of the group’s 
internal ﬁnancial control systems; 
 ● considering the appointment or 
reappointment of the external auditor and 
reviewing their remuneration, both for audit 
and non-audit;
 ● monitoring and reviewing the external 
auditor’s independence and objectivity and 
the effectiveness of the audit process;
 ● monitoring and reviewing the resources and 
effectiveness of internal audit;

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance ❯ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  ● reviewing the internal audit programme and 
receiving periodic reports on its ﬁndings; 
 ● reviewing the whistle-blowing arrangements 
available to staff;
 ● reviewing the group’s policy on the 
employment of former audit staff; and
 ● reviewing the group’s policy on non-audit 
fees. 
KEY ACTIVITIES
The committee met three times and met 
privately with the representatives from internal 
and external audit after each meeting. The 
chairman of the committee also held separate 
private meetings during the year with the 
external auditor, representatives from internal 
audit and the ﬁnance director and his team. 
The key activities included:
 ● identifying and assessing the matters which 
required signiﬁcant judgement in 2016, 
including discussion and review of the 
non-underlying items that may impact the 
performance of the business;
 ● advising the board on whether the 
Annual Report was fair, balanced and 
understandable;
 ● reviewing the group’s system of internal 
control and ﬁnancial risk, including 
management’s project to improve and 
to document the processes and controls 
in the ﬁnance functions globally and 
implementation of Navision at Institutional 
Investor in New York;
 ● monitoring the resolution of issues raised 
during internal audits;
 ● jointly with DMGT, selecting a new head of 
internal audit and increasing the internal 
audit resource for 2017 to include a team 
member allocated exclusively to the group; 
 ● a review of the provision of non-audit 
services in light of the revision of the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard for Auditors; and
 ● assessing the external auditor’s effectiveness, 
particularly as ﬁnancial year 2015 was their 
ﬁrst year-end following the formal tender 
process 2014.
The FRC’s Conduct Committee selected the 
group’s 2015 Annual Report and Accounts 
for review. Whilst there were no signiﬁcant 
ﬁndings, some areas of disclosure around 
tax reporting were identiﬁed as requiring 
improvement, including an expansion to the 
accounting policy for uncertain tax provisions 
and a description of signiﬁcant movements 
in the tax reconciliation. The audit committee 
has ensured that these matters have been 
adequately addressed in the 2016 Annual 
Report and Accounts, in particular, the 
Strategic Report, the group’s key judgement 
areas in note 2 and the tax disclosures and 
explanations in note 8. 
Looking ahead, the additional topics in 2017 
will be to evaluate systems of internal control 
across the group, including system controls, in 
light of the organisational changes being made 
following the strategic review, and to increase 
the committee’s direct interaction with ﬁnance 
staff from key businesses to widen and deepen 
its knowledge of people, processes and 
systems. 
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL JUDGEMENTS
The committee, with input from the external auditor, assessed whether suitable accounting policies had been adopted, whether management had 
made appropriate estimates and judgements and whether disclosures were balanced and fair. For the year ended September 30 2016 the committee 
reviewed the following main issues:
ISSUE REVIEW
Fair, balanced and understandable
At the request of the board, the audit committee has considered 
whether, in its opinion, the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable.
Following the committee’s review of the accounts and after applying their 
knowledge of matters raised during the year, the committee is satisﬁed 
that, taken as a whole, the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable
Presentation of adjusted performance
Presentation of the adjusted performance and the adjusting 
items, including identiﬁcation and treatment of exceptional items. 
Management considered the latest ESMA guidelines on alternative 
performance measures to ensure that the Annual Report and Accounts 
had been updated in line with best practice.
The committee reviewed the ﬁnancial statements and discussed 
with management and the external auditor the appropriateness of 
the adjusted items including consideration of their consistency and 
the avoidance of any misleading effect on the ﬁnancial statements. 
The committee challenged management to ensure that each item is 
appropriate to classify as an exceptional item. The committee concluded 
that the presentation of the adjusted performance is appropriate.

EUROMONEY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR PLC WWW.EUROMONEYPLC.COM ISSUE REVIEW
Impact of strategy on results presentation
The group’s new strategy has had the following impact on the 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements:
 ● classiﬁcation of reportable segments to reﬂect changes to the 
internal reporting to the board as prescribed by IFRS 8; and
 ● presentation of planned disposals as held for sale.
The committee reviewed the disclosures of the new reportable 
segments in the pre-close trading statement and ﬁnancial statements 
to ensure consistency with the budget presentation to the board and 
the management accounts pack. 
The committee discussed any planned disposals with management 
and satisﬁed itself that the disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements were 
appropriate.
Goodwill and other intangibles
The group has goodwill of £396.1m and other intangible assets of 
£155.0m. As a result of the impairment review at the half year and 
year end, the group recognised impairment charges for Mining Indaba 
of £12.9m, HedgeFund Intelligence (HFI) of £5.9m, Total Derivatives of 
£8.2m and Euromoney Indices of £1.7m.
A sensitivity analysis for NDR has been included as further disclosures 
are required under IAS 36 if any reasonably possible change to a key 
assumption would cause the cash generating units carrying amount to 
exceed its recoverable amount. 
The committee has considered the assessments made in relation to the 
impairment of goodwill. The committee discussed the methodology 
and assumptions used in the model supporting the carrying value. The 
committee reviewed those businesses where headroom has decreased 
or where management has identiﬁed impairments, including Mining 
Indaba, HFI, Total Derivatives and Euromoney Indices. NDR was also 
reviewed but the committee was satisﬁed no impairment was necessary 
for NDR. The committee has also understood the sensitivity analysis 
used by management in its review and disclosure of impairment.
Investments
The group holds material balances relating to investments in associates 
and available-for-sale amounting to £35.9m. 
The committee reviewed the assessments made in relation to Dealogic, 
Zanbato and Estimize for potential impairments at the half year and 
year-end. The committee is satisﬁed with the carrying value recognised 
for Dealogic and that no impairment is required. The Committee 
recognised that Zanbato and Estimize businesses are still in start-up 
phase but based on progress to date the committee concluded no 
impairment was required at year-end.
Accounting for acquisitions and disposals
The group made a number of acquisitions and disposals during the 
year. There were a number of consequential accounting considerations, 
including identiﬁcation and fair values of intangible assets, fair value 
of other assets, goodwill arising, step-up losses of prior interests held 
and gain on sale of disposal recognised. The group also has acquisition 
commitments on previous acquisitions.
The committee has reviewed the results of the work undertaken in this 
area, the disclosure in the ﬁnancial statements and has sought further 
explanation where necessary. The committee reviewed the inputs 
and assumptions into the calculation of the acquisition commitments 
liability at year-end. 
Taxation
Taxation represents a signiﬁcant cost to the group in both cash and 
accounting terms, and the group is exposed to differing tax regimes and 
risks which affect both the carrying values of tax balances (including 
deferred tax) and the resultant income statement charges. The group is 
also exposed to similar risks for indirect tax.
The committee reviewed the tax charge at the half year and full year, 
including the underlying tax effect, deferred tax balances and the 
provision for uncertain tax positions for direct and indirect tax. The 
chairman of the audit committee also attends the tax and treasury 
committee which provides valuable insight into the tax matters, related 
provisions and helps establish the appropriateness of the recognition of 
the deferred tax balances. 
The committee is satisﬁed that all issues have been addressed appropriately and in accordance with the relevant accounting standards and principles.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance ❯ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL 
FINANCIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
The committee has responsibility for reviewing 
the process for identifying and managing 
ﬁnancial risk and for reviewing internal ﬁnancial 
controls. It reviews reports on internal ﬁnancial 
controls including reports by the chief risk 
ofﬁcer, ﬁnance director and the results from 
the internal audits. In addition, the committee 
reviewed the external auditor’s assessment of 
the group’s minimum controls framework and 
the design of the ﬁnancial and system controls 
for a new ﬁnance system implemented by the 
US group.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The group’s internal audit function is managed 
by DMGT’s internal audit department, working 
closely with the company’s ﬁnance director 
and chairman of the audit committee. Internal 
audit draws on the services of the group’s 
central ﬁnance teams to assist in completing 
the audit assignments. Internal audit aims 
to provide an independent assessment as 
to whether effective systems and controls 
are in place and being operated to manage 
signiﬁcant operating and ﬁnancial risks. It also 
aims to support management by providing cost 
effective recommendations to mitigate risk and 
control weaknesses identiﬁed during the audit 
process, as well as provide insight into where 
cost efﬁciencies and monetary gains might 
be made by improving the operations of the 
business. Businesses and central departments 
are selected for an internal audit on a risk-
focused basis, after taking account of the 
risks identiﬁed as part of the risk management 
process, the risk and materiality of each of the 
group’s businesses, the scope and ﬁndings 
of external audit work, the departments and 
businesses reviewed previously and the ﬁndings 
from these reviews. This approach ensures that 
internal audit focus is placed on the higher 
risk areas of the group, while ensuring an 
appropriate breadth of audit coverage.
The audit committee monitors the level and 
skill base available to the group from internal 
audit. Although internal audit areas are 
planned a year ahead, the amount of time 
available to the group from internal audit 
is not ﬁxed. Internal audit is able to scale up 
resource as required and draws on ﬁnance 
people across the wider DMGT group as well 
as regularly supplementing its team through 
the use of specialists. In 2017, this resource will 
be increased to include a dedicated full-time 
member of the internal audit team allocated 
to the group.
The committee is able to monitor the 
effectiveness of internal audit through its 
involvement in their focus, planning, process 
and outcome. The committee approves the 
internal audit plan and any revision to it 
during the year. The chair of the committee 
is invited to attend the initial internal audit 
planning meeting with management. Internal 
audit presents, at each audit committee 
meeting, a summary of its work and ﬁndings, 
the results of the internal audit team’s follow 
up of completed reviews and a summary of 
assurance work completed by other audit 
functions within the business. Internal audit 
are involved in other risk assurance projects 
including fraud investigation, the annual 
fraud and bribery risk assessment, information 
security and business continuity. Internal audit 
are also subject to an external review every 
ﬁve years, the results of which are fed back to 
the committee. This external review was last 
carried out in September 2013. 
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was 
appointed by shareholders as the group’s 
statutory auditor in 2015 following a formal 
tender process. The external audit contract 
will be put out to tender at least every ten 
years. The company has complied with the 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 for the ﬁnancial 
year under review.
As part of its role in ensuring effectiveness, 
the committee reviewed PwC’s audit plan to 
ensure its appropriateness for the group and 
has completed a review which focused on the 
effectiveness, independence and objectivity 
of the external audit. The assessment of the 
effectiveness is based on a framework setting 
out the key areas of the audit process for the 
committee to consider, as well as the role that 
management has contributed to an effective 
process. Results from tailored questionnaires 
sent to the chairman of the audit committee, 
ﬁnance director, deputy ﬁnance director, and 
divisional ﬁnance directors and PwC’s client 
satisfaction survey were discussed by the audit 
committee and no signiﬁcant issues were 
raised by the assessment. PwC conﬁrmed 
to the committee that they maintained 
appropriate internal safeguards to ensure their 
independence and objectivity. The committee 
recommends the reappointment of PwC at the 
2017 AGM.
NON-AUDIT WORK
The audit committee completes an annual 
assessment of the type of non-audit work 
permissible and a maximum level of non-
audit fees acceptable. Any non-audit work 
performed outside this remit is assessed and 
where appropriate approved by the committee. 
Fees paid to PwC for audit services, audit-
related services and other non-audit services 
are set out in note 4. During 2016, PwC did 
not provide signiﬁcant non-audit services. The 
group’s non-audit fee policy was updated for 
the revision of the FRC’s Ethical Standard for 
Auditors and is available on the company’s 
website. 
RISK COMMITTEE
The risk committee oversees the group’s risk 
management processes and considers the 
group risk register biannually. It reviews speciﬁc 
risks and monitors developments in relevant 
legislation and regulation, assessing the impact 
on the group. The committee reports on its 
operations to the board to enable the directors 
to determine the overall effectiveness of the 
group’s risk management.

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The company’s chairman, together with the 
board, encourages regular dialogue with 
shareholders. Meetings with shareholders are 
held, both in the UK and in the US, to discuss 
annual and interim results and highlight 
signiﬁcant acquisitions or disposals, or at the 
request of institutional shareholders. Private 
shareholders are encouraged to participate 
in the AGM. In line with best practice, all

Euromoney held an Investor Day in March 2016 to communicate its new strategy to its shareholders.  
The Investor Day was a key part in Euromoney’s continuing effort to improve communication with its shareholders and to increase 
transparency of its operations, leadership and governance. The main theme of the Investor Day was the  
presentation of Euromoney’s new strategy developed following the appointment of Andrew Rashbass as the CEO. It also allowed the 
investors and analysts to meet with members of the board, many of whom attended the event. The Investor Day  
included a number of presentations by the divisional leaders of Euromoney and demonstrations of their latest products. The investors 
and analysts also had opportunities to meet with the divisional leaders to discuss face to face the opportunities  
and challenges facing their businesses.

have declined, the company’s strong balance 
sheet means the board is able to recommend 
an unchanged ﬁnal dividend of 16.40p per 
ordinary share (2015: 16.40p), payable on 
Thursday February 9 2017 to shareholders 
on the register on Friday December 2 2016. 
This, together with the interim dividend of 
7.00p per ordinary share (2015: 7.00p) which 
was declared on May 19 2016 and paid on  
June 23 2016, brings the total dividend for 
the year to 23.40p per ordinary share (2015: 
23.40p).

effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the company following a takeover 
bid. None of these agreements is deemed to 
be signiﬁcant in terms of their potential impact 
on the business of the group as a whole. The 
company’s share plans contain provisions that 
take effect in such an event but do not entitle 
participants to a greater interest in the shares 
of the company than created by the initial 
grant or award under the relevant plan. Details 
of the directors’ entitlement to compensation 
for loss of ofﬁce following a takeover or 
contract termination are given in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.

APPOINTMENT AND REMOVAL OF 
DIRECTORS
The company’s Articles of Association give 
power to the board to appoint directors from 
time to time. In addition to the statutory 
rights of shareholders to remove a director by 
ordinary resolution, the board may also remove 
a director where 75% of the board gives 
written notice to such director. The Articles of 
Association themselves may be amended by a 
special resolution of the shareholders. 
Following best practice under the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and 
in accordance with the company’s Articles of 
Association, all directors submit themselves for 
re-election annually. Accordingly, all directors 
will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being 
eligible, will offer themselves for re-election. In 
addition, in accordance with the Code, before 
the re-election of a non-executive director, the 
chairman is required to conﬁrm to shareholders 
that, following formal performance evaluation, 
the non-executive directors’ performance 
continues to be effective and demonstrates 
commitment to the role. Accordingly, the  
non-executive directors will retire at the 
forthcoming AGM and, being eligible 
following a formal performance evaluation by 
the chairman, offer themselves for re-election. 
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
A qualifying third-party indemnity (QTPI) 
as permitted by the Company’s Articles of 
Association and Section 232 and 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006, has been granted 
by the company to each of the directors 
of the company. Under the provisions of 
QTPI the company undertakes to indemnify 
each director against liability to third parties 
(excluding criminal and regulatory penalties) 
and to pay directors’ costs as incurred, provided 
that they are reimbursed to the company if the 
director is found guilty or, in an action brought 
by the company, judgement is given against 
the director.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the Accounts in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Company 
law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that 
law the directors are required to prepare the 
group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and the parent 
company ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
REPORT FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF 
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2016 
which has been prepared by the remuneration 
committee (Committee) on behalf of the 
board. The Committee continues to place 
great importance on ensuring there is a clear 
link between remuneration and delivery of 
the group’s strategy. For 2016, the priority has 
been to develop and implement a new long-
term strategy. Andrew Rashbass, the group’s 
CEO, outlined the new three pillars of strategic 
activity at the March 2016 Investor Day, namely 
investing around big themes, transforming the 
operating model and actively managing the 
portfolio. A key component of introducing an 
effective operating model is group-wide talent 
management. The Committee seeks to ensure 
that the group is a competitive employer of 
talented people and a place where colleagues 
actively encourage other high-potential 
individuals to work. The group will use reward 
arrangements as a critical part of driving and 
rewarding earnings growth and shareholder 
value. The key remuneration outcomes for 
the year and plans for the coming year are as 
follows:
2016 REWARD OUTCOMES
The group is going through a period of 
transformation following the launch of its 
new strategy. Its performance was expected to 
deteriorate in 2016, as it did, before stabilising 
in 2017 and then returning to growth. The 
short-term objective for the board was to 
deliver the new strategy and to at least meet 
proﬁt expectations in 2016. Reported revenues 
were £403.1m, ﬂat year-on-year but 4% down 
on an underlying basis. Adjusted PBT fell by 
5% to £102.5m but is marginally ahead of 
expectations. A key activity of the Committee 
at the start of the year was to link Mr Rashbass’ 
annual incentive to these short-term strategic 
and ﬁnancial objectives. In determining the 
ﬁnal level of bonus payable, the Committee 
considered the wider performance of the group 
and agreed that Mr Rashbass was making 
signiﬁcant progress in delivering the new 
strategy. On the basis of the above, the annual 
bonus will pay out at 127% of salary against a 
maximum of 150%. Any annual bonus earned 
in excess of 100% of salary will be paid via a 
nil cost option, the vesting of which will be 
deferred for two years. Colin Jones, the group’s 
ﬁnance director, is on a proﬁt share scheme 
linked to adjusted diluted EPS (before tax). Due 
to the decrease in adjusted proﬁts, adjusted 
diluted EPS fell by 5% to 66.51p and Mr Jones’ 
proﬁt share fell by 4% to £0.5m. 
REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK FOR 
2017
The Committee reviews the remuneration and 
incentive plans of the executive, divisional 
directors and other key employees as well as 
looking at the remuneration costs and policies 
of the group as a whole. After the review of 
the reward arrangements of the new CEO in 
2015, it was the intention that the new Annual 
Bonus Plan and PSP , initially applied to Mr 
Rashbass, would also enable future incentives 
for executive directors and divisional directors 
to be more closely aligned with the group’s key 
strategic, ﬁnancial and operational objectives. 
The Committee focused their efforts in 
2016 on undertaking a detailed review and 
benchmarking exercise for the arrangements 
of divisional directors. We have completed this 
review and the Committee has recommended 
that senior management incentives be 
transitioned away from the proﬁt share scheme 
used widely across the group for many years 
and the goal over time is to change the mix of 
the reward as follows:
 ● move all divisional directors to market-based 
pay, which for some will require a salary 
increase; 
 ● lower the proportion of reward delivered 
through short-term incentives; and 
 ● increase the proportion of reward delivered 
through long-term incentive plans.
This new approach requires benchmarking 
base pay, implementation of the Annual Bonus 
Plan, widening the adoption of the existing 
PSP to replace the CAP 2014 scheme and 
introducing shareholding guidelines which 
will require divisional directors to build up and 
retain shares in the company. These principles 
and arrangements will apply for new divisional 
directors while the Committee will put in place 
transition arrangements for existing divisional 
directors to migrate to the approach within 
two years. 
SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AT THE 
2017 AGM
In line with the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2013, a summary of the 
remuneration policy has been included in this 
report given that the policy was approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 General Meeting on 
June 1 2015. No changes have been made to 
this policy this year. 
The Annual Remuneration Report together with 
this letter is subject to an advisory shareholder 
vote and will be put to the 2017 AGM to be 
held on January 26 2017. The sections of this 
report that have been subject to audit are 
marked in the contents above. The Committee 
believes the 88.2% of the votes cast in favour 
of the Annual Remuneration Report at the 
2016 AGM shows strong shareholder support 
for the company’s remuneration arrangements. 
The members of the Committee include a 
representative of its major shareholder, DMGT. 
Paul Zwillenberg replaced Martin Morgan 
as chief executive of DMGT on June 1 2016 
and as a member of the Committee. The 
Committee consults with its shareholders 
prior to any major changes in its remuneration 
arrangements.

EUROMONEY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR PLC WWW.EUROMONEYPLC.COM SUMMARY OF REMUNERATION POLICY
The board believes in aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders. It is the group’s policy to construct executive remuneration 
packages such that a signiﬁcant part of a director’s remuneration is linked to performance measures aligned with the group’s key strategic, ﬁnancial 
and operational objectives and with the creation of sustainable long-term shareholder value. Salaries and beneﬁts are generally not intended to be 
the most signiﬁcant part of a director’s remuneration. The policy was approved by shareholders at the 2015 General Meeting on June 1 2015 and is 
available to view in full on the company’s website at www.euromoneyplc.com/investors.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ELEMENT KEY FEATURES OF POLICY MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY
Basic salary Part of an overall market competitive pay package with salary generally not 
the most signiﬁcant part of a director’s overall package. Reﬂects the individual’s 
experience, role and performance within the company.
Normally reviewed by the 
Committee in April each year.
The Committee examines salary 
levels at FTSE 250 companies and 
other listed peer group companies 
to help determine executive 
director pay increases.
Pensions and 
beneﬁts
Either a contribution to the Company’s pension scheme or to a personal pension 
scheme; or cash allowance in lieu of beneﬁts.
Beneﬁts provided include private healthcare and life insurance.
Maximum employers’ contribution 
to a pension scheme is 15% of 
pensionable salary.
Annual incentive 
Annual Bonus Plan
The Annual Bonus Plan links reward to key business targets and an individual’s 
contribution. 
Up to 150% of salary.
Annual bonus 
deferral
The Annual Bonus Plan provides alignment with shareholders’ interests through 
the operation of bonus deferral. Clawback arrangements are in place.
Deferred awards usually granted 
in the form of conditional share 
awards or nil-cost options and vest 
two years after the award.
Proﬁt share Proﬁt share links the pay of those executive directors to whom it relates directly 
to the growth in proﬁts of their businesses. It encourages each director to grow 
their proﬁts, to invest in new products, to search for acquisitions, and to manage 
costs and risks tightly. Proﬁt shares are designed to maximise sustainable proﬁts 
with no guaranteed ﬂoor and no ceiling and are expected to make up much of a 
director’s total pay and encourage long-term retention. Clawback arrangements 
are in place.
No maximum.
Long-term 
incentive 
Share schemes are an important part of overall compensation and align the 
interests of directors and managers with shareholders. They encourage directors 
to deliver long-term, sustainable proﬁt and share price growth. Clawback and 
malus arrangements are in place. 
The company operates the following long-term incentive plans (LTIP): 2014 Capital 
Appreciation Plan (CAP 2014), 2014 Company Share Option Plan (CSOP 2014), 
2015 Performance Share Plan (PSP), Euromoney SAYE scheme and DMGT SIP .
The performance measures and 
maximum opportunity are detailed 
on pages 50 to 52. Further details 
of the schemes are set out in  
note 24.
Shareholding 
requirement
200% of salary for the CEO and 100% for other executive directors.
External 
appointments
The company encourages its executive directors to take a limited number of outside directorships provided they are not 
expected to impinge on their principal employment. Subject to the approval of the company chairman, directors may 
retain the remuneration received from the ﬁrst such appointment. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ELEMENT KEY FEATURES OF POLICY MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY
Fees Each non-executive director receives a base fee for services to the board with 
an additional fee payable for non-executive directors with selected, additional 
responsibilities (for example, the chairs of the remuneration and audit committees). 
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the company’s incentive 
schemes. The non-executive directors receive reimbursement for reasonable 
expenses incurred as part of their role as non-executive directors.
The remuneration of non-
executive directors is determined 
by the board based on the time 
commitment required by the non-
executive directors, their role and 
market conditions.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance ❯ DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT These objectives were weighted equally and monitored by the Committee. In determining the ﬁnal level of bonus payable, the Committee considered 
the wider performance of the group and agreed that A Rashbass had delivered a clear and comprehensive new strategy that had been received well 
by shareholders. In addition, the Committee noted that he had started to drive transformational change, encouraging focus on the simpliﬁcation of 
the operating model and making divestments and investments that underpin the overall strategy of the group. On the basis of the above, the annual 
bonus will pay out at 127% of salary. Any annual bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary will be paid as a nil-cost option, the vesting of which will 
be deferred for two years.
PENSIONS
Pension amounts are those contributed by the company to pension schemes or cash amounts paid in lieu of pension contributions. Executive directors 
can participate in the Euromoney Pension Plan (a money purchase plan) or their own private pension scheme. 
The Harmsworth Pension Scheme closed to future accrual of beneﬁts on December 31 2015. Under the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, the following

BUY-OUT AWARD FOR A RASHBASS
A one-off award of shares in the company with a value of £2,250,000 was made in order to compensate A Rashbass for incentives foregone on 
leaving his previous employment. This was considered to be no more than the comparable commercial value of the incentives foregone by A Rashbass 
from his previous employment. Based on the company’s average share price for the month of September 2015, 221,011 shares were awarded on 
October 1 2015. Subject to continued employment, 40% of this award vested on September 30 2016 and the remaining 60% will vest in three equal 
tranches on September 30 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. 
Under the terms of this award, 88,404 options vested on September 30 2016. Following the exercise of these options, A Rashbass received 46,854 
ordinary shares and a cash sum for the market value equivalent of 41,550 shares. The company will apply this cash equivalent payment on his behalf 
in satisfaction of the liability for taxes arising on the exercise. The market value of the shares awarded at the date of exercise was £11.09.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
No share plan awards under the PSP or CAP 2014 were due to vest in the year for the executive directors. There were 160,473 options granted to 
executive directors during the year. These included 159,269 under the PSP and 1,204 under the SAYE scheme. Details of the group’s share option 
schemes are set in the remuneration policy that can be found on the website and note 24.

The number of options and amount of cash award granted under CAP 2014 to each director is provisional and based on the performance of the respective directors’ 
individual businesses up to the end of the performance period (September 2017). As such the actual number of options and amount of cash award issued is likely to 
be different to the amount disclosed.

There were no cash awards exercised by executive directors during the year. 
The performance conditions of other options held by directors are as follows:
Scheme Maximum opportunity Performance measure Performance target
CAP 2014 No individual could receive an 
award over 5% of the award 
pool. Award pool comprises 
3.5m ordinary shares and cash

proﬁts

 of £178.4m to be achieved by no later than ﬁnancial 
year ending September 30 2017. Secondary performance 
condition – if the primary performance is not met the 
awards will lapse unless adjusted pre-tax proﬁts are at least 
84.9% of the primary target. The number of ordinary shares 
and cash in the award pool will be reduced in accordance 
with the scheme rules. The percentage of awards that would 
vest if the minimum performance test was satisﬁed is 33%.
CSOP 2014 Each CSOP 2014 option enables 
each UK participant to purchase 
up to 2,688 shares and each 
Canadian participant up to 
8,963 shares.
The CSOP 2014 has the same performance criteria as CAP 2014. The number of CSOP 
options that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2014.

The ﬁrst and second tranches of CAP 2010 became 
exercisable in February 2013 and 2014 when the primary 
performance condition was satisﬁed in 2013 and again in 
2014. The options which have not vested are subject to 
an additional performance condition which required the 
proﬁts of each business in the subsequent vesting period to 
be at least 75% of that achieved in the year that the ﬁrst 
tranche became exercisable. The options lapse to the extent 
unexercised by September 2020.
SAYE Participants save a ﬁxed 
monthly amount of up to 
£500 for three years and are 
then able to buy shares in the 
company set at a 20% discount 
to the market value at the start 
of the savings period.
No performance conditions attach to options granted under this plan.

COMPARISON OF OVERALL PERFORMANCE AND REMUNERATION OF THE CEO
The chart below compares the company’s total shareholder return with the FTSE 250 index over the past eight ﬁnancial years. For these purposes 
shareholder return represents the theoretical growth in value of a shareholding over a speciﬁc period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to 
purchase additional shares. The company is a constituent of the FTSE 250 index and, accordingly, this is considered to be an appropriate benchmark.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance ❯ DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF THE CEO
The table below illustrates the change in remuneration for the CEO compared with the change in remuneration of the average employee across the 
group at constant currency. The directors feel that this group of people is the most appropriate as a comparator because employee pay is determined 
annually by the Committee at the same time as that of the CEO and under the same economic circumstances. The directors believe this demonstrates 
the best link between the changes in average remuneration compared to the CEO.

EUROMONEY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR PLC WWW.EUROMONEYPLC.COM REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Committee meets twice a year and additionally as required. It is responsible for determining the contract terms, remuneration and other beneﬁts 
of executive directors, including performance-related incentives. The Committee reviews the remuneration and incentive plans of the executive 
directors and other key employees as well as looking at the remuneration costs and policies of the group as a whole. The Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on the company’s website.
During 2016 the Committee met four times and informal discussions were held at other times during the year.
COMMITTEE MEMBERS
JC Botts (chairman of the committee)
MWH Morgan (retired May 31 2016)
DP Pritchard (independent)
PA Zwillenberg (appointed June 1 2016)
All members of the Committee are non-executive directors of the company. For the year under review, the Committee also sought advice and 
information from the company’s CEO, ﬁnance director and the newly appointed director of human resources. The Committee’s terms of reference 
permit its members to obtain professional advice on any matter. Guidance was sought from Deloitte on structuring A Rashbass’ performance 
measures and objectives for the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP in line with best practice and on benchmarking against an appropriate peer group. They 
were paid £20,800 for this service. Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under the code 
of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. External benchmarking was also undertaken for the remuneration of other 
executive directors and divisional directors. 
The key activities of the Committee in the year included:
 ● approving grant of PSP options to A Rashbass;
 ● obtaining advice and setting suitable performance measures and objectives for the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP for A Rashbass for the 2016 
award;
 ● approving the average annual pay increase for the group, effective from April 1 2016, of 2%; 
 ● approving the salary increase of CR Jones and other divisional directors, which was no more than the average pay increase of 2%, effective from 
April 1 2016;
 ● recommending to the board the fee for JC Botts’ appointment as permanent non-executive chairman of the board. JC Botts was not involved in 
any decision regarding his own fee;
 ● approving the annual proﬁt shares and bonuses for executive directors and divisional directors of the group for ﬁnancial year 2016; and
 ● reviewing and agreeing the design of the reward principles and arrangements for new divisional directors reporting directly to the CEO and 
transition arrangements to allow all existing divisional directors to migrate to the new approach within two years.

Pensions and benefits No change to prior year.
Annual incentive 
Annual Bonus Plan
 
The weightings for the individual and financial objectives for A Rashbass’ Annual Bonus Plan in 2017 will remain 
the same as 2016. The committee considers that disclosing the precise targets, which are commercially sensitive 
of the Annual Bonus Plan would not be in shareholders’ interests and awards made will be published at the end 
of the performance period where possible.
Annual bonus deferral Any amount above target for A Rashbass will be deferred into nil-cost options for two years in line with 2016.
Profit share CR Jones’ profit share scheme is set out on page 48 and will remain the same for 2017.
Long-term incentive The performance measures of awards to be made under the PSP to Andrew Rashbass will be in line with the 
awards granted in 2016. Directors employed in the UK are eligible to participate in the SAYE.
Non-executive  
directors fees
Non-executive directors’ fees will be reviewed.

Non-executive directors: 100% of annual fee 
CEO: 200% of salary 
Finance director: 100% of salary 
Divisional directors: 75% of salary
OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
NF Osborn serves as an advisor to the boards of both DMG Events and dmgi, fellow group companies, for which he received a combined fee of 
US$23,250 (2015: US$18,600). 
DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS 
The company’s policy is to employ executive directors on service agreements which are terminable on 12 months’ notice. The Committee seeks to 
minimise termination payments and believes these should be restricted to the value of remuneration for the notice period. The company’s executive 
directors are employed for an indeﬁnite term and the service agreements provide for a notice period of 12 months from the company and the 
executive. 
With the exception of Sir Patrick Sergeant, none of the non-executive directors has a service contract, although JC Botts, DP Pritchard, TP Hillgarth 
and ART Ballingal serve under a letter of appointment. The service contract of Sir Patrick Sergeant provides for 12 months’ expense allowance and an 
expense allowance up to the date of termination in the event of incapacity.
The directors’ service contracts are available for shareholder inspection at the company’s registered ofﬁce.

THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT AND OUR AREAS OF FOCUS
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements. In particular, we looked 
at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of signiﬁcant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, 
including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, and the risk 
of fraud in revenue recognition. Procedures designed to address these risks included testing of material journal entries and post-close adjustments, 
testing and evaluating management’s key accounting estimates for reasonableness and consistency, understanding and testing management incentive 
plans, undertaking cut-off procedures to test proper cut-off of revenue and expenses and testing the existence and accuracy of revenue transactions.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identiﬁed as 
“areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these speciﬁc areas in order to provide an opinion on 
the ﬁnancial statements as a whole and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identiﬁed by our audit.

CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL AND 
ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 39 and 
to note 12 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The group has £551.1m of goodwill and intangible 
assets, including £148.3m of acquired intangibles 
and £396.1m of goodwill as at September 30 2016. 
During the year, the group recognised a £27.0m 
impairment charge in relation to goodwill for Mining 
Indaba (£12.9m), HedgeFund Intelligence (HFI) 
(£5.9m) and Total Derivatives (£8.2m). The group 
also recognised a £1.7m impairment in relation to 
the acquired intangible assets for Euromoney Indices. 
The carrying values of goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets are contingent on future cash ﬂows 
of the underlying cash generating units (CGUs) 
and there is a risk that if these cash ﬂows do not 
meet management’s expectations the assets will be 
impaired. The cash ﬂow forecasts and related value 
in use calculations include a number of signiﬁcant 
judgements and estimates including proﬁt growth, 
cash conversion, terminal growth rate and discount 
rate. Where fair value less cost of disposal (rather 
than value in use) has been used to value CGUs, 
the related calculations are based on an estimate 
of disposal proceeds where businesses are held for 
sale. Changes in the key assumptions underpinning 
these calculations have a signiﬁcant impact on the 
headroom available in the impairment calculations. 
We obtained management’s goodwill impairment model and tested the reasonableness of 
key assumptions, including revenue, proﬁt and cash ﬂow growth rates, cash conversion, 
terminal values and the selection of discount rates. We agreed the underlying cash ﬂow 
projections to management approved budgets and forecasts and assessed how these 
projections are compiled. Deploying our valuations experts, we assessed the terminal growth 
rate and discount rate applied to each CGU compared with third party information, past 
performance, the group’s cost of capital and relevant risk factors. We evaluated indicative 
offers from third parties where CGUs are held for sale and have therefore been valued on a 
fair value less cost of disposal basis. We performed our own risk assessment by considering 
historical performance and management’s forecasting accuracy by applying any current year 
budget shortfalls to future forecasts to highlight the CGUs with either lower headroom 
or which are more sensitive to changes in key assumptions. We focussed our attention 
on those businesses where headroom has decreased or where management has identiﬁed 
impairments, namely Mining Indaba, HFI, Total Derivatives and Euromoney Indices. 
We performed our own sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of reasonable changes 
in management’s assumptions on the available headroom. We challenged the signiﬁcant 
assumptions, speciﬁcally relating to revenue and proﬁt growth in light of the individual 
CGU’s past performance to assess whether the forecasts are achievable. We focussed in 
particular on the goodwill relating to Ned Davis Research, Inc. (NDR) which is more sensitive 
to change than other CGUs. We considered the need for additional sensitivity disclosures for 
this CGU as required by IAS 36 and we agreed with management’s decision to provide these 
additional disclosures for NDR given that reasonably possible changes in the assumptions 
would give rise to an impairment. 
We checked for any additional impairment triggers in other businesses through discussions 
with management, review of management accounts and board minutes and examining 
performance of recent acquisitions to identify under-performing businesses. 
As a result of our work, we determined that the impairment charge recognised in 2016 was 
appropriate. For those intangible assets, including goodwill, where management determined 
that no impairment was required and that no additional sensitivity disclosures should be 
given, we found that these judgements were supported by reasonable assumptions that 
would require signiﬁcant downside changes before any additional material impairment was 
necessary.

CARRYING VALUE OF INVESTMENTS
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 39 and 
to note 14 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The group has £35.8m of investments including 
£29.8m of investment in associates, £0.2m of 
investment in joint ventures and £5.8m of available-
for-sale investments. 
We focussed on the group’s investment in Diamond 
TopCo Limited (Dealogic) and the key accounting 
judgements taken by management in relation to this 
investment, namely:
 ● The assessment of the recoverability of the 
investment; and
 ● Consideration of the ongoing judgement that the 
investment in Dealogic should be accounted for 
as an associate on the basis of the group having 
signiﬁcant inﬂuence.
We obtained management’s impairment model and tested the reasonableness of key 
assumptions, including revenue, proﬁt and cash ﬂow growth rates, terminal value and the 
selection of discount rate. We engaged directly with Dealogic management to understand 
key performance trends and the basis for future projections. We reviewed Dealogic’s 
quarterly trading history in order to determine any impairment indicators and to evaluate 
historical accuracy of budgeting. We agreed Euromoney management’s base case cash ﬂow 
projections to Dealogic’s board approved budgets. We assessed Euromoney management’s 
downside case projections utilised for impairment review purposes. We deployed our 
valuations experts to assess the terminal growth rate and discount rate applied by Euromoney 
management compared with third party information, past performance, the group’s cost 
of capital and relevant risk factors. Even based on Euromoney management’s downwards 
adjusted cash ﬂow projections, we noted that the carrying value of the investment was 
supportable. Management’s assumptions would require signiﬁcant downside changes 
before any material impairment was necessary. 
We assessed management’s judgement regarding classiﬁcation of Dealogic as an associate 
and the extent to which the group is able to exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence. We agreed the key 
terms of Euromoney’s relationship with Dealogic to the shareholders’ agreement and articles 
of association, including shareholder voting rights of 20% and how these are enforceable, 
and we validated management’s attendance and exercise of signiﬁcant inﬂuence at 
Dealogic board meetings. We were satisﬁed that it remains appropriate to equity account 
for Dealogic as an associate given the group’s ongoing exercise of signiﬁcant inﬂuence.
UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 39 
and to notes 8 and 22 to the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements.
The group operates in a complex multinational tax 
environment in relation to direct and indirect taxes 
and there are a number of open tax matters with 
tax authorities, especially in the UK, US and Canada. 
From time to time the group enters into transactions 
with complicated accounting and tax consequences 
and judgement is required in assessing the level 
of provisions needed in respect of uncertain tax 
positions.
In addition, the group recorded an additional 
provision amounting to £7.9m relating to a potential 
US sales tax exposure based on an adverse court 
ruling in June 2016. 
We evaluated management’s judgements in respect of estimates of tax exposures and 
contingencies in order to assess the adequacy of the group’s tax provisions.
In understanding and evaluating management’s judgements, we deployed our tax specialists 
and considered third party tax advice received by the group, the status of recent and current 
tax authority audits and enquiries, the outturn of previous claims, judgemental positions 
taken in tax returns and current year estimates and developments in the tax environment.
We undertook an independent assessment of tax risks, including permanent establishment 
risks in the group’s most material markets (UK, US and Canada) and we evaluated the 
appropriateness and completeness of related tax provisions.
In particular, we focussed on management’s assessment of the open US sales tax inquiry 
for which an additional provision of £7.9m has been recorded in 2016. We independently 
conﬁrmed and discussed this matter directly with the group’s external legal adviser and we 
are satisﬁed with the position taken.
From the evidence obtained, we considered the level of provisioning for direct and indirect 
taxes to be acceptable in the context of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements taken as a 
whole.

PENSIONS
Refer to note 27 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The company operates the Metal Bulletin Pension 
Scheme (MBPS) and participates in the Harmsworth 
Pension Scheme (HPS), which is a group scheme 
operated by Daily Mail and General Trust plc (DMGT), 
both of which are now closed to new participants. 
As at September 30 2016, the group recognised 
a net deﬁned beneﬁt liability of £10.0m (2015: 
£2.0m), which has increased mainly due to a 
decrease in discount rate along with the recognition 
of the group’s share (£1.2m) of an additional 
pension scheme. Previously, HPS was accounted for 
in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a deﬁned 
contribution scheme as DMGT did not have a policy 
of allocating the net deﬁned beneﬁt scheme deﬁcit 
to other DMGT group entities. However, due to a 
change in DMGT’s policy at year-end, Euromoney’s 
share of the underlying assets and liabilities has now 
been recognised. There is management judgement 
inherent in the assumptions selected to value the 
liabilities of both deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. 
We considered management’s IAS 19 assumptions used in determining the net deﬁned 
beneﬁt liability as at September 30 2016 by deploying our pension experts to test the 
reasonableness of key assumptions, including discount rate, RPI inﬂation rate and CPI 
inﬂation rate, by considering the methods and inputs used in determining the assumptions 
compared to market comparisons. We also tested the existence and valuation of the plan 
assets at year-end through direct conﬁrmations with investment managers. We tested 
the underlying census data and validated that no new participants joined the HPS and 
MBPS schemes during the year and that any movements were veriﬁed to supporting 
documentation. As a result of our work, we concluded that the assumptions used in 
determining the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability were within our expected range. 
We evaluated management’s accounting treatment for the recognition of the Harmsworth 
Pension Scheme in 2016 and we note that management has treated the recognition of 
Euromoney’s share of the scheme as a past service cost which has been charged to the 
consolidated income statement. We considered this approach to be appropriate and 
supportable.

PRESENTATION OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 38 and 
to note 5 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The group continues to present adjusted earnings 
by making adjustments for costs and proﬁts which 
management believes to be exceptional by virtue of 
their size and incidence.
During the year, the group presented £37.3m of 
net costs as exceptional items, comprising: goodwill 
and acquired intangible asset impairment charges 
(£28.6m); provision for US sales tax (£7.9m); 
restructuring and other exceptional costs (£6.5m); 
recognition of the Harmsworth deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme (£1.2m); offset by proﬁt on disposal of 
businesses (£7.1m).
Given that the group presents adjusted earnings 
measures in addition to its statutory results, we 
focussed on the classiﬁcation of these items as 
exceptional in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, 
particularly considering the nature of such items, 
whether they are non-recurring and whether they 
are signiﬁcant in size.
We considered the appropriateness of the adjustments made to statutory proﬁt measures 
to derive adjusted proﬁt measures. We understood management’s rationale for classifying 
items as exceptional and considered whether this is reasonable and appropriate in arriving 
at an adjusted proﬁt measure for 2016. 
We considered the goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges. Due to the 
size and nature of these impairments, we accepted management’s presentation of these 
items as exceptional.
We considered the provision for US sales taxes to be exceptional by nature of its size and 
recognising that the additional provision taken in 2016 all relates to prior periods.
We considered the appropriateness of the restructuring costs determined to be exceptional 
and, on the basis that they all relate to a series of linked initiatives underpinning one-
off strategic changes implemented by the group in 2016, we accepted management’s 
presentation of these items as exceptional. We conﬁrmed that restructuring costs not 
associated with this major restructuring programme have not been treated as exceptional 
and have continued to be charged within (rather than excluded from) the group’s adjusted 
proﬁt measures.
Similarly, the recognition of the Harmsworth deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme for the ﬁrst 
time in 2016 was triggered by a one-off change in accounting policy and will not recur and 
was accepted as being exceptional on this basis. We were satisﬁed that excluding the one-
off proﬁt on disposal of businesses from adjusted proﬁt was consistent with the group’s 
historical practice and demonstrates an even handed approach to adjusting for credits as 
well as debits in arriving at an adjusted proﬁt measure.
We considered the appropriateness and transparency of the disclosures in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements regarding the nature of the reconciling items between statutory and 
adjusted proﬁt measures, especially in the context of the principle that ﬁnancial reporting as 
a whole should be fair, balanced and understandable. 
As a result of our work, we determined that the classiﬁcation of exceptional items was 
appropriate, that the group’s policy in this area has been consistently applied and that the 
rationale for including or excluding items from adjusted proﬁt has been consistently applied 
across gains and losses.
HOW WE TAILORED THE AUDIT SCOPE
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the group operates. 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are a consolidation of 183 reporting units, each of which is considered to be a component. We identiﬁed ﬁve 
components in the US, Canada and UK that required a full scope audit due to size. For a further three components in the US, UK and India, speciﬁc 
audit procedures over signiﬁcant balances and transactions were performed to give appropriate audit coverage. None of the components not included 
in our group audit scope individually contributed more than 5% to consolidated revenue or 8% to statutory proﬁt before tax, adjusted for certain 
non-recurring items.
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the components by us, as 
the group audit team, or by component auditors within PwC UK and from other PwC network ﬁrms operating under our instruction. Where the work 
was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components to be 
able to conclude whether sufﬁcient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
as a whole.
We performed full scope audits in respect of Euromoney Trading Limited (UK), Euromoney Global Limited (UK), BCA Research, Inc. (Canada), 
Institutional Investor, Inc. (US) and Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC (UK) (the parent company) which, in our view, were ﬁnancially signiﬁcant and 
required a full scope audit due to their size. 
63
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Group accounts ❯ INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 24992.04 – 16 December 2016 4:22 PM – Proof 6
We performed speciﬁed procedures at Ned Davis Research, Inc. (US) over revenue and receivables (including accrued and deferred revenue), ISI India 
over cash and Tipall Limited (UK) over property, plant and equipment. This ensured that appropriate audit procedures were performed to achieve 
sufﬁcient coverage over these ﬁnancial statement line items.
In addition to instructing and reviewing the reporting from our component audit teams, we conducted visits to our full scope components in the 
US and Canada, which included ﬁle reviews and attendance at key audit meetings with local management. We also had regular dialogue with all 
component teams throughout the year.
The group consolidation, ﬁnancial statement disclosures and corporate functions were audited by the group audit team. This included our work over 
goodwill and intangible assets, acquisitions and disposals, treasury, post-retirement beneﬁts, share-based payments and tax.
Taken together, the components and corporate functions where we conducted audit procedures accounted for approximately 75% of the group’s 
revenue, 76% of the group’s statutory proﬁt before tax and 91% of the group’s statutory proﬁt before tax, adjusted for certain non-recurring items. 
This provided the evidence we needed for our opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole. This was before considering the 
contribution to our audit evidence from performing audit work at the group level, including disaggregated analytical review procedures, which covers 
certain of the group’s smaller and lower risk components that were not directly included in our group audit scope.
MATERIALITY
The scope of our audit was inﬂuenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
ﬁnancial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the ﬁnancial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the ﬁnancial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £4.1m (2015: £4.3m)
How we determined it 5% of statutory proﬁt before tax of £43.9m, adjusted for certain non-recurring items comprising the 
exceptional items identiﬁed in note 5 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and amounting to £37.3m. 
Rationale for benchmark applied The group’s principal measure of earnings comprises adjusted operating proﬁt, which adjusts statutory 
proﬁt for a number of income and expenditure items. Management uses this measure as it believes that 
it eliminates the volatility inherent in non-recurring items. We have taken this measure into account in 
determining our materiality, except that we have not adjusted proﬁt before tax to add back amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets, share of results in associates and joint ventures or net ﬁnance costs as in our 
view these are recurring items which do not introduce volatility to the group’s earnings.
Component materiality For each component in our audit scope, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £0.1m and £3.7m.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identiﬁed during our audit above £0.2m (2015: £0.2m) as well 
as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
GOING CONCERN
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review the directors’ statement set out on page 43 in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial 
statements. The going concern basis presumes that the group and the company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
directors intend them to remain in operation, for at least one year from the date the ﬁnancial statements were signed. As part of our audit, we have 
concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s and company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

CONSISTENCY OF OTHER INFORMATION
COMPANIES ACT 2006 OPINION
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
ISAS (UK & IRELAND) REPORTING
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 ● Information in the Annual Report is:
 — materially inconsistent with the information in the audited ﬁnancial statements; or
 — apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group 
and company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 — otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report.
The statement given by the directors on page 45, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess the group’s and company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the 
group and the company acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
The section of the Annual Report on pages 37 and 38, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee.
We have no exceptions to report.
THE DIRECTORS’ ASSESSMENT OF THE PROSPECTS OF THE GROUP AND OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS THAT WOULD 
THREATEN THE SOLVENCY OR LIQUIDITY OF THE GROUP 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 ● the directors’ conﬁrmation on page 45 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the 
Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
 ● the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or 
mitigated.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
 ● the directors’ explanation on page 20 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and 
why they consider that period to be appropriate and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualiﬁcations or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and 
only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements, checking that the statements are in alignment 
with the relevant provisions of the Code and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE OF THE DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 44 and 45, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the 
ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 ● whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
 ● the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
 ● the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and 
evaluating the disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis 
for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by 
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the implications 
for our report.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
GENERAL INFORMATION 
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC (the ‘company’) is a company 
incorporated in the United Kingdom (UK). 
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company and 
its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘group’) and equity account 
the group’s interest in associates and joint ventures. The parent company 
financial statements present information about the entity and not about 
its group. 
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by 
the directors in accordance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) adopted for use in the European Union and, therefore, 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The company has elected 
to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with 
Financial Reporting Standard 102. 
Judgements made by the directors in the application of those accounting 
policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements, and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, 
are discussed in note 2. 
Certain changes to IFRS will be applicable to the group financial 
statements in future years. Set out below are those which are considered 
to be most relevant to the group.
RELEVANT NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND 
INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT EFFECTIVE SUBSEQUENT 
TO THE YEAR END: 
 ● IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – subject to EU endorsement, the expected 
mandatory effective date of implementation is January 1 2018
 ● IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ – subject to EU 
endorsement, the expected mandatory effective date of implementation 
is January 1 2018
 ● IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – subject to EU endorsement, the expected mandatory 
effective date of implementation is January 1 2019
 ● Amendments to IAS 38 on Intangible Assets
 ● Annual Improvements 2012–2014 Cycle
The directors are still assessing the impact of these standards but do not 
expect there to be a material impact on the financial statements of the 
group.
BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
except for certain financial instruments which have been measured at 
fair value. The accounting policies set out below have been applied 
consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements. 
Having assessed the principal risks and the other matters discussed 
in connection with the viability statement, the directors consider it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
this Annual Report.
Current income tax balances for 2015 have been re-presented to reflect 
a reclassification from assets to liabilities amounting to £1.8m. These 
reclassifications have no impact on net assets. 
Deferred income balances have been re-presented to reflect a 
reclassification of deferred income of £6m from current assets to non-
current assets. These reclassifications have no impact on net assets.
(A) SUBSIDIARIES 
The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the company 
and entities controlled by the company (its ‘subsidiaries’). The group 
controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. 
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on 
transactions between group companies are eliminated. 
The group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for 
business combinations. The amount recognised as consideration by 
the group equates to the fair value of the assets, liabilities and equity 
acquired by the group plus contingent consideration (should there 
be any such arrangement). Acquisition related costs are expensed as 
incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at 
their fair values at acquisition. The group recognises any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree at fair value.
To the extent the consideration (including the assumed contingent 
consideration) provided by the acquirer is greater than the fair value 
of the assets and liabilities, this amount is recognised as goodwill. 
Goodwill also incorporates the amount of any non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity 
interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets acquired. If this consideration is lower than the 
fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is 
recognised as ‘negative goodwill’ directly in the Income Statement. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the 
end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the group 
reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting 
is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period, or additional asset and liabilities are recognised 
to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that 
existed as of the date of the acquisition that, if known, would have 
affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition 
to the date the group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is a maximum 
of one year.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
PARTIAL ACQUISITIONS – CONTROL UNAFFECTED 
Where the group acquires an additional interest in an entity in which 
a controlling interest is already held, the consideration paid for the 
additional interest is reflected within movements in equity as a reduction 
in non-controlling interests. No goodwill is recognised. 
STEP ACQUISITIONS – CONTROL PASSES TO THE GROUP 
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, at the stage at 
which control passes to the group, the previously held interest is treated 
as if it had been disposed of, along with the consideration paid for the 
controlling interest in the subsidiary. The fair value of the previously held 
interest then forms one of the components that is used to calculate 
goodwill, along with the consideration and the non-controlling interest 
less the fair value of identifiable net assets. The consideration paid for 
the earlier stages of a step acquisition, before control passes to the 
group, is treated as an investment in an associate.
(B) TRANSACTIONS WITH NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS 
Transactions with non-controlling interests in the net assets of 
consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately and included in the 
group’s equity. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those 
interests at the date of the original business combination and its share of 
changes in equity since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive 
income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the 
non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
(C) INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the group and 
other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint 
control, that is, when the strategic financial and operating policy 
decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the 
parties sharing control. 
An associate is an entity over which the group has significant influence 
and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint 
control over those policies. 
The post-tax results of joint ventures and associates are incorporated in 
the group’s results using the equity method of accounting. Under the 
equity method, investments in joint ventures and associates are carried 
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost as adjusted 
for post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of the net assets of 
the joint venture and associates, less any impairment in the value of 
the investment. Losses of joint ventures and associates in excess of the 
group’s interest in that joint venture or associate are not recognised. 
Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to 
the extent that the group has incurred legal or constructive obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate. 
Losses of joint ventures and associates in excess of the group’s interest 
in that joint venture or associate are not recognised. Additional losses 
are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the 
group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments 
on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s share of the net 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the joint venture or associate recognised at the date of acquisition 
is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying 
amount of the investment. 
FOREIGN CURRENCIES 
FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY 
The functional and presentation currency of Euromoney Institutional 
Investor PLC and its UK subsidiaries, other than Fantfoot Limited, 
Centre for Investor Education (UK) Limited and Redquince Limited, is 
sterling. The functional currency of other subsidiaries, associates, joint 
ventures and available-for-sale investments is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which they operate. 
TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on foreign 
currency borrowings and derivative instruments, to the extent that they 
are used to provide a hedge against the group’s equity investments in 
overseas undertakings, are taken to equity together with the exchange 
difference arising on the net investment in those undertakings. All other 
exchange differences are taken to the Income Statement. 
On consolidation exchange differences arising from the translations of 
the net investment in foreign entities and borrowings and other currency 
instruments designated as hedges such as investments are taken to 
shareholders’ equity. The group treats specific inter-company loan 
balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, 
as part of its net investment.
GROUP COMPANIES 
The Income Statements of overseas operations are translated into 
sterling at the weighted average exchange rates for the year and their 
balance sheets are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date. All exchange differences arising on consolidation 
are taken to equity. In the event of the disposal of an operation, the 
related cumulative translation differences are recognised in the Income 
Statement in the period of disposal. 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-
line basis over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: 
Freehold land do not depreciate 
Freehold buildings 2%
Long-term leasehold premises over term of lease
Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease
Office equipment 11% – 33%

INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
GOODWILL 
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration 
over the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured 
at cost less accumulated impairment. For the purposes of impairment 
testing, goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units that have 
benefited from the acquisition. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for 
which there are separately identifiable cash flows. The carrying value of 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or where there is 
an indication that goodwill may be impaired. If the recoverable amount 
of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, then the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit 
on a pro rata basis. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
Income Statement and may not subsequently be reversed. On disposal of 
a subsidiary undertaking, the attributable amount of goodwill is included 
in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on foreign subsidiary investments held in the 
consolidated balance sheet are retranslated into sterling at the applicable 
period end exchange rates. Any exchange differences arising are taken 
directly to equity as part of the retranslation of the net assets of the 
subsidiary. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has 
been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts having been tested 
for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK 
GAAP before October 1 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included 
in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
INTERNALLY GENERATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the group’s software 
and systems development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
 ● An asset is created that can be identiﬁed (such as software or a website);
 ● It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic 
beneﬁts; and
 ● The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are recognised at cost and 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful lives from the date the 
asset becomes usable. Where no internally generated intangible asset 
can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense 
in the period in which it is incurred.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
For all other intangible assets, the group initially makes an assessment 
of their fair value at acquisition. An intangible asset will be recognised 
as long as the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal 
rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably. 
Subsequent to acquisition, amortisation is charged so as to write off the 
costs of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, using 
a straight-line or reducing balance method. These intangible assets are 
reviewed for impairment as described below. 
These intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. 
AMORTISATION 
Amortisation of intangible assets is provided on a reducing balance basis 
or straight-line basis as appropriate over their expected useful lives at the 
following rates per year: 
Trademarks and brands 5 – 30 years 
Customer relationships 1 – 16 years 
Databases 1 – 22 years 
Licences and software 3 – 5 years 
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or 
intangible assets not ready to use – are not subject to amortisation 
and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to 
amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell or value in 
use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the 
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash 
generating units). Non-financial assets, other than goodwill, that suffer 
impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each 
reporting date. 
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount, 
less provision for impairment. A provision is made and charged to the 
Income Statement when there is objective evidence that the group will 
not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance to the original 
terms. More information on impairment is included in the impairment of 
financial assets section below.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash, short-term deposits and other 
short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three 
months or less. 
For the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash 
equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

FINANCIAL ASSETS 
The group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the 
purpose for which the assets were acquired. Management determines 
the classification of its assets on initial recognition and re-evaluates this 
designation at every reporting date. Financial assets in the following 
categories are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 
12 months; otherwise, they are classified as non-current.
CLASSIFICATION 
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets 
held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated 
by management. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges.
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The 
group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and 
cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. 
Available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets 
AFS financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this 
category or not classified in any of the other categories. 
RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT 
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the 
date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. The 
group derecognises financial assets when it ceases to be a party to such 
arrangements. All financial assets, other than those carried at fair value 
through profit or loss, are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction 
costs. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss 
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially 
recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the profit 
and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Gains 
and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets 
at fair value through profit or loss category’ are included in the profit 
and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the 
period in which they arise. Dividend income from assets, categorised as 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, is recognised in the 
profit and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
as part of other income when the group’s right to receive payments is 
established. 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. 
Available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets 
AFS financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value where it can 
be measured reliably. AFS equity investments that do not have a quoted 
market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably 
measured are measured at cost less any identified impairment losses.
OFFSETTING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in 
the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or 
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 
The group assesses at each reporting period whether there is objective 
evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A 
financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment 
losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a 
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition 
of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact 
on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of 
financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
The criteria that the group uses to determine that there is objective 
evidence of an impairment loss include: 
 ● signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculty of the issuer or obligor; 
 ● a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or 
principal payments; 
 ● the group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower’s 
ﬁnancial difﬁculty, granting to the borrower a concession that the 
lender would not otherwise consider; 
 ● it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other 
ﬁnancial reorganisation;
 ● the disappearance of an active market for that ﬁnancial asset because 
of ﬁnancial difﬁculties; or 
 ● observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the 
estimate of future cash ﬂows from a portfolio of ﬁnancial assets since 
the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot 
yet be identiﬁed with the individual ﬁnancial assets in the portfolio, 
including: 
i. adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio; 
and 
ii. national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults 
on the assets in the portfolio.

CONTINUED
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
The group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists. 
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted 
at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The asset’s carrying 
amount is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the profit 
and loss component of the Statement of Comprehensive Income. If a 
loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any 
impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under 
the contract. 
If the asset’s carrying amount is reduced, the amount of the loss is 
recognised in the profit and loss component of the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases 
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after 
the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s 
credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss 
is recognised in the profit and loss component of the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. 
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
RECOGNITION
Financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument. The group 
derecognises financial liabilities when it ceases to be a party to such 
provisions.
COMMITTED BORROWINGS AND BANK OVERDRAFTS 
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the amounts 
received, net of direct issue costs. Direct issue costs are amortised over 
the period of the loans and overdrafts to which they relate. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are 
charged to the Income Statement as incurred using the effective interest 
rate method and are added to the carrying value of the borrowings or 
overdraft to the extent they are not settled in the period in which they 
arise. 
TRADE PAYABLES AND ACCRUALS
Trade payables and accruals are not interest-bearing and are stated at 
their fair value.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its 
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks, including forward 
foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps. 
All derivative instruments are recorded in the Statement of Financial 
Position at fair value. The recognition of gains or losses on derivative 
instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated as a 
hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge. The group 
designates certain derivatives as either: 
a. hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm 
commitment (fair value hedge);
b. hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or 
liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
c. hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment 
hedge). 
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current 
asset or liability when the derivative matures in more than 12 months, 
and as a current asset or liability when the derivative matures in less 
than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or 
liability. Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Income 
Statement as they arise. 
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify 
as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income Statement, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are 
attributable to the hedged risk. The group only applies fair value hedge 
accounting for hedging fixed interest risk on borrowings. The gain or 
loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging fixed 
rate borrowings is recognised in the Income Statement within ‘finance 
costs’. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in 
the Income Statement within ‘operating profit’. Changes in the fair value 
of the hedge fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are 
recognised in the Income Statement within ‘finance costs’.
Cash flow hedge 
The effective portion of gains or losses on derivatives that are designated 
and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive 
income within the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The ineffective 
portion of such gains and losses is recognised in the Income Statement 
immediately. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement 
in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income 
Statement (for example, when the forecast transaction that is hedged 
takes place). 
The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps 
hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in the Income Statement 
accordingly, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised in the Income Statement immediately. However, whenever 
the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of 
a non-financial asset (for example, fixed assets), the gains and losses 
previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in 
the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts 
are ultimately recognised in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.

EUROMONEY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR PLC WWW.EUROMONEYPLC.COM 24992.04 – 16 December 2016 4:22 PM – Proof 6
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or 
loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income 
Statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
transferred to the Income Statement. 
Net investment hedge 
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in the 
same way as cash flow hedges. 
Gains or losses on the qualifying part of net investment hedges are 
recognised in other comprehensive income together with the gains and 
losses on the underlying net investment. The ineffective portion of such 
gains and losses is recognised in the Income Statement immediately. 
The group does not hedge the translation of the results of foreign 
subsidiaries. Fluctuations in the value of sterling versus foreign currencies 
could materially affect the amount of these items in the consolidated 
financial statements, even if their values have not changed in their 
original currency. The group does endeavour to match foreign currency 
borrowings to investments in order to provide a natural hedge for the 
translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries. 
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are transferred to the Income 
Statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. 
LIABILITIES IN RESPECT OF ACQUISITION COMMITMENTS AND 
DEFERRED CONSIDERATION
Liabilities for acquisition commitments over the remaining minority 
interests in subsidiaries and deferred consideration are recorded in the 
Statement of Financial Position at their estimated discounted present 
value. These discounts are unwound and charged to the Income 
Statement as notional interest over the period up to the date of the 
potential future payment. 
TAXATION 
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is 
recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at 
amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of IAS 12 ‘Income 
Tax’ and is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases 
used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. No provision 
is made for temporary differences on unremitted earnings of foreign 
subsidiaries or associates where the group has control and the reversal of 
the temporary difference is not foreseeable.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the 
asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged 
or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the group intends to settle its current assets and liabilities 
on a net basis. 
Actual tax liabilities or refunds may differ from those anticipated due to 
changes in tax legislation, differing interpretations of tax legislation and 
uncertainties surrounding the application of tax legislation. In situations 
where uncertainties exist, provision is made for contingent tax liabilities 
and assets when it is more likely than not that there will be a cash impact. 
These provisions are made for each uncertainty individually on the basis 
of management judgement following consideration of the available 
relevant information. The measurement basis adopted represents the 
best predictor of the resolution of the uncertainty which is usually based 
on the most likely cash outflow. The company reviews the adequacy of 
these provisions at the end of each reporting period and adjusts them 
based on changing facts and circumstances. The group does not consider 
detection risk when making its estimates. 
PROVISIONS 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, 
and it is probable that economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation. If material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the 
risks specific to the liability. 
PENSIONS 
Contributions to pension schemes in respect of current and past service, 
ex-gratia pensions, and cost of living adjustments to existing pensions 
are based on the advice of independent actuaries. 
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS 
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays 
fixed contributions into a separate non-group related entity. Payments 
to the Euromoney Pension Plan and the Metal Bulletin Group Personal 
Pension Plan, both defined contribution pension schemes, are charged 
as an expense as they fall due.

Multi-employer scheme
The group also participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, a defined 
benefit pension scheme which is operated by Daily Mail and General 
Trust plc. Up to September 30 2016 there was no contractual agreement 
or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for the plan 
as a whole to the individual entities, the group recognised an expense 
equal to its contributions payable in the period and did not recognise any 
unfunded liability of this pension scheme on its balance sheet. In other 
words, this scheme was treated as a defined contribution plan. However, 
due to a change in policy by DMGT the assets and liabilities of the DMGT 
group’s defined benefit plan have been allocated on a buy-out basis at 
September 30 2016.
DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS 
Defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an 
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more 
factors such as age, years of service and compensation. 
The liability recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect 
of the defined benefit pension plan is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value 
of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected credit method. The present 
value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to 
the terms of the related pension obligation. The actuarial valuations are 
obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur. 
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The group makes share-based payments to certain employees which are 
equity and cash-settled. These payments are measured at their estimated 
fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option 
pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest. At the end of each period the 
vesting assumptions are revisited and the charge associated with the fair 
value of these options updated. For cash-settled share-based payments a 
liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised at the 
current fair value as determined at each balance sheet date. 
REVENUE 
Revenue represents income from advertising, subscriptions, sponsorship 
and delegate fees, net of value added tax. 
 ● Advertising revenues are recognised in the Income Statement on the 
date of publication. 
 ● Subscription revenues are recognised in the Income Statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the subscription.  Subscription 
revenues contains certain items recognised on a cash basis including 
voting revenues where the amount paid by the customer is determined 
by a qualitative vote and paid in arrears for services rendered, and 
best efforts revenues where the payments for services rendered are 
uncertain until received. 
 ● Sponsorship and delegate revenues are recognised in the Income 
Statement over the period the event is run. 
Revenues invoiced but relating to future periods are deferred and treated 
as deferred income in the Statement of Financial Position. 
LEASED ASSETS 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership 
are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Operating 
lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis 
as allowed by IAS 17 ‘Leases’. 
DIVIDENDS 
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are 
approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded 
in the period in which they are paid. 
OWN SHARES HELD BY EMPLOYEES’ SHARE OWNERSHIP 
TRUST AND EMPLOYEES SHARE TRUST
Transactions of the group-sponsored trusts are included in the group 
financial statements. In particular, the trusts’ holdings of shares in the 
company are debited direct to equity. The group provides finance to the 
trusts to purchase company shares to meet the obligation to provide 
shares when employees exercise their options or awards. Costs of 
running the trusts are charged to the Income Statement. Shares held by 
the trusts are deducted from other reserves.
EARNINGS PER SHARE 
The earnings per share and diluted earnings per share calculations 
follow the provisions of IAS 33 ‘Earnings Per Share’. The diluted earnings 
per share figure is calculated by adjusting for the dilution effect of the 
exercise of all ordinary share options, SAYE options and the Capital 
Appreciation Plan options granted by the company, but excluding the 
ordinary shares held by the Euromoney Employees’ Share Ownership 
Trust and Euromoney Employee Share Trust. 
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 
Exceptional items are items of income or expense considered by the 
directors, either individually or if of a similar type in aggregate, as being 
significant and which require additional disclosure in order to provide 
an indication of the underlying trading performance of the group. Such 
items could include, but may not be limited to, costs associated with 
business combinations, one-off gains and losses on the disposal of 
businesses and properties, one-off reorganisation or restructuring costs 
associated with major restructuring programmes, and impairment of 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets.

SEGMENT REPORTING 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the board and executive committee members who 
are responsible for strategic decisions, allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments. 
2 KEY JUDGEMENTAL AREAS ADOPTED IN PREPARING 
THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often 
required in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, 
accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect 
the reported results or net asset position of the group should it later be 
determined that a different choice would have been more appropriate. 
Management considers the accounting estimates and assumptions 
discussed below to be its key judgemental areas and accordingly provides 
an explanation of each below. Management has discussed its critical 
accounting estimates and associated disclosures with the group’s audit 
committee. The discussion below should be read in conjunction with the 
group’s disclosure of accounting policies in note 1. 
ACQUISITIONS
The purchase consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary or business 
is allocated over the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired with any excess consideration representing 
goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired requires significant estimates and assumptions. The 
group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of a business at fair 
value at the date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values 
is based upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions on 
the timing and amount of future cash flows generated by the assets and 
the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Additionally, management 
must estimate the expected useful lives of intangibles assets and charge 
amortisation on the assets accordingly.
ACQUISITION COMMITMENTS 
The group is party to put and call options over the remaining non-
controlling interests in some of its subsidiaries. IAS  32 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Presentation’ requires the discounted present value of 
these acquisition commitments to be recognised as a liability on the 
Statement of Financial Position with a corresponding decrease in 
reserves. Each period end management reassesses the amount expected 
to be paid and any changes to the initial amount are recognised as a 
finance income or expense in the Income Statement. The discounts 
are unwound as a notional interest charge to the Income Statement. 
Key areas of judgement in calculating the discounted present value of 
these commitments are the expected future cash flows and earnings of 
the business, the period remaining until the option is exercised and the 
discount rate. At September 30 2016, the discounted present value of 
these acquisition commitments was £11.8m (2015: £9.2m)
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES IMPAIRMENT
Goodwill is impaired where the carrying value of goodwill is higher than 
the net present value of future cash flows of those cash generating units 
to which it relates. Key areas of judgement in calculating the net present 
value are the forecast cash flows, the long-term growth rate of the 
applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows. 
Goodwill held on the Statement of Financial Position at September 30 
2016 was £396.1m (2015: £382.0m).
INVESTMENTS
Investments are impaired where the carrying value of an investment is 
higher than the net present value of the future cash flows. Key areas 
of judgement in calculating the net present value are the forecast cash 
flows, the long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and the 
discount rate applied to those cash flows. Investments held on the 
Statement of Financial Position at September 30 2016 was £35.9m 
(2015: £38.3m). 
TAXATION 
The group’s tax expense on profit is the sum of the total current and 
deferred tax expense. The calculation of the group’s total tax charge 
necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect 
of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined 
until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as 
appropriate, through a formal legal process. The final resolution of some 
of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and/or cash flow 
variances. 
The group is a multinational with tax affairs in many geographical 
locations. This inherently leads to complexity in the group’s tax structure 
and makes the degree of estimation and judgement challenging. The 
resolution of issues is not always within the control of the group and it 
is often dependent on the efficiency of the legislative processes in the 
relevant taxing jurisdictions in which the group operates. Issues can, and 
often do, take many years to resolve. Payments in respect of tax liabilities 
for an accounting period include payments on account and depend on 
the final resolution of open items. As a result, there can be substantial 
differences between the tax expense in the Income Statement and tax 
payments. 
The group has significant open items in several tax jurisdictions and as 
a result the amounts recognised in the group financial statements in 
respect of these items are derived from the group’s best estimation and 
judgement. However, the inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of 
these items means eventual resolution could differ from the accounting 
estimates and therefore affect the group’s results and cash flows. 
The group considers each uncertain tax matter on the technical merits 
of the case in law, taking into account all relevant evidence, including 
the known attitude of tax authorities in making an assessment of the 
likelihood a matter will crystallise. The uncertain tax provisions are 
calculated by determining the single most likely cash flow for each issue 
rather than by applying a probability threshold and this methodology has 
been applied consistently year-on-year.

2 KEY JUDGEMENTAL AREAS ADOPTED IN PREPARING 
THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
DIRECT TAX
There are two main areas of direct tax risk within the group as follows:
 ● Permanent establishment risk: the group operates in multiple 
jurisdictions and has internationally mobile employees. There is a risk 
that operating activities could inadvertently create a taxable presence 
in countries where the group does not have an entity. The group 
proactively manages this risk and has a transfer pricing policy in place 
for intercompany transactions. It held an uncertain tax provision at 
September 30 2016 of £2.6m (2015: £2.9m) in respect of this risk.
 ● Challenges by tax authorities: where arrangements that have been 
adopted on the basis of professional advice are challenged by tax 
authorities and there is an expectation that there is more likely than 
not to be a cash outﬂow, this risk is provided for. The group held a 
provision in respect of this risk at September 30 2016 of £9.9m (2015: 
£9.8m). The group had been challenged on: whether certain business 
disposals should give rise to capital gains; a number of internal 
ﬁnancing arrangements between different jurisdictions that give rise 
to asymmetrical tax outcomes; and whether tax deductions taken for 
costs arising within the group’s treasury function are permissible. 
The maximum potential additional exposure for the group in relation 
to uncertain tax positions not provided for is approximately £22m if 
all cases were to be settled at the maximum potential liability. Given 
the number of discrete exposures this relates to and the nature of the 
uncertainties involved, the probability of this maximum outflow outcome 
arising is very remote.
INDIRECT TAX
At September 30 2016, an incremental provision of £7.9m (including 
interest) was recognised as an exceptional item (note 5) increasing the 
group’s provisions, including interest, to £9.5m. These uncertain tax 
positions represent the maximum estimated liability in relation to a 
potential overseas sales tax exposure based on an adverse tax ruling.
In addition, the group has gone through a process of reviewing and 
assessing indirect tax exposure across the group in the year and a further 
£4.2m provision is the group’s best estimate of the most probable 
outflow relating to these exposures.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES
The surplus or deficit in the defined benefit pension scheme that is 
recognised through the Statement of Comprehensive Income is subject 
to a number of assumptions and uncertainties. The calculated liabilities 
of the scheme are based on assumptions regarding salary increases, 
inflation rates, discount rates, the long-term expected return on the 
scheme’s assets and member longevity. Details of the assumptions used 
are shown in note 27. Such assumptions are based on actuarial advice 
and are benchmarked against similar pension schemes.
PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE
The directors believe that the adjusted profit and earnings per share 
measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on 
evaluating the performance of the business. These measures are 
consistent with how business performance is measured internally. The 
adjusted profit before tax measure is not a recognised profit measure 
under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit 
measures used by other companies. Adjusted figures are presented before 
the impact of amortisation of acquired intangible assets (comprising 
trademarks and brands, databases and customer relationships), 
exceptional items, share of acquired intangibles amortisation and 
exceptional items, tax in associates and joint ventures, and net 
movements in deferred consideration and acquisition commitments. In 
respect of earnings, adjusted amounts reflect a tax rate that includes 
the current tax effect of the goodwill and intangible assets. Many of 
the group’s acquisitions, particularly in the US, give rise to significant 
tax savings as the amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets on 
acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. The group considers that the 
resulting adjusted effective tax rate is therefore more representative of its 
tax payable position. The group has consistently applied this definition of 
adjusted measures as it has reported on its financial performance in the 
past and it is the group’s intention to continue to consistently apply this 
definition in the future. A reconciliation is set out in the appendix to the 
Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 6 and 7.
CENTRE FOR INVESTOR EDUCATION LIMITED (CIE)
In April 2013 the group acquired a 75% equity interest in CIE for a final 
consideration of £10.2m, with a commitment to acquire the remaining 
25% by early 2016. As part of the local statutory audit of CIE for the 
year to September 30 2014, a number of governance and financial 
irregularities were identified which remain subject to legal resolution. 
As a result of these irregularities, the former owner-managers of CIE 
were replaced and a number of adjustments were made to the group’s 
investment in CIE. In October 2015, the group filed a public statement 
of claim against the previous owners for breaches of warranties and 
other damages. The group in preparation of these financial statements 
at September 30 2016 has examined all evidence, including its own 
management investigation and Deloitte & Touche LLP Australia’s 
findings, in reaching the conclusion that no further amounts are payable 
under the share purchase agreement for CIE.

3 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Segmental information is presented in respect of the group’s business divisions and reflects the group’s management and internal reporting structure. 
The directors have restated the segmental information to reflect the changes in the group’s operations following the implementation of the new 
group strategy. The group is organised into four business divisions: Asset management; Pricing, data and market intelligence; Banking and finance; 
and Commodity events. 
Asset management and pricing, data and market intelligence consist primarily of subscription revenue. Banking and finance consists mainly of both 
sponsorship income and delegates revenue. Commodity events consists primarily of delegates revenue. A breakdown of the group’s revenue by type 
is set out below.
In April 2016, the group disposed of 100% of the equity share capital of Gulf Publishing Company, Inc. (Gulf) and The Petroleum Economist Limited 
(PE). As a result segment information from the disposal of Gulf and PE has been reclassified as sold/closed businesses and the comparative split of 
divisional revenues, revenue by type and operating profits have been restated.
Analysis of the group’s three main geographical areas is also set out to provide additional information on the trading performance of the businesses. 
Inter-segment sales are charged at prevailing market rates and shown in the eliminations columns.

For the year ended September 30 2016 the group recognised an exceptional charge of £37.3m.
In April 2016, the group sold 100% of the equity share capital of Gulf Publishing Company, Inc. (Gulf) and The Petroleum Economist Limited (PE) 
which gave rise to a profit on disposal of £7.1m (note 15).
The group recognised a goodwill impairment charge of £12.9m (2015: £10.7m) relating to Mining Indaba in the half year results. This was due to 
the continued challenging market conditions and the depreciation of the South African Rand, having a significant impact on the long-term outlook 
for this business. A goodwill impairment charge of £5.9m relates to HedgeFund Intelligence (HFI), the group’s information and events business 
serving the hedge fund industry. The intangibles impairment charge of £1.7m relates to Euromoney Indices. HFI and Euromoney Indices have been 
classified as assets held for sale (note 11). The goodwill and intangibles have been valued at fair value less cost to sell resulting in the impairment. 
The remaining £8.2m charge for goodwill impairment relates to Total Derivatives, the prime source of real-time news and analysis of the global fixed 
income derivatives markets. The continued challenging market conditions for this sector has had a significant impact on the long-term outlook for 
this business. 
During the year, the group acquired a further 17% of the equity share capital of World Bulk Wine increasing the group’s equity shareholding to 57%. 
The transfer from associate to a subsidiary resulted in an impairment of associate of £0.1m (note 15).
The provision for overseas sales tax of £7.9m reflects the group’s best estimate of the additional provision required for a potential sales tax exposure 
(including interest) relating to prior periods following an adverse tax ruling in June 2016. The group is in the process of challenging this judgement.
At September 30 2016, the group recognised its share of the deficit in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme (HPS), a defined benefit scheme. This is the 
result of the change in accounting policy by the group’s parent company, Daily Mail and General Trust plc (DMGT), to allocate the assets and liabilities 
of the DMGT group’s defined benefit plan on a buy-out basis (note 27). 
Restructuring and other exceptional costs mostly comprise one-off costs incurred as a result of the strategic review undertaken during the year and 
professional fees from the legal dispute with the previous owners of Centre for Investor Education (CIE). The costs relating to the strategic review 
include one-off acquisition and integration costs (note 15), the major reorganisation of certain businesses and other professional fees relating to 
development of the group’s new strategy. 
The group’s tax charge includes a related tax credit on these exceptional items of £5.3m (note 8).
For the year ended September 30 2015 the group recognised an exceptional credit of £33.4m. 
The group disposed of its interests in a number of assets generating a gain on sale of £55.1m. Most of this relates to the sale of group’s interests in 
Capital DATA and Capital NET as part of the Dealogic transaction. 
The goodwill impairment charge consists of HFI (£4.8m), CIE (£3.0m) and Mining Indaba (£10.7m). 
Restructuring and other exceptional costs cover the major reorganisation of certain businesses, costs relating to the relocation of the group’s London 
headquarters, and professional fees resulting from the CIE dispute. 
The group’s tax charge includes a related tax charge on these exceptional items of £1.0m (note 8).

removes the tax effect of items which are adjusted for in arriving at the adjusted profit disclosed in the appendix to the Chief Executive’s Statement. 
However, the current tax effect of goodwill and intangible items is not removed. The current tax benefit of tax deductible goodwill and intangibles 
is recognised in the adjusted effective tax rate as the group considers that this more accurately reflects its expected cash tax payable position as the 
deferred tax effect on the goodwill and intangible items is not expected to crystallise. The deferred tax effect on goodwill and intangible items would 
only crystallise in the event of a disposal and that is not expected.

Total tax expense for the year 12,909 17,599
The non-taxable income of £0.4m (2015: £6.4m) consists of a non-taxable gain on disposal of shares in a subsidiary. This is a non-recurring item. The 
prior year non-taxable income of £6.4m mainly consisted of a non-taxable gain on disposal of shares and gains on disposals of fixed assets covered by 
unrecognised capital losses brought forward partially offset by non-deductible goodwill impairment. These were non-recurring items. 
The goodwill and intangibles of £2.6m (2015: £0.2m) arises as a result of non-deductible goodwill impairment. This is a non-recurring item. 
The other items deductible for tax purposes of £5.3m (2015: £5.5m) arise as a result of financing arrangements that result in asymmetrical tax 
treatment in the territories involved. It arises primarily as a result of debt financing provided to US affiliates. These items are expected to recur in the 
short to medium term. The other items deductible for tax purposes in the prior year of £5.5m arise from the same financing arrangements.
Adjustments in respect of prior years of £1.0m (2015: £1.6m) reflect several small items across numerous jurisdictions that mainly relate to changes 
in estimates.
In addition to the amount charged to the Income Statement, the following amounts relating to tax have been directly recognised in other comprehensive

11 TOTAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF BUSINESSES HELD FOR SALE 
Following the strategic review, a number of businesses met the IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’ criteria to 
be classified as held for sale at September 30 2016. These businesses are Institutional Investor Intelligence (II Intelligence), Euromoney Indices and 
HedgeFund Intelligence (HFI). The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been disclosed separately on the face of the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position. The assets and liabilities held for sale were written down to their fair value less costs to sell. This is a non-recurring fair value 
which has been measured using indicative prices of other similar businesses, and is therefore within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. None of these 
businesses met the IFRS 5 criteria to be treated as discontinued operations due to their size and the fact that they do not constitute major lines of the 
group’s business. 
On October 31 2016, the group entered into an asset purchase agreement between Institutional Investor LLC and Pageant Media Limited for the sale 
of assets of II Intelligence for an initial cash consideration of US$0.7m, royalty consideration receivable of up to US$0.3m over a 24 month period from 
the completion date and will assume the expected deferred income on completion. The deal is set for completion by the end of November 2016. This 
has been disclosed as an event after the balance sheet date (note 30).
An intangibles impairment for Euromoney Indices of £1.7m is recognised as an exceptional item in the Income Statement for the year ended 
September 30 2016 (note 5).
For HFI, the group’s information and events business serving the hedge fund industry, a goodwill impairment charge of £5.9m has been recognised 
as an exceptional item (note 5). 
The main classes of assets and liabilities comprising the businesses classified as held for sale are set out in the table below. These assets and liabilities 
are recorded at their fair values.

GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES ASSETS IMPAIRMENT TESTING
During the year the goodwill and acquired intangibles assets in respect of each of the above businesses was tested for impairment in accordance with 
IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. The methodology applied to most CGUs’ value in use calculations, reflecting past experience and external sources of 
information, included: 
 ● budgets by business based on pre-tax cash ﬂows with a CAGR of 2% to 17% for the next four years derived from approved 2016 budgets. 
Management believes these budgets to be reasonably achievable; 
 ● pre-tax discount rates between 12% and 17%, derived from the company’s benchmarked weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 10.3% 
adjusted for risks speciﬁc to the nature of CGUs and risks included within the cash ﬂows themselves; and 
 ● long-term nominal growth rate of between 1% and 5%.

12 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES continued
The recoverable amounts for HFI and Euromoney Indices were assessed using a fair value less costs of disposal model. This is a non-recurring fair value 
which has been measured using indicative prices of other similar businesses. These assets held for sale are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
Following the impairment review, the impairment losses recognised in exceptional items (note 5) in respect of goodwill and intangibles are as follows:

Euromoney Indices Asset management – 1,652 313 12.0% 12.9%
Total 26,987 1,652 22,818
The impairment charges have arisen as a result of a deterioration of trading conditions.
GOODWILL SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Further disclosures in accordance with IAS 36 are provided where the group holds an individual goodwill item relating to a CGU that is significant, 
which the group considers to be 15% of the total net book value, in comparison with the group’s total carrying value of goodwill. The only significant 
item of goodwill included in the net book value above relate to BCA. 
Using the above methodology, a pre-tax discount rate of 13.7% (2015: 12.5%) and long-term nominal growth rate of 2% (2015: 2%), the recoverable 
amount exceeded the total carrying value by £175.8m (2015: £150.4m). The directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of 
this CGU. For the recoverable amount to fall to the carrying value, the discount rate would need to be increased by 10% (2015: 10.2%) or the long-
term growth rate reduced by 16% (2015: 29%).
For the other CGUs, IAS 36 provides that, if there is any reasonably possible change to a key assumption that would cause the CGU’s carrying amount 
to exceed its recoverable amount, further disclosures are required. For NDR when using the above methodology and a pre-tax discount rate of 
14.4% (2015: 13.0%) and long-term nominal growth rate of 2% (2015: 2%) the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £15.7m  
(2015: £9.5m). 
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for NDR, the following changes in assumptions (in isolation), would 
cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value:
 ● the four year pre-tax cash ﬂows decreased by 16% (2015: 12%); 
 ● the discount rate increased by 3% (2015: 2%); 
 ● the long-term growth rate reduced by 5% (2015: 4%).

payments as a compensation cost. These payments are in substance part of the cost of an investment and are thus excluded from the share of adjusted proﬁt.
The reconciliation of share of results in associates and joint ventures in the Income Statement has been provided since the directors consider it

The comparative other debtors balance has been restated as preference shares debtors of £13.5m has been presented separately in the group’s 
Statement of Financial Position. This reclassification has no impact on net assets. 
The average credit period on sales of goods and services is 30 days. Trade receivables beyond 60 days overdue are provided for based on estimated 
irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services, determined by reference to past default experience. 
Credit terms for customers are determined in individual territories. There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade 
receivables. 
As at September 30 2016, trade receivables of £28.0m (2015: £21.9m) were not yet due.

16 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES continued
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date 
credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. 
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. 
The allowance for doubtful debts does not include individually impaired trade receivables which have been placed under liquidation as these trade 
receivables are written off directly to the Income Statement.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES 
The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk arising in the normal course of business. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Full details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the group in relation to financial risk management are set out in this note and on 
pages 78 and 79 of the accounting policies. In summary, the group’s tax and treasury committee normally meets twice a year and is responsible for 
recommending policy to the board. The group’s treasury policies are directed to giving greater certainty of future costs and revenues and ensuring that 
the group has adequate liquidity for working capital and debt capacity for funding acquisitions. 
The treasury department does not act as a profit centre, nor does it undertake any speculative trading activity and it operates within policies and 
procedures approved by the board. 
Forward contracts are used to manage the group’s exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements. Further details are set out in the foreign 
exchange rate risk section (page 106).

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders. The group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2015. 
The capital structure of the group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20, cash deposits with Daily Mail and General Trust 
plc (DMGT) group disclosed in note 29, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising share capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity. 
NET CASH/DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA* RATIO 
The group’s tax and treasury committee reviews the group’s capital structure at least twice a year. A US$160m multi-currency revolving credit facility, 
provided by DMGT, was extended during the financial year until November 28 2018 on similar terms. The facility requires the group’s net debt to 
rolling 12 month adjusted EBITDA to be no more than three times. During the financial year ended September 30 2016 the net debt to rolling 12 
month adjusted EBITDA did not breach the DMGT debt covenant. As at September 30 2016 the facility was undrawn. The group expects to be able 
to remain within these limits during the life of the facility. The net cash/debt to adjusted EBITDA covenant is defined to allow the rate used in the 
translation of US dollar adjusted EBITDA, including hedging contracts, to be used also in the calculation of net debt, thereby removing any distortion 
to the covenant from increases in net debt due to short-term movements in the US dollar. 
The group has a deposit agreement with DMGT to place excess operating funds on deposit with DMGT at a LIBOR plus 0.5%. The total cash deposit 
held with DMGT is disclosed in note 29. 
The net cash to adjusted EBITDA* ratio at September 30 is as follows:

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities above are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy other than available-for-sale investments, 
deferred consideration and acquisition commitments which are classified as level 3 (page 111). The directors consider that the carrying value amounts 
of financial assets and liabilities are equal to their fair value.
The group has derivative assets of £0.4m (2015: £1.3m) and derivative liabilities of £10.4m (2015: £4.0m) with a number of banks that do not meet 
the offsetting criteria of IAS 32, but which the group has the right to setoff same currency cash flows settled on the same date. Consequently, the 
gross amount of the derivative assets and the gross amount of the derivative liabilities are presented separately in the group’s Statement of Financial 
Position. 
The group has entered into an omnibus guarantee and setoff agreement with Lloyds Banking Group plc with a right to setoff outstanding credit 
balances against cash balances. Cash and cash equivalents included a net overdraft of £0.2m (2015: £0.7m) after applying this setoff. Bank overdrafts 
included gross cash balances of £0.4m (2015: £20.7m) which are offset under the cash pooling arrangements. This agreement meets the offsetting 
criteria of IAS 32.
i) MARKET PRICE RISK 
Market price risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices will adversely affect the value of the 
group’s financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The group’s primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate 
movements. Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such 
risks exist. Derivatives used by the group for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources. The fair 
values of forward exchange contracts are set out in this note and represent the value for which an asset could be sold or liability settled between 
knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length transaction calculated using the market rates of interest and exchange at September 30 2016. The 
group has no other material market price risks. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis. 
There has been no change to the group’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risks during the year. 
ii) FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK 
The group’s principal foreign exchange exposure is to US dollar. The group generates approximately two-thirds of its revenues in US dollars, including 
approximately 35% of the revenues in its UK-based businesses, and approximately 60% of its operating profits are US dollar-denominated. The group 
is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk on the US dollar revenues in its UK businesses, the translation of results of foreign subsidiaries and 
external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the 
lender/borrower. 
The carrying amounts of the group’s US dollar-denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: 
Assets Liabilities

Subsidiaries normally do not hedge transactions in foreign currencies into the functional currency of their own operations. However, at a group level, 
a series of US dollar and euro forward contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus US dollars and euros so as to hedge 80% of the group’s UK 
based US dollar and euro revenues for the coming 12 months and 50% of the group’s UK based US dollar and euro revenues for the subsequent six 
months. The timing and value of these forward contracts is based on management’s estimate of its future US dollar and euro revenues over an 18 
month period and is regularly reviewed and revised with any changes in estimates resulting in either additional forward contracts being taken out 
or existing contracts’ maturity dates being moved forward or back. If management materially underestimate the group’s future US dollar and euro 
denominated revenues, this would lead to too few forward contracts being in place and the group being more exposed to swings in US dollar and 
euro to sterling exchange rates. An overestimate of the group’s US dollar and euro denominated revenues would lead to associated costs in unwinding 
the excess forward contracts. The group also has a significant operation in Canada whose revenues are mainly in US dollars. At a group level a series 
of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 18 months forward to hedge the operation’s Canadian cost base. In addition, each subsidiary is 
encouraged to invoice sales in its local functional currency where possible. Forward exchange contracts are gross settled at maturity. 
IMPACT OF 10% STRENGTHENING OF STERLING AGAINST US DOLLAR 
The following table details the group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against US dollar. A 10% sensitivity has been determined 
by the board as the sensitivity rate appropriate when reporting an estimated foreign currency risk internally and represents management’s assessment 
of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates at the reporting date.

The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 
10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where 
the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender/borrower. Where sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency 
a negative number below indicates a decrease in profit and equity. For a 10% weakening of sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an 
equal and opposite impact on the profit and other comprehensive income, and the balances below would be positive.

Change in other comprehensive income (derivative financial instruments) 6,811 8,184
Change in other comprehensive income (loans to foreign operations) 29,139 12,466
The decrease in the loss from the sensitivity analysis is due to a decrease in the working capital assets. The decrease in other comprehensive income 
from £8.2m to £6.8m from the sensitivity analysis is due to the decrease in the notional value of the derivative financial instruments. 
The group is also exposed to the translation of the results of its US dollar-denominated businesses, although the group does not hedge the translation 
of these results. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of sterling versus other currencies could materially affect the translation of these results in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
The change in other comprehensive income from a 10% change in sterling against US dollars in relation to the translation of loans to foreign 
operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is not in the functional currency of the lender/borrower would result in a change of 
£29.1m (2015: £12.5m). However, the change in other comprehensive income is completely offset by the change in value of the foreign operation’s 
net assets from their translation into sterling. 
FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS 
It is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts. A series of 
US dollar and euro forward contracts are put in place to sell forward surplus US dollars and euros so as to hedge 80% of the group’s UK based US 
dollar and euro revenues for the coming 12 months and 50% of the group’s UK based US dollar and euro revenues for the subsequent six months. In 
addition, at a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 18 months forward to hedge the subsidiary’s Canadian cost base. 
The group has also entered into a number of short dated South African Rand forward contracts to hedge future UK based ZAR payments.

As at September 30 2016, the aggregate amount of unrealised losses under forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the fair value reserve 
relating to future revenue transactions is £10.0m (2015: £2.7m). It is anticipated that the transactions will take place over the next 18 months at 
which stage the amount deferred in equity will be released to the Income Statement. As at September 30 2016, there were no ineffective cash flow 
hedges in place at the year end (2015: £nil). 
iii) INTEREST RATE RISK 
The group’s committed facility is in both sterling and US dollars with the related interest tied to LIBOR. If the group drew down on this facility then 
this would result in the group’s interest charge being at risk to fluctuations in interest rates. It is the group’s policy to hedge approximately 80% of its 
interest exposure, converting its floating rate debt into fixed debt by means of interest rate swaps. The maturity dates are spread in order to reduce 
interest rate basis risk and also to negate short-term changes in interest rates. The predictability of interest costs is deemed to be more important than 
the possible opportunity cost foregone of achieving lower interest rates and this hedging strategy has the effect of spreading the group’s exposure to 
fluctuations arising from changes in interest rates and hence protects the group’s interest charge against sudden increases in rates but also prevents 
the group from benefiting immediately from falls in rates. 
As at September 30 2016, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding as the group had repaid its debt in full (2015: £nil).
The group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section on page 109. 
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance 
sheet date. For floating rate instruments, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the 
whole year. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
the directors’ assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates at the reporting date. 
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the group’s profit for the year ended September 30  
2016 would decrease or increase by £0.8m (2015: £0.1m). This is mainly attributable to the group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate 
borrowings and cash deposits.
iv) CREDIT RISK 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group. The group seeks to 
limit interest rate and foreign currency risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result have a credit risk from the potential 
non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured. The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the 
amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged. The group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal 
amount of cash and cash equivalents and cash on deposit with DMGT. Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the amounts outstanding with, and 
the credit quality of, these counterparties. For the group’s cash and cash equivalents these are principally licensed commercial banks and investment 
banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and for cash on deposit and derivative financial instruments with DMGT who have treasury policies in 
place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties 
which are rated lower than AA. 
The group also has credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued income. The concentration of credit risk from 
trade receivables is limited due to the group’s large and broad customer base. Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units 
where they arise. Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on management’s assessment of the risk of non-payment taking into account 
the ageing profile, experience and circumstance. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, 
recorded in the Statement of Financial Position. The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any 
group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. 
Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.

v) LIQUIDITY RISK 
The group is an approved borrower under a DMGT US$160m committed multi-currency revolving credit facility which expires on November 28 2018. 
The DMGT facility requires the group to meet certain covenants based on net debt and profits adjusted for certain non-cash items and the impact of 
foreign exchange. Exceeding the covenant would result in the group being in breach of the facility potentially resulting in the facility being withdrawn 
or impediment of management decision making by the lender. Management regularly monitors the covenants and prepares detailed cash flow 
forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available and that the covenants are not close or potentially close to breach. At September 30 2016, 
the group’s net cash to adjusted EBITDA was (0.76) times (2015: (0.15) times). 
The group has a deposit agreement with DMGT to place any excess operating funds on deposit with DMGT at LIBOR plus 0.5%.
The group’s strategy is to use excess operating cash on deposit with DMGT or pay down its debt. As at September 30 2016 the facility was undrawn 
and has not been utilised during the financial year (2015: £nil). The group generally has an annual cash conversion rate (the percentage by which 
cash generated from operations covers operating profit before acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items) of 100% or more due to much 
of its subscription, sponsorship and delegate revenue being paid in advance. The group’s operating cash conversion rate was 102%. The underlying 
operating cash conversion rate is 105% compared to 104% in 2015. 
There is a risk that the undrawn portion of the facility, may be unavailable or withdrawn if DMGT experience funding difficulties themselves. However, 
if DMGT were unable to fulfil its funding commitment to the group, the directors are confident that the group would be in a position to secure 
adequate external facilities, although at a higher cost of funding. 
The group’s forecasts and projections, looking out to September 2019 and taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
show that the group should be able to operate within the level and covenants of its current and available borrowing facilities.
This table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual cash flows of the financial liabilities including both interest and principal cash 
flows. To the extent that the interest rates are floating, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at September 30 2016. The 
contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the group may be required to settle.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: 
LEVEL 1 
 ● The fair value of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets is determined with 
reference to quoted market prices. 
LEVEL 2 
 ● The fair value of other ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) is determined in accordance with generally accepted 
pricing models based on discounted cash ﬂow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar 
instruments. 
 ● Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching 
maturities of the contracts.
LEVEL 3 
 ● If one or more signiﬁcant inputs are not based on observable market date, the instrument is included in level 3. 
As at September 30 2016 and the prior year, all the resulting fair value estimates have been included in level 2 other than the group’s available-for-sale 
investments, acquisition commitments and deferred consideration which are classified as level 3. 
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE 
The directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements 
approximate their fair values. Such financial assets and financial liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and loans.

LOAN NOTES 
Loan notes were issued in October and November 2006 to fund the purchase of Metal Bulletin plc. Interest is payable on these loan notes at a variable 
rate of 0.75% below LIBOR, payable in June and December. Loan notes can be redeemed at the option of the loan note holder twice a year on the 
interest payment dates above. The remaining loan notes will be redeemed in full on December 30 2016. During the year ended September 30 2016 
£0.1m (2015: £0.2m) of these loan notes were redeemed. 
COMMITTED LOAN FACILITY 
The group’s access to debt funding is provided through a committed multi-currency revolving credit facility from Daily Mail and General Trust plc 
(DMGT). The total maximum borrowing capacity is US$160m (£123m). The facility was extended during the financial year and is available to the group 
until November 28 2018. Interest is payable on this facility at a variable rate of between 1.35% and 2.35% above LIBOR dependent on the ratio of 
adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA. The facility’s covenant requires the group’s net debt to be no more than three times adjusted EBITDA on a rolling 
12 month basis. Failure to maintain the covenant requirement would result in the group being in breach of the facility, potentially resulting in the 
facility being withdrawn or impediment of management decision making by the lender. Management regularly monitors the covenant and prepares 
detailed forecasts to ensure that sufficient headroom is available and that the covenants are not close or potentially close to breach. At September 30 
2016, the group’s net cash to adjusted EBITDA was (0.76) times and the committed undrawn facility available to the group was £123m.
There is a risk that the undrawn portion of the facility, or that the additional funding, may be unavailable or withdrawn if DMGT experiences funding 
difficulties themselves. However, if DMGT were unable to fulfil its funding commitment to the group, the directors are confident that the group would 
be in a position to secure adequate external facilities, although at a higher cost of funding.
The group’s strategy is to use excess operating cash to deposit with DMGT or pay down its debt. As at September 30 2016 the facility was undrawn 
and has not been utilised during the financial year (2015: £nil). The group generally has an annual cash conversion rate (the percentage by which 
cash generated from operations covers adjusted operating profit before acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items) of 100% or more 
due to much of its subscription, sponsorship and delegate revenue being paid in advance. The group’s operating cash conversion rate was 102%. The 
underlying operating cash conversion rate is 105% compared to 104% in 2015.

At the balance sheet date, the group has unused US tax losses available for offset against future profits. At September 30 2016 a deferred tax asset 
of £2.1m (2015: £2.7m) has been recognised in relation to these losses. The US losses can be carried forward for a period of 20 years from the date 
they arose. The US losses have expiry dates between 2016 and 2030. 
At the balance sheet date, the group has unused UK tax losses available for offset against future profits. At September 30 2016 a deferred tax asset 
of £3.2m (2015: £1.6m) has been recognised in relation to these losses. There is no expiry date on these losses.
The directors are of the opinion that, based on recent and forecast trading, it is probable that the level of profits in future years is sufficient to enable 
the above assets to be recovered. 
Of the £10.3m net deferred tax liability, £1.4m of the deferred tax asset is expected to reverse over the next 12 months, with the remaining net 
deferred tax liability expected to reverse after 12 months.
There are additional tax losses in the UK with a deferred tax value of £0.5m for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. There is no expiry 
date on these losses.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £266.0m (2015: £228.0m) relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries as the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The temporary differences at September 30 2016 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where 
remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax 
jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate. 
Under IFRS deferred tax is calculated at the tax rate that has been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Legislation was 
substantively enacted in September 2016, to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax from 19% to 17% from April 1 2020. The relevant UK 
deferred tax balances have been revalued and the impact is shown in note 8.

The allocation of the number of options granted under each tranche of the CAP and CSOP UK and CSOP Canada represents the directors’ best estimate. The CAP award 
is reduced by the number of options vesting under the respective CSOP schemes (see the Directors’ Remuneration Report for further details). 
CASH-SETTLED OPTIONS 
The group has liabilities in respect of two share option schemes that are classified by IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ as cash-settled. These consist of 
the cash element of the CAP 2010 and the CAP 2014 scheme. 
SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
The company has four share option schemes for which an IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’ charge has been recognised. Details of these schemes are 
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 58. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are 
shown below.

The group operates a SAYE scheme in which all employees, including directors, employed in the UK are eligible to participate. Participants save a fixed 
monthly amount of up to £500 for three years and are then able to buy shares in the company at a price set at a 20% discount to the market value 
at the start of the savings period. In line with market practice, no performance conditions attach to options granted under this plan.
The SAYE options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility 
of the group’s share price over a period of three years. The expected term of the option used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

The CAP 2010 executive share option scheme was approved by the shareholders on January 21 2010. Each CAP 2010 award comprises two equal 
elements: an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25 pence each in the company at an exercise price of 0.25 pence per ordinary share, and a 
right to receive a cash payment. The award pool comprised 3,500,992 ordinary shares with an option value of £15.0m and cash of £15.0m, limiting 
the total accounting cost to £30.0m over its life. The awards vest in two equal tranches. The first tranche of awards became exercisable in February 
2013 on satisfaction of the primary performance condition in 2012 and there are no options outstanding. The second tranche became exercisable 
in February 2014 in which the primary performance condition was again satisfied. The remaining balance of the second tranche is subject to an 
additional performance condition, applicable for the vesting of the second tranche of awards, which requires the profits of each business in the 
subsequent vesting period be at least 75% of that achieved in the year the first tranche of awards became exercisable. The options lapse to the extent 
unexercised by September 30 2020.
The CAP 2014 was approved by the shareholders on January 30 2014 as a replacement for CAP 2010. Each CAP 2014 award comprises two equal 
instalments: an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25 pence each in the company for nil consideration, and a right to receive a cash payment. 
The value of the awards is linked directly to the growth in profits over the performance period. The award pool comprises a maximum of 3.5m shares 
and cash of £7.6m, limiting the cost of the scheme to £41.0m over its life. Awards will vest in three equal tranches, subject to the performance 
conditions and lapse to the extent unexercised by September 30 2023.

24 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued
The CAP options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of grant for the net present value of expected future 
dividend streams up to the date of expected exercise. The expected term of the option used in the models has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
The number of CSOP 2014 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2014 respectively. The CSOP is 
effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the CAP award. The CSOP 2014 options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing model. The 
CSOP 2014 options have an exercise price of £11.16, which will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism which results in the same net gain
1
 on 
these options delivered in the equivalent number of shares to participants as if the same award had been delivered using 0.25 pence CAP options. 
The amount of the funding award will depend on the company’s share price at the date of vesting. Because of the above and the other direct links 
between the CSOP 2014 and the CAP 2014, including the identical performance criteria, IFRS 2 ‘Share based payments’ combines the two plans and 
treats them as one plan. 
The minimum performance target under CAP 2014 is unlikely to be achieved given the tough trading conditions with the result that the related costs 
were not amortised in 2016 and 2015 and the costs in 2014 were reversed in 2015.
1 
Net gain on the CSOP options is the market price of the company’s shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised. 
2015 PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
The PSP was approved by the shareholders on June 1 2015. Under the PSP share option scheme, each award of options has a maximum life of ten 
years. The maximum award is shares with a market value 200% of annualised basic salary. These awards will not normally vest until the five years 
after the award and the performance conditions have been met. The only grant under this scheme was to A Rashbass, CEO, on December 18 2015 
for 159,269 nil-cost options with fair value of £1.5m. The share price used to determine the number of shares awarded was the average of the middle 
market quotations of an Ordinary Share as derived from the Daily Official List for the preceding five dealing days of December 18 2015. Further details 
are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
BUY-OUT AWARD
There was a buy-out award issued to A Rashbass on October 1 2015. Further detail is provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
25 ACQUISITION COMMITMENTS AND DEFERRED CONSIDERATION
The group is party to contingent consideration arrangements in the form of acquisition commitments, acquisition deferred consideration payments 
and deferred consideration receipts on disposal. The group recognises the discounted present value of the contingent consideration. This discount is 
unwound as a notional interest charge to the Income Statement. The group regularly performs a review of the underlying businesses to assess the 
impact on the fair value of the contingent consideration. Any resultant change in these fair values is reported as a finance income or expense in the 
Income Statement.

The discounted acquisition commitments, acquisition deferred consideration payments and deferred consideration receipts on disposal are based 
on predetermined multiples of future profits of the businesses, and have been estimated on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis using available 
performance forecasts. The directors derive their estimates from internal business plans and financial due diligence. At September 30 2016, the 
weighted average growth rates used in estimating the expected profits range was 13%.
A one percentage point increase or decrease in growth rate in estimating the expected profits, results in the acquisition commitment at September 30 
2016 increasing or decreasing by £0.1m with the corresponding change to the value charged or credited to the Income Statement in future periods.

paid by the employer and employees. Employees are able to contribute a minimum of 2% of salary with an equal company contribution in the first 
three years of employment and thereafter at twice the employee contribution rate, up to a maximum employer contribution of 10% of salary. Assets 
are invested in funds selected by members and held independently from the company’s finances. The investment and administration is undertaken 
by Fidelity Pension Management.
METAL BULLETIN GROUP PERSONAL PENSION PLAN 
The Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan is a defined contribution arrangement under which contributions are paid by the employer and 
employees. The scheme is closed to new members. The plan’s assets are invested under trust in funds selected by members and held independently 
from the company’s finances. The investment and administration of the plan is undertaken by Skandia Life Group.

PRIVATE SCHEMES 
Institutional Investor LLC contributes to a 401(k) savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an independent investment 
provider. Employees are able to contribute up to 50% of salary (maximum of US$52,000 a year) with the company matching up to 50% of the 
employee contributions, up to 6% of salary. 
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES
The group operates the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme (MBPS) and participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme (HPS), which is a scheme 
operated by DMGT, both of which are now closed to new entrants. HPS was accounted for by Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC as a defined 
contribution scheme in prior years as DMGT did not have a policy of allocating the net defined benefit scheme deficit to other DMGT group entities. 
However, due to a change in policy by DMGT’s policy to allocate the assets and liabilities of the DMGT group’s defined benefit plan on a buy-out basis, 
the group’s share of HPS has been recognised at September 30 2016. The net deficit reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 
at September 30 2016 includes a deficit of £1.2m for HPS, which has been treated as an exceptional item in the current year as shown in note 5. 
HARMSWORTH PENSION SCHEME 
HPS is a defined benefit scheme operated by DMGT and closed to further accrual. 
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out triennially by the scheme actuary. As a result of the valuations of the main 
schemes as at March 31 2013, DMGT makes annual contributions of 12.0% or 18.0% of members’ basic pay (depending on membership section). 
Following the results of the latest triennial valuation, DMGT agreed a recovery plan involving a series of annual funding payments, and in accordance 
with this arrangement, payments of £23.2m were made in line with the due date of October 5 2014. Between October 2015 and October 2026 
further annual payments have been agreed amounting to £305.9m (excluding the balloon funding payment referred to below in connection with the 
Limited Partnership investment vehicle). DMGT considers that these contribution rates are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period. 
Both the ongoing contributions and Recovery Plan will be reviewed at the next triennial funding valuation of the main schemes due to be completed 
with an effective date of March 31 2016.
In February 2014 DMGT agreed with the Trustees, that should it continue its share buy-back programme, it would make additional contributions 
to the schemes amounting to 20% of the value of shares purchased. Contributions of £3.5m relating to this agreement were made in the year to 
September 30 2016.
DMGT enabled the trustee of the scheme to acquire a beneficial interest in a Limited Partnership investment vehicle (LP). The LP has been designed 
to facilitate payment of £10.8m as part of the deficit funding payments described above over the period to 2026. In addition, the LP is required to 
make a final payment to the scheme of £149.9m, or the funding deficit within the scheme on an ongoing actuarial valuation basis at the end of 
the period to 2026 if this is less. For funding purposes, HPS’s interest in the LP is treated as an asset of the scheme and reduces the actuarial deficit 
within the scheme. However, under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ the LP is not included as an asset of the scheme and therefore is not included in the 
disclosures below.
DMGT also has a defined benefit obligation relating to the DMGT AVC Plan (the Plan) which is closed to further member contributions. The most 
recent actuarial funding valuation of the Plan, carried out with an effective date of March 31 2014, showed a funding deficit of £3.8m. The Trustees 
and DMGT have agreed that this funding shortfall will be recovered through the expected investment returns, with no further contributions required 
from DMGT.
DMGT expects to contribute approximately £13m to the schemes during the year to September 30 2017 including the deficit funding payments 
described above. The Euromoney group did not contribute to the scheme in 2016 and does not expect to contribute in 2017.
METAL BULLETIN PENSION SCHEME 
A full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme is carried out triennially by the Scheme Actuary. The latest valuation of the MBPS was 
completed as at June 1 2016. Any change to the future contributions have not been agreed. As a result of the 2013 valuation, the company agreed 
to make annual contributions of 38.9% per annum of pensionable salaries, plus £42,400 per month to the scheme. The group considers that the 
contributions set at the last valuation date are sufficient to eliminate the deficit and that regular contributions, which are based on service costs, will 
not increase significantly.
The group expects to contribute approximately £0.6m to the Metal Bulletin Pension Scheme during the year to September 30 2017.

The major categories and fair values of plan assets are as follows: 
2016
£000
2015

Equities 23,609 10,853
Bonds 31,535 18,923
Property 2,846 –
With profits policy 2,734 2,567
Cash and cash equivalents 455 136
61,179 32,479
Equities include hedge funds and infrastructure funds. All the assets listed above excluding cash and cash equivalents have a quoted market price in 
an active market. The assets do not include any of the group’s own financial instruments nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the 
group. The actual return on plan assets was £4.8m (2015: £1.1m). The 2016 fair values of plan assets include 1% of the scheme assets of HPS, the 
comparatives have not been restated for the change in accounting policy. 
The figures in this note are based on calculations carried out in connection with the actuarial valuation of the scheme as at June 1 2013 adjusted to 
September 30 2016 by the actuary. The key financial assumptions adopted are as follows: 
2016
%
2015
%
Discount rate 2.40 3.70
Price inflation 2.95 2.95
Salary increases 2.50 2.50
Pension increases 2.80 2.80
The discount rate for both scheme liabilities and the fair value of scheme assets reflects yields at the year-end date on high-quality corporate bonds 
and are based on a cash flow-based yield curve, calculating a single equivalent discount rate reflecting the average duration of the schemes’ liabilities, 
rounded to the nearest 0.05% p.a. This methodology incorporates bonds given an AA rating from at least one of the main four rating agencies 
(Standard and Poors, Moody’s, Fitch and DBRS). In previous years the methodology incorporated bonds given an AA rating from at least two of the 
four main rating agencies.
This change in accounting estimate increases the number of bonds being assessed as high-quality. The impact of this change is to reduce the defined 
benefit obligation and net pension obligation reported on the Statement of Financial Position as at September 30 2016 by £2m.
RPI inflation is derived in a similar way to the discount rate but with reference to the Bank of England spot curve at the duration of the schemes’ 
weighted average duration with an appropriate allowance for inflation risk premium (0.30% p.a.), rounded to the nearest 0.05% p.a. In previous 
years this was derived from the annualised Bank of England spot curve at the duration of the schemes’ weighted average duration with an appropriate 
allowance for an inflation risk premium, rounded to the nearest 0.05% p.a.
Mortality assumptions take account of scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy based on the Continuous 
Mortality Investigation (CMI) projections but with a long-term rate of improvement in future mortality rates of 1.25 % p.a. Allowance is made for the 
extent to which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement.
The average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the year is approximately 20 years (2015: 21 years).

Retiring at the end of the reporting year:
 Males 24.6 25.1
 Females 26.8 26.9
Retiring 20 years after the end of the reporting year:
 Males 26.4 27.3
 Females 28.7 29.2
Pension costs and the size of any pension surplus or deficit are sensitive to the assumptions adopted. The sensitivity of the defined obligation to 
changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
Assumption
Change in
assumption
Change in
liabilities
Discount rate Increase by 0.1% Decrease by 2.1%
Inflation rate Increase by 0.1% Increase by 0.5%
Salary increases Increase by 0.25% Increase by 0.1%
Life expectancy Increase by one year Increase by 3.7%
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice it is unlikely to occur, 
and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions has 
been estimated by projecting the results of the last full actuarial valuation as at June 1 2013 forward to September 30 2016. 
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.
These are the significant risks in connection with running defined benefit schemes, and the key risks are detailed below:
DISCOUNT RATE RISK
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high-quality corporate bond yields. A 
decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation, although this will be partially offset by an increase 
in the value of corporate bonds held by the schemes.
INFLATION RATE RISK
A significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore increased inflation will result in a higher defined benefit 
obligation. The Trustees have sought to acquire certain assets with exposure to inflationary uplifts in order to negate a proportion of this risk.
LIFE EXPECTANCY RISK
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated with reference to the best estimate of the mortality of scheme members. An increase 
in assumed life expectancy will result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation. Regular reviews of mortality experience are performed to ensure 
life expectancy assumptions remain appropriate.
INVESTMENT RISK
This is a measure of the uncertainty that the return on the schemes’ assets keeps pace with the discount rate. The schemes hold a significant 
proportion of equities and similar ‘growth assets’, which are expected to outperform the discount rate in the long term. 
28 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
CLAIMS IN MALAYSIA 
Four writs claiming damages for libel were issued in Malaysia against the company and three of its employees in respect of an article published in one 
of the company’s magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November 1995. The writs were served on the company on October 22 1996. 
Two of these writs have been discontinued. The total outstanding amount claimed on the two remaining writs is Malaysian ringgit 82.9m (£15.4m). 
No provision has been made for these claims in these financial statements as the directors do not believe the company has any material liability in 
respect of these writs.

Notes to the Company Accounts
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
BASIS OF PREPARATION 
These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting 
Standard 102, The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK 
and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102), and the Companies Act 2006. The 
accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention except 
for financial instruments which have been measured at fair value and 
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards 
and the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies 
set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently 
throughout the current and prior year. The going concern basis has been 
applied in these accounts. No operating segments have been disclosed 
as the company operates as one operating segment. 
DISCLOSURE EXEMPTIONS
The company satisfies the criteria of being a qualifying entity as defined 
in FRS 102. Its financial statements are consolidated into the financial 
statements of the group. As such, advantage has been taken of the 
following disclosure exemptions available under FRS 102 in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, presentation of a cash flow 
statement, certain related party transactions and the effect of future 
accounting standards not yet adopted.
TRANSITION TO FRS 102
The company transitioned from previous UK GAAP to FRS 102 as at 
October 1  2014. Details of how FRS 102 has affected the reported 
financial position and financial performance is given in note 15.
TURNOVER 
Turnover represents income from subscriptions, net of value added tax. 
Subscription revenues are recognised in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the subscription. 
Turnover invoiced but relating to future periods is deferred and treated 
as deferred income in the balance sheet. 
LEASED ASSETS 
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS 
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is 
provided on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the 
following rates per year: 
Short-term leasehold premises - over term of lease 
TAXATION 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided 
at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. 
Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of FRS 102 section 
29 ‘Deferred Taxation’, and is provided in full on timing differences that 
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a 
right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when the 
timing differences crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Deferred 
tax is not provided on timing differences on unremitted earnings of 
subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these 
earnings. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is 
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
SUBSIDIARIES 
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. 
Cost is adjusted to reflect amendments from contingent consideration. 
Cost also includes directly attributable cost of investment. 
INTEREST IN ASSOCIATES
Investments in associates are held at historical cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
TRADE AND OTHER DEBTORS 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount, 
less provision for impairment. A provision is made and charged to 
the profit and loss account when there is objective evidence that the 
company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms. 
CASH AT BANK AND IN HAND 
Cash at bank and in hand includes cash, short-term deposits and other 
short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three 
months or less. 
DIVIDENDS 
Dividends are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are 
approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded 
in the period in which they are paid.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
PROVISIONS 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the company has 
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, 
and it is probable that economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation. If material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the 
risks specific to the liability. 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The company makes share-based payments to certain employees which 
are equity-settled. These payments are measured at their estimated fair 
value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing 
model. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest. At the period end the vesting 
assumptions are revisited and the charge associated with the fair value 
of these options updated. In accordance with the transitional provisions, 
FRS 102 section 26 ‘Share-based Payments’ has been applied to all 
grants of options after November 7 2002 that were unvested at October 
1 2004, the date of application of FRS 20.
OWN SHARES HELD BY EMPLOYEES’ SHARE OWNERSHIP 
TRUST AND EMPLOYEES SHARE TRUST
Transactions of the group-sponsored trusts are included in the group 
financial statements. In particular, the trusts’ holdings of shares in the 
company are debited direct to equity. The group provides finance to the 
trusts to purchase company shares to meet the obligation to provide 
shares when employees exercise their options or awards. Costs of 
running the trusts are charged to the Income Statement. Shares held by 
the trusts are deducted from other reserves.
2 KEY JUDGEMENTAL AREAS ADOPTED IN PREPARING 
THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INVESTMENTS
Investments are impaired where the carrying value of an investment 
is higher than the net present value of the future cash flows. An 
impairment of £113.2m was recognised during the year (note 6). Key 
areas of judgement in calculating the net present value are the forecast 
cash flows, the long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and 
the discount rate applied to those cash flows. Investments held in the 
Statement of Financial Position at September 30 2016 were £1,215m 
(2015: £997m). 
3 STAFF COSTS
Details of directors’ remuneration are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 58 and in note 6 to the group 
accounts. 
The executive directors do not receive emoluments specifically for their 
services to this company. There are no employees remunerated by in this 
company (2015: nil).

In October 2015, the company subscribed to 1,000 new ordinary shares of HK$1 each in CEIC Holdings Ltd for a total consideration of US$148m. 
In September 2016, the company subscribed to 43 new ordinary shares of £1 each in Euromoney Canada Ltd for a total consideration of £235m. 
In September 2016, a review of the company’s investments was undertaken to ensure that their carrying book values were supported by their 
expected future profits. It was found that the carrying value of the investment in Euromoney Jersey Limited could no longer be supported. As a result, 
an impairment was made to fully write down the value of the investment, resulting in a charge of £113.2m.
Details of the principal subsidiary and associated undertakings of the company at September 30 2016 can be found in note 32 to the group accounts.

During the year, 64,462 ordinary shares of 0.25p each (2015: 115,477 ordinary shares) with an aggregate nominal value of £161 (2015: £289) were 
issued following the exercise of share options granted under the company’s share option schemes for a cash consideration of £0.3m (2015: £0.5m).
12 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
An explanation of the company’s share-based payment arrangements is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 58. The number 
of shares under option, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used to determine their values are given in note 24 to the group 
accounts. Their dilutive effect on the number of weighted average shares of the company is given in note 10 to the group accounts. 
SHARE OPTION SCHEMES 
The Save as You Earn (SAYE) Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility was determined by calculating 
the historical volatility of the group’s share price over a three year period. The charge recognised in the year in respect of these options was £157,000 
(2015: £102,000). Details of the SAYE options are set out in note 24 to the group accounts. 
CAPITAL APPRECIATION PLAN 2010 (CAP 2010) 
The CAP 2010 options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of grant for the net present value of expected 
future dividend streams up to the date of expected exercise. The expected term of the option used in the models has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. There was no share-based 
expense recognised in the year for the CAP 2010 options (2015: £34,000). Details of the CAP 2010 options are set out in note 24 to the group 
accounts (excludes cash-settled options). 
CAPITAL APPRECIATION PLAN 2014 (CAP 2014) AND COMPANY SHARE OPTION PLAN 2014 (CSOP 2014)
The CAP 2014 and CSOP 2014 options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of grant for the net present value 
of expected future dividend streams up to the date of expected exercise. The expected term of the option used in the models has been adjusted, based 
on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. There is no cost or liability 
for the equity or cash element of the CAP 2010 or CAP 2014 option scheme. These are borne by the company’s subsidiary undertakings. Details of 
the CAP 2014 and CSOP 2014 options are set out in note 24 to the group accounts (excludes cash-settled options).

12 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued
2015 PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
The PSP was approved by the shareholders on June 1 2015. Under the PSP share option scheme, each award of options has a maximum life of ten 
years. The maximum award is shares with a market value 200% of annualised basic salary. These awards will not normally vest until the five years 
after the award and the performance conditions have been met. The only grant under this scheme was to A Rashbass, CEO, on December 18 2015 
for 159,269 nil-cost options with fair value of £1.5m. The share price used to determine the number of shares awarded was the average of the middle 
market quotations of an Ordinary Share as derived from the Daily Official List for the preceding five dealing days of December 18 2015. Details of the 
PSP are set out in note 24 to the group accounts.
BUY-OUT AWARD
There was a buy-out award issued to A Rashbass on October 1 2015. Details of the buy-out award are set out in note 24 to the group accounts.

15 FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF FRS 102 continued
NET INVESTMENT HEDGING
Historically, foreign exchange gains and losses on borrowings denominated in foreign currency were used to hedge net investments in foreign 
subsidiaries. Upon transition to FRS 102, net investment hedging at an entity level is no longer permitted. The 2015 Company Balance Sheet has been 
adjusted to adjust the foreign exchange movement on investments to the income statement. The effect of the change has been to reverse the foreign 
exchange movement of £8.6m recognised through investments in the year ended September 30 2015 and bring the investment value back to cost 
as at October 1 2014. The transition relief to enable measurement of the investments at carrying value at transition to be considered as deemed cost 
has been applied. The Company Balance Sheet at October 1 2014 has not been presented as there were no changes. 
16 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT
The directors propose a final dividend of 16.40p per share (2015: 16.40p) totalling £20.8m (2015: £20.7m) for the year ended September 30 2016 
subject to approval at the AGM to be held on January 26 2017. In accordance with FRS 21 ‘Post Balance Sheet Events’, these financial statements 
do not reflect this dividend payable but will be accounted for in shareholders’ equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending 
September 30 2017. 
There were no other events after the balance sheet date. 
17 ULTIMATE PARENT UNDERTAKING AND CONTROLLING PARTY 
The company is controlled by Rothermere Continuation Limited (RCL) which is incorporated in Bermuda. RCL is owned by a trust (the Trust) which 
is held for the benefit of Viscount Rothermere and his immediate family. The Trust represents the ultimate controlling party of the company. Both 
RCL and the Trust are administered in Jersey, in the Channel Islands. The immediate parent of the company is DMG Charles Limited, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Daily Mail and General Trust plc (DMGT).
The largest and smallest group of which the company is a member and for which group accounts are drawn up is that of DMGT, incorporated in Great 
Britain and registered in England and Wales. Copies of its report and accounts are available from:

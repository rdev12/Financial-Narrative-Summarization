Business review:  
Chairman’s statement
Stuart Wallis Chairman 
Overview
Our business continues to perform well. In the past year we added 
three programmes to help build our development pipeline, diversifying 
the risk in our pipeline without, we believe, diluting the rewards. We 
are delighted with the progress being made with each of the three 
programmes and we recently reported encouraging phase 2a data 
for OncoGel
TM
 in oesophageal cancer. 
Financial results for the year ended 31 March 2007 were slightly 
ahead of market expectations, and included a £10.0 million milestone 
payment from AstraZeneca for scale up of the CytoFab™ manufacturing 
process. R&D for the year increased over the previous year, reﬂecting 
continued expenditure on CytoFab™ and Voraxaze™, a quarter’s 
expenditure from the acquisition of MacroMed, and the in-licensed 
programmes for the treatment of pre-eclampsia and B-CLL.
Following our £38.2 million fundraising in January 2007, we ended 
the 2006–2007 financial year with £40.0 million in cash, up from 
£25.4 million at our last year end. Our strong cash position, together with 
our product revenues and anticipated CytoFab
TM 
milestones, provide us 
with the resources to progress our expanded pipeline.
Strategic direction
Protherics is actively building a leading international biopharmaceutical 
company. T o create a sustainable business, we believe that we must 
be able to take at least some of our own products through to market to 
retain their full economic value. We are focusing in two key areas: critical 
care and cancer. In both, targeted specialist products with high medical 
value can be developed and marketed effectively by a focused sales team. 
With the potential launch of Voraxaze™ in the US in 2009, we have 
an opportunity to build a specialist sales and marketing capability 
in cancer. During this past year we have had extensive interaction 
with both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMEA”) 
on Voraxaze™. In the US, we expect to start resubmitting our 
marketing application in early 2008 under a rolling submission, with an 
estimated approval date in 2009. To capitalise on this opportunity, 
we are building a pipeline of cancer products with high medical 
value that we can look to sell ourselves in the future. 
In 2010, the marketing rights to our two FDA-approved critical care 
products, CroFab™ and DigiFab™, return to Protherics, providing us 
with an opportunity to distribute these products ourselves in the US. 
Meanwhile, Protherics, together with its local partner, Beacon 
Pharmaceuticals, is preparing to market DigiFab™ in Europe once 
the necessary regulatory approvals have been granted.
The opportunities to sell CroFab™, DigiFab™ and Voraxaze™, 
together with manufacturing initiatives to improve CroFab™ gross 
margins, are expected to provide the Company with additional cash 
ﬂow from which to fund our product pipeline.
Major market opportunities
While we are seeking to develop products we can market ourselves, 
we also have three programmes targeting potential billion dollar 
markets where we have, or will require, major pharmaceutical partners: 
CytoFab™ for sepsis; Digoxin Immune Fab for pre-eclampsia; and our 
Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine for high blood pressure. We expect 
to have additional phase 2 data on each of these key programmes 
over the next 12 to 24 months.
Our strong cash position, together with our product revenues and 
anticipated CytoFab
TM
 milestones, provide us with the resources 
to progress our expanded pipeline.

Heading
Protherics is the world’s leading manufacturer 
of ovine polyclonal antibody fragments for 
therapeutic use. We have a track record of 
producing CroFab™ (pit viper antivenom) and 
DigiFab™ (digoxin overdose) for sale in the US, 
and we have scaled up the manufacturing 
process for CytoFab™ (severe sepsis) to 
commercial batch size.
...for manufacturing
 30-FOLD
INCREASE IN OUR CHROMATOGRAPHIC 
PROCESSING CAPABILITY
“  Scaling up 
the CytoFab™ 
manufacturing 
process has been 
a major focus for 
Protherics since 
signing the deal 
with AstraZeneca 
in December 2005. 
We are extremely 
pleased to have met 
this key milestone 
which allows 
AstraZeneca to start its 
phase 2 development 
programme in the 
second half of 2007.”

Major market opportunities continued
CytoFab™, our anti-TNF-alpha polyclonal Fab for the treatment of 
severe sepsis, remains the largest single value driver in our business. 
Under the terms of the licensing deal signed with AstraZeneca in 
December 2005, Protherics is entitled to receive up to £187.0 million 
in upfront and milestone payments together with a 20% royalty on global 
net sales of CytoFab™ and additional manufacturing related supply 
payments. AstraZeneca also made a £7.5 million equity investment 
in Protherics on completion of the deal. Following the recent £10.0 million 
milestone payment from AstraZeneca, we have received a total of 
£26.3 million in upfront and milestone payments. We look forward 
to more patients being treated with CytoFab™ when AstraZeneca 
begins its phase 2 programme in the second half of 2007.
We see an opportunity to sign major licensing deals for our two 
other potential blockbuster programmes, should we demonstrate 
proof of concept for Digoxin Immune Fab and Angiotensin 
Therapeutic Vaccine in 2008.
Realising value from non-core assets
Protherics has a number of non-core assets from which we 
hope to realise value in the near to mid term. In addition to 
Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine, we have a proprietary adjuvant, 
CoVaccine HT , which is attracting interest from third parties for use 
with their own vaccines, and the drug delivery platform technologies 
and programmes gained through the acquisition of MacroMed.
Board changes
Barry Riley, our Finance Director since the formation of Protherics in 
1999, will step down from his role in August 2007. Barry has played 
a vital role in the Company’s development, and leaves Protherics 
in a strong ﬁnancial position. I thank him for his support and wish him 
all the best for the future. Barry will be replaced by Rolf Soderstrom, 
who joins us from Cobham PLC. Rolf’s operational, transactional, 
and treasury experience with much larger businesses will put us 
in good stead as we seek to grow our business.
It is also a pleasure for me to welcome Saul Komisar, President 
of our US operations, to our Board in recognition of Saul’s strong 
contribution to our business over many years.
Outlook
We have an opportunity to create a pre-eminent UK biopharmaceutical 
company with international standing and the ﬁnancial resources to 
fulﬁl its ambition. With products targeting nine different indications, 
we expect ten clinical studies to be ongoing in 2007/8. This gives 
Protherics one of the strongest pipelines in the sector relative to our 
size. Proof of concept is expected for many of these programmes 
over the next 12–24 months and delivering clinical results remains 
our biggest opportunity to create shareholder value in the near 
to mid term.

Our strategy is to build a pipeline of specialist 
critical care and cancer products with high medical 
value that we can sell in the US and Europe. CroFab™, 
DigiFab™ and Voraxaze™ should provide us 
with opportunities to establish a sales and 
marketing capability.

Business review: Chief Executive’s review
Overview
Our ﬁnancial year ended 31 March 2007 was a year of increased 
activity and expansion. We completed three corporate transactions 
to expand our development pipeline, adding a second potential 
blockbuster to our critical care pipeline, alongside CytoFab™, while 
doubling the size of our cancer portfolio. With the integration of 
MacroMed now complete, we are making excellent progress with 
the development of OncoGel™ in two lead indications, and also with 
the two in-licensed programmes, Digoxin Immune Fab in pre-eclampsia 
and acadesine in B-CLL. T o support the expanded business, we 
completed a £38.2 million (gross) equity fundraising and reported 
£40.0 million in cash at the year end, the strongest cash position 
in the Company’s history.
Internally, we have focused on scaling up the CytoFab™ 
manufacturing process and delivered, on schedule, our ﬁrst 
commercial scale batches of CytoFab™ to AstraZeneca. This 
triggered the recognition in the last ﬁnancial year of a £10.0 million 
milestone from AstraZeneca, which was received in April 2007. 
We are also working alongside AstraZeneca to align our manufacturing 
strategy with their clinical development plan, and we look forward 
to patient enrolment in their expanded phase 2 programme in the 
second half of 2007. 
We are also making progress with the rest of our pipeline and aim 
to have nine other clinical studies recruiting patients over the next 
twelve months. Despite unexpected regulatory issues with Voraxaze™, 
we are encouraged by recent discussions with the FDA and remain 
convinced of the need for this life saving product, which underpins 
our sales and marketing ambitions in cancer.
The performance of our two marketed critical care products, 
CroFab™ and DigiFab™ remains strong. CroFab™ is used 
increasingly for the treatment of pit viper bites in the US and we 
expect this growth to continue in the current ﬁnancial year. DigiFab™ 
is now the clear market leader in the US digoxin overdose market 
with more than 70% market share. In Europe, we reached an 
agreement with Roche to replace their product, Digitalis Antidot
®
 
with DigiFab™ once marketing approvals have been granted in the 
necessary countries.
R&D pipeline update
New programmes
We have made excellent progress with the clinical development 
of OncoGel™ following the acquisition of MacroMed. OncoGel™ 
is a novel, proprietary formulation of paclitaxel for localised cancer 
therapy, which is designed to achieve high concentrations of the 
cytotoxic drug at the tumour site for up to six weeks. We recently 
announced encouraging preliminary results from a phase 2a study 
in oesophageal cancer and we plan to start a phase 2b study in this 
indication in the second half of 2007. We previously announced the 
start of a phase 1/2 study in primary brain cancer which is expected 
to report in the second half of 2008. 
The in-licensing of intellectual property from Glenveigh to use Digoxin 
Immune Fab in pre-eclampsia provides Protherics with another major 
market opportunity. Pre-eclampsia is a potentially life threatening condition 
of pregnancy, which often requires the early delivery of the baby to resolve 
symptoms and avoid possible death of the mother. This can, in turn, 
necessitate lengthy and costly neonatal intensive care for the baby. There 
are currently no approved products that speciﬁcally treat this condition 
and there are very few in development.

Business review: Chief Executive’s review continued
New programmes continued
We have made good progress with the phase 2b pre-eclampsia 
study initiated by Glenveigh. We recently reported that the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board has allowed patient recruitment to continue 
following an interim review of the available safety data. Protherics 
has now recruited 34 of the 50 patients planned and we expect to 
report the results of this study in the ﬁrst half of 2008. If the data are 
positive, we intend to hold discussions with potential licensing partners 
for the programme and to determine whether we continue development 
in this indication with Digibind
®
 or progress our DigiFab™ product. 
Following the in-licensing and codevelopment deal with Advancell for 
the use of acadesine in B-CLL, we can report that, with guidance from our 
Clinical Advisory Board, a protocol for a combined single and repeat dose 
phase 1/2 clinical study has been developed. The study is planned to start 
in the second half of 2007 and we expect an early indication of proof of 
concept for acadesine from this open-label study in the ﬁrst half of 2008.
CytoFab™ – for sepsis resulting from uncontrolled infection
CytoFab™ is an anti-TNF-alpha polyclonal Fab product for the treatment 
of sepsis and other TNF-mediated diseases which has been out-licensed 
to AstraZeneca. In November 2006, following consultations with regulators 
in the US and EU, AstraZeneca announced its intention to expand the 
clinical development plan for CytoFab™ in severe sepsis, with the 
addition of a 480 patient phase 2 programme. Data from the phase 2 
study will be used to estimate the number of patients required in the 
phase 3 study and to conﬁrm the appropriate dose, as well as provide 
further supporting efﬁcacy and safety data. The phase 2 programme 
will start in the second half of 2007 and is expected to last up to 
21 months. On completion, AstraZeneca intends to initiate a single 
phase 3 study in the US, Europe and Japan. 
Protherics has successfully scaled up the CytoFab™ manufacturing 
process to a 600 litre batch size which triggered a £10.0 million 
milestone payment from AstraZeneca in March 2007 (received in 
April 2007). We have now also successfully scaled up the process 
to the full 3,000 litre commercial batch size. Under the licensing 
agreement, Protherics may receive up to a further £161.0 million in 
milestone payments, in addition to a 20% royalty on global net product 
sales of CytoFab™ and manufacturing related supply payments.
CytoFab™ revenues of £12.2 million were recognised in the year 
ended 31 March 2007. 
Voraxaze
TM
 – for the control of high dose methotrexate 
therapy in cancer
Voraxaze™ (glucarpidase) contains an enzyme that rapidly breaks 
down methotrexate (“MTX”), a widely used anti-cancer agent. It has 
been developed to prevent or reduce the serious toxicity that can 
result when patients receiving high doses of MTX (“HDMTX”) for the 
treatment of cancer develop renal damage and then have difﬁculty 
eliminating MTX from the body.
On 15 September 2006, we submitted a BLA for Voraxaze™ to the 
FDA in the US. This application was withdrawn on 7 November 2006 
following a request for additional manufacturing-related information. 
Following positive discussions with the FDA, Protherics has agreed 
the additional manufacturing and stability data required and work 
is now underway to generate the necessary data. 
Discussions were also held with the FDA regarding the interaction 
of Voraxaze™ with leucovorin, the standard supportive therapy 
given with HDMTX therapy. The FDA has asked Protherics to 
We are proud to have achieved the successful scale up of the 
CytoFab

undertake a twelve patient study to support a label claim regarding 
the dosing of leucovorin following administration of Voraxaze™ 
to address this interaction.
The FDA has granted Voraxaze™ a Fast Track Designation for the 
rapid and sustained reduction in toxic MTX levels in patients with 
impaired renal function. The FDA has also agreed to Protherics 
resubmitting its application as a rolling submission, starting in early 
2008. This will enable the FDA to review sections of the application 
whilst Protherics collects the additional manufacturing and clinical 
data. The Company is seeking a Priority Review, which would reduce 
the time for the BLA review to six months from ten months from 
submission of the ﬁnal part of the application. If granted, Voraxaze™ 
could be approved in the US towards the end of 2009. 
The FDA has also granted Protherics permission to supply Voraxaze™ 
in the US on a compassionate use basis under a Treatment Protocol, 
prior to marketing authorisation being granted. The FDA has agreed 
for Protherics to charge for its supply, providing for recovery of some 
of the costs associated with the development and supply of Voraxaze™. 
We expect modest revenues from this cost recovery programme which is 
expected to continue until the approval of a BLA in the US. Protherics has 
commenced the supply of Voraxaze™ in the US using AAIPharma Inc as 
its distributor. Voraxaze™ was previously available for compassionate use 
in the US through the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”).
A MAA for the use of Voraxaze™ as an intervention treatment, 
for patients experiencing or at risk of MTX toxicity from delayed 
elimination, was submitted in the EU in July 2005. The EMEA 
requested additional manufacturing data, similar to that requested 
by the FDA, and further data regarding the interaction between 
Voraxaze™ and leucovorin. As these data could not be provided 
within the timeframe available under the Centralised Procedure the MAA 
was withdrawn on 21 May 2007. The Company will consider resubmitting 
an MAA application if the twelve patient leucovorin dosage regimen study 
requested by the FDA is acceptable to the EMEA to address the clinical 
relevance of the leucovorin interaction issue. 
Protherics will continue to supply Voraxaze™ in Europe on a 
named patient basis for intervention use in patients at risk of severe 
or life-threatening methotrexate toxicity due to delayed elimination 
of MTX following HDMTX therapy. 
Two pilot studies to investigate the planned repeated use of 
Voraxaze™ have been initiated and if successful, the data from 
these studies will be used to develop a planned use clinical 
programme to expand the indications for Voraxaze™ into the 
potentially much larger planned repeated use market. 
Voraxaze™ is now available in both the US and Europe on a 
compassionate use basis. In Europe, revenues for the year were 
£1.4 million, compared to £0.8 million in the previous year.
Prolarix
TM
 – targeted therapy for liver cancer and other 
selected solid tumours
Prolarix™ is comprised of a small molecule prodrug, tretazicar, 
which is converted to a highly cytotoxic agent when administered 
with a cosubstrate, caricotamide. The conversion is produced by an 
endogenous enzyme, NQO2, which has elevated activity in certain 
tumour types. 
The FDA has granted Voraxaze™ a Fast Track Designation 
for the rapid and sustained reduction in toxic MTX levels 
in patients with impaired renal function.

    Digoxin Immune Fab are complex ovine based biological products 
providing protection from generic competition
Digoxin Immune Fabs, such as Protherics’ DigiFab™ and GSK’s Digibind
®
, may have a role 
in the treatment of pre-eclampsia. 
Pre-eclampsia is a life-threatening complication of pregnancy that occurs in about 5–8% 
of pregnancies in the US. Pre-eclampsia is generally characterised by high blood pressure 
and if left unmanaged can lead to renal failure, eclampsia and death of the mother. It can 
also lead to the early delivery of the baby, resulting in development abnormalities or death 
of the baby. It is a major cause of admission of babies into neonatal intensive care units. 
There are no approved therapies and few products in development to speciﬁ cally 
treat pre-eclampsia. 
The cause of pre-eclampsia has not been conclusively identiﬁ ed. However several 
vasoactive substances called Endogenous Digoxin-Like Factors (“EDLFs”) have been 
found in the blood and placenta of women with pre-eclampsia. These EDLFs rapidly 
disappear following delivery of the baby, coincident with the disappearance of the 
symptoms of pre-eclampsia. Digoxin Immune Fabs have been found to bind to known 
EDLFs in vitro and may therefore have potential application in the treatment of 
pre-eclampsia through their neutralisation and removal from the body.
A phase 2a study with Digibind
®
 has been completed in the US in patients with severe 
pre-eclampsia, after delivery of the baby. Six out of 13 patients required drugs to lower 
blood pressure, compared to none in the Digibind
®
 treatment group. This result was 
statistically signiﬁ cant.
A phase 2b, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 50 women with severe 
pre-eclampsia is ongoing with Digibind
®
 in the US. The primary assessments are the 
use of antihypertensive drugs and renal function. Time to delivery is being assessed 
as a secondary endpoint. Results are expected in ﬁ rst half of 2008.

Prolarix
TM
 – targeted therapy for liver cancer and other 
selected solid tumours continued
A phase 1 study of Prolarix™ is being run under the auspices of Cancer 
Research UK and 23 patients have been treated to date. One patient had 
stable disease after receiving a relatively low dose of Prolarix™ and 
received all six cycles of treatment. The dose of tretazicar has been 
escalated several times but the maximum tolerated dose has not yet 
been reached. Further data should be available before the end of the 
year and the study is now expected to report in the ﬁrst half of 2008.
The manufacture of tretazicar and caricotamide has been scaled up 
successfully and a non-clinical programme has been initiated to 
support a phase 2 study in primary liver cancer which is scheduled 
to start in the ﬁrst half of 2008. 
Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine – management of high 
blood pressure (hypertension)
Protherics’ Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine is designed to induce 
endogenous antibodies to angiotensin, one of the key hormones involved 
in the regulation of blood pressure. Encouraging non-clinical and clinical 
results suggest that the binding of antibodies to angiotensin may be 
able to produce a clinically signiﬁcant reduction in blood pressure in 
hypertensive patients. 
A new formulation of Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine containing 
a novel adjuvant, CoVaccine HT , acquired from CoVaccine BV in 
June 2006, has produced up to a ten-fold improvement in antibody 
response in non-clinical studies. Protherics has completed the 
non-clinical safety testing of the CoVaccine HT adjuvant required 
to support phase 2 development, and manufacturing scale up for the 
adjuvant and formulation development for the vaccine are ongoing. 
Protherics is planning to start a phase 2a study with the new 
formulation in early 2008. The goal of this study will be to conﬁrm 
that the new formulation increases levels of anti-angiotensin 
antibodies in hypertensive patients and to establish whether this 
results in a reduction in blood pressure.
The market for the treatment of high blood pressure is estimated to be in 
excess of US$30 billion per annum, and with positive phase 2a data, our 
Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine could provide another major outlicensing 
opportunity for Protherics. Additionally, our adjuvant is attracting 
considerable interest from several possible partners for other programmes.
Marketed products
CroFab™ – pit viper antivenom
CroFab™ is a polyclonal Fab for the management of crotalid 
(pit viper) envenomations. It is currently the only product marketed 
for these bites in the US, where there are around 8,000 pit viper 
bites reported each year. We believe that CroFab™ has captured 
more than half of a potential $70–80 million market opportunity and 
net revenues in the US are shared equally with our distributor, Fougera. 
CroFab™ sales were £14.1 million in the year compared to £11.5 million 
in the previous year. This increase was achieved despite a weaker 
US dollar. The corresponding sales in US dollars were $26.9 million 
against $20.4 million in the prior year, a 32% increase.
DigiFab™ – treatment for digoxin overdose
DigiFab™ is a polyclonal Fab for the treatment of toxicity due to digoxin 
overdose and is now the market leader in this indication in the US. 
The market is estimated to be worth approximately US$25 million 
per annum. Fougera’s sales continue to increase.

OncoGel™ is a novel injectable formulation of paclitaxel, a commonly used cancer 
treatment. It is designed for local administration, where it is able to deliver high 
concentrations of paclitaxel for up to six weeks. OncoGel™ is being investigated in 
two lead indications, oesophageal and primary brain cancers. 
Oesophageal cancer 
The American Cancer Society has estimated that around 15,000 new cases of 
oesophageal cancer are reported in the US each year and the majority of patients present 
with dysphagia (difﬁ culty in swallowing). As a result more than 50% of patients suffer 
serious weight loss as they are unable to eat properly, severely impacting on their quality 
of life. A major goal of current therapy is to control loco-regional disease to enable 
curative resection and improve surgical outcomes. Despite current therapy, there remains 
a large unmet need for a more effective therapy.
A phase 2a study in inoperable oesophageal cancer in which OncoGel™ was given with external 
beam radiation for the treatment of dysphagia has been completed in Europe and the US. In this 
study, where OncoGel™ was injected directly into the primary tumour, it reduced tumour bulk in 
the majority of patients. In the future, this may allow more patients to become candidates for 
surgical resection, in addition to improving the management of their cancer. A phase 2b 
study of OncoGel™ in potentially operable oesophageal cancer patients, in combination 
with chemoradiotherapy will commence in the second half of 2007.
Brain cancer 
Treating brain cancer is extremely challenging due to the inability of most chemotherapeutic 
agents to cross the blood-brain barrier. Where feasible, the primary therapy for patients 
with primary brain tumours is surgical debulking. OncoGel™ is being developed for the 
treatment of primary brain cancers, such as glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”), either 
post-surgery, by injecting OncoGel™ into the tumour cavity to try to kill residual tumour cells, 
or directly into the tumour in patients with inoperable tumours. About 19,000 cases of 
primary brain cancer are diagnosed in the US each year, of which 60% are the most 
malignant form, GBM. 
OncoGel™ has demonstrated encouraging dose dependent activity in non-clinical models 
of brain cancer. A phase 1/2 study is ongoing in the US to investigate the safety and tolerability 
of OncoGel™ when administered into the cavity produced after a tumour is surgically removed. 
Data from this study will determine the dose to be used in future studies of patients with 
primary or recurrent GBM. Preliminary data is expected to be available from the ﬁ rst dose 
cohort in the second half of 2007 and data from all patients in second half of 2008.

DigiFab™ – treatment for digoxin overdose continued
However, as previously reported, Fougera has reduced its orders from 
us to better align its stock holding with sales. As a result, our revenues 
declined to £2.7 million in the year, from £3.8 million. In US dollars, sales 
declined to $5.1 million from $6.7 million, a decrease of 24%. We believe 
that Fougera has now worked through much of its excess inventory and 
it  has increased its orders for the current ﬁnancial year. 
The European market can provide a further opportunity to grow 
DigiFab™ sales and Protherics anticipates receiving marketing 
approval in the UK in the second half of 2007, with subsequent 
approvals in Europe over the following six to twelve months. 
We announced an agreement with Roche Pharmaceuticals to 
replace its niche digoxin antidote product, Digitalis Antidot
®
 with 
DigiFab™ in those countries where it is currently available. DigiFab™ 
will be marketed via our licensee Beacon Pharmaceuticals in most 
mainland European countries and by Protherics in certain other 
countries. In the meantime, we are making DigiFab™ available 
in some EU countries on a named patient basis.
Operations
We are proud to have achieved the successful scale up of the CytoFab™ 
manufacturing process, which utilises some of the largest chromatography 
columns of their kind in the world. This work at our facility in Wales has, 
however, necessitated the rescheduling of the manufacture of FDA 
qualiﬁcation batches of CroFab™ using our new process and we now 
expect approval of the revised CroFab™ process in the US in 2009.
The integration of MacroMed is now complete and we expect to have 
completed construction of our new manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City 
in the third quarter of 2007. We aim to have Good Manufacturing Practice 
material available from the new facility using the commercial process 
for use in the OncoGel™ phase 3 study in oesophageal cancer. 
Following the acquisition of MacroMed and the hiring of additional 
staff to support our expanded activities, headcount has increased from 
213 in April 2006 to 271 in March 2007. 
Business outlook
Our goal is to become a self-sustaining biopharmaceutical business, 
developing and selling our own cancer and critical care products. 
Our recent fundraising, together with the further milestone payment 
received in April 2007 from AstraZeneca on CytoFab™, leaves our 
business in a strong ﬁnancial position. We expect to deliver key newsﬂow 
on all our development programmes over the next 12–24 months 
as our pipeline matures, including data from AstraZeneca’s phase 2b 
study with CytoFab™ in severe sepsis. We plan to launch Voraxaze™ 
in the US in late 2009, assuming regulatory approval, and will 
regain the marketing rights to CroFab™ and DigiFab™ in the US 
from Fougera in late 2010. We continue to explore ways to leverage 
these opportunities to sell our own products in the US and Europe 
in the future.

Acadesine is a novel nucleoside analogue that could be a promising new therapy for the 
treatment of B-CLL, a haematological cancer where there is an excess of B–cells. Unlike 
existing chemotherapies for B-CLL, acadesine has been shown ex vivo to selectively kill 
B-cells, whilst having only minimal toxicity to T -cells. This selectivity for B-cells means that 
acadesine has the potential to reduce the risk of serious infection and other side effects 
seen with current chemotherapies. 
B-CLL is the most frequently occurring type of leukaemia in the western world and 
accounts for about 40% of all leukaemias in those over 65 years of age. It is very rare 
in those below the age of 30 years and it follows an extremely variable course with overall 
survival times ranging from months to decades. B-CLL is considered incurable but temporary 
remission can be achieved with chemotherapies such as chlorambucil (Leukeran
®
, GSK), 
ﬂ udarabine (Fludara
®
, Schering) or cladrabine (Leustatin
®
, Ortho Biotech) and the monoclonal 
antibodies, alemtuzumab (MabCampath
®
, Schering) or rituximab (MabThera
®
, Roche), 
either given alone or in combination.
Acadesine was well tolerated in 2,000 patients when previously studied by another 
company in an unrelated indication. We plan to initiate a proof of concept phase 1/2 
clinical study with Advancell in second half of 2007. The study will investigate safety 
of acadesine, pharmacokinetics and B-cell selectivity in cancer patients and is expected 
to report in the second half of 2008.

Annual Report 2007 18
Overview
Results for the year to 31 March 2007 show a step change 
compared to the prior year. Revenues increased to £31.1 million 
from £17.7 million and although, as expected, operating expenses 
also increased signiﬁcantly, we were able to deliver a much reduced 
loss after tax of £3.4 million (2006: £9.5 million).
Revenues
Most areas of the business performed strongly in the year. 
The £10.0 million receivable from AstraZeneca related to a major 
CytoFab™ manufacturing milestone and was fully recognised in 
the year. A further £2.2 million related to amortisation of the initial 
up-front receipt of £16.3 million, which is being spread over the 
expected period to marketing approval. In total, revenues from 
CytoFab™ were £12.2 million, compared to £0.7 million in the 
previous year.
The components of the £31.1 million of revenue for the year ended 
31 March 2007 and the £17.7 million in the previous year are shown 
in the Key Performance Indicators (“KPI”) tables on pages 19 and 20 
and are also discussed in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 7 to 15.
Cost of sales and gross proﬁt
Cost of sales for the year was £11.3 million, the same as in the 
previous year, which included overheads of £1.4 million, incurred 
during a planned shutdown to complete a major expansion of our 
facilities in Wales. These were shown as an exceptional cost. Net 
of these unabsorbed overheads, the cost of sales for the prior year 
was £9.9 million. On a like-for-like basis, gross proﬁt on manufactured 
products increased to £7.2 million from £6.3 million. This was driven 
by a particularly strong increase in CroFab™ volumes, helped by 
higher sales of Voraxaze™, and was delivered despite the further 
weakening of the US dollar, which lowers our revenues when translated 
into pounds sterling. Costs associated with CytoFab™ are currently 
treated as R&D expenditure. Including the revenues from CytoFab™ 
and other items which have no associated cost of sales, gross proﬁt 
for the year was £19.8 million, against £6.4 million in the prior year. 
Administrative expenses
Research and development expenditure increased to £14.0 million 
from £6.7 million as we committed resources to CytoFab™ and 
undertook further work on Voraxaze™ in support of regulatory ﬁlings. 
The ﬁnal quarter of the ﬁnancial year also saw the effects of increased 
spending from the acquisition of MacroMed in January 2007 and the 
products in-licensed at the same time. No research and 
development expenditure has been capitalised.
General and administrative spending also increased to £10.2 million 
from £9.2 million, reﬂecting the increasing size of the business and 
the acquisition of MacroMed. The increase in expenditure was offset 
by gains on foreign currency positions of £0.7 million and reduced 
share option costs of £0.5 million.
Finance income and costs
Finance income increased to £1.2 million from £0.4 million due 
to the increased levels of cash and cash equivalents on deposit 
following receipt of funds from AstraZeneca towards the end of 
the prior ﬁscal year, and the fundraising completed in January 2007. 
Finance costs remain at £0.4 million, comprised of the costs of the 
remaining balance of convertible loan notes which were issued to 
ﬁnance the acquisition of Enact Pharma plc (“Enact”) in 2003, and 
charges on ﬁnance leases.

Most areas of the business performed well in the year. 
We approach the future in the knowledge that the ﬁnancial 
resources available to the Company have never been stronger.

Annual Report 2007 19
Results before and after tax
Loss before tax for the year was £3.6 million compared to a loss 
before tax of £9.6 million in the previous year. A tax credit on research 
and development expenditure of £0.3 million has been taken, compared 
to a credit of £0.1 million in the prior year. Loss for the year after tax 
was £3.4 million compared to £9.5 million in the previous year.
Balance sheet
Non-current assets increased to £40.6 million from £18.6 million 
at the end of the prior year, largely as a result of the acquisition 
of MacroMed in January 2007, together with continued investment 
in property, plant and equipment. Current assets show a signiﬁcant 
increase to £66.6 million from £41.6 million. Cash and cash equivalents 
were £40.0 million, up from £25.4 million as a result of the fundraising 
completed earlier in the year, while trade and other receivables increased 
to £15.1 million from £4.5 million, showing the £10.0 million milestone 
from AstraZeneca which was received in April 2007. 
Total liabilities decreased to £30.8 million from £33.8 million. 
The release of deferred income to revenues (mostly from the initial 
payment received from AstraZeneca) has more than offset the 
increases in ﬁnance lease obligations which have ﬁnanced the 
equipment purchases.
Share capital and share premium have increased by a total of 
£50.8 million over the previous year, as a result of the fundraising, 
acquisition of MacroMed and in-licensing agreements completed in 
January 2007. Further shares to be issued as a result of the acquisition 
amount to £1.3 million and are included as a component of total 
equity, which was £76.5 million at 31 March 2007, up from £26.4 million 
at the prior year end. 
Liquidity and cash ﬂow
In addition to Protherics’ main sources of revenue explained above, 
we have raised further funds from shareholders as investment 
opportunities have arisen, and in January 2007 completed a 
£38.2 million (gross) fundraising. The proceeds are intended to 
support the development of OncoGel™ and progress development 
of the intellectual property in-licensed from Glenveigh and Advancell. 
We use lease ﬁnancing to fund capital equipment where appropriate, 
with total obligations of £3.3 million at 31 March 2007. 
The acquisition of Enact in 2003 was accomplished largely by the 
issue of a £7.2 million convertible loan note which, if unconverted, 
would be repayable in 2010. Much of this has already been converted 
into ordinary shares, and £2.1 million remained outstanding at 
31 March 2007. Other borrowings remain modest at £0.2 million.
Operating loss for the year was £4.4 million compared to £9.5 million 
in the prior year. This, along with the recording of the £10.0 million 
milestone from AstraZeneca in March 2007, which was not received 
until April 2007, and the reduction in payables due to the recognition 
of a portion of the upfront £16.3 million, has resulted in a net cash 
outﬂow from operating activities of £15.8 million in the year. The previous 
year showed cash inﬂow from operating activities of £12.6 million, 
due to the treatment of the majority of the upfront payment as 
deferred income. 
Cash invested in property, plant and equipment decreased to 
£1.2 million from £2.0 million in the previous year, while £4.1 million 
was expended on the in-licensing of intellectual property, largely 
from Glenveigh and Advancell. The issue of shares produced a 
net £36.2 million against £8.0 million in the prior year.

Key performance indicators

_0_PTH_ar07_front.indd   19 19/06/2007   14:57:02 Protherics PLC
Annual Report 2007 20
Cash and cash equivalents were £40.0 million at the end of the year, 
up from £25.4 million at the previous year end. We invest our cash 
resources in deposits with banks with the highest credit ratings, 
putting security before absolute levels of return.
Currency effects
CroFab™ and DigiFab™ revenues arise substantially in US dollars, 
while manufacturing and administrative costs were largely in sterling 
and Australian dollars. We continue to manage currency exposures 
using foreign exchange contracts on a rolling twelve month basis. 
The difference between the fair value of these contracts at each year 
end, together with any other exchange gains or losses, is reﬂected 
in administrative expenses for the year. Although the foreign exchange 
contracts therefore lock in expected cash receipts, they do not 
determine the rate used to translate these revenues in the Income 
Statement, which depends on the average actual rate over the year. 
The effective overall translation rate applied to these US dollar revenues 
in the year was approximately £/$1.91 against £/$1.77 in the previous 
year. In the future, following the acquisition of MacroMed, the proportion 
of expenditure incurred in US dollars is expected to increase, 
providing a higher level of internal hedging of currency exposures.
Financial outlook
CroFab™ orders remain strong, and DigiFab™ orders from Fougera 
are expected to recover. Sales of DigiFab™ in Europe are also 
expected to increase as the anticipated marketing approvals are 
achieved. Further milestone payments from AstraZeneca are scheduled 
as clinical trials of CytoFab™ are undertaken, while Voraxaze™ 
revenues are expected to increase modestly as we start to distribute 
it on a compassionate use basis in the US through the cost recovery 
programme. More substantial increases await final marketing 
authorisation from the regulatory authorities, which could occur 
in the US in 2009.
As the planned R&D programme continues, we anticipate a further 
increase in expenditures in the coming year. However, we approach 
the future in the knowledge that the ﬁnancial resources available to 
the Company have never been stronger.

Annual Report 2007 21
Business review: Principal risks and uncertainties
Competitive environment 
Some of Protherics’ revenue streams have direct competitors 
(such as Digibind
®
, GSK’s competitor to DigiFab™) and increasing 
competition (in the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy testing 
market). In other cases, alternative technologies may be developed 
which could compete or prove superior to our other products or product 
candidates. We also face competition for possible product acquisitions.
Intellectual property 
We may not be able to secure the necessary intellectual property 
rights in relation to products in development. Other companies may 
have patents which limit our ability to exploit our R&D efforts and 
there are risks of challenge to our existing patent portfolio.
Regulatory environment 
The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated. New products 
will generally need several phases of preclinical and clinical studies 
before marketing approval and may require approvals in several 
jurisdictions. It is often difﬁcult to anticipate the requirements of the 
various regulatory authorities, which can evolve with time, frequently 
making the approval process more costly and lengthier than initially 
estimated, or even resulting in the abandonment of an application 
for approval. The manufacturing of pharmaceutical products is also 
closely regulated, with frequent inspections from the agencies. Failure 
to maintain the necessary approvals could result in an inability to 
supply the market, with consequent loss of revenues. 
Manufacturing risk
We rely on certain third party contractors for the supply of key 
materials and services, such as ﬁlling and freeze-drying the end 
product. The ﬁlling and freeze-drying process in particular carries 
with it risks of failure and loss of product. Problems at contractors’ 
facilities may result in delays and disruptions in supplies. Some of 
these materials and services may be available from one source only 
and regulatory requirements can make the substitution costly and 
time-consuming. Our polyclonal antibody products rely on serum 
produced from our sheep ﬂocks in Australia, which could be subject 
to disease outbreaks. We also rely on our single site in Wales for 
supply of manufactured product, with the consequent possibilities 
for disruption in supplies. 
R&D risk
There is always a risk that drugs under development will fail. Potential 
products may show unacceptable levels of toxicity or may not prove 
effective in clinical trials. In addition, it may not prove possible to 
attract a suitable outlicensing partner for some of our potentially 
larger market opportunities, which generally need a higher level of 
investment in phase 3 clinical studies than we may be able to 
commit from our own resources.

Annual Report 2007 27
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company Financial Statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law they are required 
to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial Statements on the same basis. 
The Group and Parent Company Financial Statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the ﬁnancial position of the 
Group and the Parent Company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such Financial Statements that 
references in the relevant part of that Act to Financial Statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
  prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Parent 
Company and enable them to ensure that its Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Annual Report 2007 28
Principles statement
The Board is committed to high standards of Corporate Governance. In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Company is required to comply with the 
Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in July 2003 (the Combined Code). Set out below is a statement 
of how the principles of the Combined Code were applied. The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in preparing the accounts is set out on page 27 
and the statement from the Auditors on their reporting responsibilities is set out on page 41.
The Board of Directors
The Group is controlled through the Board of Directors of the Company. The Board’s main roles are to create value for shareholders, to provide leadership 
to the Group, approve its strategic objectives and to ensure that the necessary ﬁnancial and other resources are made available to enable it to meet those 
objectives. The Board, which meets at least nine times a year, has a deﬁned schedule of matters reserved for decision by it.
The speciﬁc responsibilities reserved to the Board include: setting overall Group strategy; approving major capital expenditure or other commitments, 
including any substantial transactions; consideration of major ﬁnancing matters of the Group; overseeing the system of risk management; considering 
key appointments within the Group and approving annual and interim Financial Statements. The Board also approves the annual budgets and monitors 
performance against this budget. Control of research and development, business development, sales and marketing and corporate affairs is delegated 
through the Chief Executive to Senior Executives who submit monthly reports to the Board. J C Christie has overall responsibility for operations, and control 
of operational matters is delegated through him to senior managers at each of the Company’s sites in Wales, Australia and Salt Lake City.
As at 31 March 2007, the Board comprised ﬁve Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, and three Executive Directors. The names of the 
current Directors together with their biographical details are set out on page 23 of this report. With the exception of J Gonella who was appointed as 
a Non-executive Director on 24 January 2007, all the above Directors served throughout the period under review. In addition, S Komisar was appointed 
a Director on 26 April 2007.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive is clearly deﬁned and has been approved by the Board.
The Chairman leads the Board in the determination of its strategy and in the achievement of its objectives. The Chairman is responsible for organising the 
business of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda. The Chairman has no involvement in the day-to-day business of the Group. The Chairman 
facilitates the effective contribution of Non-executive Directors and constructive relations between Executive and Non-executive Directors, ensuring Directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear information. The Chairman gives feedback to the Board on issues raised by major shareholders.
The Chief Executive has direct charge of the Group on a day-to-day basis and is accountable to the Board for the ﬁnancial and operational performance 
of the Group.
The Company regards S M Wallis, J R Brown, G Watts and B G Morton as independent Non-executive Directors and these Directors constructively challenge 
and help develop proposals on strategy, and bring strong independent judgement, knowledge and experience to the Board’s deliberations. The Independent 
Directors are of sufﬁcient calibre and number that their views carry signiﬁcant weight in the Board’s decision making. J R Brown is the Senior Independent 
Director. As Senior Independent Director, he is available to shareholders if they have concerns where contact through the normal channels of Chairman, 
Chief Executive or Finance Director has failed to resolve matters or for which such contact would be inappropriate. 
The Chairman ensures that all Directors go through an induction process on joining the Board. Continuing training is provided as and when necessary. 
Training requirements are identiﬁed as part of the annual appraisal process. There is an agreed procedure whereby any of the Directors may take independent 
professional advice, at the Company’s expense, in the furtherance of their duties. All Directors also have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary.
The Company held eleven Board meetings during the year ended 31 March 2007. All members of the Board are supplied in advance with appropriate 
information covering matters which are to be considered, including monthly management accounts and regular management reports, which enables them 
to scrutinise the Group’s and management’s performance against agreed objectives.
The record of Board attendance during the year ended 31 March 2007 was:
          Number of  Total 
          meetings  number of 
          attended  meetings

The Board has established a formal process, led by the Chairman, for the annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its principal Committees 
and its individual Directors using a detailed evaluation checklist based on the Higgs evaluation guidance. The performance of the Chairman was reviewed 
by the Senior Independent Director. The Directors are made aware that their performance will be subject to an evaluation on appointment.
The Company’s Articles of Association require Directors to stand for election by shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual General Meeting after their appointment 
and for re-election every three years.

The Board of Directors continued
Non-executive Directors, J R Brown and G Watts, who are proposed for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting, receive payment under letters 
of appointment which are terminable by three months’ notice by either party. J R Brown is Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee. G Watts is Chairman of the Audit Committee. Having been appointed since the previous Annual General Meeting, J Gonella and S Komisar 
will step down from the Board at the next Annual General Meeting and are standing for election. J Gonella receives payment under a letter of appointment 
which is terminable by three months’ notice from either party and S Komisar has a service contract which provides for a notice period of three months 
from the Director and twelve months from the Company.
Nomination Committee
A Nomination Committee has been established to recommend the appointment of new Directors to the Board and to make recommendations on Board 
composition and balance. Although the Board’s practice is to use an external recruitment agent in appointing Non-executive Directors, an agency was not 
used in the case of J Gonella, who was appointed to the Board on 24 January 2007. His appointment was made on the basis of his considerable knowledge 
of MacroMed Inc., a company acquired by Protherics in January 2007 of which he was a Non-executive Director, and his extensive experience in the 
pharmaceutical industry. S Komisar’s appointment to the Board on 26 April 2007 recognises the importance of his role as President of Protherics Inc., 
bringing signiﬁcant knowledge and experience of the US commercial environment to the Board, as the Company expands its operations in the US.
During the year, the Committee comprised J R Brown, J Gonella (appointed 24 January 2007), A J Heath, B G Morton and G Watts and was chaired by S M Wallis 
and the contribution of all members of the Committee was in line with expectations. The terms of reference of the Committee have been documented and 
agreed by the Board. The full text of the terms of reference is available in the investor relations section of the Company’s website, www.protherics.com. 
The key terms are as follows:
   to review and evaluate the Board structure, size, balance of skills and composition and make recommendations to the Board with regard to adjustments 
that are deemed necessary;
  consider succession planning for Directors and other Senior Executives; and
  prepare a description of the roles and capabilities required for a particular appointment, be responsible for identifying and nominating candidates for 
approval of the Board to ﬁll Board vacancies as and when they arise as well as put in place plans for succession, in particular, of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive.

Before selecting new appointees, the Nomination Committee considers the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board to ensure that 
a suitable balance is maintained. All job speciﬁcations prepared include details of the time commitments expected in the role.
S M Wallis has other commitments outside the Company as documented on page 23. The Board does not consider that these commitments represent 
an impediment to proper performance of his role as Chairman of the Company.
Details of Directors’ service contracts are given in the Remuneration Report on page 35. The terms and conditions of appointment of the Directors are 
available for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered ofﬁce during normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting (for 15 minutes 
prior to the meeting and during the meeting).

Directors’ Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Remuneration Committee comprises J Gonella (appointed 24 January 2007), B G Morton, S M Wallis, and G Watts, and is chaired by J R Brown. 
The Committee meets at least once a year to review the Group’s policy on Directors’ remuneration and advise the Board on the salaries and beneﬁts of 
Executive Directors and the Executive Team. The full terms of reference of this Committee have been documented and are available in the investor relations 
section of the Company’s website, www.protherics.com. The key terms are as follows:
  determine the policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Executive Team and review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance 
of such remuneration policy;
   determine total individual remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Executive T eam, including bonuses, incentive payments, pension and other beneﬁts;
   determine the annual bonus arrangements for the Executive Directors and the Executive Team and review bonus arrangements recommended by the 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer for Senior Management within the business;
   review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders. For any such plans, determine each year whether awards will 
be made, and if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards to Executive Directors and other Senior Executives and the performance 
targets to be used; and
  review any major changes to pension schemes, prior to submission to, and approval by, the appropriate Boards of Trustees.
The record of attendance during the year ended 31 March 2007 was:

The Board has discussed the composition of the Remuneration Committee and is satisﬁed that the Directors who are members of this Committee are those 
who are best able to contribute to the Committee’s objectives. Although not considered by the Board to be independent, the Board believes that J Gonella 
brings with him substantial knowledge and experience of the pharmaceutical business, which assists the Committee in discharging its duties. The remaining 
four members of the Committee are considered to be independent.
The Remuneration Report, which includes details of the Group’s remuneration policy is set out on pages 33 to 39 of the Annual Report.

Audit Committee
During the year the Audit Committee comprised of Non-executive Directors J R Brown, B G Morton and G Watts who acted as Chairman of the Committee.
The Committee has at least one member possessing recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. G Watts, a chartered accountant, was Group Finance Director 
of SSL plc between 2001 and 2004 and prior to that, a partner at Chartered Accountants KPMG. It can be seen from the Directors’ biographical details, 
appearing on page 23, that the other members of the Committee bring to it a wide range of experience from positions at the highest level.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee have been documented and agreed by the Board. The full text of the terms of reference are available in the 
investor relations section of the Company’s website, www.protherics.com. The Committee’s duties include:
 monitoring the integrity of the Group’s Financial Statements and any formal announcement relating to the Group’s performance;
 reviewing signiﬁcant accounting judgements contained within the Group’s Financial Statements;
   monitoring the effectiveness of the external audit process and making recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, reappointment 
and remuneration of the External Auditor;
 ensuring that an appropriate relationship between the Group and the External Auditors is maintained, including reviewing non-audit services and fees;
  reviewing annually the Group’s system of internal control and the process for monitoring and evaluating risks facing the Group;
  reviewing, from time to time, the need for an internal audit function; and
  reviewing and monitoring External Auditors’ independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process taking into consideration relevant 
UK professional and regulatory requirements.
The Audit Committee has approved a whistleblower procedure at a meeting held on 26 May 2005 which was issued to all employees on 31 May 2005.
The Committee meets with Executive Directors and management, as well as privately with the External Auditors.
In order to preserve auditor independence, the Board seeks alternative advisers in the provision of consultancy services unless use of the Auditor is in the 
best interests of the Group. The Auditors are asked on a regular basis to articulate the steps they have taken to ensure their independence. Prior approval 
of the Audit Committee is required for any non-audit services provided by the External Auditors. Details of the amounts paid to the External Auditors during 
the year for audit and other services are set out on page 51 of the Financial Statements.

Shareholders
The Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer are the principal spokesmen for the Group with both institutional and private investors. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
and Group Finance Director attend meetings with major institutional shareholders at least twice yearly and communicate the views of major shareholders to 
the Board. The Company Secretary ensures that any matters of concern raised by institutional shareholders are communicated to the Board and its Committees 
as appropriate.
The Annual General Meeting is used as an opportunity to communicate with private investors, as is the Company’s website which includes announcements 
and corporate documents. All shareholders are entitled to attend the Annual General Meeting where the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees are available to answer any questions that may arise. It is the Company’s intention that the notice of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
and related papers will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before that meeting.

Annual Report 2007 32
Internal control
The Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal control to provide them with reasonable assurance that 
the assets of the Group are safeguarded and that the shareholders’ investments are protected. The system includes internal controls covering ﬁnancial, 
operational and compliance areas, and risk management. There are limitations in any system of internal control, which are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. Such internal control systems provide reasonable but not absolute assurance with respect to the 
preparation of ﬁnancial information, the safeguarding of assets and the possibility of material misstatement or loss. 
The Board conﬁrms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks that the Group faces. The Group’s management 
regularly reviews risks and controls and provides feedback to the Group’s Risk Management Committee of which J C Christie and B M Riley are members. 
A Risk Management Plan is in place and is supervised by the Committee which provides updates to the Board on any signiﬁcant changes in risks and any 
failures or weaknesses in controls. The Board regularly reviews the risk management process, which has been in place from the start of the year to the date 
of approval of this report and which is in accordance with the Turnbull guidance. 
The key procedures designed to provide an effective system of internal control are that:
 there is an organisational structure with clearly deﬁned lines of responsibility and delegation of authority;
  annual budgets are prepared and updated as necessary;
  management accounts are prepared on a monthly basis and compared to budgets and forecasts to identify any signiﬁcant variances; and
  the Group appoints staff of the required calibre to fulﬁl their allotted responsibilities.
In the year to 31 March 2007, a review of the Group’s internal controls was undertaken by the Board. As part of this review, a Group wide risk proﬁle was 
prepared which identiﬁed the Group’s signiﬁcant risks, the likelihood of those risks occurring and their impact should they occur. Whilst some reﬁnements 
continue to be made to detailed processes, no signiﬁcant weaknesses or failings in the system of internal controls were identiﬁed in this annual review. 
Internal audit
The Board has considered it inappropriate to establish an internal audit function, given the size of the Group. However, this decision will be reviewed 
as the operations of the Group develop. 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Statement of compliance
Throughout the year ended 31 March 2007, the Company complied with the provisions of the Combined Code except for Provision B.2.1:
  J Gonella is a member of the Remuneration Committee and is not considered by the Board to be an Independent Non-executive Director due to the 
material business relationship he has had with the Company as a Non-executive Director and shareholder of MacroMed Inc., a company acquired 
by Protherics in January 2007. The Board believes that Dr Gonella brings with him substantial knowledge and experience of the pharmaceutical business, 
which assists the Committee in discharging its duties. The remaining members of the Committee are considered by the Board to be Independent 
Non-executive Directors.

Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 (the “Schedule”) and also meets the relevant 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to 
Directors’ Remuneration. In accordance with Section 241A of the Companies Act 1985 (the “Act”), a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the Financial Statements are to be approved.
Section 235 of the Act requires the Auditors to report to the Company’s members on the “auditable part” of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and to state 
whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with Part 3 of the Schedule. The report has therefore been divided 
into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
In accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code, the Company has established a Remuneration Committee. The members of the Committee 
comprised J R Brown, B G Morton, S M Wallis and G Watts, when the Committee considered matters relating to the Directors’ Remuneration for the ﬁnancial year 
ending 31 March 2007 and the Committee was chaired by J R Brown. J Gonella was appointed to the Remuneration Committee on 24 January 2007. Although 
Dr Gonella is not considered by the Board to be an Independent Non-executive Director, the Board believes that he brings with him substantial knowledge 
and experience of the pharmaceutical business, which assists the Committee in discharging its duties. The remaining four members of the Committee are 
considered by the Board to be Independent Non-executive Directors.
None of the Committee had any personal ﬁnancial interest (other than as shareholders and convertible loan note holders as disclosed in the Directors’ Report), 
conﬂicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, or day-to-day involvement in the running of the business. No Director plays a part in any discussion 
about his or her own remuneration.
The Committee received external advice from Deloitte & Touche LLP during the year on speciﬁc remuneration matters. Deloitte & Touche LLP also provided 
tax and valuation services to the Company during the year. The Committee consulted A J Heath (Chief Executive Ofﬁcer) in determining the remuneration of 
the other Executive Directors and key members of Senior Management. A J Heath did not participate in any discussions concerning his own remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Committee are on the Company’s website, www.protherics.com.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the necessary calibre and to reward them for enhancing 
value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and key members of Senior Management and the determination of their 
annual remuneration package is undertaken by the Remuneration Committee. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board 
within limits set out in the Articles of Association. It is proposed that these limits be increased at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
There are ﬁve main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and Senior Management:
 Basic salaries and beneﬁts in kind
 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”)
 Annual incentive and Deferred Bonus Plan (the “DBP”)
 Share option plans
 Pensions
The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related. This is delivered 
through participation in the DBP and the LTIP , both of which are structured to deliver share-based payments which will align Directors’ interests with those 
of shareholders and reward participants for creating shareholder value. 
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company providing the Board’s permission is sought. 
(i) Basic salaries and beneﬁts in kind
Basic salaries are determined by the Remuneration Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility. 
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and takes into account the performance of the individual and the rates for 
similar positions in comparable companies. Basic salaries are reviewed annually.
Beneﬁts in kind include permanent health insurance and private medical insurance. Beneﬁts in kind are not pensionable.
(ii) Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”)
The LTIP is used as the primary incentive mechanism for Executive Directors. Other key employees are also invited to participate. Awards are made in the 
form of share options over new shares with an award price equal to the aggregate nominal value of the number of shares under option. Awards will not be 
granted in any year with a value greater than the individual’s annual remuneration (excluding bonuses and beneﬁts in kind). This limit may be exceeded in 
exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the Committee. Current policy is to grant awards at six-monthly intervals.
Subject to the achievement of performance conditions determined at the time of grant, awards may be exercised at the end of the vesting period. The 
Committee may amend the performance conditions in certain circumstances, subject to their replacement with equally stretching conditions. Under exceptional 
circumstances the Committee may waive performance conditions. Any change in conditions would be disclosed to shareholders in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. The vesting period will normally be three years from the date of grant and awards may be exercised up to ten years from the date of grant. Beneﬁts 
under the LTIP are not pensionable.

Remuneration policy continued
(ii) Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”) continued
Provided the Remuneration Committee is satisﬁed that the Company has achieved sound underlying performance, awards will vest based on the Company’s 
relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance. TSR was chosen because it aligns the interests of management with those of shareholders. 
Details of the performance conditions are provided in the audited section of the Remuneration Report. 
The awards made to Directors under this plan are illustrated in the table on page 37 of this report.
(iii) Annual incentive and Deferred Bonus Plan (the “DBP”)
The Executive Directors participate in an annual incentive arrangement the terms of which are set out in the DBP which was approved by shareholders 
on 27 January 2005. Under the DBP the maximum bonus opportunity has been 50% and for the year to 31 March 2007 performance was measured on 
an individual basis against key objectives which were linked to the strategic aims of the business. The Committee also took into consideration performance 
in relation to the acquisition and integration of MacroMed Inc., a company acquired by Protherics in January 2007. 100% of performance bonuses received 
under the DBP related to achievement of these key objectives, with the LTIP providing the basis upon which Directors receive rewards based on ﬁnancial 
measures of performance, further details of which are in the audited section of the Remuneration Report. At the discretion of the Committee, the bonus 
is payable under the terms of the DBP either in cash or options over shares, or a proportion of cash and options over shares.
The Remuneration Committee decides each year what proportion of the annual incentive should be delivered as options over shares, but usual policy is 50%. 
Current policy is to grant awards annually to Executive Directors and Senior Managers. Participation in the DBP is at the discretion of the Committee. 
Following a review of the Company’s remuneration policy, the Committee considers that it would be in the interests of the Company to increase the maximum 
annual incentive payment under the terms of the DBP from 50% to 75% of basic salary, receipt of the additional 25% to be subject to performance targets 
which are signiﬁcantly more demanding than those applied to the ﬁrst 50%. Whilst the actual targets cannot be disclosed due to commercial sensitivity, the 
measures for the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2008 will again be based on key objectives linked to achievement of the Company’s strategic aims. They 
will be set for each Director on an individual basis and 100% of the bonus payable will be linked to personal performance targets. The LTIP will continue to be used 
to link reward to the ﬁnancial performance of the business. The Remuneration Committee will judge the extent to which each Director has met key objectives and 
will use their discretion to make awards above 50% only in cases where performance has signiﬁcantly exceeded that required to meet key objectives. The Committee 
considers that the Company is at a crucial stage of its development and restructuring the annual incentive to support the achievement of signiﬁcantly more demanding 
performance targets has an important role to play in enhancing shareholder value. Accordingly, a proposal will be put forward at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting to amend the rules of the DBP to increase the maximum level of bonus payable to 75%.
Performance targets may be amended should the Remuneration Committee consider this to be in the interests of the Company, subject to their replacement with 
equally stretching conditions.
Where the award is delivered as an option over shares, the number of shares under the award is calculated by dividing the amount of the bonus by the 
market value of the shares on the date on which the award vests, or such other day as the Committee determines. Options will normally be granted at a 
nominal, or nil, exercise price and will normally be exercisable between two and ten years after grant. If the individual leaves within the two year deferral 
period, under normal circumstances the option is forfeited. The Committee retains the discretion to allow the individual to retain the options if appropriate.
Beneﬁts arising under the DBP are not pensionable.
(iv) Share option plans
The Company operates an Executive Share Option Plan (the “ESOP”). The ESOP is believed to be consistent with current best practice guidelines. 
It consists of an unapproved section with a UK Inland Revenue approved addendum. The option price must not be less than the greater of the market value 
of the shares on the date of grant and the nominal value of the shares. In any year, options will not be granted over shares with a value greater than twice 
the individual’s annual remuneration (excluding bonuses, commissions and beneﬁts in kind). This limit may be exceeded in exceptional circumstances at 
the discretion of the Committee. The ESOP is used primarily to incentivise new employees joining the Company at middle management level. No awards 
have been made to Executive Directors under the ESOP .
Subject to satisfying performance conditions which are imposed at grant, details of which are in the audited section of the Remuneration Report, options 
will be exercisable from the end of the vesting period, normally three years from the date of grant, to ten years from grant. The Committee may amend 
the performance conditions in certain circumstances subject to their replacement with equally stretching conditions. Under exceptional circumstances the 
Committee may waive performance conditions. The committee retains discretion not to set performance conditions for awards made to employees who are 
not Executive Directors.
The Company has previously operated an Approved Share Option Plan and an Unapproved Share Option Plan for Directors and employees. These plans 
have now expired and no further options may be granted under them. Existing options are exercisable up to ten years from date of grant. The Company also 
operates an Approved Savings Related Share Option Plan (“Plan”), which is open to all employees with a minimum of six months’ service. Options may be granted 
under this Plan at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of Protherics’ shares on the date immediately preceding the date of the invitation made to 
employees to subscribe for options. All options granted under this plan during the year and outstanding at 31 March 2007 have been made at 20% discount. 
Options may be exercised during the period of six months following maturity of the savings contract. Under the rules of the Plan, participants may choose 
either a three-year or a ﬁve-year savings contract. There are no performance criteria under the Savings Related Share Option Plan.
The performance conditions attaching to the Approved and Unapproved Plans are detailed in the audited section of the Remuneration Report. Under both 
the Approved and Unapproved Share Option Plans, which have been used widely across the Group, the exercise price of the options was equal to the 
market value of the Company’s shares at the time the options were granted. 
The Committee has responsibility for supervising the plans and the grant of options to Executive Directors and Senior Management under the terms of the plans.

Remuneration policy continued
(iv) Share option plans continued
A J Heath was granted an option to subscribe for 600,000 ordinary shares at 39p on 22 December 1999. The terms of the agreement and performance 
criteria at the date of grant were similar to those of the Unapproved Share Option Plan and are detailed in the audited section of the Remuneration Report.
As at 31 March 2007, awards over 13,112,217 ordinary shares were outstanding under the Company’s share option plans which amounted to 3.87% of the 
Company’s issued share capital.
(v) Pensions
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme for the beneﬁt of Executive Directors and employees. Their dependants are eligible for a lump sum 
payment in the event of death in service. The assets of the pension scheme are held separately from those of the Group. The Committee may make payments 
to the pension scheme in lieu of bonuses or salary increases, at its discretion. In the year ending 31 March 2007, Directors and Senior Management were given 
the opportunity to waive all rights to receive an annual bonus under the Deferred Bonus Plan and, at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee, the 
Company would make additional contributions to the Company’s Pension Plan on behalf of those Directors and Senior Managers. 
Performance graphs
The following graphs show the Company’s performance, measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Pharmaceutical and 
Biotech Index also measured by TSR. TSR is deﬁned as share price growth and reinvested dividend. The FTSE All Share Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index 
has been selected for this comparison because it was used as the basis of performance criteria for the Company’s Approved and Unapproved Share Option Plans. 
An additional graph is provided showing the Company’s TSR against the FTSE All Share Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index excluding FTSE 100 companies. 
TSR has also been included in this report as it is the index used for performance measurement under the LTIP .
Executive Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indeﬁnite term providing for a maximum of one year’s notice by the Company.
The details of the Executive Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below:
       Notice period  Notice period 
      Date of contract  (Director)  (Company)
J C Christie      21 September 2000  Six months  Twelve months
A J Heath      6 November 2001  Twelve months  Twelve months
B M Riley      13 July 1995  Six months Twelve months
S Komisar 
(i)
     26 April 2007 Three months Twelve months
(i)
 S Komisar was appointed a Director on 26 April 2007
In the event of early termination, the Directors’ contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of basic salary for the notice period.
Non-executive Directors’ terms of engagement
The Non-executive Directors have speciﬁc terms of engagement. Their remuneration is determined by the Board within limits set by the Articles of Association 
and based upon Board surveys of fees paid to Non-executive Directors with similar responsibilities at similar companies. G Watts, J R Brown, B G Morton 
and J Gonella receive payments under letters of appointment which are terminable by three months’ notice by either party. S M Wallis received payment 
under both a consultancy agreement and a letter of appointment, amounting to a total of £70,000 in the year, both of which are terminable by twelve months’ 
notice from either party. When setting the remuneration of Non-executive Directors, the Board considers the amount of time required to discharge Committee 
responsibilities. Excluding the Chairman of the Company, the Non-executive Directors received fees of £25,000 in the year. The Chairmen of the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees received an additional amount of £5,000 in the year.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in the Company’s share option and share award plans, although any existing options held upon appointment 
can be retained.
The Non-executive Directors are not eligible to join the Company’s pension scheme.

 J Gonella was appointed as a Non-executive Director on 24 January 2007.
The fees in respect of S M Wallis include £35,000 paid to his management company (2006: £35,000). The fees and termination payments in respect 
of A Atkinson include £nil (2006: £41,000) paid to a company controlled by him.
Beneﬁts in kind reﬂect the provision of private healthcare with the exception of S M Wallis for whom a fully expensed car is provided.
The fees/basic salary exclude entitlements waived by A J Heath and B M Riley of £36,000 and £46,000 respectively (2006: £100,000 and £30,000 respectively). 
The Remuneration Committee determined that these sums be paid into their respective pension funds and they are included in the Directors’ Pension 
Entitlement table on page 37.
A J Heath, B M Riley and J C Christie waived their right to receive a bonus under the DBP for the year ended 31 March 2007, and the Remuneration 
Committee has determined that an amount to be classiﬁed as a bonus be paid into the Company pension fund on their behalf. The amount paid is equal 
to the amount which would otherwise have been receivable under the DBP plus 10% thereof, being a portion of the saving to the Company as a result of 
the method of bonus payment. The annual bonus disclosure above includes the additional 10%. These amounts are not included in the Directors’ Pension 
Entitlement table on page 37.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company subject to Board approval. A J Heath is currently a Non-executive Director 
of XL T echGroup Inc. from which he received remuneration of £45,000 in the year ended 31 March 2007 (2006: £35,000). B M Riley is a Non-executive Director 
of TyraTech Inc. and S Komisar holds a Non-executive position with Franklin Synergy Bank. B M Riley and S Komisar did not receive remuneration from these 
appointments in the year ended 31 March 2007.

Directors’ share options continued
Performance criteria for the Unapproved and Approved Plans
Options issued prior to 1 March 2004 under both the Approved and Unapproved Share Option Plans, may be exercised on any date between three and ten 
years from the date of grant of the option, subject to the Company’s share price outperforming the average price of shares in the FTSE Pharmaceutical Index 
in any three year period commencing on or after the date of grant of the option. 
Options issued on 1 March 2004 under the Unapproved Plan are subject to performance criteria which measures Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) on a 
sliding scale against the FTSE All Share Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index. Options issued to existing holders with a total aggregate value (at the date 
of grant) of up to four times annual salary are exercisable after three years. If the Company is at the median, one third of the shares under option become 
exercisable, rising on a sliding scale such that all the shares under option would become exercisable if the Company’s performance was at or above the upper 
quartile. For options granted to existing holders with a total aggregate value (at the date of grant) between four and eight times annual salary, performance 
is measured after ﬁve years. No options are exercisable if the TSR of the Company at the time of performance measurement is at the median of the 
FTSE All Share Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index. Options are then exercisable on a sliding scale beyond this point, with the maximum number of shares 
being exercisable if the Company’s performance is at or above the upper quartile. The Committee must also be satisﬁed that there has been an improvement 
in the Company’s underlying ﬁnancial performance over the period.
On 29 March 2007, in determining the extent to which the performance criteria had been met for options granted on 1 March 2004 with a three year 
performance measurement period, the Committee determined that the comparator group should exclude those companies in the FTSE 100 (currently 
AstraZeneca PLC, GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Shire plc) in line with performance measurement applied to options granted under the Long T erm Incentive Plan 
approved by shareholders on 27 January 2005. TSR was averaged across a period of three months before the date of the award and three months before the 
date on which the performance period ended. This is in keeping with normal market practice and is a practical adjustment to smooth out the impact of short-term 
market inﬂuences and to provide a more robust measure of the performance of the Group. Following application of the above measures, the Remuneration Committee 
determined that 81.74% of the shares under option would vest. 
Performance criteria for the Long Term Incentive Plan
Awards were granted on 12 June 2006 and 15 December 2006 under the LTIP which was adopted by shareholders on 27 January 2005. In line with previous 
options granted under this plan, performance will be measured after three years from the date of grant by measuring the TSR of the Company against a 
comparator group consisting of the primary listed components of the FTSE All Share Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index but excluding those companies in 
the FTSE 100. TSR will normally be averaged across a period of three months before the date of the reward and three months before the date on which the 
performance period ends, although the Committee may determine that a different averaging period is appropriate and properly reﬂective of management 
performance but in any event this will not be more than six months or less than one month. This is in keeping with normal market practice and is a practical 
adjustment to smooth out the impact of short-term market inﬂuences and to provide a more robust measure of the performance of the Group. Awards will 
vest on a sliding scale between each step, as follows:
Protherics PLC TSR relative to comparator group          % of total award vesting
Upper decile           100%
Upper quartile           80%
Median           30%
Below median           Nil
Measuring the Company’s performance against this comparator group recognises the importance for shareholders that the Company outperforms its sector 
and reﬂects the importance of the Company’s aim of sustainable share price growth. In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisﬁed that the 
Company has achieved sound underlying performance.

Directors’ share options continued
Performance criteria for option granted to A J Heath
The performance criteria for A J Heath’s individual option is similar to those of the Unapproved Share Option Plan. In particular, the option may generally 
be exercised only between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, and on the date of exercise, the share price must have outperformed

or the exercise price in the case of a variation in share capital, subject to conﬁrmation by the Auditors that it is in their opinion fair and reasonable. The option 
lapses if A J Heath leaves the Company voluntarily, and must be exercised within three months if his employment ceases by reason of injury, disability, sickness 
or redundancy. The agreement confers no pensionable beneﬁts. No amendment may be made to the beneﬁt of A J Heath without the prior approval of the Company 
in General Meeting except for minor amendments to beneﬁt the administration of the agreement or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or 
regulatory treatment for A J Heath or any Group Member.
A J Heath holds options over 116,300 shares under the Protherics PLC Plan for ex-Therapeutic Antibodies employees. There are no performance criteria 
under this Plan, which mirrors the terms of the Therapeutic Antibodies 1990 Plan, from which the options were transferred.
There are no performance criteria under the Savings Related Share Option Plan.

Corporate social responsibility
The Board of Directors has adopted a corporate responsibility programme which incorporates social, ethical and environmental policies.
Social and ethical policies
Protherics’ policy is to establish and preserve a reputation for ethical and fair dealing with its stakeholders.
Protherics has implemented policies on health and safety, human resources policies including the issuance of a Company handbook detailing a code of 
conduct, which is supported by other policies such as equal opportunities, policies against harassment, disciplinary rules, grievance procedures, maternity 
and parental leave policies.
The Company has appointed Health and Safety Ofﬁcers who undertake regular audits and maintain a health and safety culture within the Group.
The Company has published on its website a code of ethics applicable to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Finance Director and Group Financial Controller, 
as required by the US Sarbanes–Oxley legislation, and has also distributed a whistleblowing policy to all employees.
The ethical behaviour of the Company is reliant on the way employees conduct business with external organisations. Employees are required when acting 
on behalf of Group companies to uphold best ethical practice with respect to customers and suppliers.
Protherics promotes interaction with the local community, including schools and has hosted a number of open days at its UK manufacturing facility.
Environmental policy
The Company regards the protection of the environment as a mutual objective for management, employees and others engaged in Company activities. It is 
Company policy to adopt the “best available techniques not entailing excessive costs” (“BATNEEC”) and “best practicable environmental option” (“BPEO”) 
approach at all times to prevent pollution of the air, land and water, and to protect everyone from all foreseeable hazards connected with Company activities.
In particular, the Company has a responsibility to:
  provide and maintain a safe and healthy environment;
  adopt a system of integrated pollution control of all Company activities;
 realise its duty of care for the management of all waste;
  provide adequate information, instruction, training and supervision to prevent the pollution of the environment;
 take account of all relevant statutory requirements;
  assess all risks to everyone affected by Company activities; and
   continually monitor environmental control measures applicable to the Company’s activities and wherever necessary, consult with the Environment Agency, 
local enforcing authorities and external advisers.
All employees and others engaged on Company business have a duty to co-operate in the enactment of this policy by:
  working safely and efﬁciently at all times;
  reporting any incidents that have led, or may lead to possible pollution of the environment; and
  adhering to Company Rules and procedures for securing a safe and healthy environment.
The Company’s UK manufacturing operation has been granted an Integrated Pollution and Prevention Permit (“IPPC”) from the Environment Agency. 
All waste, water and energy usage is measured on an ongoing basis and systems are being put in place which will enable the Company to measure 
improvements in waste management and energy usage. These systems will provide important key performance indicators for the Company’s future reporting 
requirements. In addition, the Company has been independently assessed to the Green Dragon Environmental Management Standard level two, and is 
intending to seek assessment at the higher level three standard in the coming year.

Annual Report 2007 41
We have audited the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”) of Protherics PLC for the year ended 31 March 2007 
which comprise the Group and Parent Company Income Statements, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Cash 
Flow Statements, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Recognised Income and Expenses and the related notes. These Financial Statements have 
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
on page 27.
Our responsibility is to audit the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal 
and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial Statements give a true and fair view and whether the Financial Statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group Financial 
Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the 
Financial Statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Business Review that is cross referred 
from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined Code speciﬁed 
for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements 
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s Corporate Governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Financial Statements. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Financial Statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the Financial 
Statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient 
evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2007 and of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s loss for the year then ended;
  the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Financial Statements.

Annual Report 2007 45
1 General information
Protherics PLC is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered ofﬁce is given on page 76. 
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and in the Business Review on pages 3 to 21.
These Financial Statements are presented in sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
These Financial Statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 4 June 2007. At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, 
the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not yet been applied in these Financial Statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
 IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures; and the related amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements on Capital Disclosures.
 IFRS 8, Operating Segments.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future years will have no material impact on the Financial Statements 
of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and ﬁnancial instruments when the relevant Standards come into effect for periods commencing 
on or after 1 April 2007.
2 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Financial Statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied 
to all years presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of accounting
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial and Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union. 
The ﬁnancial information presented on pages 42 to 71 has been prepared based on IFRS as adopted by the European Union, including International 
Accounting Standards (“IAS”) and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) of the IASB that are relevant to its operation and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 April 2006.
As applied to the Company’s Financial Statements, there are no material differences between IFRS as adopted by the European Union and IFRS as published 
by the IASB.
The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. 
A summary of the more important policies are set out below.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results ultimately may 
differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Financial Statements of Protherics PLC incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and all entities over which it can exercise 
control (its “subsidiaries”). Control is achieved by the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of the subsidiary so as to obtain beneﬁts from 
its activities, and generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.
The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets 
given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identiﬁable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values on the date of acquisition, irrespective of the extent of any 
minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of identiﬁable net assets, including intangible assets acquired, 
is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is 
recognised directly in the Income Statement.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial Statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
On consolidation, all intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenditure are eliminated.
Segment reporting
A business segment is a group of assets, liabilities and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are 
different from those of other parts of the business. A geographical business segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic 
environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.

2 Accounting policies continued
Foreign currency translation
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the functional currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional 
and presentational currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising on translation 
are included in the income statement.
On consolidation, the results of operations that have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated at the average rate 
of exchange during the year and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the date of the balance sheet. Exchange differences arising on translation 
from 1 April 2004 are taken directly to a separate component of equity, the cumulative translation reserve.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts received or receivable in respect of the sale of goods and services, licence agreements and intellectual property to customers 
during the year, net of trade discounts given and value added tax. 
A description of the various elements of revenue and the associated accounting policies is given below:
 Products 
  Revenue is partly recognised upon the shipment of products to the distributor, the signiﬁcant risks and rewards having been transferred to the distributor, 
with further amounts being recognised in accordance with the contractual terms upon shipment to the end user.
 Upfront and milestone payments
 Non-refundable upfront and milestone payments recognised over the period of the earnings process (see note 3).
 Outlicensed product royalties 
  Royalty income is generated by sales of products incorporating the Group’s proprietary technology. Royalty revenues are recognised once the amounts 
due can be reliably estimated based on the sale of underlying products and collectibility is assured. Where there is insufﬁcient historical data on sales 
and returns to fulﬁl these requirements, for example in the case of a new product, the royalty revenue will not be recognised until the Group can reliably 
estimate the underlying sales. 
Research and development expenditure
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Expenditure incurred on development projects (relating to the design and testing of new or 
improved products) is recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will generate future economic beneﬁt, considering factors including 
its commercial and technological feasibility, status of regulatory approval, and the ability to measure costs reliably. Other development expenditures are 
recognised as an expense as incurred. Development expenditure previously recognised as an expense is not recognised as an asset in a subsequent 
period. Development expenditure that has a ﬁnite useful life and which has been capitalised is amortised from the commencement of the commercial 
production of the product on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected beneﬁt. 
No development expenditure has been capitalised in either the current or prior year.
Exceptional items
The Group deﬁnes exceptional items as those items which are not expected to occur frequently and by their nature or size, would distort the comparability 
of results from year to year.
Finance income and costs
Finance income comprises of income on funds invested and is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Intangible ﬁxed assets – goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identiﬁable assets, including intangible assets, 
of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for 
impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of a subsidiary include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the subsidiary sold. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount. Goodwill arising on acquisitions 
in the year ended 31 March 1998 and earlier periods has been written off to reserves, has not been reinstated in the balance sheet and is not included 
in determining any subsequent proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Intangible ﬁxed assets – other
Purchased trademarks, licenses and customer lists are recognised at cost on acquisition and are subject to amortisation over their useful life from the point at which 
the asset is available for use. The amortisation charge is calculated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (currently a maximum of ten years).

2 Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings comprise mainly factories and ofﬁces. All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment 
losses, except for land, which is shown at cost less impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in an asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the asset will ﬂow 
to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset less its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows:
Buildings and improvements  5% to 10% per year
Plant and machinery   10% to 15% per year
Computer equipment and software 20% to 33% per year
Fixtures, ﬁttings and motor vehicles 20% to 25% per year
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted as appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount exceeds the higher of the asset’s fair value less cost 
to sell and value in use. Any impairment charge is recorded in the income statement.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are included in the income statement. 
Borrowing costs incurred during the construction of assets are expensed as incurred.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets and intangible assets with ﬁnite lives when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value 
may be impaired, whilst goodwill with an indeﬁnite life is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. In performing such reviews, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are independent 
from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indeﬁnite 
life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which 
the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) 
is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying value of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, provided that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises materials, direct labour and a share of production overheads appropriate 
to the relevant stage of production. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate. Net realisable value is determined at the 
balance sheet date on commercially saleable products based on estimated selling price less all further costs to completion and all relevant marketing, selling 
and distribution costs. Research and development inventories are fully provided for in the income statement for the year, and are reinstated as appropriate 
if the related products are brought into commercial use.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income statement because it excludes 
items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial 
recognition (other than a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.

2 Accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable 
proﬁts will be available to allow the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited 
in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Leases
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases 
are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each 
determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁnance lease obligation. Lease payments 
are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly against income. Such assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the length of the lease. 
Assets purchased under hire purchase agreements are accounted for similarly, except that these assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Government grants
Government grants towards staff retraining costs are recognised as income over the periods in which the related costs are incurred and are deducted 
in reporting the related expense.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the useful lives 
of the assets concerned.
Pensions
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt scheme for all members of staff who wish to participate. The funds of the scheme are administered 
by trustees and are independent of the Group’s ﬁnances. The Group’s contributions are charged in the income statement as they fall due.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, Share-Based Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied 
to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005. 
The Group grants share options to Directors and employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant 
and expensed on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the option, based on the estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest.
The share options granted have varying performance criteria required for the option to vest and these are considered in the method of measuring the fair 
value. Where it is considered appropriate, the fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model. Where complex market performance criteria exist, 
a simulation model has been used, based on the same underlying methodology as the Black-Scholes model, to establish the fair value on grant.
Convertible loan notes
Following adoption of IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, by the Group on 1 April 2005, convertible loan notes are regarded as 
compound ﬁnancial instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component 
is established by using an estimate for a similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the 
fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative carrying amounts at the date 
of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component consists of the coupon rate and the element of the equity component proportionate to the liability component 
outstanding. This latter part is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan notes. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their face value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their face value.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the ﬁnancial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group uses foreign exchange forward 
contracts and options to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of ﬁnancial 
derivatives is in accordance with the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which is to hedge the foreign currency exposure from the expected 
US dollar sales on a rolling twelve month basis. 
Prior to the adoption of IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, 
on 1 April 2005, where a derivative instrument was used to hedge an asset denominated in a foreign currency, the effect of the instrument, being the 
difference between the closing and hedged rate of exchange for these assets, was carried separately on the balance sheet as a ﬁnancial asset.

Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of the cash ﬂow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities 
on the balance sheet.
Financial guarantees
Where the Company enters into ﬁnancial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers 
these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability 
until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Financial risk management
The Group’s multinational operations expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, credit risks and 
liquidity risks. The Group undertakes procedures which aim to reduce uncertainty in the ﬁnancial performance of the Group which are discussed below:
 Foreign exchange risk 
  A signiﬁcant element of the Group’s revenue is denominated in US dollars whilst much of its cost base in the provision of these products is denominated 
in sterling. The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts and similar derivatives which typically extend for up to twelve months and cover 70 to 100% 
of anticipated sterling requirements.
 Credit risk
  A signiﬁcant element of the Group’s revenue is generated from sales to one customer in the US. Management are constantly in communication with 
this customer and monitor both sales and payments from this customer to minimise the credit risk exposure.
 Liquidity risk
  The Group maintains a mixture of short and medium-term deposits that are designed to ensure the Group has sufﬁcient available funds for operations 
and planned expansions.
 Interest rate risk
  The Group seeks to mitigate partially against increased interest rates whilst maintaining a degree of ﬂexibility to beneﬁt from decreasing rates of interest 
by holding a mix of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate ﬁnancial liabilities.
3 Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, described in note 2, the management has made the following judgements that have had 
the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.
Revenue recognition
As described in note 2, it is the Group’s policy to recognise non-refundable upfront payments over the period of the earnings process. During the prior year, 
the Group received £16,300,000 from AstraZeneca UK Ltd in a Patent and License Know How agreement. These monies are non-refundable and are being 
recognised as revenue as the varying obligations within the contract are being satisﬁed, estimated to be over a period of seven years. During the current year, 
the Group earned a £10,000,000 milestone from AstraZeneca UK Ltd which has been recognised as revenue in the year since the earnings process for 
the milestone had been completed.
In determining the revenue recognition period, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue per IAS 18, Revenue, and is satisﬁed 
that all requirements have been met by the Group.
Acquisitions
Judgements have been made in respect of the identiﬁcation of intangible assets based on pre-acquisition forecasts, analysis and negotiations. In addition 
to the judgements and estimates made in establishing the intangible assets acquired and their value, in certain instances, these assets are in development 
and are only amortised once the development phase has been completed, although these assets are subjected to impairment review in accordance with 
the accounting policy described in note 2.

5 Segmental reporting 
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two operating segments, the sale, manufacture and development of pharmaceutical products 
and royalties arising from outlicensed technology. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The revenue and costs of each segment are clearly identiﬁable and allocated to each segment accordingly. There are no inter-segmental revenues. The exceptional 
item shown within cost of sales for the prior year is included within the sale, manufacture and development of pharmaceutical products operating segment.

  During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Group completed a major upgrade and expansion of its manufacturing facility in Wales. During this phase of the work, the facility was 
shutdown for a substantial part of the year incurring £1,362,000 of expenditure which, under normal circumstances would have been absorbed into stock manufactured during 
the year. These costs had no effect on the tax credit for the period.

The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme for the beneﬁt of all qualifying Executive Directors and employees. The assets of the scheme 
are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the trustees. Where there are employees who leave the scheme prior to the 
contributions fully vesting in the scheme, the contributions paid by the Group are refunded.
Included within salaries above are bonuses of which £536,000 (2006: £397,000) will be paid into the Group’s deﬁned contribution pension scheme, 
as disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration report on page 36.
Pension contributions of £87,000 (2006: £74,000) were included in accruals at the year end for the Group. No accruals were included in the Company 
for the current and prior years.
In addition to the wages and salaries analysis above are the effects of the share-based compensation charge to the Group during the year of £703,000

Transactions with Directors
On 3 January 2007, the Group completed the acquisition of MacroMed Inc. (subsequently renamed Protherics Salt Lake City Inc.). Dr J Gonella was a 
Non-executive Director and shareholder of MacroMed Inc. In consideration for his interest in MacroMed Inc., Dr Gonella received 8,245,815 Protherics PLC 
2p ordinary shares, valued at £6,102,000 at the date of the transaction with a further 916,202 2p ordinary shares, valued at £678,000 at the date of the 
transaction, to be issued 18 months after the date of the transaction.
JG Consulting, a business owned by Dr Gonella, has charged the Group for the provision of consultancy services supplied by employees other than 
Dr Gonella, a total of $71,000 during the year.
During the year, the Company purchased equipment from BCS Global Networks Limited, a company for which S M Wallis is a Director, at a cost of £28,000. 
BCS Global Networks Limited also provided services amounting to £5,000 in the year. In addition, the Company also purchased services at a cost of £1,000 
from LCG Limited, a company for which S M Wallis is Chairman. 
All the transactions are considered by the Board to be at arms-length.

Corporation tax in the UK is calculated at 30% (2006: 30%) of the estimated assessable proﬁt for the year. Taxes for other jurisdictions are calculated at the 
rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The UK tax credits arising in the current and prior years were as a result of research and development expenditure claimed under the Finance Act 2000. 
The tax for the year is lower (2006: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK (30%). The differences are explained below:

10 Tax continued
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 30% (2006: 30%). The movement on the deferred tax 
account is as shown below:

The deferred tax asset, which relates to trading losses incurred in Australia, has been recognised in the Financial Statements following the development 
of the Group’s products in prior years and the Directors are of the opinion, based on recent and forecast trading, that the level of proﬁts in Australia in 
the forthcoming years will lead to the realisation of this asset.
In addition to the losses on which the deferred tax asset has been recognised, the Group has additional taxable losses and other timing differences in 
the United Kingdom and the United States which arose as a result of the research and development incurred during the start-up of the Group’s activities. 
These losses are available for offset against future taxable proﬁts in these territories. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses 
and other temporary differences since the Group does not anticipate generating sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts to utilise these losses within the immediate future 
and consequently the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is uncertain. The total amount of deferred tax asset not recognised, measured at 30%, the rate 
of corporation tax in the United Kingdom (2006: 30%) is approximately £23 million of which £1 million related to temporary differences and £22 million was 
in respect of losses (2006: approximately £27 million, of which £4 million related to temporary differences and £23 million was in respect of losses). 
The movements in the deferred tax asset and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12, Income Taxes) 
during the year are as shown below. The deferred tax asset and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an 
intention to settle the balance net.

There were no recognised deferred tax liabilities at 31 March 2007 or 31 March 2006.
At 31 March 2007 the Group had tax losses, subject to the agreement of the Taxation Authorities, of approximately £84 million (2006: £72 million) available for 
offset against future taxable proﬁts of the same trade. Included within these total losses, approximately £24.7 million (2006: £18.6 million) relates to Protherics Inc., 
and of these, the use of £21.6 million is restricted to US$2.7 million per year.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax 
liabilities had not been recognised was £nil (2006: £nil). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position 
to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
In March 2007, proposals were announced to change the UK rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008. This will reduce the 
deferred tax asset available in future periods.
11 Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
during the year. For diluted loss per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue would be adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. The Company would have three categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options, warrants and the 6% unsecured 
convertible loan notes.
The Company has been loss making in both the current and prior year and as such, should the Company be called upon to issue shares, the effect would 
be anti-dilutive.
The calculation of the basic and diluted loss per share is based on the loss of £3,357,000 (2006: £9,488,000) and on 285,365,704 ordinary shares 
(2006: 246,854,698) being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue. The weighted average number of shares in issue for the year ended 
31 March 2006 has been adjusted for the cash placing and open offer during the current year. This had no effect on the loss per share previously reported.

The goodwill at 31 March 2006 arose on the acquisition of Enact Pharma PLC in June 2003 with the addition in the current year arising from the acquisition 
of MacroMed Inc., each of which is considered to be a separate cash-generating unit.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. At 31 March 2007 there were 
no accumulated impairment losses. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined from a value in use calculation. 
The key assumptions for the value in use calculation are those regarding the launch dates of products which in the cases of Enact Pharma PLC and 
MacroMed Inc. are principally Voraxaze™ and OncoGel
TM
 respectively, the expected unit sales, and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs 
during the year. Changes are based on expectations of future changes in the market. A discount rate of 14% has been applied. The calculations are based 
upon the most recent cash ﬂow forecasts covering the next ten years in the case of Voraxaze™ and twelve years in the case of OncoGel
TM
. These forecasts 
have been approved by management.
The Company had no goodwill.

A signiﬁcant proportion of the Group’s revenue is generated by the sale of its CroFab™ and DigiFab™ products into the US through its distribution agreement 
with Fougera, a division of Altana Inc., which would generally make up the majority of the trade receivables. The carrying value of this and other trade receivables 
has been determined by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. The average credit 
period taken on sales of goods is 30 days. At 31 March 2007, trade receivables included an amount of £10,000,000 due from AstraZeneca UK Ltd in relation 
to a milestone due on the CytoFab™ licence agreement, an amount which was invoiced in March 2007 and paid in April 2007. The Directors consider that the 
carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

During the year, capital grants of £nil (2006: £250,000) were received and £111,000 (2006: £78,000) was released to the income statement. As a result of 
these grants, the Welsh Development Agency has a legal charge over certain buildings, plant and equipment securing grants received amounting to £33,000 
and the Group is required to maintain certain employment levels at its Welsh manufacturing facility.
The Company had no deferred income.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

20 Borrowings continued
The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
  The Group’s sterling loan was obtained upon the acquisition of Enact Pharma PLC in June 2003. The loan was taken out by Enact Pharma PLC in June 2002. 
Repayments commenced in March 2003 and will continue until August 2007. The loan is secured over the assets of that company and its immediate 
subsidiaries. The loan carries a ﬁxed interest rate of 8% per annum.
  The Group’s US dollar denominated loan was taken out in August 2004. Repayments commenced in September 2004 and will continue until August 2009, 
when substantially all of the principal received on inception will become repayable. The loan is secured by a charge over certain of the Group’s assets 
and carries an interest rate of 5.625%.
  The notes payable to the South Australian Minister for Primary Industries (the “Minister”) are secured on buildings and equipment of Protherics 
Australasia Pty Limited. Repayment is in instalments, with the ﬁnal instalment due in April 2008. The interest rate is variable at the discretion of the 
Minister and is currently in line with market interest rates.
21 6% convertible unsecured loan notes
The 6% convertible unsecured loan notes, denominated in sterling, were issued on 19 June 2003 as part of the consideration to acquire Enact Pharma PLC. 
Interest on the loan notes is payable twice annually in arrears. If not previously repaid, converted or repurchased, the loan notes will be repaid at par on 
19 June 2010. The loan notes are convertible at 25p per ordinary share, at the holder’s option, from the earlier of 19 December 2004, or such date that the 
Company has received FDA marketing approval for Voraxaze™ but in any event no earlier than 19 June 2004. The Company can enforce conversion should the 
principal amount of the loan notes outstanding be equal to 20% or less of the total notes issued at any time, or if the middle market quotation of an ordinary 
share at the close of a consecutive ﬁve business day period after 19 June 2006 is greater than 32.5p. The terms of the loan notes permit the Company to 
repurchase the loan notes at any time by tender (available to all holders alike) or by privately negotiated transactions with individual holders at any price.
Upon adoption of IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Information, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, at 1 April 2005, 
the net proceeds received from the issue of the 6% convertible unsecured loan notes have been split between the liability element and an equity component, 
representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the liability into the equity of the Group, as follows:
Group and Company          £’000
Nominal value of convertible loan notes issued         7,196
Equity component at date of issue          (711)
Liability component at date of issue          6,485
          2007 2006 
Group and Company         £’000 £’000
Liability component at 1 April         2,469 3,480
Interest charged         41 57
Liability converted to equity         (410) (1,068)
Liability component at 31 March         2,100 2,469
The Directors estimate that the fair value of the liability component at 31 March 2007 to be approximately £2,047,000 (2006: £2,424,000) using an interest rate 
to discount estimated future cash ﬂows of 9.8% (2006: 9%).
During the current year, an additional loan note amounting to £17,000, with identical terms to the original loan notes above, was issued following the exercise 
of warrants in Enact Pharma Limited (see note 24). The note was considered to be wholly equity and was converted in its entirety shortly after issue.
In addition, a non-interest bearing loan note, repayable at par on 31 March 2026, was issued to CoVaccine BV as consideration for the in-license of the 
CoVaccine HT adjuvant. The €350,000 loan note could be converted into 295,413 Protherics PLC ordinary 2p shares.
Net proceeds received from the issue of this loan note was split between the liability element and the equity component, representing the fair value of the 
embedded option to convert the liability into the equity of the Group as follows:
Group and Company          £’000
Nominal value of convertible loan note issued         242
Equity component at date of issue          (169)
Liability component at date of issue          73
The entire loan note was converted during the year.

28 Acquisition of business operations 
On 3 January 2007, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of MacroMed Inc. (subsequently renamed Protherics Salt Lake City Inc.), 
a private US Company, in order to access its lead product OncoGel
TM
, a novel sustained release formulation of Paclitaxel for local administration in 
oesophageal and brain cancers. Prior to the acquisition, the Group had loaned $1,000,000 to MacroMed Inc.
The goodwill arising on acquisition results from assets which cannot be recognised separately and measured reliably including early stage pipeline products 
and a highly skilled workforce.
Protherics Salt Lake City Inc. contributed revenue of £26,000 and a loss of £637,000 in the period since acquisition.

30 Share-based payments 
The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2, Share-Based Payments to all share-based awards and options granted post 7 November 2002 that had not vested 
by 1 January 2005. These options have been issued under the Unapproved Share Option Plan, individual option arrangements, the Executive Share Option 
Plan (“ESOP”), the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), Savings Related Share Option Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Under the Unapproved Share Option Plan and the ESOP , the Remuneration Committee can grant options over shares in the Company to employees of the 
Group. Options are granted with a ﬁxed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of the grant. The vesting period is 
generally three years and subject to performance criteria. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options 
expire. Furthermore, except in deﬁned circumstances, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the option vests.
Under the LTIP , the Remuneration Committee can grant equity-settled options over shares in the Company but these awards are generally reserved for Directors 
and employees at Senior Manager level. The options are granted at a ﬁxed exercise price which is generally equal to the nominal value of the shares under 
the award. As with the above plans, the vesting period is generally three years, subject to performance criteria and, if the options remain unexercised after 
a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, except in deﬁned circumstances, options are forfeited if the employee leaves 
the Group before the option vests.
Awards under the Savings Related Share Option Plan are made available to all employees who have been with the Company for more than six months. 
Options under this plan are awarded at a discount of up to 20% of the market price of the shares under option at the date of the invitation to enter the plan. 
The vesting period is either three or ﬁve years with a six month period to exercise after the vesting period. There are no performance criteria attached to 
these options. The options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group during the vesting period.
Under the Deferred Bonus Plan, the Remuneration Committee can grant options over shares in the Company but these awards are generally reserved for 
Directors and employees at Senior Manager level. The options are granted at a ﬁxed price which is generally equal to the nominal value of the shares under 
the award. The vesting period is generally two years, with no performance criteria. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date 
of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, except in deﬁned circumstances, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the option vests.

The share options granted have varying performance criteria required for the option to vest and these are considered in the method of measuring the fair 
value. Where it is considered appropriate, the fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model. Where complex market performance criteria exist, 
a simulation model has been used, based on the same underlying methodology as the Black-Scholes model, to establish the fair value on grant.
The fair values of the options granted, performance criteria, and the assumptions used in the calculation of fair value are as follows:

(1)  To vest, the Company’s share price is required to outperform the average price of shares in the FTSE All Share Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index in any three year period 
commencing on or after the date of grant of the option. 
(2)  Performance will be measured once only after three years from the date of grant of the option. If the Total Shareholder Return of the Company reaches the median of the FTSE 
All Share Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index, one third of the shares under option become exercisable, rising on a sliding scale such that all the shares under option become 
exercisable if the Company’s performance is at or above the upper quartile. The Remuneration Committee must also be satisﬁed that there has been an improvement in the 
Company’s underlying ﬁnancial performance over the period.
(3) As (2) except that performance measured after ﬁve years.
(4)  Provided the Remuneration Committee is satisﬁed that the Company has achieved sound underlying performance, awards will vest based on the Company’s Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”). Performance will be measured after three years from grant by measuring the TSR of the Company against a comparator group consisting of the primary listed 
components of the FTSE All Share Pharmaceutical and Biotech Index but excluding those companies in the FTSE 100 (currently AstraZeneca PLC, GlaxoSmithKline PLC and 
Shire plc). TSR will normally be averaged across a period of three months before the date of the award and three months before the date on which the performance period ends, 
although the Committee may determine that a different averaging period is appropriate and properly reﬂective of management performance but in any event this will not be 
more than six months or less than one month. No award will vest if the Company’s TSR is below the median of the comparator group, 30% will vest if the Company’s TSR is 
at the median position, 80% if the Company’s TSR is at the upper quartile and 100% if at the upper decile. Awards will vest on a sliding scale between each step.
(5) Granted to non-employee.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the expected life, being the average expected period to exercise, of the option as at the date 
of grant. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the expected life at the date of grant.

payment plans was £713,000 (2006: £311,000), all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. 
31 Retirement beneﬁt schemes
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt scheme for all qualifying UK based employees. The assets of the scheme are held separately 
from those of the Group in funds under the control of the trustees. Where there are employees who leave the scheme prior to the contributions made by the 
Group fully vesting, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of the forfeited contributions.
Eligible employees of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries are members of externally operated deﬁned contribution schemes. The only obligation of the Group 
with respect to these schemes is to make the speciﬁed contributions.

The increase in payables for the year ended 31 March 2006 is primarily a result of the increase in deferred income arising from the deferral of non-refundable 
up-front fees received under the Patent and License Know How agreement with AstraZeneca UK Ltd (see note 3). The increase in receivables for the year ended 
31 March 2007 is primarily a result of the amount of £10,000,000 due under the same agreement which was invoiced in March 2007 and paid in April 2007.
Additions to Group plant and equipment during the year amounting to £2,252,000 (2006: £572,000) were ﬁnanced by new ﬁnance leases. Additions to 
Company plant and equipment during the year amounting to £74,000 (2006: £nil) were ﬁnanced by new ﬁnance leases.
Cash and cash equivalents (which are presented as a single class of assets on the face of the balance sheet) comprise cash at bank and other short-term 
highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less.

charges for options granted to employees of subsidiaries of £288,000 (2006: £94,000). The outstanding balances due from/to subsidiary companies

Annual Report 2007 74
Resolution 1
The Directors are required to present the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2007, together with the reports of the Directors and Auditors, 
to the Annual General Meeting.
Resolutions 2, 3, 4 and 5
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and the principles of the Combined Code, Directors offer themselves for re-election after three 
years. Accordingly, John Brown and Garry Watts will retire at the Annual General Meeting and offer themselves for re-election.
Jacques Gonella and Saul Komisar were appointed to the Board on 24 January 2007 and 26 April 2007 respectively. Under the Articles of Association, they 
will step down and offer themselves for election at the Annual General Meeting, which will be the ﬁrst Annual General Meeting following their appointment. 
Biographical details of the Directors are given on page 23 of the Annual Report.
The Board recommends to shareholders the election or re-election of the above Directors. The Board conﬁrms that in making this recommendation, the 
Nomination Committee has given careful consideration to the Board’s balance of skills, knowledge and experience and is satisﬁed that the Non-executive 
Directors putting themselves forward for election or re-election have sufﬁcient time to discharge their duties effectively, taking into account their other commitments.
Resolutions 6 and 7 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP resigned as Auditors during the year and the Directors appointed KPMG Audit Plc to ﬁll the casual vacancy arising. In accordance 
with Section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, special notice has been given pursuant to Section 388 of the Companies Act 1985 of Resolution 6 which is to 
re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as Auditors of the Company until the next general meeting at which accounts are presented. Resolution 7 gives authority to the 
Directors to set the Auditors’ remuneration.
Resolution 8
This resolution is to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the ﬁnancial year ended on 31 March 2007. The report is set out on pages 33 to 39 
of the Annual Report.
Resolution 9
This resolution, to increase the existing authorised share capital of the Company from £9,500,000 to £9,700,000 (an increase of 2.1%), is necessary to 
provide sufﬁcient authorised but unissued shares to satisfy the exercise of options under the Company’s share option arrangements, the acquisition of any 
minority interests which may arise in Enact Pharma Limited, the conversion of the 6% unsecured convertible loan notes, the issue of shares in connection 
with the agreements with CoVaccine BV and in relation to the acquisition of MacroMed Inc., and upon the exercise of any authority given by resolution 10.
Resolution 10
Your Directors may only allot shares or grant rights over shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. The authority granted at the Extraordinary General 
Meeting held on 3 January 2007 is due to expire at this year’s Annual General Meeting. Resolution 10 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant a 
new authority to allot unissued share capital up to an aggregate nominal value of £2,261,519, representing 33.3% of the total issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company as at 4 June 2007. If given, this authority will expire at the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2008. Other than in respect of the Company’s 
share option arrangements, the acquisition of any minority interests which may arise in Enact Pharma Limited, the conversion of the 6% unsecured convertible 
loan notes, the issue of shares in connection with the agreements with CoVaccine BV and in relation to the acquisition of MacroMed Inc., the Directors have 
no present intention of issuing any of the authorised but unissued share capital of the Company.
Resolution 11
Your Directors also require additional authority from shareholders to allot shares or grant rights over shares where they propose to do so for cash and 
otherwise than to existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. The authority granted at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 3 January 2007 
is due to expire at this year’s Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 11 will be proposed as a special resolution to grant such authority.
Apart from rights issues, open offers or any other pro rata offer as mentioned, the authority would be limited to the issue of shares and sales of treasury 
shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £678,456 (being 10% of the issued share capital of the Company at 4 June 2007). If given, this 
authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2008.
Whilst your Company does not have any immediate need to carry out an equity fundraising, we may wish to do so at some stage in the future. At the last 
Extraordinary General Meeting, shareholders supported the resolution to disapply pre-emption rights (which would enable the Company to carry out a cash 
placing) in respect of up to 10% of the Company’s issued share capital. Having carefully considered the recommendations contained in the Myner’s Report 
on pre-emption rights published in February 2005 and the statement issued by the Pre-emption Group in April 2006, your Directors believe it is appropriate 
to seek to renew this greater ﬂexibility to issue shares without further recourse to shareholders. Accordingly your Directors are seeking authority to issue up 
to 10% of the current issued share capital of Protherics for cash without ﬁrst having to offer the shares to shareholders pro rata to their existing shareholdings.
Based on the guidance published by the Pre-Emption Group as to the information likely to be required by shareholders in assessing proposals for disapplication 
of pre-emption rights at higher levels than 5% of current issued share capital, the Directors request shareholders to consider the following: 
(i) Business case
  The strategy of the Company continues to encompass the strengthening of the business in a considered and controlled manner. This could be 
accomplished by a series of product acquisitions in niche market areas, which may be small individually. However, to allow the Company to move quickly, 
sufﬁcient cash reserves are required to best manage these opportunities. The ability to rapidly access funds up to 10% of the existing share capital greatly 
enhances the Company’s ability to exploit these situations.

Annual Report 2007 75
Resolution 11 continued
(ii) Stage of development of the Company
  Existing resources will be reserved to develop the current pipeline of CytoFab™, Voraxaze™, Prolarix™, Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine, OncoGel
TM
, 
and the intellectual property in-licensed at the same time as the MacroMed acquisition in January 2007. The Directors believe that the Company’s 
capacity to generate funds internally in the near future may not be sufﬁcient to expand in a controlled manner without placing undue risk on this 
current development portfolio.
(iii) Stewardship and governance 
  The Directors believe that the total shareholder return produced by the Company against its peer group over the last ﬁve years is testimony to 
its performance over this period. This is demonstrated by the graphs on page 35 included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report section of the 
Annual Report for 2007. 
(iv) Financing options
  It is likely that opportunities which are considered will need some period of development before they are cash generating. Debt ﬁnancing will 
be considered, but may not be the preferred option, given the relatively early stage of development of potential opportunities.
(v) Level of dilution of value and control for existing shareholders
  The Board had the authority to issue up to 10% of the issued share capital non pre-emptively last year. This was fully utilised in conjunction with the £38.2 million 
equity fundraising completed in January 2007, and the additional ﬂexibility provided contributed signiﬁcantly to the success of this transaction. The disapplication 
provision was also used in December 2005 in connection with the licensing of CytoFab™ to AstraZeneca, in which shares were issued to AstraZeneca at a 30% 
premium to the average share price over the three months prior to the announcement of the agreement. Shares totalling 4.3% of the share capital at that time 
were issued for a consideration of £7.5 million. Prior to this, shares representing 5% of the share capital were issued on a non pre-emptive basis in connection 
with a cash placing and open offer of up to 10% of the issued share capital at the time of the acquisition of Enact Pharma PLC in June 2003. £1.5 million 
was raised on a non pre-emptive basis at a price of 16p per ordinary share, a 5.7% discount to the share price immediately before the announcement. 
The Directors believe that all of these transactions have added signiﬁcant value for shareholders.
(vi) Proposed process following approval 
  The Company would seek to engage shareholders in dialogue at the earliest practical opportunity, so that major shareholders have the opportunity to 
express an opinion on any proposed transaction wherever possible, bearing in mind the potential legal and regulatory issues which may be involved. 
Resolution 12
Your Directors are aware that the authority sought by paragraph (ii) of resolution 11 is higher than the more usual level of 5%. If shareholders do not wish 
to authorise the Directors to issue up to 10% of the issued share capital as at 4 June 2007 other than pursuant to a pro rata offer, your Board would still 
want to have authority to make such an issue up to the more usual level of 5%. Accordingly, resolution 12 is being proposed as a special resolution in the 
event that resolution 11 is not passed.
Apart from rights issues, open offers or any other pro rata offer as mentioned, the authority would be limited to the issue of shares and sales of treasury 
shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £339,228 (being 5% of the issued share capital of the Company at 4 June 2007). If given, this authority 
will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2008.
EVEN IF YOU SUPPORT THE PASSING OF RESOLUTION 11, THE DIRECTORS URGE YOU TO ALSO VOTE FOR RESOLUTION 12. 
However, if resolution 11 is passed, resolution 12 will be withdrawn.
Resolution 13
This resolution is to amend the Company’s existing Articles of Association to increase the maximum aggregate amount of fees that may be paid to Directors 
from £200,000 to £400,000. These fees are paid to the Non-executive Directors purely in their capacity as Directors. Your Board believes this increase is appropriate 
as a result of the increased numbers of Non-executive Directors on the Board. These fees are entirely separate to any amounts payable to the Executive 
Directors in their capacity as employees.
Resolution 14
In accordance with the rules of the Protherics PLC 2005 Deferred Bonus Plan (the “DBP”) this resolution is to approve an amendment to its terms to allow 
Deferred Awards to be granted to an individual with a value of up to 75% of Annual Remuneration.
This amendment will allow the Company to structure and offer a remuneration package which would be sufﬁciently competitive to attract and incentivise the 
right calibre of individuals and reﬂects current market practice. 
The current rules of the DBP , impose a limit such that in any year Deferred Awards cannot be granted to an individual with a value greater than 50% of basic 
salary (being the higher of the annual rate of remuneration at the date of grant excluding bonuses, commissions and beneﬁts in kind; or the remuneration, 
excluding bonuses, commissions and beneﬁts in kind paid or payable in respect of the twelve months immediately preceding the date of grant). Deferred 
Awards vest subject to the achievement of performance conditions set at the time of grant. The performance measures are based on annual targets and 
are set by the Grantor each year. 
The resolution is to approve an amendment to the DBP to allow Deferred Awards to be granted to an individual with a value of up to 75% of Annual 
Remuneration PROVIDED THAT to the extent that a Deferred Award exceeds 50% of Annual Remuneration, the vesting of such excess will, in the opinion 
of the Grantor, be dependent on the achievement of a signiﬁcantly more stretching Performance Target.

Positive results
Summary
Your Board is pleased to report a set of 
encouraging results for 2016 which reflects 
the continued progress in building the portfolio 
of capacity on syndicates at Lloyd’ s to generate 
profits for shareholders. The profits before 
goodwill and impairment for the year were 
£1,334,000 (2015: £753,000), whilst the 
adjusted net asset value of the Group is 
£1.96 per share (2015: £2.01).
Underwriting profits from the two older 
underwriting years, the “off-risk” years, made 
a good contribution but the 2016 underwriting 
year in its first 12 months recognised a loss. 
Other income arising from fees from reinsurers 
and investment income has increased this year. 
T otal costs reduced to £1.8m as the expenditure 
on protecting the portfolio using stop loss 
reinsurance was rationalised.
Strategy
We have continued to implement our strategy 
of building the portfolio of syndicate capacity. 
During 2016 the key developments were the:
 » raising of £5.7m of new capital for the 
acquisition of further limited liability vehicles 
(“LLVs”) and enabling the broadening of the 
shareholder base; and
 » £3.9m of the funds raised have been 
utilised to date.
Underwriting result
The calendar year underwriting profits for 2016 
have been generated from results recognised 
in the portfolio from the 2014 to the 2016 
underwriting years as follows:

During 2016, the 2014 underwriting year 
mid-point estimate increased from 8.7% 
return on capacity to a final result of 15.6%. 
The overall return on capacity for 2014 
benefited from the weaker £/US$ exchange 
rate that weakened by 20% in 2016 and from 
below average loss activity. The mid-point 
estimate for the 2015 underwriting year at 
31 December 2016 was 8.2%. This mid-point 
estimate for 2015 has improved to 9.8% 
with the release of updated estimates.
The level of major claims for the whole of 
Lloyd’s during 2016 at £2.1bn was the fifth 
highest since the turn of the century and 
above the long-term average. These losses 
were incurred mainly as a result of Hurricane 
Capacity acquired
During 2016 a further three corporate members were acquired that increased the capacity for 
the 2014 to 2016 years of account, and a further two corporate members have been bought 
since 31 December 2016. These companies have increased the capacity underwritten on the 
2014 to 2017 underwriting years as shown below.

Current total capacity 35.5 34.4 35.9 35.0
These five acquisitions in 2016 and 2017 to date were purchased for a total consideration 
of £8.7m, of which £3.9m was committed from the funds raised from shareholders.
• Adjusted net asset value at 
£1.96 per share (2015: £2.01) 
• Three acquisitions in 2016 
added £5.6m of capacity to 2016 
underwriting year – 20% increase
• Two acquisitions agreed in 2017 
will add £2.4m of capacity to 2017 
underwriting year – an additional 
7% increase
• 5.5p per share total dividend 
payable (2015: 5.0p)
Acquisition strategy continues 
to build the fund of capacity.
We have continued 
to implement our 
strategy of building 
the portfolio of 
syndicate capacity.
Sir Michael Oliver 
Non-executive Chairman Matthew, the earthquake in Japan in April 2016 
and the Fort McMurray Wildfire in Canada. 
Consequently, the 2016 underwriting year 
result in the first 12 months retained by Helios 
made a negative contribution mainly arising 
from this claims experience. The underwriting 
environment remains competitive and pressure 
to reduce underwriting terms and conditions 
is prevalent within most classes of business. 
Nevertheless, we would expect the 2016 
underwriting year to be profitable and early 
indications from the managing agents of the 
syndicates in the portfolio are currently 
forecasting a mid-point estimate of profit 
on capacity of 3.5%.
The underwriting results will remain exposed 
to movements in £/US$ exchange rate due 
to significant underlying US$ exposure.
Other income
Helios generates fees from the quota share 
reinsurers, investment income from the Group 
funds at Lloyd’s and foreign exchange gains.

Fees from reinsurers 557 385

Fees and profit commission from reinsurers 
have increased as the capital committed has 
risen to £13m and as the 2014/15 years are 
recognising increased profits. The Group 
Funds at Lloyd’s are invested to produce 
consistent long-term returns. 
Total costs
The costs of the Group comprise the operating 
expenses and the cost of the stop loss 
protection bought to mitigate the downside 
from large underwriting losses.

Total costs 1,778 1,941
The reduction in the stop loss costs reflects 
the rationalisation of the stop loss reinsurance 
policies acquired in 2016. 
Adjusted net asset value per share
The Board views the adjusted net asset value 
per share (“ANAV”) as the key metric to measure 
the success of the Group. It measures the 
combination of the net tangible asset value 
of Helios and the current market value of the 
portfolio of syndicate capacity. The building 
of a portfolio of participations on leading 
Lloyd’s syndicates remains the strategic 
objective of the Group.

Adjusted net asset 
value per share (£) 1.96 2.01
The issue of shares in the year to raise 
additional funds has restricted the growth in 
ANAV per share. Previously the Board relied 
on the Humphrey’ s valuation that approached 
the valuation in a very similar way and the ANAV 
of £1.99 per share was published last year.
Dividend
Following another successful year, the Board 
is pleased to recommend that the final dividend 
remains the same as last year at 1.5p per 
share which, together with a special dividend 
of 4.0p per share (2015: 3.5p), totals 5.5p 
per share (2015: 5.0p). The special dividend 
equates to approximately 20% of the £3m 
cash released from the 2014 year of account. 
These dividends will be payable to shareholders 
on the register on 9 June 2017. If approved, 
the dividend will be paid in a single payment 
on 7 July 2017. 
Outlook
Our strategy of providing access to insurance 
exposures at Lloyd’s continues to develop. 
We see opportunities to both develop access 
to syndicates at Lloyd’s and to build on the 
structure for participation by private capital.
Although the 2015 underwriting year is 
expected to produce a good result, early 
indications for the 2016 underwriting year 
show lower returns on capacity. We see 
lower expected profitability as an opportunity 
to continue to build the portfolio of capacity 
by purchasing LLUs at reduced prices.
Board 
This is my final set of annual results as 
Chairman, and in the years since we 
launched the Company in 2007 we have 
substantially grown the portfolio of capacity 
and our financial strength. I am delighted 
that Michael Cunningham is taking over 
the role of Chairman.

Continuing to grow
Highlights
Growth in capacity 
through acquisitions
The strategy of building a portfolio of 
underwriting capacity at Lloyd’ s has continued 
through the purchase of further corporate 
members. There remains a steady flow 
of vehicles for sale as existing owners wish 
to cease underwriting due to a change 
of circumstances. Since 1 January 2016 
£7.9m of capacity has been acquired. 
We remain selective on the purchases and 
have encountered reticence from potential 
vendors as the prices offered do not match 
their expectations. Premiums over the 
Humphrey’ s value are no longer paid and as the 
soft market conditions are reflected in the profits 
generated and auction values, we would expect 
discounts on the Humphrey’ s value to increase.
Following the close of 2014 year of account, 
another very profitable year, further vehicles 
are expected to be marketed as the impact 
of the soft insurance market affects the future 
returns to be generated by LLVs. We continue 
to expect resistance from vendors regarding 
our value expectations. There remains a risk 
to the implementation of our strategy if suitable 
vehicles are not available at attractive prices.

Quality of portfolio
We continue to focus ruthlessly on the quality 
syndicates. So, participations on weaker 
syndicates in acquired portfolios are sold to 
maintain the overall quality. The six largest 
participations with the leading managing 
agents at Lloyd’s account for 77% of the 
portfolio. These participations in syndicates 
managed by these managing agents 
represent shares in the better managed 
businesses at Lloyd’s. 
The underwriting results of the Helios portfolio 
have consistently outperformed the Lloyd’s 
market average. Helios’ average return on 
capacity over the last three closed years 
is 14.3% and is on average 3.69% higher 
than the average of the Lloyd’s market. 
The combined ratio of the portfolio (before 
Helios corporate costs) has been 5.79% lower 
on average over the last three calendar years. 
These incremental returns demonstrate the 
diversity and the breadth of underwriting 
expertise within the businesses comprising 
the portfolio of syndicate capacity.
• 77% of the portfolio managed by 
leading managing agents at Lloyd’s 
• Helios portfolio underwriting 
results for 2014 underwriting 
year outperform Lloyd’s average 
return on capacity by 4.7% 
• Helios cedes 70% of portfolio at 
the start of the underwriting year
• Helios expects to retain over 50% 
of overall underwriting result by 
the close of the underwriting year
Maintaining the quality of the portfolio.
Helios return on 
capacity is on average 
3.6% higher than the 
Lloyd’s market over the 
last three closed years.

Reinsurance quota share
The use of quota share reinsurance to 
provide access to the Lloyd’s underwriting 
exposures for reinsurers and private capital 
has been expanded. The core of the panel 
of reinsurers remains XL Group plc and 
Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited.
This reinsurance reduces the exposure 
of the portfolio and assists in the financing 
of the underwriting capital. Helios will seek 
to reinsure a significant proportion of the 
capacity at the start of the underwriting 
year to mitigate the open-year underwriting 
exposures. For corporate members acquired 
during the year, a proportion of the “on-risk” 
capacity will be ceded to reinsurers whilst 
the capacity on older years will be retained 
100% by Helios. Therefore, the proportion 
of the overall capacity that Helios retains 
is expected to rise as further corporate 
members are acquired in the future. The 
profits earned after the company has been 
acquired will be recognised by Helios.
The table shows that the Helios retained 
capacity increases significantly in years 
2 and 3 as further corporate members 
are acquired and the older years are 
not reinsured. Capacity on underwriting 
years after 18 months of development 
is substantially “off risk” as the underlying 
insurance contracts have mostly expired. 
Therefore, the profits from the capacity 
on the older years are retained 100% by 
Helios. The proportion of overall capacity 
retained by Helios for the 2015 and 2016 
underwriting years is expected to increase 
to approximately 50% as further corporate 
members are acquired.

Strategic report
Annual report and financial statements 2016 — Helios Underwriting plc 7 Development of profit estimates
As Helios has no active involvement in the 
underwriting or management of the syndicates 
on which it participates, it relies on information 
on forecast profitability of the portfolio that is 
released on a quarterly basis by the managing 
agents of the syndicates. The managing 
agents have traditionally been conservative 
in the estimation of the profitability of a year 
of account, waiting until the development of 
the underlying reserves for the claims can 
be assessed with greater certainty. 
The capacity acquired on the “off-risk” years 
that is retained 100% by Helios contributes 
a significant part of the profits of the Group. 
The chart below indicates that a significant 
proportion of the improvement in the estimates 
of profitability of syndicates are declared by 
the managing agents in the last 12 months 
to the close of an underwriting year. Helios 
benefits from the conservative nature of the 
managing agents.
Risk management
Helios continues to ensure that the portfolio 
is well diversified across classes of businesses 
and managing agents at Lloyd’s. 
The purchase of quota share reinsurance cedes 
70% of the risk on the younger or “on-risk” 
years, which has remained consistent for 
the last three years. The market conditions 
continue to soften even as the incidence 
of insured natural disasters and large loss 
events have been above normal expectations 
in 2016. This has allowed the insurance 
industry to generate adequate returns 
on capital and thereby attract new capital 
to the industry. 
There is today a strong consensus in the 
insurance industry that the continued 
pressure on rates will have to slow shortly. 
It might take a catastrophe, or series of 
catastrophes, on a very large scale to 
materially turn the market for short-tail lines 
of business. The high aggregation of coastal 
exposures in the US and other developed 
markets is one reason why such massive 
dislocations cannot be ruled out. 
The biggest single risk faced by insurers 
arises from the possibility of mispricing 
insurance on a large scale. This is mitigated 
by the diversification of the syndicate 
portfolio and by the depth of management 
experience within the syndicates that Helios 
supports. These management teams have 
weathered multiple market cycles and the 
risk management skills employed should 
reduce the possibility of substantial 
under-reserving of previous-year underwriting.
We assess the downside risk in the event 
of a major loss through the monitoring of the 
aggregate net losses estimated by managing 
agents to the catastrophe risk scenarios 
(“CRS”) prescribed by Lloyd’s. 
The individual syndicate net exposures will 
depend on the business underwritten during 
the year and the reinsurance protections 
purchased at syndicate level.
The aggregate exceedance probability 
(“AEPs”) assess the potential impact across 
the portfolio from either single or multiple 
large losses with a probability of occurring 
greater than once in a 30-year period.
In addition, Helios buys stop loss reinsurance 
that will mitigate the impact of a significant 
loss to the portfolio.
For 2017, the scope of the stop loss cover has 
been rationalised and terms have been included 
which will assist in funding a large loss.

Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2016 8 Capacity value
The value of the portfolio of the syndicate 
capacity remains the major asset of the 
Group and an important factor in delivering 
overall returns to shareholders. The adjusted 
net asset value (“ANAV”), being the value of 
the net tangible assets of the Group, 
together with the current value of the 
portfolio capacity, is a key management 
metric in determining growth in value 
to shareholders. 
The Board recognises that the average prices 
derived from the annual capacity auctions 
managed by the Corporation at Lloyd’s could 
be subject to material change if the level of 
demand for syndicate capacity reduces. 
Notwithstanding the average prices derived 
from the auction process, each of the syndicates 
will have a track record of trading profitability 
and generating cash.
The 2016 auctions valued the Helios portfolio 
at 31 December 2016 at £14.9m. Applying 
the 2015 auction average prices to the same 
portfolio, the overall value was very similar at 
£14.9m. There were variations in the prices 
achieved by individual syndicates between 
the years. 
The accounting policy requires an assessment 
of the carrying value of each syndicate 
participation against the latest average 
auction prices. The impairment charge 
for this year of £555,000 (2015: £63,000) 
results in a reduction in the fair value of the 
syndicate capacity held on the balance sheet. 
The two syndicates that mainly contributed 
to this impairment charge were Syndicate 
2010 (Cathedral) and Syndicate 386 (QBE 
Liability). The excess supply of capacity over 
demand for these participations at the last 
auction, the Board believes, was due to 
circumstances peculiar to each syndicate. 
Should the average auction prices for these 
two syndicates exceed the current carrying 
value in the future; the impairment charge 
could be reversed.
These movements in the carrying value of 
capacity have no impact on cash flow.
For calculation of the ANAV, the carrying 
value of the capacity in the balance sheet 
is replaced by the total current portfolio 
value. Therefore, this impairment charge 
does not impact the ANAV of the Group.

Helios has generated free cash of £3m in 
2016 (2015: £1.8m) from the distribution of 
its share of the final underwriting profits of the 
2014 underwriting year. These profits have 
assisted in funding the recent acquisitions 
and will provide working capital for the next 
12 months. 
Corporate, social and 
environmental responsibility
Helios aims to meet its expectations of 
its shareholders and other stakeholders 
in recognising, measuring and managing 
the impacts of its business activities. 
As Helios manages a portfolio of Lloyd’s 
syndicate capacity, it has no direct responsibility 
for the management of those businesses. 
Each managing agent has responsibility 
for the management of those businesses, 
their staff and employment policies and 
the environmental impact. 
Therefore, the Board does not consider 
it appropriate to monitor or report any 
performance indicators in relation to 
corporate, social or environmental matters.
Sir Michael Oliver has been our Chairman 
since the Company was created in 2007. 
Sadly he has decided that it is time to 
stand down at this year’s AGM in June. 
His experience and wise counsel was 
invaluable when the Company was launched 
as a new spread underwriting vehicle and 
has continued to be through all stages of 
its development. I would like to take this 
opportunity to extend our heartfelt gratitude 
to him and wish him well for the future.

Strategic report
Annual report and financial statements 2016 — Helios Underwriting plc 9 The underwriting results of the Helios portfolio 
of syndicates have consistently outperformed 
the Lloyd’ s market average both on an annually 
accounted basis measured by combined ratio 
and on a three-year account basis, measured 
by return on underwriting capacity. 
The calendar year combined ratio of the 
portfolio (before Helios corporate costs) was 
94.6% in 2016 (2015: 83.4%). The Helios 
portfolio continues to outperform the Lloyd’s 
combined ratio, which was 97.9% in 2016. 
The increase in the calendar year combined 
ratio was driven in large part by a series 
of major losses. These losses included 
Hurricane Matthew and wildfires at Fort 
McMurray in Canada. Despite the major 
losses suffered during 2016, the 2016 
three-year account is expected to remain 
profitable, although property reinsurance 
remains on risk until 30 June 2017, while 
other classes of business can be on risk 
until 31 December 2017.
Over the last three calendar years, the average 
combined ratio of the Helios portfolio was 86.4%, 
outperforming Lloyd’ s by 5.7 percentage points 
a year. These incremental returns compared 
with the Lloyd’s market average demonstrate 
the quality of the syndicates in the Helios 
portfolio. The chart below shows the 
combined ratio of the Helios portfolio 
compared with Lloyd’s for the last three 
calendar years from 2014 to 2016.
With the closure of the 2014 account at 
31 December 2016 the Helios portfolio has 
outperformed Lloyd’s for the sixth successive 
three-year account result, reporting a profit of 
15.6% on capacity compared with the Lloyd’s 
market average of 10.9% of capacity, an 
outperformance of 4.7% of capacity. The 
chart below shows the return on capacity of 
the Helios portfolio compared with Lloyd’s for 
the last two closed years from 2013 to 2014 
and includes the mid-point estimated results 
for the 2015 account at Q8.
Underwriting profitability is set to continue for 
the 2015 account with the mid-point estimate 
for the Helios portfolio at Q8 in 2015 being 
8.1% of capacity compared with the Lloyd’s 
market average of 3.8% of capacity.
Global insured major losses, according to 
Swiss Re Sigma, were the highest since 2012 
at $54bn in 2016, up from $38bn in 2015 and 
in line with the inflation adjusted annual average 
for the last ten years of $53bn a year.
The largest insured loss in 2016 was the 
earthquake in Japan in April, with claims 
of $4.9bn. The second costliest event was 
Hurricane Matthew, which resulted in insured 
losses of $4bn in the US and the Caribbean. 
Hurricane Matthew, made landfall in Haiti 
as a Category 4 storm on 4 October 2016, 
before following the US coastline for hundreds 
of miles until it made landfall again in South 
Carolina on 8 October 2016 after causing 
storm surge, wind and flood damage, beach 
erosion and infrastructure damage in Florida 
through to North Carolina. 
Hurricane Matthew was a reminder of the 
potential insurance and reinsurance exposures 
from a major hurricane. Research by insurance 
company Validus calculated that had Matthew 
tracked just 30 miles to the west the insured 
loss could have been nearly ten times greater 
than the actual loss at $38bn, while Lloyd’s 
itself models a Florida windstorm landing in 
Miami-Dade County with total insured losses 
of $131bn. Insured losses of either magnitude 
would likely have had a significant impact on 
catastrophe reinsurance rates. 
Outperformance by syndicates 
continues to be expected 
Market conditions remain competitive despite early signs 
of capacity withdrawals from some lines of business.

Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2016 10 Financial year results for 2016 reported 
by Lloyd’s and its competitors highlight the 
challenge in an average year for major losses 
of producing an underwriting profit with limited 
support from investment yields and declining 
prior year releases.
The insurance market in 2017
Market conditions remain the most competitive 
in Lloyd’s since the late 1990s when Lloyd’s 
reported four consecutive years of underwriting 
losses on a three-year account basis. So far 
in 2017, the trend of rate reductions has 
continued in most classes of business other 
than motor. There are signs that the level 
of rate reductions is beginning to moderate 
both in insurance and reinsurance classes, 
prompted in some cases by withdrawals 
of capacity.
For 2017, Hampden has a target profit, 
excluding prior year loss reserve development, 
of 0% to 5% of capacity assuming a long-term 
average for catastrophe losses. Pure year 
profitability is becoming increasingly dependent 
on major loss experience. The balance of 
power continues to shift from net sellers of 
reinsurance to net buyers of reinsurance, with 
the traditional reinsurance market facing 
increasing competition from alternative 
capital. Guy Carpenter calculates that 
alternative capital’s market share of global 
reinsurance capital has grown from 8% 
in 2008 to 19% in 2016. 
The return expectations from many alternative 
capital investors are modest. In a 2016 survey, 
Clear Path Analysis spoke to 108 institutional 
asset managers in Europe and the United States 
asking what returns they looked for in Insurance 
Linked Securities. The most frequent target 
return expected by over 30% of those surveyed 
was in the range of 3% to 5%. Despite these 
modest return expectations institutional investors 
continue to be attracted by the low correlation 
of insurance returns to other financial assets.
Syndicates in the Helios portfolio are adapting 
to current market conditions by buying more 
reinsurance or retrocession protection. The 
reinsurance cession ratio of the Helios portfolio 
increased from 17.9% in 2015 to 20.2% in 
2016. Part of the reason for this increase was 
due to portfolio composition – on a like-for-like 
basis the increase in the reinsurance cession 
ratio was from 17.6% to 18.9%. 
The rating environment
Property catastrophe reinsurance rates at 
1 January 2017 have now declined for five 
years in succession. Guy Carpenter’s Global 
Rate on Line Index reduced by 3.7% at 
1 January 2017, compared with reductions 
of 8.8% a year earlier.
Property and casualty insurance rates in the 
United States began to decline during the 
first quarter of 2015. Rates have continued 
to reduce for nine successive quarters with 
the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers 
reporting rate reductions averaging 2.5% 
in Q1 2017, although the quantum of rate 
reductions is showing signs of moderating 
from reductions reported of 3.3% in Q4 2016.
The economy drives the property casualty 
insurance industry with net written premiums, 
a proxy for demand, tracking nominal GDP 
fairly well other than in “hard markets”. For 
the full year 2016, US nominal GDP grew by 
2.9%, down from 3.7% in 2015. Net written 
premium growth for all property/casualty 
insurers in the US was 2.8% for the first three 
quarters of 2016. Since the recession ended 
in Q2 2009 the economic recovery measured 
by real GDP growth has been muted compared 
with previous post-recession recoveries, only 
growing faster than 3% (at an annual rate) in 
a calendar quarter eight times out of 31 quarters 
and once in the last ten.
Supply of capital at all-time highs
Good underwriting results continue to attract 
capital to both the insurance industry and, in 
particular, the reinsurance industry searching 
for yield. Much of this is “alternative capital” 
and focused on reinsurance business through 
short-term structures such as catastrophe 
bonds and collateralised reinsurance. During 
2016 global reinsurer capital again reached 
a record high, according to Aon Benfield, of 
$595bn, increasing by 5% at the 2015 year end. 
Alternative capital grew by 13% to $81bn 
principally reflecting additional deployment 
into collateralised reinsurance structure. 
The insurance cycle is a classic supply-led cycle 
where pricing is driven more by changes in the 
supply of capital to the market than changes 
in demand for insurance and reinsurance. 
The growth in alternative capital has had a 
dramatic impact on pricing with Guy Carpenter 
assessing rate decreases on reinsurance cover 
bought through insurance-linked securities 
as high as 30% in the fourth quarter of 2016, 
which compares with much more modest 
rate reductions for global reinsurance at 
1 January 2017 of 3.7%. 
Global reinsurance capital has increased 
by 75% since 2008 while insurance capital 
measured by the United States property and 
casualty policyholders’ surplus also reached 
a record high at the end of 2016 of $701bn, 
an increase of 54% on 2008. 
In current market conditions profit-orientated 
organic growth is difficult and is the reason 
why many listed companies favour capital 
management with excess capital being repaid 
to shareholders through share buy-backs or 
special dividends. Capital repatriation is a 
reflection of underwriting discipline with Beazley, 
Lancashire and Hiscox ranked in the top four 
for capital repatriation out of 23 major reinsurers 
in the Aon Benfield Aggregate Report for 2016 
measured by dividends and share buy-backs 
as a percentage of opening equity. It is no 
coincidence that syndicates managed by 
Beazley (Syndicate 623), Hiscox (Syndicate 33) 
and Lancashire (Syndicate 2010) comprise in 
total 27.5% of the Helios syndicate portfolio 
for 2017. 
Investment returns 
no longer provide a 
cushion to sub par 
underwriting.
Strategic report
Annual report and financial statements 2016 — Helios Underwriting plc 11 Lloyd’s Advisers’ report – Hampden Agencies continued
The investment environment
Declining bond yields in 2016 boosted 
investment returns with the US ten-year 
treasury yield declining from 2.2% on average 
in 2015 to 1.8% in 2016. The yield on the 
US ten-year treasury has been below 3% for 
over five years. As long as new money yields 
are below the embedded yield (purchase 
price) of maturing bonds, portfolio yields of 
insurers will continue to fall, putting upward 
pressure on premium rates. Research from 
the Insurance Information Institute suggests 
that US insurers at year-end 2016 were 
earning a pre-tax new money yield of 1.6% 
compared with a pre-tax embedded yield 
of 3.0% using the US-five year treasury 
note as a proxy for new money yield. 
The importance of 
conservative reserving 
Bottom-line results in the current rating 
environment continue to be reliant on 
conservative reserving, given Hampden’s 
modest forecast for pure year underwriting 
return on the 2017 account in a range of 0% 
to 5% of capacity. We consider the Helios 
portfolio of syndicates to be conservatively 
reserved overall with the last three-year account 
closed result for 2014 including a prior release 
of 4.0% of capacity from the 2013 and prior 
years. Going forward, however, we see some 
moderation of reserve releases given that the 
“hard market” years of 2002–2006 reserves 
on liability business have now largely been 
distributed whilst market conditions have 
been more competitive since 2007. 
A continued focus on quality
Our focus in this market is to focus syndicate 
portfolios on quality syndicates with key success 
characteristics, being conservative reserving 
and a focus on profit rather than growth.
The Helios portfolio for 2017 continues to 
provide a good spread of business across 
managing agents and classes of business. 
The two largest classes of business remain 
reinsurance at 26.0% (2016: 28.6%) and 
US dollar property insurance at 16.9% 
(2016: 17.7%) shown in the first “doughnut” 
chart below.
The measure of quality assessed by Hampden is 
the grading we assign each year to syndicates. 
Syndicates graded “D” are not recommended 
for support while the four positive gradings 
range from “AA” (excellent), “A” (very good), 
“B” (good), “C” (market average).
Helios continues to focus its portfolio on the 
quality syndicates which have traditionally 
outperformed the Lloyd’s market result to 
a greater degree in “soft market” conditions 
compared with “hard market” conditions. 
The Helios portfolio split by Hampden grading 
for 2017 contains 56% (2016: 55.6%) 
underwriting capacity in syndicates graded 
“AA” and “A” by Hampden, as shown in 
the second “doughnut” chart below.

Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2016 12 Summary financial information
The information set out below is a summary of the key items that the Board assesses in estimating the financial position of the Group. 
Given the Board has no active role in the management of the syndicates within the portfolio, the following approach is taken.
A) It relies on the quarterly syndicate forecasts to assess its share of the underlying profitability of the syndicates within the portfolio.
B)  It calculates the amounts due to/from the quota share reinsurers in respect of their share of the profits/losses as well as fees and 
commissions due.
C) An adjustment is made to exclude pre-acquisition profits on companies bought in the year.
D) Costs relating to stop loss reinsurance and operating costs are deducted.

Report of the Directors – Year ended 31 December 2016
The Directors present their report and the audited Group and Parent Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Principal activity, review of the business and future developments
The Company’s principal activity is to provide a limited liability investment for its shareholders in the Lloyd’s insurance market.
The Group participates in the Lloyd’s insurance market through its participation in a portfolio of Lloyd’s syndicates.
A more detailed review of the business for the year and outlook for the future is included in the Chairman’ s Statement, the Chief Executive’ s Review 
and the Lloyd’s Advisers’ Report.
Results and dividends
The Group result for the year ended 31 December 2016 is shown in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Group profit 
for the year after taxation was £713,000 (restated 2015 (Note 27): £910,000).
A dividend of 5.0p per share was paid during calendar year 2016 totalling £525,000 (2015: £457,000).
Charitable and political donations
During the year, the Group made no political or charitable donations.
Directors and their interests
Under the Articles of Association, one-third of the Directors are required to retire from the Board by rotation at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting and may offer themselves for re-election as Directors. As the Board consists of six Directors, two are required to retire by rotation.  
Nigel Hanbury and Andrew Christie therefore retire by rotation and offer themselves for re-election as Directors of the Company.
Policy and practice on the payment of creditors
It is the Group’s policy to:

Corporate governance statement – Year ended 31 December 2016
The Company’s shares are traded on AIM of the London Stock Exchange. The Company is not required to report on compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”); however, the Board of Directors acknowledges the importance of the principles of the Code 
and also the recommendations of the Quoted Companies Alliance in its publication “Corporate Governance Guidelines for Small and Mid-size 
Quoted Companies” and seeks to apply them as appropriate to the Company given its nature and size. 
Board
The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Company’s strategy, budgets and corporate actions. The Company 
holds Board meetings at least four times each financial year and at other times as and when required.
Board balance, Independence and review
The Board consists of two Executive Directors and four Non-executive Directors. The Board concludes that all the Non-executive Directors 
are independent in character and judgement. The Board will review on an ongoing basis whether there are relationships or circumstances 
which are likely to affect or could affect the independence of the Non-executive Directors.
The Board continually considers its own performance and effectiveness and that of its Committees. Throughout the year the Board has 
continued to review and assess all policies and practices to comply wherever possible with corporate governance best practice.
Committees
Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are Michael Cunningham and Andrew Christie, who chairs the Committee. The Committee met twice 
during the year to fulfil its duties and with auditors without management present.
The Committee is comprised of independent Non-executive Directors only. The major tasks undertaken by the Committee include monitoring 
the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting, reviewing internal controls and risk management systems and oversight of the external 
audit process.
The Committee meets the auditors and reviews reports from the auditors relating to the accounting and internal control systems. It also 
oversees the relationship with the external auditors including reviewing the effectiveness of the audit; assessing annually their independence 
and objectivity, taking into account relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements; and the relationship with the auditors as a whole, 
including non-audit services and monitoring the auditors’ compliance with relevant ethical and professional guidance. The Committee reviews 
the Company’s compliance with accounting, legal and listing requirements.
Nomination and Remuneration Committee
The members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee are Sir Michael Oliver, Michael Cunningham, who chairs the Committee, 
and Andrew Christie, all of whom are independent Non-executive Directors.
The full Committee met three times during the year to fulfil its duties. In respect of its remuneration duties, the Committee determines and 
agrees with the Board policies for pay; bonuses; incentives and other rewards; employee benefits; and the conditions of termination of 
employment. The Committees’ terms of reference try to ensure that members of the executive management are provided with sufficient 
incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are in a fair and responsible manner rewarded for their individual contribution to the 
success of the Company.
The Company has adopted a model code for Directors’ dealings which is appropriate for an AIM-quoted company and the Directors comply 
with Rule 21 of the AIM Rules relating to Directors’ dealings.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities – Year ended 31 December 2016
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors and the Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare 
the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by 
the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
 » select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 » make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
 » state whether IFRS adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Financial Statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the 
Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the Financial Statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
The Company is compliant with AIM Rule 26 regarding the Company’s website.

Independent auditors’ report – To the members of Helios Underwriting plc
We have audited the Financial Statements of Helios Underwriting plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 which comprise the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated and 
Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flows and the related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company Financial Statements, as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone, other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial 
Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial 
Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited Financial Statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion:
 » the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2016 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 » the Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 » the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 » the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 » The information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the Financial Statements 
are prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements.
 » The Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified 
material misstatements in Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 » adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 » the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 » certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 » we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the financial statements – Year ended 31 December 2016
1. General information
The Company is a public limited company listed on AIM. The Company was incorporated in England, is domiciled in the UK and its registered 
office is 40 Gracechurch Street, London EC3V 0BT. The Company participates in insurance business as an underwriting member at Lloyd’s 
through its subsidiary undertakings. 
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”) 
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Change in accounting policy effected in the comparative year
As of 1 January 2015 the Group changed its accounting policy for the accounting for intangible assets, syndicate capacity. The new accounting 
policy has been applied retrospectively and first reflected in the Financial Statements of the year ended 31 December 2015. For details of this 
change, refer to this accounting policy as disclosed further below and Note 22.
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as endorsed by the 
European Union (“EU”), IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. 
No statement of comprehensive income is presented for Helios Underwriting plc, as a Parent Company, as permitted by Section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006.
The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss. A summary of the principal Group accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results 
may ultimately differ from these estimates.
The Group participates in insurance business through its Lloyd’s member subsidiaries. Accounting information in respect of syndicate 
participations is provided by the syndicate managing agents and is reported upon by the syndicate auditors.
Going concern
The Group and the Company have net assets at the end of the reporting period of £22,519,000 and £29,888,000 respectively.
The Company’s subsidiaries participate as underwriting members at Lloyd’s on the 2014, 2015 and 2016 years of account and they have 
continued this participation since the year end on the 2017 year of account. This underwriting is supported by Funds at Lloyd’s totalling 
£6,006,000 (2015: £5,341,000), letters of credit provided through the Group’s quota share reinsurance agreements totalling £13,641,000 
(2015: £9,378,000) and solvency credits issued by Lloyd’s totalling £837,000 (2015: £3,645,000).
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to meet their underwriting and other 
operational obligations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
annual Financial Statements.

Principles of consolidation, business combinations and goodwill
(a) Consolidation and investments in subsidiaries
The Group Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of Helios Underwriting plc, the Parent Company, and its directly and 
indirectly held subsidiaries being Hampden Corporate Member Limited, Nameco (No. 365) Limited, Nameco (No. 605) Limited, Nameco 
(No. 321) Limited, Nameco (No. 917) Limited, Nameco (No. 229) Limited, Nameco (No. 518) Limited, Nameco (No. 804) Limited, Halperin 
Underwriting Limited, Bernul Limited, Dumasco Limited, Nameco (No. 311) Limited, Nameco (No. 402) Limited, Updown Underwriting Limited, 
Nameco (No. 507) Limited, Nameco (No. 76) Limited, Kempton Underwriting Limited, Devon Underwriting Limited, Nameco (No. 346) Limited,  
Helios UTG Partner Limited, Nomina No 035 LLP , Nomina No 342 LLP , Nomina No 380 LLP , Nomina No 372 LLP and Salviscount LLP (Note 4).
The Financial Statements for all of the above subsidiaries are prepared for the year ended 31 December 2016 under UK GAAP . Consolidation 
adjustments are made to convert the subsidiary Financial Statements prepared under UK GAAP to IFRS so as to align accounting policies 
and treatments.
No income statement is presented for Helios Underwriting plc as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after tax 
for the year of the Parent Company was £2,539,000 (2015: £7,819,000).
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a 
shareholding or partnership participation of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that 
control ceases.
Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. 
In the Parent Company’s Financial Statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost and are reviewed for impairment annually 
or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value to be impaired.
(b) Business combinations and goodwill
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured as 
the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Acquisition costs are 
expensed as incurred.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is capitalised and recorded 
as goodwill. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment 
annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired and recognised directly in the consolidated 
income statement. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised 
directly in the consolidated income statement as a bargain purchase. Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2016 30

2. Accounting policies continued
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identified as Nigel Hanbury.
Foreign currency translation
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The Financial Statements are presented in thousands of Pounds Sterling, which is the 
Group’s functional and presentational currency.
Foreign currency transactions and non-monetary assets and liabilities, including deferred acquisition costs and unearned premiums, are 
translated into the functional currency using annual average rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction as a proxy for the 
transactional rates. The translation difference arising on non-monetary asset items is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Certain supported syndicates have non-Sterling functional currencies and any exchange movement that they would have reflected in other 
comprehensive income as a result of this has been included within profit before tax to be consistent with the Group’s policy of using Sterling 
as the functional currency.
Monetary items are translated at period-end rates; any exchange differences arising from the change in rates of exchange are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement of the year.
Underwriting
Premiums
Gross premium written comprises the total premiums receivable in respect of business incepted during the year, together with any differences 
between booked premiums for prior years and those previously accrued, and includes estimates of premiums due but not yet receivable or 
notified to the syndicates on which the Group participates, less an allowance for cancellations. All premiums are shown gross of commission 
payable to intermediaries and exclude taxes and duties levied on them.
Unearned premiums
Gross premium written is earned according to the risk profile of the policy. Unearned premiums represent the proportion of gross premium written 
in the year that relates to unexpired terms of policies in force at the end of the reporting period calculated on a time apportionment basis having 
regard, where appropriate, to the incidence of risk. The specific basis adopted by each syndicate is determined by the relevant managing agent.
Deferred acquisition costs
Acquisition costs, which represent commission and other related expenses, are deferred over the period in which the related premiums are earned.
Reinsurance premiums
Reinsurance premium costs are allocated by the managing agent of each syndicate to reflect the protection arranged in respect of the 
business written and earned.
Reinsurance premium costs in respect of reinsurance purchased directly by the Group are charged or credited based on the annual 
accounting result for each year of account protected by the reinsurance.
Claims incurred and reinsurers’ share
Claims incurred comprise claims and settlement expenses (both internal and external) occurring in the year and changes in the provisions 
for outstanding claims, including provisions for claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) and settlement expenses, together with any other 
adjustments to claims from previous years. Where applicable, deductions are made for salvage and other recoveries.
The provision for claims outstanding comprises amounts set aside for claims notified and IBNR. The amount included in respect of IBNR is 
based on statistical techniques of estimation applied by each syndicate’s in-house reserving team and reviewed, in certain cases, by external 
consulting actuaries. These techniques generally involve projecting from past experience the development of claims over time to form a view 
of the likely ultimate claims to be experienced for more recent underwriting, having regard to variations in the business accepted and the 
underlying terms and conditions. The provision for claims also includes amounts in respect of internal and external claims’ handling costs. 
For the most recent years, where a high degree of volatility arises from projections, estimates may be based in part on output from the rating 
and other models of the business accepted, and assessments of underwriting conditions.
The reinsurers’ share of provisions for claims is based on calculated amounts of outstanding claims and projections for IBNR, net of estimated 
irrecoverable amounts, having regard to each syndicate’s reinsurance programme in place for the class of business, the claims experience for 
the year and the current security rating of the reinsurance companies involved. Each syndicate uses a number of statistical techniques to 
assist in making these estimates.
Accordingly, the two most critical assumptions made by each syndicate’s managing agent as regards claims provisions are that the past is a 
reasonable predictor of the likely level of claims development and that the rating and other models used, including pricing models for recent 
business, are reasonable indicators of the likely level of ultimate claims to be incurred.
The level of uncertainty with regard to the estimations within these provisions generally decreases with time since the underlying contracts 
were exposed to new risks. In addition, the nature of short-tail risks, such as property where claims are typically notified and settled within a 
short period of time, will normally have less uncertainty after a few years than long-tail risks, such as some liability business where it may be 
several years before claims are fully advised and settled. In addition to these factors if there are disputes regarding coverage under policies 
or changes in the relevant law regarding a claim this may increase the uncertainty in the estimation of the outcomes. Financial statements

2. Accounting policies continued
Underwriting continued
Claims incurred and reinsurers’ share continued
The assessment of these provisions is usually the most subjective aspect of an insurer’s accounts and may result in greater uncertainty within 
an insurer’s accounts than within those of many other businesses. The provisions for gross claims and related reinsurance recoveries have been 
assessed on the basis of the information currently available to the directors of each syndicate’s managing agent. However, ultimate liability will 
vary as a result of subsequent information and events and this may result in significant adjustments to the amounts provided. Adjustments to 
the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the Financial Statements for the period in which the adjustments 
are made. The provisions are not discounted for the investment earnings that may be expected to arise in the future on the funds retained 
to meet the future liabilities. The methods used, and the estimates made, are reviewed regularly.
Quota share reinsurance
Under the Group’s quota share reinsurance agreements, 70% of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 underwriting year of insurance exposure is ceded 
to the reinsurers. Amounts payable to the reinsurers are included within “reinsurance premium ceded” in the consolidated income statement 
of the year and amounts receivable from the reinsurers are included within “reinsurers share of gross claims paid” in the consolidated income 
statement of the year. 
Unexpired risks provision
Provision for unexpired risks is made where the costs of outstanding claims, related expenses and deferred acquisition costs are expected 
to exceed the unearned premium provision carried forward at the end of the reporting period. The provision for unexpired risks is calculated 
separately by reference to classes of business that are managed together, after taking into account relevant investment return. The provision 
is made on a syndicate-by-syndicate basis by the relevant managing agent.
Closed years of account
At the end of the third year, the underwriting account is normally closed by reinsurance into the following year of account. The amount of the 
reinsurance to close premium payable is determined by the managing agent, generally by estimating the cost of claims notified but not settled 
at 31 December, together with the estimated cost of claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) at that date and an estimate of future claims 
handling costs. Any subsequent variation in the ultimate liabilities of the closed year of account is borne by the underwriting year into which 
it is reinsured.
The payment of a reinsurance to close premium does not eliminate the liability of the closed year for outstanding claims. If the reinsuring 
syndicate were unable to meet any obligations, and the other elements of Lloyd’s chain of security were to fail, then the closed underwriting 
account would have to settle any outstanding claims.
The Directors consider that the likelihood of such a failure of the reinsurance to close is extremely remote and consequently the reinsurance 
to close has been deemed to settle the liabilities outstanding at the closure of an underwriting account. The Group will include its share of 
the reinsurance to close premiums payable as technical provisions at the end of the current period and no further provision is made for any 
potential variation in the ultimate liability of that year of account.
Run-off years of account
Where an underwriting year of account is not closed at the end of the third year (a “run-off” year of account) a provision is made for the estimated 
cost of all known and unknown outstanding liabilities of that year. The provision is determined initially by the managing agent on a similar basis 
to the reinsurance to close. However, any subsequent variation in the ultimate liabilities for that year remains with the corporate member 
participating therein. As a result, any run-off year will continue to report movements in its results after the third year until such time as it 
secures a reinsurance to close.
Net operating expenses (including acquisition costs)
Net operating expenses include acquisition costs, profit and loss on exchange and other amounts incurred by the syndicates on which 
the Group participates.
Acquisition costs, comprising commission and other costs related to the acquisition of new insurance contracts, are deferred to the extent 
that they are attributable to premiums unearned at the end of the reporting period.
Investment income
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable are accrued to the end of the period.
Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the income statement when the Group’s right 
to receive payments is established.
Syndicate investments and cash are held on a pooled basis, the return from which is allocated by the relevant managing agent to years 
of account proportionate to the funds contributed by the year of account.
Other operating expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Intangible assets: syndicate capacity
Syndicate capacity is an intangible asset which represents costs incurred in the Corporation of Lloyd’s auctions in order to acquire rights 
to participate on syndicates’ years of account.
At the individual subsidiary company level, the syndicate capacity is stated at cost, less any provision for impairment at initial recognition, and 
amortised on a straight line basis over the useful economic life, which is estimated to be five years (up to 2014: estimated to be seven years). 
No amortisation is charged until the following year when underwriting commences in respect of the purchased syndicate participation. Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2016 32
Notes to the financial statements continued – Year ended 31 December 2016
2. Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets: syndicate capacity continued
At the consolidation level, the Group’ s accounting policy for the year 2014 was consistent with the accounting policy of the subsidiaries as described 
above. As of 1 January 2015, the Group changed its accounting policy for accounting for the intangible asset, syndicate capacity, as set out below:
The syndicate capacity represents the cost of purchasing the Group’s participation in the combined syndicates. The capacity is capitalised at 
cost in the statement of financial position. It has an indefinite useful life and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment. It is annually tested 
for impairment for each syndicate by reference to the weighted average value at Lloyd’s auctions and expected future profit streams to be 
earned by those syndicates in which the Group participates and provision is made for any impairment in the consolidated income statement.
This change in accounting policy was applied retrospectively as if the new policy had always been in place. The effects of this change 
are disclosed in Note 22.
Financial assets
(a) Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, and loans and receivables. The classification 
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. The Group does not make use of the held-to-maturity and available-for-sale classifications.
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
All financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are categorised as designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition 
because they are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the Company’s documented investment 
strategy. Information about these financial assets is provided internally on a fair value basis to the Group’s key management. 
The Group’s investment strategy is to invest and evaluate their performance with reference to their fair values. Assets in this category are 
classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months; otherwise, they are classified as non-current.
(ii) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
classified as current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period. The latter ones are classified as non-current assets.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “other receivables, including insurance and reinsurance receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents”.
The Parent Company’s loans and receivables comprise “other receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents”.
(b) Recognition, derecognition and measurement 
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date on which the Group commits to the purchase 
or sale of the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the financial assets has expired or are transferred 
and the Group has transferred substantially all its risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs incurred expensed in the income statement.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost less any 
impairment losses.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss which are traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the 
end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, 
industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regular occurring market transactions on an arm’s 
length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss held by the Group is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 
techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on 
entity-specific estimates.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, are presented 
in the income statement within “net investment income”.
The fair values of short-term deposits are assumed to approximate to their book values. The fair values of the Group’s debt securities have 
been based on quoted market prices for these instruments. 
(c) Impairment  
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets 
is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event 
(or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
Asset carried at amortised cost
For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of the estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that has not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. If a loan has a 
variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. 
As a practical expedient, the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market price.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised 
impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Financial statements

Financial statements
2. Accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits at bank.
Current and deferred tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the 
Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management establishes provisions when appropriate, on the basis 
of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Financial Statements. 
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that 
at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period 
and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Other payables
These present liabilities for services provided to the Group prior to end of the financial year which are unpaid. These are classified as current 
liabilities, unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting date. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
The difference between the fair value of the consideration received and the nominal value of the share capital issued is taken to the share 
premium account. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, 
from proceeds.
Dividend distribution policy
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised in the Group’s and the Parent Company’s Financial Statements 
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
3. Key accounting judgements and estimation uncertainties
In applying the Company’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in determining 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. These judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the best and most reliable 
evidence available at the time when the decisions are made, and are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered 
to be applicable. Due to the inherent subjectivity involved in making such judgements, estimates and assumptions, the actual results and 
outcomes may differ. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
The measurement of the provision for claims outstanding is the most significant judgement involving estimation uncertainty regarding amounts 
recognised in these Financial Statements in relation to underwriting by the syndicates and this is disclosed further in Note 4.
The management and control of each syndicate is carried out by the managing agent of that syndicate, and the Company looks to the 
managing agent to implement appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls to manage each syndicate. 
The key accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty set out below therefore relate to those made in respect of the 
Company only, and do not include estimates and judgements made in respect of the syndicates.
Purchased syndicate capacity
Estimating value in use
Where an indication of impairment of capacity values exists, the Directors will carry out an impairment review to determine the recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash 
flows expected to arise from the capacity and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. 
Assessing indicators of impairment
In assessing whether there have been any indicators of impairment of assets, the Directors consider both external and internal sources 
of information such as market conditions, counterparty credit ratings and experience of recoverability. 
Recoverability of receivables
The Company establishes a provision for receivables that are estimated not to be recoverable. When assessing recoverability, factors such 
as the ageing of the receivables, past experience of recoverability and the credit profile of individual or groups of customers are all considered.  Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2016 34

4. Risk management
The majority of the risks to the Group’s future cash flows arise from each subsidiary’s participation in the results of Lloyd’s syndicates. As detailed 
below, these risks are mostly managed by the managing agents of the syndicates. The Group’s role in managing these risks, in conjunction 
with its subsidiaries and members’ agent, is limited to selection of syndicate participations, monitoring the performance of the syndicates 
and the purchase of appropriate member level reinsurance.
Risk background
The syndicates’ activities expose them to a variety of financial and non-financial risks. The managing agent is responsible for managing the 
syndicate’s exposure to these risks and, where possible, introducing controls and procedures that mitigate the effects of the exposure to risk. 
For the purposes of setting capital requirements for the 2016 and subsequent years of account, each managing agent will have prepared a 
Lloyd’s Capital Return (“LCR”) for the syndicate to agree capital requirements with Lloyd’s based on an agreed assessment of the risks impacting 
the syndicate’s business and the measures in place to manage and mitigate those risks from a quantitative and qualitative perspective. The risks 
described below are typically reflected in the LCR and typically the majority of the total assessed value of the risks concerned is attributable 
to insurance risk.
The insurance risks faced by a syndicate include the occurrence of catastrophic events, downward pressure on pricing of risks, reductions in 
business volumes and the risk of inadequate reserving. Reinsurance risk arises from the risk that a reinsurer fails to meet its share of a claim. 
The management of the syndicate’s funds is exposed to investment risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, currency risk and interest rate risk (as detailed 
below), leading to financial loss. The syndicate is also exposed to regulatory and operational risks including its ability to continue to trade. 
However, supervision by Lloyd’s and the Prudential Regulation Authority provides additional controls over the syndicate’s management of risks.
The Group manages the risks faced by the syndicates on which its subsidiaries participate by monitoring the performance of the syndicates it 
supports. This commences in advance of committing to support a syndicate for the following year, with a review of the business plan prepared 
for each syndicate by its managing agent. In addition, quarterly reports and annual accounts, together with any other information made available 
by the managing agent, are monitored and if necessary enquired into. If the Group considers that the risks being run by the syndicate are 
excessive, it will seek confirmation from the managing agent that adequate management of the risk is in place and, if considered appropriate, 
will withdraw support from the next year of account. The Group also manages its exposure to insurance risk by purchasing appropriate 
member level reinsurance.
Impact of Brexit vote
The Brexit vote will have an impact on various risk factors, including currency risks. The Lloyd’s market is in the process of developing a 
strategy for dealing with Brexit and the Company will monitor these developments and identify whether it needs to modify its participation 
in the Lloyd’s market. 
(a) Syndicate risks
(i) Liquidity risk
The syndicates are exposed to daily calls on their available cash resources, principally from claims arising from its insurance business. Liquidity 
risk arises where cash may not be available to pay obligation when due, or to ensure compliance with the syndicate’s obligations under the 
various trust deeds to which it is party.
The syndicates aim to manage their liquidity position so that they can fund claims arising from significant catastrophic events, as modelled 
in their Lloyd’s realistic disaster scenarios (“RDS”).
Although there are usually no stated maturities for claims outstanding, syndicates have provided their expected maturity of future claims 
settlements as follows:

4. Risk management continued
(a) Syndicate risks continued
(iv) Currency risk
The syndicates’ main exposure to foreign currency risk arises from insurance business originating overseas, primarily denominated in US 
dollars. Transactions denominated in US dollars form a significant part of the syndicates’ operations. This risk is, in part, mitigated by the 
syndicates maintaining financial assets denominated in US dollars against its major exposures in that currency.

The impact of a 5% change in exchange rates between GBP and other currencies would be £511,000 on shareholders’ funds (2015: £411,000).
(v) Reinsurance risk
Reinsurance risk to the Group arises where reinsurance contracts put in place to reduce gross insurance risk do not perform as anticipated, 
result in coverage disputes or prove inadequate in terms of the vertical or horizontal limits purchased. Failure of a reinsurer to pay a valid claim 
is considered a credit risk, which is detailed separately below.
The Group currently has reinsurance programmes on the 2014, 2015 and 2016 years of account.
The 2014 and 2015 years of account have strategic collateralised quota share arrangement in respect of 50% of their business with XL Re Limited, 
12.45% with Bermudan reinsurer Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited (part of global NYSE-quoted insurer Everest Re Group Limited) and 
7.55% with Guernsey reinsurer Polygon Insurance Co Limited, through Hampden Insurance Guernsey PCC Limited – Cell 6.
The 2016 year of account (excluding Nameco (No 346) Limited) has strategic collateralised quota share arrangements in respect of 44.84% of 
its business with XL Re Limited,11% with Bermudan reinsurer Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited (part of global NYSE-quoted insurer 
Everest Re Group Limited), 5.29% with Guernsey reinsurer Polygon Insurance Co Limited and 8.87% with private shareholders through 
Hampden Insurance Guernsey PCC Limited – Cell 6.  
In addition, the Nameco (No 346) Limited 2016 year of account has strategic collateralised quota share arrangement in respect of 40% of its 
business with XL Re Limited,10% with Bermudan reinsurer Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited (part of global NYSE-quoted insurer Everest 
Re Group Limited) and 20% with private shareholders through Hampden Insurance Guernsey PCC Limited – Cell 6.
(b) Group risks – corporate level
(i) Investment, credit, liquidity and currency risks
The other significant risks faced by the Group are with regard to the investment of funds within its own custody. The elements of these risks 
are investment risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. To mitigate this, the surplus Group funds are deposited with 
highly rated banks and fund managers. The main liquidity risk would arise if a syndicate had inadequate liquid resources for a large claim and 
sought funds from the Group to meet the claim. In order to minimise investment risk, credit risk and liquidity risk, the Group’s funds are invested 
in readily realisable short-term deposits. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2016 is £14.8m (2015: £8.1m), being 
the aggregate of the Group’s insurance receivables, prepayments and accrued income, financial assets at fair value, and cash and cash 
equivalents, excluding any amounts held in the syndicates. The syndicates can distribute their results in Sterling, US dollars or a combination 
of the two. The Group is exposed to movements in the US dollar between the balance sheet date and the distribution of the underwriting 
profits and losses, which is usually in the May following the closure of a year of account. The Group does not use derivative instruments 
to manage risk and, as such, no hedge accounting is applied.
As a result of the specific nature and structure of the Group’s collateralised quota share reinsurance arrangements through Cell 6, the Group’s 
Funds at Lloyd’s calculation benefits from an aggregate £13.6m (2015: £9.4m) letter of credit (“LOC”) acceptable to Lloyd’s, on behalf of 
XL Re Limited, Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited, Polygon Insurance Co Limited (the reinsurers) and the private shareholders. The LOC 
is pledged in aggregate to the relevant syndicates through Lloyd’s and thus Helios Underwriting plc is not specifically exposed to counterparty 
credit risk in this matter. Should the bank’s LOC become unacceptable to Lloyd’s for any reason, the reinsurer is responsible under the terms 
of the contract for making alternative arrangements. The contract is annually renewable and the Group has a contingency plan in place in the 
event of non-renewal under both normal and adverse market conditions.
(ii) Market risk
The Group is exposed to market and liquidity risk in respect of its holdings of syndicate participations. Lloyd’s syndicate participations are 
traded in the Lloyd’s auctions held in September and October each year. The Group is exposed to changes in market prices and a lack of 
liquidity in the trading of a particular syndicate’s capacity could result in the Group making a loss compared to the carrying value when the 
Group disposes of particular syndicate participations. Financial statements

4. Risk management continued
(b) Group risks – corporate level continued
(iii) Regulatory risks 
The Company’s subsidiaries are subject to continuing approval by Lloyd’s to be a member of a Lloyd’s syndicate. The risk of this approval 
being removed is mitigated by monitoring and fully complying with all requirements in relation to membership of Lloyd’s. The capital requirements 
to support the proposed amount of syndicate capacity for future years are subject to the requirements of Lloyd’s. A variety of factors are taken 
into account by Lloyd’s in setting these requirements including market conditions and syndicate performance and, although the process is 
intended to be fair and reasonable, the requirements can fluctuate from one year to the next, which may constrain the volume of underwriting 
a subsidiary of the Company is able to support. 
The Company is subject to the AIM Rules. Compliance with the AIM Rules is monitored by the Board.
Operational risks
As there are relatively few transactions actually undertaken by the Group, there are only limited systems and operational requirements of the 
Group and therefore operational risks are not considered to be significant. Close involvement of all Directors in the Group’s key decision making 
and the fact that the majority of the Group’s operations are conducted by syndicates provide control over any remaining operational risks.
Capital management objectives, policies and approach
The Group has established the following capital management objectives, policies and approach to managing the risks that affect its capital position:
 » to maintain the required level of stability of the Group, thereby providing a degree of security to shareholders;
 » to allocate capital efficiently and support the development of the business by ensuring that returns on capital employed meet the requirements 
of the shareholders; and
 » to maintain the financial strength to support increases in the Group’s underwriting through acquisition of capacity in the Lloyd’s auctions 
or through the acquisition of new subsidiaries.
The Group’s capital management policy is to hold a sufficient level of capital to allow the Group to take advantage of market conditions, 
particularly when insurance rates are improving, and to meet the Funds at Lloyd’s (“FAL”) requirements that support the corporate member 
subsidiaries’ current and future levels of underwriting.
Approach to capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists entirely of equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued share capital, 
share premium and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statements of Changes in Equity on pages 24 and 25.
At 31 December 2016 the corporate member subsidiaries had an agreed FAL requirement of £19,632,000 (2015: £16,844,000) to support 
their underwriting on the 2017 year of account (2016 year of account). The funds to support this requirement are held in short-term investment 
funds and deposits or provided by the quota share reinsurance capital providers by way of a LOC. The FAL requirements are formally assessed 
and funded twice yearly and must be met by the corporate member subsidiaries to continue underwriting. At 31 December 2016 the agreed 
FAL requirements for the Group were 60% (2015: 51%) of the capacity for the following year of account.
5. Segmental information

As described in Note 4, the majority of the risks to the Group’s future cash flows arise from its subsidiaries’ participation in the results of Lloyd’s 
syndicates and are mostly managed by the managing agents of the syndicates. The Group’s role in managing these risks, in conjunction with 
the Group’s members’ agent, is limited to a selection of syndicate participations and monitoring the performance of the syndicates and their 
managing agents.
The amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are calculated by the managing agents of the syndicates, derived from 
accounting information provided by the managing agents and reported upon by the syndicate auditors. 
The key assumptions underlying the amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are:
 » the claims reserves calculated by the managing agents are accurate; and
 » the potential deterioration of run-off year results has been fully provided for by the managing agents.
There have been no changes in assumptions in 2016.
The amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are sensitive to various factors as follows:
 » a 10% increase/decrease in the managing agents’ calculation of gross claims reserves will decrease/increase the Group’s pre-tax profits 
by £5,009,000 (2015: £3,299,000);
 » a 10% increase/decrease in the managing agents’ calculation of net claims reserves will decrease/increase the Group’s pre-tax profits 
by £4,041,000 (2015: £2,733,000); and 
 » a 10% increase/decrease in the run-off year net claims reserves will decrease/increase the Group’s pre-tax profits by £12,000 (2015: £1,000).
The 10% movement has been selected to give an indication of the possible variations in the assumptions used.

* Refer to Note 27 for details of the restatement of the profit for the year 2015 as a result of a reclassification.
The results of the Group’s participation on the 2014, 2015 and 2016 years of account and the calendar year movement on 2013 and prior run-offs 
will not be assessed for tax until the years ended 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively, being the year after the calendar year result of each run-off 
year or the normal date of closure of each year of account. Full provision is made as part of the deferred tax provisions for underwriting 
profits/(losses) not yet subject to corporation tax.
New legislation was passed on 18 November 2015 to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020. 
The government further announced on 16 March 2016 as part of its Budget that a rate of 17% will apply from 1 April 2020 instead of 18%. 
This is not expected to have a material impact on the closing deferred tax liability.
The Group has £1,069,000 (2015: £2,184,000) taxable losses carried forward, to which £134,000 (2015: £1,009,000) has been recognised 
as a deferred tax asset and has been offset against deferred tax liabilities of the same nature as disclosed in Note 18.
The Company has £935,000 (2015: £1,175,000) of tax losses to carry forward to which no deferred tax asset has been recognised due 
to the uncertainty of the future taxable profits, as disclosed in Note 18.
11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company after tax by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued 
on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
The Group has no dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Earnings per share has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 “Earnings per share”. Financial statements

15. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded securities) is based on quoted market prices 
(unadjusted) at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. 
These instruments are included in Level 1.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise 
the use of observable market data inputs, either directly or indirectly, (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) and rely as little as possible 
on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. This is the case 
for unlisted equity securities.   Financial statements

recognition, and amortised on a straight line basis over the useful economic life, estimated to be seven years. 
As of 1 January 2015 the Group changed its accounting policy for intangible assets, syndicate capacity. The new accounting policy has been 
applied retrospectively, as if the policy had always been in place.
The new accounting policy adopted measures the intangible asset, syndicate capacity, at cost less any impairment. For more details, refer 
to Note 13.

27. Effects of a reclassification in the year 2015 comparatives 
The year 2015 comparatives, at consolidation level, in these Financial Statements include the effects of the reclassification of the foreign 
exchange differences, for the year 2015, originally included in the other comprehensive income, net of tax, amounting to £121,000, and now 
reclassified into the income statement, within the other income line.
These foreign exchange differences arose as a result of the retranslation of the syndicates’ results whose functional currency is not the 
Pound Sterling, into the Pound Sterling as the reporting currency to Lloyd’s. Hence, such foreign exchange differences were accounted 
for as other comprehensive income within the syndicates’ reported results.
As the functional and presentation currency of the Helios Group is the Pound Sterling, such foreign exchange differences were accounted 
for as other income in the income statement in the consolidated Financial Statements of the year ended 31 December 2016.
As a result, to aid consistency in presentation, the comparative amount for the year ended 31 December 2015 of £121,000 has been reclassified 
and the effects of the reclassification resulted in the restatements as set out below:

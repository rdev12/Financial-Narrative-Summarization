whilst any sustained improvement in the 
shipping market is likely to take some time, 
the Board is pleased to observe that there 
are some early indicators of improvement 
in overall sentiment in the market. t his will 
have a positive impact on the Group in the 
medium and long term, given that ACM’s 
various divisions have worked hard to maintain 
and grow their market share during the 
downturn in freight rates.
ACM’s focus during the period has been on 
strengthening the Group’s global footprint, 
increasing volumes, ensuring the sustainability 
of its core business and that its teams are fully 
aligned to maximise value for clients. The Board 
is confident that this has been successfully 
achieved and that the Group is well placed 
to capitalise on any improvement in the market 
as and when it occurs.
Results
Despite the challenging markets, profit before tax 
and amortisation and impairment of intangibles 
was £3.1 million for the year (2012: £4.3 million) 
on revenue of £24.1 million (2012: £26.6 million). 
The key performance indicator of the business 
is the total number of fixtures and the Board is 
pleased that this increased by 6.9% during the 
period. Although weak freight rates impacted 
both revenue and profit, it was the results from 
the Group’s sale and purchase division which 
had the most significant impact. This impact 
related to the Group’s rebuilding of the division 
following personnel departures in 2011. During 
this rebuilding phase, the division generated a 
net loss of £0.2 million in the year, whereas the 
previous year showed a profit of £1 million as 
the forward order book was settled. The success 
of this division’s re-establishment is evidenced 
by the deals concluded and the rebuilding of 
the forward book after the year end. It is worth 
noting that the £1.2 million variance between 
the profitability of the two years is the same as 
the Group’s overall fall in profit, which highlights 
the robustness of the rest of the business during 
the year under review.
Earnings Per Share (EPS), adjusted for the 
non-cash impacts of amortisation and 
impairment of intangible assets, was down 
from 17.7 pence in 2012 to 12.5 pence.
Dividend
The Board’s ongoing confidence in the 
medium and longer-term growth prospects 
for ACM remains strong and this is reflected 
in the Group’s final dividend being maintained 
at 7 pence per share (2012: 7 pence per share). 
This makes the dividend for the full year 10.15 
pence per share (2012: 10.15 pence per share). 
The final dividend is payable on 4 October 2013 
to shareholders on the register as at close of 
business on 6 September 2013.

In brief
•	 Group’s global footprint continues

Strategy
The Group’s strategy is to be a globally 
integrated shipbroking service provider and 
the Board is pleased with the progress that has 
been made against this stated strategy during 
the period, developing the teams in each of 
the global offices and refining the infrastructure 
to enable them to work together effectively. 
The Group has rebuilt its sale and purchase 
division and has continued to increase the 
number of brokers while relocating several 
brokers to different offices so as to better 
serve its clients.
Employees
ACM’ s teams are working well together globally 
and the Board will look to continue to expand 
the teams organically as markets allow . The Board 
would like to thank all of the Group’s employees 
for their ongoing commitment to ACM.
Prospects
As has been widely reported during the period, 
the shipping market is currently at a particularly 
low point in its cycle; however, the Board 
believes that we are seeing the start of the 
cyclical change in the market for the medium 
term. Although any upturn in the market may 
take some time, sentiment is starting to improve 
amongst ship owners and this will positively 
impact freight rates in due course.
The current year has started well with volumes 
continuing to rise. Even more encouragingly, 
the Group has seen some significant growth 
in both the sale and purchase and time 
charter forward order books.
The Board is pleased with the strong position 
that ACM has established in the market in 
terms of its diversified offering and its team 
and remains confident of the Group’s 
growth prospects.

Chief Executive’s review
James Gundy, Chief Executive Officer
ACM has continued to successfully execute its 
global strategy and has made good operational 
progress during the year. 
In brief
•	 Overall number of fixtures continues to grow
•	 Sale and purchase business being rebuilt with 
some key appointments
•	 Building a strong global team of highly 
motivated people
•	 New sale and purchase team now working 
productively with the projects team
•	 Well positioned for any upturn in the markets
t he Group has continued to execute against its 
stated strategy during the period, building its 
global teams and the infrastructure for those 
teams to work together effectively. t he Board 
is pleased to report that the overall number 
of fixtures that the Group has secured continues 
to grow. t he overall year on year growth was 
6.9%, demonstrating that ACM has successfully 
grown its volume of fixtures every year since 
joining AiM in 2006, having grown volumes 
from just over 1,000 fixtures in 2006 to over 
3,200 in the period under review.
Profit before tax and amortisation and 
impairment of intangibles was £3.1 million 
(2012: £4.3 million). The Group continues to 
have a strong cash position with cash balances 
at the year end of £4.3 million (2012: £3.1 million).
Spot brokerage
The Group’s core business is its spot brokerage 
desk, involving the hire of a ship for a single 
voyage. This desk continued to perform well in 
terms of volume of fixtures and although rates 
remain weak they are now showing more signs 
of activity driven volatility. The number of fixtures 
achieved by the Group’s main tanker desks 
increased by 5.0%. The Group has strengthened 
the team in the Far East in particular and the 
global spot brokerage desks are interacting 
well together.
Time charter
ACM’s time charter business, which involves 
the long-term hire of tankers, continued to 
maintain a steady stream of deals. However, 
revenue from this desk decreased in the year 
as new deals being completed were at lower 
hire rates than those fixed when the market 
was higher. The Board’s belief that this team is 
well positioned to capitalise on any improvement 
in the market has been validated in the first 
quarter of the current year where the amount 
fixed has exceeded the booking for any quarter 
for several years.
Sale and purchase
The year to 31 March 2013 saw ACM establish 
a new sale and purchase team following 
personnel departures in the summer of 2011. 
During this rebuilding process revenue 
opportunities were low and revenue fell from 
£2.2 million to £0.6 million, which resulted in 
the desk showing a loss of £0.2 million in the 
year to 31 March 2013 whereas in the previous 
year it contributed a profit of £1.0 million. The 
previous year had benefitted from a forward 
book which had already been built. The Board 
is pleased that the new global team is now in 
place and is working productively with the 
projects team. The Board believes that there 
are indications that the number of ship sale 
transactions in the market will start to increase.  ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
07
FinAnCiAl St AteMent S notiCe oF AGM Corpor Ate GovernAnCe YeAr in review
Since the year end, more deals have been 
concluded by ACM and a forward book 
is successfully being built which gives 
the Board confidence about the future 
growth of this division.
Dry cargo
ACM’s global dry cargo desks successfully 
increased volumes during the period, but 
they have also been hampered by low market 
freight rates. As previously announced, certain 
productivity improvements have been 
implemented, with more planned, so as 
to ensure that this division should become 
profitable even while freight rates remain low. 
ACM is well positioned to capitalise on any 
upturn in freight rates, as it continues to grow 
its market share. The Group’s expansion into 
Dubai and Singapore has proved successful 
to date, with these teams working well with 
the rest of the desk globally.
As previously reported, the ongoing lower 
market rates are resulting in reduced revenues 
for ACM Endeavour, which was acquired in 2010. 
Although the Board is satisfied that this business 
is performing well in a challenging market, the 
Board announced in the latest Interim Results 
that an impairment was to be made to the 
goodwill acquired on acquisition. This impairment 
amounts to £3.7 million. The last few months 
have seen this business broaden its focus which 
has resulted in the successful completion of 
some long-term period business which will 
support its future performance. The Board 
remains confident that this business will 
prove to be a valuable part of the Group.
Gas/LPG
The Group established a small, London-based 
broking team for Gas/LPG shipbroking in 2008, 
having identified this as an area with considerable 
growth potential, and this continues to develop 
in accordance with the Board’s strategy. 
Although still on a small scale, the year to 
31 March 2013 was successful as the desk moved 
into profit. This market is now expanding and 
ACM expects to grow its team as the market 
demand increases.
Financial derivatives
The Group’s joint venture with GFI Group, Inc. 
(GFI) to conduct derivative brokerage is 
continuing to maintain robust volumes of 
business within the industry. However, revenue 
from this division has also been affected by 
weakened freight rates. The Board is pleased 
with the performance of this division in terms 
of market share and believes that financial 
derivatives continue to be a valuable part 
of the Group’s offering.
The market
Recent times have proved very difficult for 
crude carriers across the board. Heavy refinery 
maintenance programmes in Asia can explain 
at least some of the slowdown in tanker activity. 
As refinery activity returns and new crude 
supplies emerge from Sudan and West Africa, 
ACM expects to see a slight improvement 
in rates for the second half of this year. The 
pace of newbuilding deliveries has slowed 
considerably and with some assistance from 
the demolition of vessels as well as the floating 
production storage offshore market, fleet growth 
is coming under control. This will accommodate 
an unwinding of slow-steaming at least until 
the second half of 2015, which is also the 
earliest delivery date for future newbuilding 
orders. While an overcapacity buffer still exists, 
the Board believes that this will shortly 
become manageable.
Product carrier markets have fared better in 
the current year, with the larger Long-Range 
vessels beating five-year averages in the second 
quarter. Strong demand for transportation fuel 
in Africa and Latin America is supporting trade 
growth, while refinery closures in Europe, 
Australia and Hawaii are lengthening supply 
chains. Although heavy ordering in the 
Medium-Range 2 and, more recently, the 
Long-Range 2 sectors puts freight gains at risk 
in the second half of 2014, the Group expects 
rates to hold or improve over the next six to 
twelve months as new Asian refining capacity 
forces further closures among OECD refiners.
Although deliveries of new vessels have 
slowed considerably from the previous year, 
dry bulk carrier freight rates in the first half 
of the year have been low. The oversupply of 
tonnage has yet to be absorbed by increasing 
demand, although utilisation is slowly edging 
up. This could lead to some volatility in the 
coming months. Looking further out to mid-2014 
and beyond, a significant number of greenfield 
or mine-expansion projects should provide 
the necessary impetus to support healthier 
returns for owners, supported by the ever 
increasing demand for iron ore in China.
The outlook for Very Large Gas Carriers (VLGC) 
owners looks relatively positive. Additional US 
exports from Targa and Soyo (starting in 
October 2013) is expected to add to the 
already considerable volume of LPG exports 
in the Atlantic basin. West to East arbitrage has 
recently become a feature of the LPG market 
and, together with a busy Indian programme, 
this seems to be the main driver of the current 
spike in VLGC freights. Next year some increase in 
Middle East LPG exports and fleet consolidation 
through the proposed sale of Maersk vessels 
to BW Gas should maintain momentum, 
despite ten VLGC new building deliveries 
expected in 2014.
Outlook
Whilst the overall market remains challenging, 
the Board is pleased with the operational progress 
that has been made during the year and is 
satisfied with the ongoing growth in volumes 
across the business. The Group has successfully 
focused on building its global teams and 
supporting their ongoing interaction and the 
Board is confident that despite the immediate 
challenges in terms of freight rates holding back 
revenue growth, the medium and longer-term 
prospects for ACM remain strong.

Financial review
Ian Hartley, Finance Director
Profit and earnings
Revenue fell by 9.5% primarily due to lower 
revenue from the Group’s sale and purchase 
desk which has been rebuilt. Administrative 
expenses fell by 7.0%, not withstanding 
continued expansion and an increase in 
the number of brokers employed.
Profit before tax and amortisation and 
impairment of intangibles was £3.1 million 
for the year (2012: £4.3 million). Contribution 
from tanker broking was affected by the low 
sale and purchase revenue which masked the 
robust performance of the rest of the division. 
The loss from dry cargo broking was reduced.
Lower market freight rates have also resulted 
in lower revenues from ACM Endeavour, a 
business acquired in 2010. As a result the Board 
has made an impairment of £3.7 million to the 
goodwill acquired on acquisition. The Board is 
satisfied that the business is performing well 
and remains confident that it should contribute 
good results in the future.
The effective taxation rate, having adjusted 
for the effects of intangible assets, was 27.9% 
(2012: 29.7%), reflecting the reduced rate of 
corporation tax. It remains above the level 
of UK corporation tax due to expenses not 
being deductible for tax purposes.
As a result of the non-cash impairment, the 
loss attributable to equity shareholders was 
£1.5 million (2012: loss £4.5 million).
Basic loss per share was 7.8 pence  
(2012: loss 23.8 pence) with EPS adjusted for 
non-cash items of amortisation and impairment 
of intangible assets down to 12.5 pence from 
17.7 pence.
Foreign exchange
The Group derives most of its revenue in US 
dollars. The average effective exchange rate for 
the 2012/2013 year was US$1.58 compared with 
US$1.60 for the previous year, while the rate at 
31 March 2013 was US$1.52 (31 March 2012: US$1.60). 
The overall effect of the change in exchange 
rates was to increase revenue by £0.2 million 
and reduce loss before taxation by £0.1 million. 
At the year end, the Group had forward currency 
contracts to sell of US$8.0 million at an average 
exchange rate of US$1.58 to £1.
Dividends
The Directors are recommending an unchanged 
final dividend of 7.0 pence per share in respect 
of the year ended 31 March 2013. Together with 
an interim dividend of 3.15 pence paid during 
the year, the total dividend in respect of the 
year will be an unchanged 10.15 pence. The 
total cost of the dividends will be £1,946,000. 
The Board is confident in the future profitability 
In brief
•	 Revenue down primarily due to lower revenue 
from the sale and purchase desk
•	 Dividends steady at 10.15 pence
•	 Dividend covered 1.2 times by adjusted EPS
•	 Strong cash position

The Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 7.0 pence per share in respect

FinAnCiAl St AteMent S notiCe oF AGM Corpor Ate GovernAnCe YeAr in review
and cash-generating capabilities of the Group 
and is therefore comfortable with the dividend 
cover of 1.2 times based on the adjusted Earnings 
Per Share.
Cash flow
The Group continues to be cash generative 
and the cash balance at the year end 
increased to £4.3 million (2012: £3.1 million). 
Cash generated from operating activities was 
£4.1 million (2012: £1.6 million). This inflow excludes 
a further £0.6 million (2012: £0.9 million) received 
from the Group’s joint ventures. The cash 
performance was boosted by a permanent 
change in the Group policy to pay a higher 
proportion of the bonus pool after the year 
end which benefitted the year by £1.1 million.
Balance sheet
The value of net assets at the balance sheet date 
decreased to £8.3 million (2012: £12.0 million); 
the reduction due to the impairment of 
intangible assets.
In accordance with IFRS, the Board has 
reviewed the carrying value of its intangible 
assets. Following this review the Board has made 
an impairment and the value for intangible 
assets, which resulted from acquisitions, fell 
to £3.9 million (2012: £7.7 million).
The pension deficit for the defined benefit 
scheme fell slightly to £1.6 million from 
£1.7 million. The market value of the assets 
increased, however this was offset by an 
increase in liabilities, caused by a change 
in the assumptions relating to the discount 
rate. A deferred tax asset of £0.3 million 
(2012: £0.4 million) exists as a result of the 
net pension liability. This scheme is closed to 
new members. On the back of a full actuarial 
valuation as at 31 March 2011 the Group has 
agreed to continue to make additional 
contributions of £320,000 per annum to 
the pension scheme.
Trade and other payables have increased by 
approximately £1.1 million. This includes the 
effect of the change in the Group policy with 
a higher proportion of bonus payments being 
made post-year end.
During the year the Group acquired 245,000 
of its own shares through its Employee Share 
Option Plan. The cost of shares acquired is 
shown on the balance sheet within the ESOP 
reserve which is shown as a deduction from 
equity. The plan owned 305,791 shares of the 
Group as at 31 March 2013.
Pension accounting
As a result of changes to IAS 19, future pension 
costs in accounts will be calculated by applying 
the discount rate to the net liability in the defined 
benefit scheme. This change will be effective 
in the Group’s year to 31 March 2014. Had the 
amendments been effective for the year to 
31 March 2013, a charge of £0.2 million would 
have resulted rather than a credit of 
£0.1 million accounted for under the existing 
IAS. These changes do not affect the amount 
of cash required to fund the scheme.
Risk management
The Board seeks to identify and monitor risks 
facing the business.
Foreign exchange risk: The majority of the 
Group’s income is denominated in US dollars 
and the rate of exchange relative to sterling 
has an effect on the performance of the Group. 
The Group uses foreign exchange instruments 
to manage this risk. At 31 March 2013, the Group 
had forward foreign exchange contracts in place 
to sell US$8.0 million (2012: US$7.5 million) at an 
average rate of US$1.58 (2012: US$1.57) into sterling. 
The Board has a policy to have some forward 
cover continually in place to help manage this risk.
Liquidity risk: At 31 March 2013 the Group did 
not hold any net debt and has adequate cash 
resources to meet its ongoing requirements.
Interest rate risk: The Group has exposure to 
movements in interest rates in respect of its 
deposits. All deposits are made with 
reputable banks.

Employees
The Group has high regard for its employees. The Group seeks to enhance their careers with training and career development as well 
as continuing to motivate them. Share option schemes have been set up to add to the annual bonus structure. The Group seeks to have 
equal opportunity policies in place at each location.
Payment policy
The Group pays in accordance with agreed payment terms. The Company does not have any trade creditors.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. As required by the 
AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union. The Directors have chosen to prepare financial statements for the parent company in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union.
IAS 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash 
flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for 
the preparation and presentation of financial statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with 
all applicable IFRS. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. A fair presentation also requires the 
Directors to:
 • consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies;
 • present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
 • make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
13
FinAnCiAl St AteMent S notiCe oF AGM Corpor Ate GovernAnCe YeAr in review Directors’ responsibilities continued
 • provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 • prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s and the 
Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and parent company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Insofar as the Directors, individually, are aware:
 • there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 • the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant information and to establish 
that the auditor is aware of that information.
Donations 
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £15,166 (2012: £41,472).
Financial risk
The Group’s financial risk and its management policies are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
At the Annual General Meeting (AGM) a number of resolutions will be proposed. Details of these resolutions together with explanatory 
notes can be found in the enclosed notice of meeting.
Auditor
RSM Tenon Audit Limited has expressed its willingness to continue in office and a resolution to re-appoint it will be proposed at the AGM.

14 Introduction
The Board is committed to achieving good standards of corporate governance. Although under the rules of AIM the Group is not required 
to comply with the Combined Code, the Directors intend to comply so far as reasonably practicable for a company of ACM’s size and nature. 
Where full compliance is not appropriate due to the Company’s size and/or nature, the Directors will refer to guidance for AIM listed companies 
issued by the Quoted Companies Alliance.
Board of Directors
The Board consists of four executive and four non-executive Directors, a composition which the Board believes is best suited to the continued 
success of the Group. 
The Board is responsible for establishing the strategic direction of the Group and monitoring the Group’s performance against its business 
plan. It is also responsible for leading and controlling the Group and, in particular, for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s 
strategy, budget, major items of capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals. Regular meetings are held and all necessary information 
is supplied on a timely basis to enable the Board to discharge its duties effectively. Additionally, special meetings take place, or other 
arrangements are made, when Board decisions are required in advance of the regular meetings. 
It is the Company’s policy that Directors are re-elected by shareholders and the Company’s Articles of Association require one third to retire 
by rotation. 
Board committees
The Board has a remuneration committee, an audit committee and a nomination committee. Each of these committees consists of the 
four non-executive Directors. The Board also has a compliance committee consisting of John Plumbe and Ian Hartley.
The remuneration committee is discussed within the Directors’ remuneration report on page 16.
The audit committee meets whenever there is business to discuss and meets at least twice each year. The audit committee is responsible 
for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored, controlled and reported on. It also meets with the auditor 
without executive Directors being present and reviews reports from the auditor relating to accounts and internal control systems. Mark Tracey 
is the current chairman of the audit committee.
The nomination committee has responsibility for making recommendations on the appointment of additional Directors to the Board 
and the appointment of members of the Company’s senior management team. It meets at least twice a year. 
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control. Although no system can provide absolute assurance against misstatement or 
loss, the Group’s systems are designed to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance. The Board is also responsible for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the system.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue its business for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Shareholder relations
The Board places significant importance on maintaining good communications with its shareholders. This includes meetings with shareholders 
and analysts as appropriate. Shareholders are also invited to the Company’s AGM, where questions are taken. The Company also uses its 
Annual Report and Accounts, interim statement and website (www.acmshippinggroup.com) to provide further information to shareholders.

Remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee consists of the non-executive Directors: currently Jürgen Breuer (as Chairman), David Cobb, Timothy Jaques 
and Mark Tracey. The committee meets formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required. The remuneration committee considers all 
material elements of remuneration policy, including remuneration and incentives of executive Directors and senior management (including 
pension rights and compensation payments) with reference to independent remuneration research and professional advice. The Board is 
responsible for implementing the recommendations and agreeing the remuneration packages for individual Directors. The remuneration 
committee is also responsible for making recommendations for grants of options under share option and incentivisation schemes. No 
Director is able to participate in discussions relating to his own terms and conditions of remuneration. Non-executive Directors’ and the 
Chairman’s fees are determined by the full Board on the advice of the remuneration committee.

Annual bonus
In order to attract and retain the highest calibre of employees, a significant proportion of the remuneration packages of executive Directors 
and senior management is geared towards an annual bonus. The Group adopts an industry standard bonus model whereby proportions of profit 
are distributed to employees as bonuses. The individual allocation of this bonus between the Directors and employees is discretionary. 
This discretion is exercised by the remuneration committee upon the recommendation of senior executives.
Pension contributions
The Company makes pension contributions on behalf of its executive Directors. Mike Rudd is a member of the Group’s defined benefit scheme. 
James Gundy is also a member of the Group’s defined benefit scheme, but as no further contributions are to made in respect of him he is 
counted as a deferred member. Ian Hartley is a member of the Group’s stakeholder scheme. John Plumbe and the non-executive Directors 
do not participate in the Group’s pension schemes.

FinAnCiAl St AteMent S notiCe oF AGM Corpor Ate GovernAnCe YeAr in review We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (“the financial statements”) of ACM Shipping Group plc for the year 
ended 31 March 2013 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the balance 
sheets, the statements of changes in equity, the cash flow statements and the related notes 1 to 27. We have also audited the information 
in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 13, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
 • whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
 • the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
 • the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 • the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2013 and of 
the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
 • the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and
 • the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 • the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 • the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.

The currency reserve arises from exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation.
The share-based payment reserve represents the fair value of share options which have been granted.
The merger reserve arose when the shares of ACM Shipping Limited were exchanged for shares in ACM Shipping Group plc. Since the members 
and their rights were unchanged the transfer of ownership was accounted for in accordance with the principles of merger accounting.
The treasury reserve arises from where the Company acquired shares in itself.

Cash flow statements
year ended 31 March 2013
Annual report and accounts 2013 www.acmshippinggroup.com
24 1. Accounting policies 
(a) Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and those European Union endorsed 
IFRS and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective or issued and early adopted as at the time of preparing these statements (July 2013). 
The policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as noted below.
No separate profit and loss account is presented for the parent company as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and enterprises controlled by the Company 
(and its subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date 
of acquisition. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by other members of the Group. All significant intercompany transactions and balances between group enterprises are 
eliminated on consolidation.
(c) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow and can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised 
when the Group has a contractual entitlement to commission. This is generally the point at which there is completion of contractual terms 
between the principals of a transaction. Time charter revenue is recognised on a monthly basis.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is provided 
on a straight line basis over the expected economic life of that asset as follows:
Leasehold improvements  – over the life of the lease
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment – two to five years
(e) Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged against 
profits on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
(f) Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and recognises the pension liability in the Group balance sheet. The liability is the present 
value of the accrued defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme’s assets. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation is measured using the projected unit method and discounted at an AA corporate bond rate. Assets are valued at 
market value. The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses via the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. 
The Company also contributes to defined contribution schemes. Contributions to these schemes have been charged against profit as they 
fall due.

1. Accounting policies continued
(g) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. 
(h) Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted into sterling at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction. At each 
balance sheet, monetary assets and liabilities are converted at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date with any gain or loss being 
included in the income statement.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas operations are converted at the balance sheet rate while the income statement is translated 
at the average rate for the year. Any exchange gain or loss arising on consolidation is charged to reserves.
(i) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity which is subject 
to joint control.
The financial statements incorporate the share of the results, assets and liabilities of jointly controlled entities (joint ventures) using the equity 
method of accounting. The investment is carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the share of net assets of the joint venture less 
any provision for impairment. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies used by the joint ventures into line 
with those used by the Group in its financial statements. Intercompany transactions are eliminated. Losses in excess of the consolidated 
interest in joint ventures are not recognised, except where the Group has made a commitment to make good those losses.
(j) Investments
All investments are stated at cost less provisions for diminution in value.
(k) Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets (including any identifiable intangible assets) acquired. Goodwill arises 
where the fair value of the consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed 
for impairment at least annually. Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating 
units for the purposes of impairment testing. On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business remaining on the balance sheet 
is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
(l) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition less 
accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment. The amortisation of the carrying value of the capitalised forward order book 
and customer relationships is charged to the income statement over an estimated useful life determined by either the expected due dates 
for future income in the case of forward order books or the expected duration of customer relationships. The carrying values of intangible 
assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication that they may be impaired. The estimated useful life of 
the items in the forward order book is generally up to four years and the customer relationships is ten years.

26 1. Accounting policies continued
(m) Impairment 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets with finite lives to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill 
has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or on such other occasions that events or changes in circumstances indicate that it 
might be impaired. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised as an expense 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is land or buildings at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation 
decrease. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the 
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase. However, impairment losses relating to goodwill may not be reversed.
(n) Share-based payments
The Group awards employees equity settled bonuses in the form of share options and long-term incentive plan share awards, on a 
discretionary basis from time to time. These are accounted for as equity settled transactions. The options and awards are normally subject 
to vesting conditions and, where it is considered likely that the conditions will be met, their fair value is recognised as an employee benefits 
expense with a corresponding increase in other reserves over the vesting period. When shares on options and awards have been issued 
and are fully vested a transfer is made from other reserves to retained earnings. The fair value is assessed at the time of the grant. Awards made 
under the LTIP scheme are inherently valued at the share price at the date of the grant. EMI and Sharesave scheme options are valued 
using the Binomial option pricing model and the Black Scholes model. The cash proceeds received, when the options are exercised, net 
of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when new shares are issued. 
If shares are issued from the ESOP proceeds are accounted for within the ESOP . 
(o) Financial instruments
Classification
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ 
funds) only to the extent that they meet the following definition:
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. To the extent that this definition is not 
met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own 
shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in 
relation to those shares.
The Company’s share capital is treated as equity.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated with financial 
instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.

Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at nominal value.
Forward contracts
The Company uses forward contracts for foreign currency and accounts for these at fair value.
(p) Own shares held by ESOP
Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP are treated as being those of the Group and are therefore reflected in the Group’s financial statements. 
In particular, the plan’s purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.

(r) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the Group’s financial statements management make certain estimates and judgements. In evaluating these estimates and 
judgements management uses historical knowledge and available current information. They assume a reasonable expectation of future 
events and are based on market and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Group. The main areas that could be affected 
by these judgements are:
(i) Impairment of intangible assets
Intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. Management estimate future cash flows and use a suitable discount rate 
to assess the present value of those cash flows. Further details of the assumptions used are set out in note 11.
(ii) Trade receivables
The provision for impairment of trade receivables represents management’s estimate at each balance sheet date.
(iii) Share-based payments
The cost of share-based payments is calculated by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. Estimating 
fair value requires determining the most appropriate valuation model which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. 
Key variables include the life of the option, volatility, yield and interest rates. Further details of the assumptions used are set out in note 20.
(iv) Pensions
The net liability and cost of the defined benefit pension scheme is calculated by a qualified independent actuary. The valuation is based 
on making assumptions including those for discount rate, price inflation, expected return on assets and mortality rates. Further details 
of the assumptions used are set out in note 16.
(v) Deferred tax 
The deferred tax asset in respect of unrelieved tax losses relates to losses in ACM Shipping Dry Cargo Limited. Its recovery is on the basis 
that future profits will be generated to utilise those losses.
2. Segmental reporting
The Group operates in one business sector. Internally, revenue streams are reported by function along with profit analysis between tanker 
broking and dry cargo broking. Geographical information is not produced and is not readily available. In the view of management, the cost 
of developing this information would be excessive.

11. Intangible assets continued
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units which are tested for impairment at least annually. The recoverable amount has been determined 
based on a value in use calculation using risk-adjusted cash flow projections based on financial budgets prepared by the Group. The key 
assumptions used in the value in use calculation are:
 • the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 16%. This is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted 
to reflect market assessment of specific risks associated with the segment cash flows;
 • the period over which cash flows are projected based on financial budgets approved by the Board is one year; and
 • the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the budget period is between 0% and 5% for the first three years 
and between 0% and 3% thereafter. These growth rates are based on a modest recovery in shipping freight rates.
Management believes that it is unlikely that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any 
of the cash-generating units to exceed its recoverable amount.

As a result of changes to IAS 19, future pension costs will be calculated by applying the discount rate to the net liability in the defined benefit 
scheme. The change will be effective for the year ending 31 March 2014. Had the amendments been effective for the year to 31 March 2013, 
a charge of £247,000 would have resulted rather than a credit of £114,000 actually accounted for under the existing IAS. The current service 
cost would have been £179,000 rather than £162,000 whereas the net interest impact would have been a £68,000 charge as opposed to the 
£276,000 credit. As dictated by the revised IAS, the figures for year ended 31 March 2013 will be restated.

Share-based payment expense
The total charge in the consolidated income statement for the year with regard to these awards is £537,000 (2012: £417,000).
The fair values of the LTIPs are inherently valued at the share price at the date of grant less 1 penny per share.
The fair values of the Sharesave scheme and EMI options granted were determined using the Binomial option pricing model and the 
Black Scholes model. Assumptions used in the application of the option pricing models were: 
 • Risk-free interest rate – in the range 2.93% to 5.11% for the different grants 
 • Dividend yield  – 3%
 • Volatility – 30%
 • Life of options – three to five and a half years
 • Fair values range – from 36.6 pence to 64.5 pence for those issued at market value and 151 pence for those issued at nominal value
Expected volatility was estimated by reference to historical share price movements in both the Group and comparable quoted companies.

25. Financial instruments and risks
The Group’s financial risk management policies are designed to reduce the risk of currency, liquidity and credit risk exposure.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash at bank and other items including trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly 
from its operations. 
The Group has no assets or liabilities other than forward foreign exchange contracts that fall to be classed as derivatives. The Group does 
not engage in instruments of a speculative nature.
Annual report and accounts 2013 www.acmshippinggroup.com
46 25. Financial instruments and risks continued
(a) Currency risk
The Group derives most of its revenue in US dollars and hence it is exposed to currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates. 
So as to mitigate this risk the Group places forward contracts for the sale of US dollars at fixed rates. The purpose of such transactions is 
to manage the currency risk arising from the Group’s operations. At year end the Group had contracts outstanding to sell US$8.0 million 
(2012: US$7.5 million) and to receive sterling. These contracts all had a maturity date of less than one year and were contracted at rates 
ranging from $1.49 to $1.61 to £1. The average rate of the forward contracts was $1.58 to £1. 
At each balance sheet date, the contracts are restated to their fair value, based on currency contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
At 31 March 2013 the fair value of these contracts was a liability of £201,000 (2012: an asset of £96,000). All other financial assets are 
classified as loans and receivables. All financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.
The rate on the balance sheet date was $1.51 to £1 (2012: $1.60). The average rate for the year was $1.58 to £1 (2012: $1.60).
As at 31 March 2013 all cash and cash equivalents were held in sterling except for bank accounts totalling US$3.2 million (2012: US$2.7 million). 
There is no difference between the book values and fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
The effect on profit before taxation of a 10% weakening in the average US dollar exchange rate in the year compared to the effective rates 
for the year is approximately £0.9 million adverse (2012: £1.1 million). This effect is before hedging and with all other variables being equal. 
A 10% strengthening in the average US dollar is approximately £0.9 million favourable (2012: £1.1 million). The effect on equity is similar to 
that on profit before taxation.
(b) Liquidity risk
The Group finances itself through retained earnings. The Group is fundamentally cash generative and manages its liquid resources 
so as to obtain the best available rates of return on cash investments, whilst retaining access to those resources. 
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents is given in note 24. The Group does not currently have any borrowings.
(c) Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets 
is represented by the carrying value of receivables as at the balance sheet date. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing 
basis and a bad debt provision is held to cover doubtful debts. The Group has not historically suffered from significant bad debts.
(d) Interest rate risk
The Group has exposure to interest rates on its cash and short-term deposits. 
26. Ultimate controlling party
No individual shareholder has ultimate control of the Company. 
27. Related party transactions
The Group did not enter into any related party transactions. 
The Company entered into transactions, in the ordinary course of business, with related parties. Dividends were received from a 
subsidiary of £1,943,000 (2012: £2,180,000). At 31 March 2013 the Company owed £744,000 (2012: £482,000) to subsidiary companies.

1.  If you have sold or transferred all your ordinary shares in the Company, please send this document and the enclosed form of proxy (“Proxy Form”) to the stockbroker, 
or other agent through whom the sale or transfer was effected, for transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
2.  Holders of ordinary shares, or their duly appointed representatives, are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM. Shareholders are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all 
or any of their rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A shareholder can appoint the Chairman of the meeting or anyone else to be his/her proxy 
at the meeting. A proxy need not be a shareholder. More than one proxy can be appointed in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the 
rights attached to a different ordinary share or shares held by that shareholder. To appoint more than one proxy, the Proxy Form should be photocopied and completed 
for each proxy holder. The proxy holder’s name should be written on the Proxy Form together with the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is authorised to act. 
The box on the Proxy Form must also be ticked to indicate that the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All Proxy Forms must be signed and, to be 
effective, must be lodged with the Company’s registrar so as to arrive not later than 48 hours before the time of the meeting or, in the case of an adjournment, 48 hours 
before the adjourned time. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most 
senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the 
joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
3. The return of a completed Proxy Form will not prevent a shareholder attending the AGM and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.
4.  Only shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company as at 48 hours before the time of the meeting shall be entitled to attend the AGM 
either in person or by proxy and the number of ordinary shares then registered in their respective names shall determine the number of votes such persons are entitled 
to cast on a poll at the AGM.
5.  The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in note 2 does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights described in that note can 
only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
6.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the AGM, arrangements will be put in place at the AGM so that: (i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the 
Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at 
the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative 
in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder 
has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives 
who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. Corporate shareholders 
are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details 
of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of appointment letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above. 
7.  In accordance with regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended), to be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting (and for the purposes of the 
determination by the Company of the number of votes they may cast), members must be entered on the Company’s register of members by 11:30am on 3 September 2013 or, 
if the meeting is adjourned, by not later than 48 hours before the time and date fixed for the adjourned meeting.
8. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution.
9.  Copies of all service agreements under which Directors of the Company are employed by the Company or any subsidiaries will be available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office, during normal business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) from the date of this notice until the conclusion of the 
AGM and at the venue of the AGM for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.
10.  Except as provided above, shareholders who have general queries about the meeting should write to the company secretary at the address of our registered office. You may not 
use any electronic address provided either in this notice of AGM or any related documents (including the Proxy Form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes 
other than those expressly stated.

50 AGM – Business at the AGM
Shareholders will see from the notice of AGM that they are asked to consider and, if thought fit, pass a number of resolutions as ordinary 
and special business which are summarised below.
As ordinary business
Resolution 1 – to receive the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2013.
Resolution 2 – to approve the Directors’ remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 March 2013.
Resolution 3 – to declare a final dividend for the financial year ended 31 March 2013 of 7 pence per share. Subject to approval, the final 
dividend will be payable on 4 October 2013 to shareholders on the register as at close of business on 6 September 2013.
Resolutions 4, 5 and 6 – under the Company’s Articles of Association, and in accordance with Group policy, one third of the Company’s 
Directors retire by rotation and, being eligible, Mark Tracey, Michael Rudd and James Gundy offer themselves for re-election.
Resolution 7 – auditor – this resolution, if passed, will re-appoint RSM Tenon Audit Limited as auditor of the Company and authorise the 
Directors to fix its remuneration.
As special business
The following item will be proposed as an ordinary resolution:
Resolution 8 – Authority to allot shares
This resolution, if passed, will authorise the Directors of the Company generally and unconditionally to allot ordinary shares of the Company up 
to a maximum nominal value of £65,168 representing approximately one third of the current issued share capital of the Company. This authority 
will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company unless previously varied, revoked or renewed by the Company in general meeting.
The following items will be proposed as special resolutions:
Resolution 9 – Disapplication of pre-emption rights
This resolution, if passed, will grant the Directors of the Company power to allot shares wholly for cash pursuant to the authority conferred 
on them by resolution 8 otherwise than to the existing shareholders of the Company in proportion to their existing holdings of ordinary shares. 
The first part of the disapplication is limited to rights issues, open offers and similar pro-rata issues. In relation to a rights issue, open offer 
or other pro-rata issues the disapplication authority is unlimited and allows the Directors to offer shares to existing shareholders other than 
strictly in proportion to their holdings, where for example, overseas regulations make it difficult to offer shares pro-rata to existing overseas 
shareholders or when dealing with fractions of shares. The second part of the disapplication is limited to issues of shares pursuant to the 
terms of the Company’s current share scheme and any other share schemes approved by the Company in general meeting. The final part 
of the resolution also enables your Board to allot shares for any purpose up to an aggregate nominal value of £19,550 representing 
approximately 10% of the current issued share capital of the Company.

Resolution 10 – Share buy-back 
This resolution seeks authority for the Company to make market purchases of its own shares and is proposed as a special resolution. 
If passed, the resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 1,955,000 of its shares, representing just under 10% of the 
Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at the date of this notice of AGM.
The resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any shares purchased under this authority. The authority 
will expire at the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM. 
Whilst the Directors do not currently have any intention of exercising the authority granted by this resolution, the Directors would require 
the authority granted by this resolution to make market purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares as a method of returning surplus cash 
to shareholders. The Directors will only exercise the authority to purchase shares where they consider that such purchases will be in the best 
interests of shareholders generally and will result in an increase in earnings per share.
The Company may either cancel any shares it purchases under this authority or transfer them into treasury (and subsequently sell or transfer 
them out of treasury or cancel them). The Directors currently intend to transfer sufficient shares purchased under this authority into treasury 
in order to satisfy the Company’s share incentive schemes and to cancel any excess shares purchased.

Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Chairman’s Statement
Stephen Oke
Chairman
2013 was another challenging year for the global 
mining industry and for your Company in particular. 
Declining commodity prices, a continued focus on 
cost control by incoming management teams, political 
uncertainty in some countries and concerns over poor 
economic growth in China all significantly impacted 
levels of capital expenditure in the sector, which are 
estimated to have fallen by 20% during the year. 
As a result of these factors a 
number of Shaft Sinkers’ contracts 
were delayed, reworked or 
cancelled during the year and this 
has negatively impacted the 
Group’s financial performance in 
2013. Despite significant efforts by 
management to deliver on targets, 
disappointing operational 
performance on key contracts has 
exacerbated the decline in financial 
performance. I can assure you the 
focus of the management team is 
concentrated fully on the 
improvement of our operational 
performance and the negative 
impact on cash flow that has been 
felt as a result.
In addition, the arduous operating 
environment in South Africa 
continues to impact our business 
and industry generally. The 
renewed strike action after the end 
of the year which, at the time of 
writing, has not been resolved 
despite recent further offers being 
made, is debilitating and crippling 
the platinum industry in particular 
and is clearly affecting levels of 
investment. Nevertheless, South 
Africa remains a core market for 
Shaft Sinkers and we hope that the 
business environment will improve 
following elections later in 2014 and 
a sensible resolution to the 
protracted strike action will be 
reached.
As a result of these conditions we 
have had to take a number of 
difficult decisions to reshape the 
business and reduce our cost base 
significantly. I believe, however, that 
the significant resizing of our 
corporate structure that has been 
undertaken to improve our 
profitability levels will not damage 
our ability to service current clients 
or dilute our expertise. We also 
continue to focus on adjusting our 
contracting model to reduce risks 
and improve operational visibility. I 
am delighted that despite these 
difficult conditions Shaft Sinkers 
delivered a creditable health and 
safety performance in 2013 with 
zero fatalities and 2.4 million 
fatality free shifts in the year.
Despite the current uncertain 
environment our strategy remains 
valid: to diversify by building on our 
reputation as a trusted and 
professional operator in order to 
enter new markets around the 
world and to support projects 
beyond just the mining sector.
Shaft Sinkers’ strong heritage and 
successful track record is unique in 
the industry and extremely 
attractive for clients seeking a 
reliable partner to construct the 
type of critical infrastructure in 
which we specialise. The significant 
skills and experience we have built 
over many years are part of our 
core strengths and enable us to 
complete technically complex 
projects safely and reliably. 
In addition to the sector headwinds 
outlined above, during the year we 
have continued to deal with the 
legal action by EuroChem relating 
to the Volga-Kaliy project. We 
reject EuroChem’s allegations in 
the strongest possible manner and 
are defending them vigorously. We 
believe the principal claims are 
entirely without foundation.  Order book by commodity

pleased to report that despite the 
very difficult conditions resulting 
from strike action in South Africa all 
of our teams in the country remain 
ready to assist our clients in line 
with our contractual obligations. 
The outlook for the remainder of 
2014 remains difficult. There is no 
clear sign of when sentiment in our 
core mining markets will improve 
and the added uncertainty over 
how the growing stalemate 
between the major South African 
platinum producers and the 
Association of Mineworkers and 
Construction Union (“AMCU”) will 
be resolved is also of great 
concern. Nevertheless, as a result 
of the measures we have taken, I 
believe that the Group is well 
positioned to weather the current 
market environment. In the longer 
term the outlook remains positive 
for your Company. In an 
environment where brownfield 
developments require mining at 
greater depths, and open cut 
operations make the transition to 
underground, demand for our 
services is likely to grow. In 
addition, in an industry which is 
capital constrained, mining 
companies are likely to focus on 
extending the lives of existing 
operations where significant costs 
have already been sunk rather than 
investing in new projects that may 
have greater risk. 
Stephen Oke
Chairman
29 April 2014
Furthermore, we continue to 
pursue EuroChem to recover the 
amounts it owes us. 
Dealing with these damaging 
allegations continues to take up a 
significant amount of board and 
management time as well as 
financial resources. We have made 
a number of submissions to the 
arbitrators, and expect the hearing 
to occur in mid 2014 with final 
determinations expected early in 
2015.
Given the range of challenges that 
the Group is currently facing and 
the resulting short-term cash 
pressures especially in South 
Africa, the Board has elected to 
pay no final dividend.
I would like to thank our employees 
for their considerable efforts in 
what is an extremely difficult time 
for our sector and the Group. The 
business is dependent upon the 
hard work, dedication and skills of 
all of our employees wherever they

Strategy and Context
Strategy
Shaft Sinkers seeks to generate 
long-term returns for investors by 
exploiting a global leadership 
position in the development of 
large, deep complex shaft systems. 
The Group aims to do this through:
Increased geographic 
diversification:
Major mining and infrastructure 
projects are increasingly located 
in growth markets such as the 
CIS, India and China. The Group is 
targeting further expansion in 
these geographies by applying its 
superior technical skills and, in 
some cases, forming partnerships 
with leading local firms.
Expansion into new end use 
markets:
Whilst the Group’s clients are 
predominantly in the mining 
sector, Shaft Sinkers has 
experience of operating in a 
number of industries, such as 
hydro-electric and underground 
storage. The Group’s strong 
engineering and technical skills 
covering all elements of shaft 
sinking and underground 
construction should provide a 
strong basis for further expansion 
in this area.
Development of additional 
services:
In order to provide improved 
services to clients, Shaft Sinkers 
supplements its core business by 
providing additional services such 
as contract mining, shaft 
maintenance, underground 
construction and tunnelling. Shaft 
Sinkers is also engaged in research 
and development activities to 
develop new technologies and 
improve existing practices.
Leverage of its industry-leading 
technical strengths:
The Group’s highly skilled 
engineers and technical experts 
adopt an integrated approach to 
all aspects of shaft design, 
construction and operation. We 
invest heavily in training and 
employee development to 
maintain this position. 
Market context
Short term
The main customers of shaft 
sinking contractors are mining 
companies, therefore prevailing 
conditions in the sector have a 
significant influence on demand 
for the Group’s services. During 
2013, mining companies adhered 
to conservative policies they 
began to adopt in 2012, driven by 
three connected issues:
1. Poor returns to shareholders: 
since 2011 total returns to 
shareholders by mining 
companies have 
underperformed all other 
sectors. As a result, investors 
have demanded increased 
dividends at the expense of 
capital expenditure on projects 
to increase production levels. 
2. Commodity price declines: 
Following an extended boom in 
the metals and mining sector, 
falling commodity prices have 
resulted in declining profits and 
more than $60 billion of write 
downs across the sector since 
2012. During 2013 prices for 
precious metals such as gold, 
silver and platinum fell by 
approximately 30%, 33% and 
3% respectively whilst base 
metals were also impacted with 
nickel declining by 18% and zinc 
by 4%.
3. Increasing uncertainty and 
volatility: Volatility and 
uncertainty makes it hard for 
companies to approve long-
term investment projects. 
Concerns over slowing growth 
in China and continued 
subdued growth in Europe 
have not been fully offset by 
improving conditions in North 
America so the demand for key 
commodities is currently 
unclear. Political and regulatory 
uncertainty has also grown in a 
number of key markets. In 
addition, prices for a number of 
commodities are increasingly 
volatile due to factors such as 
the monetisation of 
commodities and structural 
supply issues. According to a 
recent McKinsey study the 
average annual volatility of 
resource pricing since 2000 is 
almost three times the level 
seen in the 1990s.
As a result of these factors, mining 
companies reduced capital 
expenditure in 2013, with 
Bloomberg forecasting that 
expenditure by the top 20 mining 
companies will decline by about a 
third to $66 billion in 2015 from 
2012 levels. Nevertheless, although

remains significant at GBP238 
million at year end. 
Long-term market dynamics
Despite these negative short-term 
trends, the outlook for the sector 
is potentially more positive. 
Commodity prices remain close 
to the levels seen in 2008 prior to 
the financial crisis and there are a 
number of long-term factors 
which are likely to mean demand 
for shaft sinking grows.
Demand for metals is likely to 
remain elevated as a result of 
urbanisation in Asia and 
particularly China where the 
economy is forecast to grow by 
7.5% in 2014 and 7.2% in 2015 
according to Bloomberg. BHP 
Billiton forecasts that Chinese 
growth could increase demand 
for some commodities by 75% 
over the next 15 years.
The mining industry faces a 
significant challenge in meeting 
this demand as many mines are 
becoming older and new major 
discoveries remain limited despite 
significant expenditure on 
exploration over recent years. 
Furthermore, investors remain 
uncertain about companies 
investing in major greenfield 
projects given the poor returns 
such projects have generated in 
recent years.
As a result, the industry is likely to 
focus on prolonging the lives of 
existing mines and one of the 
most common ways this can be 
achieved is through the 
conversion of open cut mines into 
underground operations. This 
approach has a number of 
benefits for mining companies as 
it minimises financial and 
operational risks because key 
infrastructure is already in place 
and the characteristics of the 
deposit are already well known.
Shaft sinking jumbo  STRATEGIC REPORT

Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Business Model
Shaft Sinkers has a track record of more than 
50 years developing some of the deepest and 
most geologically complex shafts in the world 
for major, blue chip customers. Much of the 
Group’s work consists of repeat projects or 
multiple contracts for the same customers.
Focused on delivering value
We apply the skills we have 
developed to design, deliver and 
maintain technically complex 
projects to the highest standards 
of engineering anywhere in the 
world. We have the capability to 
sink shafts through all types of 
rock strata.
The Group performs vital but 
non-core activities for major 
mining companies by sinking 
mine shafts and developing 
underground infrastructure which 
enables them to access their ore 
and sustain their businesses. The 
Group’s projects typically last a 
number of years and require 
specialised, non-transferrable 
skills and equipment which 
mining companies do not 
generally possess.
 
Geological conditions and other 
variable factors can never be 
predicted comprehensively 
before sinking commences so it is 
normal for Shaft Sinkers to share 
these risks with its clients. The 
Group also ensures that contracts 
cover on-going costs in the event 
that revenues are impacted by 
unforeseen delays in project 
execution. A more detailed 
explanation of the contracting 
types follows below. 
 
Shaft Sinkers revenue model is 
akin to that of a construction 
contractor and the Group targets 
a profit margin (7% to 15%) and 
overhead (10%) on top of costs. 
The Group’s costs comprise 
specialised and semi-skilled 
labour (50%), specialised plant 
and equipment (30%) and 
consumables and permanent 
materials (20%). Hence even 
though the Group is heavily 
reliant on the mining industry, its 
earnings model is not directly 
affected by commodity pricing 
and is directly linked to project 
delivery and growth in the 
number of new projects it 
secures.
 
The Group’s revenues can vary, 
however, as they are subject to a 
range of factors including project 
delivery schedules, competitor 
activity and the overall market 
environment.
The long-term value to be derived 
from Shaft Sinkers is the growth 
in business that should stem from 
the fact that mineral deposits are 
increasingly found at greater 
depths, with the territories being 
focussed on by the Group largely 
unexploited to date. In the short-
term there will be vloatility in the 
revenues and cash flows of the 
Group but from the longer term 
growth should flow a more 
dependable earnings and hence 
dividend stream.
Tendering process
Due to the complexity and 
longevity of a typical project, 
contract negotation is critical to 
effective risk management both 
for the Company and its clients. 
The process recognises the need 
for contractual adjustments 
(variation orders) during the 
project, requiring strong 
commercial skills, including 
contract management, quantity 
surveying and financial 
management. Where possible, the 
Company carries out its activities 
under contract terms which share

risks equitably with its clients.
Variation orders typically occur 
when a contractor is required to 
undertake additional work which is 
not defined in the terms of the 
contract and therefore does not 
have a specified rate. For Shaft 
Sinkers, this situation usually 
occurs when the mine design or 
mining plan changes. Consequently 
the contractor performs the 
activity and engages the client to 
recoup the activity cost after the 
fact. This is a normal occurrence in 
rates type contracts and has a cash 
flow impact which we as the 
contractor try to minimise. In 
addition to delay, the main risk is 
that the estimate for the work is 
inaccurate resulting in an 
inappropriate rate being agreed.
Preferred contract model 
Selecting the right contract type 
is key to delivering value to 
shareholders. Historically, the 
shaft sinking industry has used 
rates based contracts under 
which almost all risk is assumed 
by the contractor. Whilst 
potentially lucrative, these 
contracts can impose significant 
burdens in the event that delays 
or other problems occur.
The Group’s preferred contracting 
model is cost-plus, which fairly 
apportions project risks and 
minimizes costs by giving the 
client direct control of 
procurement through a 
transparent system. The costs 
related to developing the shaft are 
reimbursed to the company while 
a reasonable mark-up is added for 
the benefit of the contractor. 
One variation to the cost-plus 
model is Agreed Target Cost 
(ATC). In ATC, a target cost is 
agreed at the outset of the project 
together and set as the budget 
against which costs are measured. 
Costs are reimbursed with an 
added mark-up for the contractor. 
If the actual cost is below the 
target cost then the benefits are 
shared, however if the target cost 
is excceeded then a penalty is 
imposed. This incentivises project 
delivery on time and on budget, 
whilst sharing risks equitably.
Work on site
The preparatory work and sinking 
processes require specific 
technical expertise given the 
complexity and unique features of 
each project, together with the 
fact that a typical project may 
take over a decade to complete.
The Group’s sophisticated risk 
and project management 
techniques enable us to manage 
challenging, large scale 
engineering projects. 
Maintaining our competitive 
position also requires: 
 – High standards of health and 
safety. Shaft Sinkers applies 
leading health and safety 
standards and has a strong 
safety record.
 – Training and personnel 
development. Shaft Sinkers 
operates a training facility 
which provides skills training in 
both sinking and conventional 
development and mining 
operations with structured 
development programmes for 
individuals. 
 – Investment in research and 
development. The Group is 
involved in the development of 
a new shaft scanning 
technology which has the 
potential to revolutionise the 
maintenance of shafts. STRATEGIC REPORT

Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
CEO’s Review
Following a review of the Group’s 
activities last year, we took a 
number of steps to restructure 
the business in the first half of 
2013, cutting costs and reducing 
operating overheads by 17% and 
ensuring the optimal mix of skills 
across our business. 
Gross margins improved to 13% in 
the year as a result of changes to 
the way in which certain 
engineering costs were allocated 
within our South African business. 
Although the margin 
improvement was offset by a rise 
in operating expenses the 
reallocation process has enabled 
us to identify a number of 
opportunities to reduce costs 
which we will pursue in 2014. 
However, the challenging 
conditions in the mining sector 
continued to affect our financial 
performance. Revenues declined 
by 21% in 2013 with gross profits 
for the year falling by 
approximately 11.5% as a result of 
reduced work load in South Africa 
as well as the deterioration in the 
value of the Rand against Sterling, 
which impacted profits by 
GBP0.2 million. The GBP3.9 
million of legal costs associated 
with the EuroChem arbitration 
processes were well above 
expectations and therefore also a 
significant drag on profitability. 
Operational performance across 
our projects during 2013 was 
mixed. Whilst our work on the 
Kibali project for Randgold 
Resources and our projects for 
Lonmin proceeded well during 
2013 we experienced operational 
problems at Impala, Leuwkop, 
Styldrift and Hindustan Zinc. 
 
Despite a difficult environment, 
the Group won in excess of 
GBP47 million of repeat business 
from existing clients such as 
Lonmin, Afplats and Impala and 
was selected as preferred bidder 
to sink a shaft for Kazchrome 
during 2013. This is testament to 
the continued hard work of our 
teams and the attractiveness of 
our proposition. However, Shaft 
Sinkers was not awarded any 
major new contracts during the 
year, significantly hampering our 
planned profitability.
We remain in discussions with 
Kazchrome having been 
appointed as the preferred bidder 
for the Kazchrome Donskoy Gok 
project in August 2013 and we will 
provide further updates in due 
course. We also expect to be 
awarded extensions of work on 
existing projects in 2014, such as 
Lonmin K3 and Leeuwkop. 
The Group continues to tender for 
a number of significant contracts 
around the world however we 
cannot at this stage predict the 
timing or outcome of these 
processes. 
Cash flow is anticipated to be 
tight until the latter half of the 
year and liquidity issues in South 
Africa have been exacerbated by 
the lack of revenues from the 
strike-affected projects as well as 
poor operational performance. 
We continue to review a range of

options to address this issue and 
will provide further information as 
necessary. 
Strategy
As expected, the current situation 
in the global mining sector 
continues to validate our strategy 
to diversify into different 
commodities, geographies and 
sectors. Revenues from our 
international business rose 
strongly in the year to GBP42.1 
million from GBP16.0 million in the 
prior year and offset some of the 
decline in revenues from South 
Africa. Revenues from our 
International business now 
represent almost 28% of total 
revenues, up from approximately 
8% in 2012 and 19% in 2011. We 
expect this trend to continue over 
the medium term as we secure 
more international business 
through new partnerships. 
During 2013 we also made 
progress in a number of key areas 
with regards to increasing 
diversification through the 
conclusion of collaboration 
agreements with China Nonferrous 
Metal Industry’s Foreign 
Engineering and Construction Co., 
Ltd. (‘NFC’), one of the largest 
Chinese Engineering, Procurement 
and Construction Management 
(‘EPCM’) companies and India’s 
Tata Projects Limited, the EPCM 
subsidiary of TATA Group. These 
two agreements, whilst in the early 
stage, have the potential to deliver 
significant long-term benefit by 
providing improved access to the 
growing markets of India and 
China. Another initiative in its early 
stages is the collaboration 
between the Group and Laing 
O’Rourke, a large UK based 
construction group. We have 
jointly submitted a proposal to 
Sirius Minerals to perform some 
early design work.
As our business internationalises 
we face a different set of risks to 
those which affect our core South 
African operations. The ability to 
operate successfully within 
different legal, regulatory and 
cultural norms is every bit as 
complex as the difficult geological 
or operational challenges we face. 
We are therefore focusing on 
improving our project 
management skills to deal with 
these challenges and to learn from 
operations where we are working 
successfully, such as Kibali 
Goldmines in the DRC.
We also continue to focus on 
changing the nature of our 
contractual arrangements with 
clients. Historically our work has 
been carried out on rates-based 
contracts which expose the Group 
to significant risk in the event of 
unforeseen circumstances relating 
to geological or mine plan 
adjustments which slow the rate of 
progress achieved by Shaft 
Sinkers. When negotiating new 
contracts for existing clients we 
were successful in moving the 
contract type to one which more 
equitably shares the risks in a 
number of instances, notably with 
Lonmin at Karee 3 and Impala 16 
which have changed to an agreed 
target cost basis.
Operations – International
Work at the Kibali Goldmines 
project in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo proceeded well, with a 
number of major operational 
milestones achieved during 2013, 
notably the start of the main 
sinking phase in November. The 
project has performed in line with 
budget and the shaft has recently 
reached a depth of 483m ahead of 
schedule with sinking proceeding 
at a rate of at least 3 metres a day 
for more than 30 continuous days. 
Achieving this high level of 
operational performance in what 
many consider to be a complex 
and difficult operating 
environment, is a significant 
achievement. 
The project for Hindustan Zinc 
Limited (‘HZL ’) at the Rampura 
Agucha mine progressed more 
slowly than expected because of 
problems with a civil engineering 
subcontractor during the first half 
of the year. Having dismissed the 
subcontractor and taken over its 
responsibilities ourselves the 
project operated in line with 
expected rates. However sinking 
progress in the later part of 2013 
was poor and resulted in higher 
than expected costs and lower 
revenues. As the HZL project is 
being conducted on a rates type 
contract, our revenue is linked to 
the number of metres sunk and 
the slow performance meant that 
we failed to meet expected sinking 
rates and thus our revenue was 
lower than expected whilst our 
costs remained relatively fixed.  STRATEGIC REPORT
12
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
CEO’s Review continued
The HZL team has since worked 
hard at mitigating the issues 
affecting performance and we are 
currently experiencing a much 
improved performance level.
Operations – South Africa
The Group’s South African 
operations were significantly 
impacted by the difficult operating 
environment in 2013. Contracts 
were cancelled during the year in 
response to declining commodity 
prices and rising operating costs in 
the country. 
Despite this difficult operating 
environment we were awarded a 
number of contract extensions for 
South African clients, with Afplats, 
Lonmin and Impala agreeing to an 
additional GBP47.6 million worth of 
work for the Group. This is 
testament to the vital nature of our 
work for these clients and the 
strong relationships we have built 
with their management teams 
despite the challenging 
environment. 
 
We successfully reduced the level 
of outstanding variation orders 
during the first half of the year, 
however, they began to build again 
during the second half of 2013. 
However, we were successful in 
collecting many of the outstanding 
variation orders in the last quarter 
of 2013 and were therefore able to 
reduce the Group’s debtors’ book 
outstanding, resulting in a small 
improvement in cash before the 
repayment of debt.
As a result of the removal of one 
layer of operational management 
and a range of other cost cutting 
initiatives such as consolidating 
roles, eliminating unrecoverable 
costs and reducing overtime we 
were able to significantly reduce 
operational overheads. Total 
headcount in South Africa has 
now declined from approximately 
7,200 to 3,923 at the end of 2013. 
The Group will continue to 
examine its overhead structures 
and look for opportunities to 
reduce costs in this very sensitive 
period for the mining industry.
 
However, these improvements 
were offset by significant 
operational underperformance at 
a number of operations, with 
performance at the Impala 17 and 
Styldrift projects being particularly 
disappointing. 
Styldrift experienced poor 
operational performance over the 
last two months of the 
measurement period stemming 
from some poor planning. 
Our Impala 17 project was severely 
impacted by safety stoppages as 
a result of Section 54 notices 
during 2013 and a generally poor 
safety record in the year. Under 
Section 54 of the Mine Health and 
Safety Act of South Africa, the 
mine safety inspectorate can close 
all or part of a mine in the event 
that it believes any conditions or 
particular events could impact the 
health and safety of anybody 
working in the mine (see the 
Corporate Responsibility section 
on page 38 for more details). 
Management has taken various 
steps to improve the situation 
including engaging a third party 
health and safety expert firm to 
perform an independent 
assessment of site safety systems. 
The assessment rated the project’s 
safety systems very highly, 
although it found that in a number 
of cases issues which had been 
identified were not dealt with 
effectively. A number of 
recommendations have since been 
adopted in order to improve the 
clarity of the safety reporting and 
ensure issues are fully resolved. 
As a result of the operational 
difficulties at Impala 17 Shaft 
Sinkers lost GBP0.6 million on the 
project in 2013 and has lost a 
further GBP0.9 million since the 
financial year end to March 2014. 
In April 2014, after the year end, 
we reached agreement with 
Impala over a revision to the terms 
of the contract for Impala 17 under 
which Shaft Sinkers will be 
compensated for labour and 
materials based on an agreed rate 
and will have the opportunity to 
be paid an additional bonus 
element based on achieving 
certain performance criteria.
The revised terms, which became 
effective from 15 April 2014, are 
expected to improve the financial 
performance of this contract. The 
new contract runs until to 15 
September 2014, after which date 
it will terminate if not renewed. 
Impala is retendering the contract 
and Shaft Sinkers is participating 
in the retender process. 13
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
www.shaftsinkersgroup.com
South African Labour situation
After the end of the year, the 
Association of Mineworkers and 
Construction Union (‘AMCU’) 
initiated a protected strike 
affecting South Africa’s major 
platinum producers which had 
suspended operations at Impala 16 
and Lonmin. The current situation 
between the AMCU and the mining 
companies appears deadlocked 
with little signs of movement by 
either side. As a result, there is 
currently little clarity on when and 
how the strike will conclude.
Our employees are not on strike, 
however they have been 
prevented from working at 
affected sites. Shaft Sinkers has 
contractual provisions in place 
which are designed to ensure that 
we will recover certain costs in the 
event that our clients’ operations 
are impacted by strike action not 
related to us. However, even with 
these contractual provisions, the 
Group’s profitability will be 
impacted. 
METS
Our Mining Engineering and 
Technical Services (‘METS’) 
division continues to find new 
opportunities for design and EPCM 
contracts. In 2013 METS managed 
the highly complex project to 
design, engineer, coordinate and 
supervise manufacture of the head 
gears for the HZL project. 
This required the sourcing of more 
than 2,000 tonnes of a certain 
specification of steel across China, 
India and South Africa. We 
successfully met the aggressive 
timetables set and gained 
additional invaluable experience in 
international project management 
which will be of significant long-
term benefit to the Group. 
Furthermore, in 2013 our METS 
division designed a new and 
progressive main sinking 
methodology in collaboration with 
our Indian and Russian offices. The 
new method promises a safer and 
more cost effective sinking 
operation especially for shallower 
ventilation type shafts. The Group 
will be implementing this new 
sinking methodology at HZL. 
Health, Safety and Environment
There were a number of 
significant positive achievements 
during the year with regards to 
health and safety. Notably, we 
achieved zero fatalities for the 
year and the Group has yet again 
recorded 2 million fatality free 
shifts across its operations. 
However, due to a number of 
incidents the Group’s Lost Time 
Injury Frequency Rate rose to 
4.75 from 4.08 in 2012, compared 
to our target of 3.5. As previously 
disclosed, a new safety and 
behaviour campaign has been 
introduced across the Group with 
the aim of creating greater 
awareness of safety standards 
and procedures. We have 
reintroduced a behaviour based 
system whereby all staff, 
whatever their level, are required 
to report unsafe practices or site 
conditions. All reports are 
compiled on a daily basis in a 
central database which produces 
trends that are analysed and 
create recommendations and 
mitigating steps. This system has 
been used successfully in Shaft 
Sinkers in the past and its re-
introduction has already started 
yielding measurable trends that 
management can recognise and 
respond to in a timely manner.
The Group recorded no significant 
environmental incidents at its 
operations during the year.
As most of the Group’s work 
takes place underground, impacts 
upon the environment are limited. 
Nevertheless, we are committed 
to achieving the highest 
standards of performance and 
the Group’s projects have 
ISO14001 compliant 
environmental management 
systems. During 2013, our sites 
were all audited and retained their 
ISO compliant status with only 
minor comments.

Employees
I would like to thank all of the 
Group’s employees for their efforts 
in 2013. The difficult environment 
the Group is operating in has 
required a number of tough 
decisions about the shape of Shaft 
Sinkers’ business. Despite this 
uncertainty, I am appreciative of 
the commitment our teams have 
shown in continuing to work 
together to make Shaft Sinkers a 
more efficient and competitive 
company. I am convinced that the 
Group will emerge from this 
challenging environment as a 
stronger business, ready to 
capture the significant long-term 
opportunities which exist. 
Outlook
The outlook for 2014 is mixed. 
Whilst prospects for the Group’s 
international business are positive, 
the continued uncertainty in South 
Africa is likely to significantly 
impact our operations there. 
Our work for Kibali Goldmines in 
the DRC is progressing well and 
we expect to meet operational 
and financial targets in 2014. 
Meanwhile, operational 
performance has improved at 
HZL over the first quarter of 2014 
and we have authorised a work 
acceleration programme that will 
reduce delays and potentially 
create further opportunities 
outside the current scope. 
Furthermore, I believe that we will 
finalise terms for the Kazchrome 
project in Kazakhstan in 2014 and 
that the new alliances with Tata 
and NFC will begin to bear fruit 
during the year. 
In South Africa whilst work 
continues at a number of our 
unaffected operations we are 
constantly working on plans to 
mitigate the impact of the ongoing 
strikes by redeploying some of our 
affected work force and assisting 
our clients to reduce cost impacts. 
Although the Labour strike is 
negatively affecting the South 
African platinum and associated 
industries, we believe it will be 
resolved. As a result we continue to 
compete for new projects in the 
country as well as potential 
additional work from existing 
clients. 
Management assess the new 
business pipeline to still be at a 
healthy level with a committed 
order book of GBP238 million at 
year end and outstanding tenders 
worth GBP 970 million.
The Group’s cash position remains 
tight currently, however, we are 
undertaking numerous initiatives 
with clients and suppliers to 
improve short term liquidity as well 
as converting unutilised assets into 
cash. We expect the cash position 
to improve in the second half of the 
year as the benefit of these 
initiatives is felt.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and ensuring that 
appropriate risk management processes are in place. 
It has set suitable policies on internal control and 
seeks regular assurance that the system is effective 
in managing risks in the manner which it has 
approved.
Risk management process
The Group has an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced 
by the Group. The executive management of the 
Group conducts monthly operational reviews for 
each site and for each operational department 
against measurable performance targets, budgets 
and other key performance indicators, to ensure 
risks are being communicated and managed 
throughout the Company and this process is 
regularly reviewed by the Board. 
Assessment of risks
The principal risks faced by the Group are 
considered and formally reviewed by the Board on 
an annual basis. This review includes:
 – the nature and extent of the risks facing the Group;
 – the extent and categories of risk that it regards as 
acceptable for the Group to bear;
 – the likelihood of the risks concerned occurring;
 – the Group’s ability to reduce the incidence and 
impact on the business of risks that may 
materialise through mitigating strategies; and
 – the costs of operating particular controls relative 
to the benefit thereby obtained in managing the 
related risks.
The most significant risks faced by the Group during 
2013 are summarised below along with examples of 
relevant controls and mitigating actions. They do not 
comprise all the risks associated with the Group and 
are not set out in any order of priority.
RISK MITIGATING ACTIONS
STRATEGIC RISK
The Board is involved in setting the Group’s broad strategic 
objectives and monitoring executive management’s performance 
against annually set goals. There are processes in place to ensure 
the strategic objectives are effectively communicated within the 
Company and regular quarterly reviews of financial performance.
Failure to successfully execute the Group’s stated strategy and to 
meet shareholder objectives is one of the primary risks facing the 
Group.
SAFETY RISK
A comprehensive set of safety procedures are in place and these 
are regularly reviewed and updated for any new risks which have 
been identified. In addition, the Group periodically introduces 
new safety campaigns to improve performance. A dedicated 
Safety, Health, Environment, Quality and Training department 
(‘SHEQT’) monitors safety performance and events on a daily 
basis. Each site has a dedicated safety officer responsible for 
managing safety matters, including monitoring the progress of 
action plans, reporting on safety incidents and ensuring the 
Group’s policies are being adhered to. In this way the Group 
ensures accountability and responsibility for these matters 
remains with operational management teams. The Safety 
Committee of the Board endeavours to meet at least quarterly to 
review performance reports from the SHEQT department and 
reports to the Board with recommendations should they be 
required.
Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, safety is a significant 
issue for the Company. Failure to maintain high levels of safety 
can result in harm and serious injury to our employees and 
significantly impact our ability to carry out and grow our 
business.
LIQUIDITY RISK
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet 
unexpected operational expenses, including the servicing of 
financial obligations. This excludes the potential impact of 
extreme circumstances that cannot be reasonably predicted, 
such as natural disasters. In addition, the Group maintains 
overdraft facilities with its Bankers to cover periods where high 
volumes of the operational liabilities are expected to occur. 
The Board and management conduct regular and intensified 
planning sessions to ensure the cash resources available to the 
Group are managed in the most efficient manner, especially in 
times of tight cash flow constraints when liquidity is limited. 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its 
financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will 
always have sufficient cash flow and marketable securities to 
meet its obligations when they fall due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk 
damage to the Group’s reputation. 17
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
www.shaftsinkersgroup.com
RISK MITIGATING ACTIONS
FINANCIAL RISK
For each of these risks the Group has implemented appropriate 
policies and procedures and executive management regularly 
reviews performance against set targets. Daily reviews of cash 
management with rolling forecasts and strong controls are 
implemented by the executive management. Furthermore, the 
Board sets prudent policies for the hedging of currency and 
interest rate risks and the Audit and Risk Committee reviews 
these aspects on a quarterly basis. Insurance is taken to protect 
the Group against the risk of fraud or theft of funds.
The risk of inadequate funding or inappropriately managing the 
funding of the business is one of the primary risks that could 
affect the Group’s ability to trade. Other significant financial risks 
include the safeguarding of assets, inappropriate tendering prices 
that could cause the Group to lose potential contracts or 
undertake contracts which are unprofitable, corrupt procurement 
practices resulting in excessive costs and mismanagement of 
expenditure.
LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS
We adhere to the principle of self-regulation backed by 
appropriate policies and management review. The Group actively 
monitors regulatory and political developments on a continuous 
basis to ensure we are in compliance with all relevant regulations. 
We have developed a Group-wide anti-bribery and corruption 
policy which has been implemented throughout the Group 
through the necessary procedures, taking into account the 
requirements of the OECD Convention on Bribery of Foreign 
Public Officials in International Business Transactions, the US 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the UK 
Bribery Act 2010 and the anti-bribery and corruption statutes of 
all jurisdictions to which the Company and its subsidiaries and 
affiliates are subject and any related rules and regulations. The 
rolling out of an enhanced compliance framework is in progress.
The Group continues to robustly reject and defend against the 
EuroChem claim proceedings.
Changes in standards, laws and regulations in the countries where 
we operate may affect our business. We are aware that some of 
the jurisdictions in which the Group operates pose particular and 
often heightened reputational issues that need to be managed 
appropriately. We are conscious of the risk of failure to comply 
with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and/or 
sanctions laws and regulations which could lead to share price 
devaluation, financial penalties and criminal prosecutions.
The Group is currently subject of legal action from EuroChem.
EXTERNAL/ 
POLITICAL RISK
Through its strategy of diversification both geographically and 
into other related areas of operation, the Board has sought to 
mitigate these risks to the extent possible. Political risks are 
mitigated through the contractual terms agreed and where 
appropriate, the involvement of Export Credit Agencies.
The Group is aware of the political, social and labour relations risks 
in some of the geographies in which it operates. The political, social 
or economic environment in any jurisdiction may change leading to 
the inability to realise the expected results from our projects.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
The Group’s contracting models have been established to provide 
flexibility thus mitigating some of these risks. Management 
oversight, strong disciplines within the operations departments 
and a focus on attracting and retaining key skills are also key 
elements of the Group’s strategy. Regular planning by executive 
management on securing the appropriate resources for current 
and future projects form part of the mitigating strategies which 
are reviewed at all levels of management and the Board.
Operational performance can be influenced by technical and 
engineering factors as well as events or circumstances. Failure to 
meet project delivery timetables and budgets may delay cash 
inflows, increase capital costs, and reduce profitability. The risk of 
operating below best industry standards could also lead to lost 
contracts in the long run.
COMMODITY CYCLE/GLOBAL 
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by pursuing a strategy to 
increase geographic, commodity and end market diversity.
The Group’s customers operate in markets which are closely 
linked to the global economic environment and the commodities 
cycle. As a result, demand for the Group’s services can be 
impacted by changes in global economic performance. STRATEGIC REPORT
18
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Corporate Responsibility
We believe that conducting our operations responsibly 
and sustainably in all countries in which we operate is 
important in order to remain at the forefront of shaft 
sinking and underground development over the longer 
term.
With regard to corporate 
responsibility, our key areas of 
focus are ensuring the safety of 
our employees and the quality of 
our operations, recruiting and 
developing skilled employees and 
contributing to the communities 
within which we operate, often in 
collaboration with our clients. Our 
corporate responsibility activities 
during 2013 are set out in the 
following section. 
Safety
The safety of our employees 
remains our priority and we have 
a strong safety record across our 
operations. The Group aims to 
develop a disciplined and 
constructive environment in 
which all employees understand 
their roles and obligations, as well 
as the importance of maintaining 
safety standards, through internal 
training, management and safety 
standards and procedures.
In 2013 we achieved zero fatalities 
and in September 2013 we 
reached two million fatality free 
shifts across our operations. 
While the Group’s Lost Time 
Injury Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’) 
remained low at a level of 4.75 in 
2013, this was below our target of 
3.5 and a slight increase from the 
level of 4.08 achieved in 2012. 
Over the last three years our 
operations have been impacted 
by a significant increase in the 
number of Section 54 notices 
issued by mine inspectors from 
the South African Department of 
Mineral Resources. Section 54 
Notices can result in some or all 
work at a particular mine being 
halted. We have conducted a 
detailed analysis of our Section 
54 statistics over the last three 
years in order to develop a better 
understanding of how to manage 
this issue. 
Despite a significant (threefold) 
increase in Section 54 notices 
over the period our safety 
statistics have been broadly flat. 
We believe, therefore, that the 
increase in Section 54 notices is 
largely due to a change in policy 
at the DMR rather than a 
deterioration of our safety 
systems. Indeed many of the 
Section 54 notices Shaft Sinkers 
have been subject to are the 
result of considerably more 
stringent implementation of 
existing rules and regulations. 
As a result the Group continues to 
strive to improve its safety 
standards by introducing new and 
innovative safety campaigns. 
During 2013 we launched a 
number of additional safety 
initiatives, some of which are 
outlined below: 
 – In the second half of 2013, we 
began a Tools and Equipment 
safety campaign, which aimed 
to further raise awareness of 
operating safely. Posters were 
distributed to all sites to discuss 
in their daily and weekly safety 
meetings and display on all the 
notice boards on site. The 
campaign has already achieved 
a 38% reduction in the number 
of incidents related to tools and 
equipment and a 75% reduction 
in the number of lost time 
injuries.
 – A Behaviour Based Safety 
(‘BBS’) road show was 
conducted at all our operational 
sites. Supervisors and crew 
were sensitised on our 
behavioural based training 
programme, highlighting their 
different roles and 
responsibilities both for their 
own safety and the safety of 
their fellow employees. To 
reinforce senior management’s 
commitment to safety, all the 
sessions were opened by our 
Operational Director and a 
member of senior management 
was also present during the 
sessions. 
 – A campaign to improve 
material handling standards 
was also introduced in 2013. 
Although the number of 
incidents fell only slightly – 
from 32 to 31, the number of 
incidents which resulted in a 
lost time injury declined 75% 
indicating significant progress 
was achieved.
 – Engineering supervisor training 
focused specifically on their 
daily, weekly and monthly 
duties including legal 
compliance and accountability, 
conducting inspections and 
managing employees.
We also operate our own safety, 
health, environment, quality and 
training (‘SHEQT’) learning 
academy which is a Mines 
Qualifications Authority (South 
Africa specific) accredited 
training facility. On completion of 
training, our employees are 
Committed to acting responsibly 19

qualified to perform their specific 
duty not only for Shaft Sinkers, 
but in the South African mining 
industry at large.
For 2014, the benchmarks set for 
our safety performance remain 
unchanged. We are targeting 
LTIFR of 3.5.
Training and development
We believe that our employees 
are our most valuable asset. Their 
skills, commitment and 
capabilities are crucial to the 
success of our business, 
particularly given the specialist 
nature of the work we undertake. 
We have put in place a range of 
strategies and initiatives to assist 
us in recruiting and retaining 
experienced and competent staff 
across our operations. 
The Group undertakes training 
programmes for employees to 
develop both basic and specialist 
skills. 
Qualified and trained facilitators 
provide ABET (‘Adult Basic 
Education and Training’) training 
to internal staff in South Africa in 
order to equip them for higher 
level roles requiring a basic level 
of literacy. During 2013 164 
employees enrolled in ABET 
training. 
The Group also has an 
engineering learnership 
programme covering all the major 
trades (fitters, electricians, 
boilermakers and riggers) and 
participants complete an 
approved skills programme. 
Eleven engineering learners 
completed their training during 
2013. 
Environment
Respecting and preserving the 
environment directly relates to 
our success and that of our 
industry and we recognise the 
potential impacts of climate 
change on our business. The 
Group’s activities are subject to 
extensive laws and regulations 
governing environmental 
protection and we work to ensure 
that all projects are compliant 
with the regulations of the 
jurisdiction in which we are 
operating. 
The Group complies with ISO 
14001, a voluntary international 
environmental management 
standard. ISO audits were carried 
out across our operations during 
2013 and these audits confirmed 
our ISO accreditations.
Since all our projects are 
undertaken on a contract basis, 
initiatives to combat climate 
change and reduce GHG 
emissions remain the 
responsibility of our clients and 
we are committed to working 
with them wherever possible. Our 
ISO 14001 accreditation assists us 
in this regard.

Financial Review
Basis of preparation
The financial information 
presented has been prepared in 
terms of International Financial 
Reporting Standards and has been 
prepared on a basis consistent 
with that used in the preparation 
of the financial statements for the 
year-ended 31 December 2012.
On 1 January 2013 the Group 
changed its accounting policy 
governing the subsequent 
measurement of land and 
buildings from the revaluation 
model to the cost model. The 
Group believes that this approach 
provides more relevant and 
reliable information about the 
Group’s financial position. 
Apart from the above mentioned 
change in accounting policy there 
have been no other changes to the 
accounting policies or new 
standards that have been applied 
during the year that had an effect 
on the reported performance in 
comparison to the prior year.
Overview
2013 has been another challenging 
year for the Group. The financial 
results were yet again impacted 
by operating difficulties 
experienced at certain sites as well 
as by Section 54 safety stoppages 
imposed on various projects in 
South Africa during the year. 
Disappointing operational 
performance and work stoppages, 
coupled with the extensive legal 
fees incurred in defending the 
EuroChem arbitration matters 
have all been a drain on the 
Group’s cash resources. 
The Hindustan Zinc and Kibali 
Goldmine projects that were 
awarded during the latter part of 
the 2012 financial year saw a full 
year’s contribution towards the 
revenues of the Group, with the 
Kibali project performing well and 
supporting the continued 
profitability of the Group.
In the light of the pressures 
brought to bear on the Group’s 
financial resources, the Board 
does not recommend a final 
dividend for 2013. 
The arbitration claim filed by 
EuroChem in October 2012 against 
Shaft Sinkers (Proprietary) 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of the Group, and its immediate 
holding company, Rossal No. 126 
(Pty) Ltd, continues according to 
the agreed timetables. Based on 
advice from the Group’s legal 
counsel, we continue to believe 
that the principal claims have no 
foundation and the Group 
continues to contest the claim 
robustly and to pursue its counter-
claim in the order of around USD16 
million. The Board expects an 
outcome on the first of the 
arbitrations under the Building 
Construction Works contract, in 
early 2015. The second arbitration, 
under the Design Contract, should 
also be resolved in 2015.
Analysis of results
Income Statement
Profits before tax for the year of 
GBP2.9 million fell by 16.0% in 
GBP terms due to a poorer 
performance and higher legal fees 
incurred during the year. The 
weaker ZAR average exchange 
rate for the year at ZAR15.1 
against Pound Sterling compared 
to an average of ZAR12.99 in 2012 
has reduced profits by GBP0.2 
million. 
Revenue
Revenues decreased by 21.0% to 
GBP152.2 million (2012: GBP192.5 
million). The decrease in revenues 
was primarily as a result of 
unplanned stoppages and delays 
on the Impala 17 contract, the 
completion of the Impala 16 
contract, client decisions to halt 
expenditure at our Hernic and 
Moab projects, coupled with the 
weakening of the ZAR against 
Pound Sterling by 14.0% on 
average. 
The weaker ZAR reduced 
revenues by GBP20.8 million, 
accounting for approximately half 
of the 21.0% decrease in the 
Group’s revenues during the year. 
In South Africa, revenues 
decreased by 20.8% in ZAR 
terms. The decrease in revenue 
was partly offset by higher 
full-year revenues from the Kibali 
Goldmine and Hindustan Zinc 
projects, which contributed an 
additional GBP19.4 million to 
revenues in 2013. 
 
Gross profit
Gross profit decreased by 11.5% to 
GBP20.0 million (2012: GBP22.6 
million). The decrease in gross 
profit can be ascribed to the 
following factors:
 – Losses on Impala 16 prior to 
conversion to a labour rates 
contract; 21
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
www.shaftsinkersgroup.com
 – Work stoppages and losses 
incurred on the Impala 17 
contract;
 – Unrecovered costs incurred on 
the Moab contract following 
termination; and
 – The weakening of the ZAR by 
14.0%.
These factors were partially offset 
by:
 – Additional gross profit earned 
on the Hindustan Zinc project, 
albeit at poorer profit margins 
than expected; and
 – higher gross profits earned at 
the Kibali Goldmine project. 
During the year under review, 
given the reduction in contractual 
work in South Africa, we decided 
to reassess the allocation of our 
Engineering department operating 
costs to direct expenses to more 
accurately reflect the component 
of costs related to actual projects. 
This largely accounts for the 
improved gross profit margin 
which increased to 13.1% for the 
2013 financial year compared to 
11.7% in 2012 when most of the 
Engineering expenses were 
allocated to direct costs.
Operating income
Operating income increased by 
GBP0.2 million to GBP6.5 million 
due to gains made on the sale of 
property partially offset by lower 
reversals of provisions as 
compared to the previous year. 
Operating expense
Operating expenses decreased by 
17.0% (GBP3.8 million) to GBP18.7 
million, before taking higher legal 
fees into account (2012: GBP4.5 
million reduction). During 2013, as 
a result of our operational 
performance, efforts were made 
to reduce overhead levels in South 
Africa, leading to the 
retrenchment of staff and a 
trimming of overhead expenses. 
Those efforts were largely masked 
by the substantially higher legal 
fees of GBP3.9 million (2012: 
GBP1.1 million) incurred relating to 
the EuroChem arbitration matter.
The weaker ZAR reduced net 
operating expenses (operating 
income minus operating expenses) 
before taking account of legal fees, 
by GBP1.1 million, accounting for 
approximately a quarter of the 
decrease in net operating expenses 
before legal fees during the year. In 
South Africa, net operating 
expenses before legal fees 
decreased by 62.4% in ZAR terms. 
The decrease in net operating 
expenses before legal fees was due 
to the ongoing efforts at cost 
reduction while revenues declined.
Finance expense
During the 2013 financial year the 
Group repaid GBP6.9 million (2012: 
GBP3.9 million) of its interest 
bearing term borrowings from the 
Standard Bank of South Africa. 
This resulted in a decrease in 
interest of approximately GBP0.5 
million to GBP1.3 million while 
additional interest was incurred on 
overdraft borrowing facilities.
Taxation 
In 2013 the Group’s effective tax 
rate was 28.9% (2012: 30.0%). The 
reduction in the effective tax rate 
was largely due to lower taxes paid 
in South Africa with a capital gain 
on the sale of property and a 
recovery of an over-provision in the 
prior year. These were offset by a 
higher average tax rate in India. 
The South African standard 
corporate tax rate is 28% before 
withholding taxes. The comparable 
standard tax rates in India are 
approximately 42% before 
withholding taxes, while standard 
tax rates in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo are around 
40% before withholding taxes. The 
Group is resident in the Isle of Man 
where it is taxed at zero.
Effect of exchange difference on 
translation from functional to 
presentation currency
The Group reports in GBP while 
the functional currencies of the 
main operations of the Group are 
ZAR and USD. The average rate of 
exchange for 2013 was ZAR15.09 
to the GBP (2012: ZAR12.99) and 
USD1.56 to the GBP (2012: 
USD1.59). The spot rate at 31 
December 2013 saw the ZAR and 
the USD both weaken against the 
GBP to ZAR17.29 (2012: ZAR13.69) 
and USD1.65 (2012: USD1.62) 
respectively. The translation of 
income statement items at the 
average rate for the year, 
monetary items in the balance 
sheet at the closing spot rate and 
historical items at historical rates, 
gave rise to a loss of GBP7.5 million 
(2012: GBP3.0 million). Despite the 
reporting currency being GBP, the 
Group prefers to hold most of its 
surplus cash resources in the USD 
functional currency. STRATEGIC REPORT

Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Financial Review continued
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, tax and 
depreciation for the year were 
GBP8.5 million (2012: GBP10.9 
million), a decrease of 22.1%. This 
was due to a lower depreciation 
charge of GBP4.6 million (2012: 
GBP5.7 million) coupled with lower 
profits from operations at GBP3.9 
million (2012: GBP5.3 million). 
Earnings per share
Earnings per share was calculated 
on the 47.5 million shares in issue 
throughout the year. 
Earnings per share decreased to 
4.14 pence (2012: 4.92 pence 
restated), a decrease of 15.8%. The 
theoretical effect of awarding 
incentive shares to the executive 
directors of the Company was 
reflected in diluted earnings per 
share of 4.90 pence in 2012. The 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
took into account the share price at 
31 December 2010 and comparing 
it to the target growth in price of at 
least 13% per annum for LTIP 
shares to vest each year and a net 
profit target growth rate of 20% 
per annum. These targets have not 
been met to date and so it is 
considered that there will be no 
dilution to earnings per share. 
Dividend policy
The Group has adopted a 
progressive dividend policy with 
dividends moving broadly in line 
with earnings over time. Dividends 
are expected to be paid semi-
annually in respect of each year 
with an interim dividend for each 
year paid in September and a final 
dividend paid in June of the 
following year in each case subject 
to the satisfaction of the Solvency 
Test. 
Interim dividends are expected to 
represent around one third and 
final dividends around two thirds of 
the full year dividend for each year. 
Annual dividends per share are 
expected to be covered some 2.5 
– 3.0 times by earnings per share. 
In the light of the pressures 
brought to bear on the Group’s 
financial resources through poor 
operating results and increased 
legal fees, the Board does not 
recommend a final dividend for 
2013. 
Financial position
Total assets decreased to GBP101.2 
million (2012: GBP131.7 million) and 
net assets decreased to GBP36.8 
million (2012: GBP42.4 million).
Interest-bearing debt to equity has 
decreased to 7.9% (2012: 26.5%). 
The term borrowing facilities 
granted to the Group by Standard 
Bank of South Africa Limited have 
been reduced by GBP6.9 million 
during the year in accordance with 
the amortisation schedule of the 
facilities. There remains one final 
bullet payment under these 
facilities of GBP2.9 million (ZAR50 
million) payable at the end of 
December 2014.
The Group’s net debt (defined as 
interest bearing debt minus cash) 
has improved to GBP1.6 million 
(2012: net debt of GBP2.1 million). 
The Group managed to collect 
many outstanding variation orders 
and to reduce its debtors’ book 
outstanding, resulting in a small 
improvement in cash before the 
repayment of debt, despite the 
cash consumed in its operating 
activities. 
The Group’s net current assets 
decreased to net current liabilities 
of GBP4.6 million (2012: net current 
assets GBP16.2 million). Trade 
payables remain at almost the 
same level as trade receivables, 
indicating a tightening working 
capital position. Numerous 
initiatives are being implemented 
to ensure that sufficient cash is 
available to meet the Group’s 
payment obligations in the short 
term. This is being achieved partly 
through converting some of the 
Group’s surplus assets into cash.
PPE
New additions to property, plant 
and equipment amounted to 
GBP14.0 million (2012: GBP12.7 
million). The additions during the 
year comprised mainly the capital 
expenditure incurred in respect of 
the Hindustan Zinc and Kibali 
Goldmine projects as well as 
capital expenditure incurred in 
respect of the Styldrift, Leeuwkop 
and Karee 3 projects. 
Disposals of plant and equipment 
in 2013 were GBP2.4 million (2012: 
GBP1.6 million restated). The Group 
disposed of its offices in South 
Africa on a sale and leaseback 
basis, generating cash of GBP2.2 
million and recording a profit of 
GBP0.7 million.
Other intangibles
The Group has continued to invest 
in a 75% share of the development 
of technology for the automated 
inspection of mine shafts. To date 
the Group has invested GBP2.0 
million (2012: GBP1.7 million). The 
development is in the prototype 
phase and it is envisaged at this 
stage that the Group will not be 
required to invest any material 
amounts going forward. 
Inventories
Inventories decreased to GBP4.6 
million (2012: GBP4.9 million) in line 
with a reduction in contracts and 
revenues.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables 
decreased to GBP33.3 million 
(2012: GBP61.2 million). The 
decrease in trade and other 
receivables reflects the reduction 
in contracts in South Africa as well 
as the reduction in outstanding 
variation orders that had built up at 
the end of 2012. Furthermore, in 
2012 the counter- claim against 
EuroChem was reflected under 
current assets to a net value of 
GBP9.2 million. In 2013 this has 
been reclassified to non-current 
assets as the outcome of the 
arbitration is only expected in early 
2015.
Order book
The Group’s order book at financial 
reporting period end is calculated 
to represent the total value of 
estimated outstanding project 
revenues for contractually 
committed projects, excluding any 
escalation which is typically built 
into the contracts. The order book 
at 31 December 2013 amounted to 
GBP238.2 million (2012: GBP346.5 
million). The decrease is mainly due 
to the discontinuance of the Hernic, 
Moab and Impala 16 contracts and  Committed order book as of 31 December 2013

by revenue recognised during the 
year on continuing projects. Post 
year end we have announced the 
change to our Impala 17 contract 
which has the effect of reducing 
the current order book by GBP13.9 
million.
Cash
The Group ended the year with a 
positive cash balance of GBP4.2 
million (2012: GBP9.1 million) and 
an overdraft bank account of 
GBP2.9 million (2012: nil). GBP14.0 
million of cash was consumed in 
operating activities and legal fees 
(2012: GBP0.5 million) and a 
reduction in working capital in 2013 
of GBP15.9 million (2012: increase in 
working capital of GBP22.9 million). 
Further, expenditures on interest 
(net of interest received) and taxes 
of GBP2.0 million (2012: GBP0.7 
million) reduced cash on hand 
although no dividend was paid to 
Shaft Sinkers’ shareholders in the 
year (2012: GBP3.4 million), GBP6.9 
million of interest bearing debt was 
repaid during 2013 (2012: GBP3.9 
million). During the year under 
review the Group received advance 
revenues and interest free 
advances from clients that 
amounted to GBP12.3 million (2012: 
GBP30.7 million). Project related 
capital expenditure of GBP13.5 
million (2012:GBP12.1 million) was 
incurred during the year.
At 31 December 2013 the Group held its cash in the following currencies:
GBP equivalent
British Pounds GBP0.1 million
United States Dollars USD6.2 million* GBP3.9 million
Russian Roubles RUR0.1 million GBP0.0 million
Indian Rupees INR52.0 million GBP0.2 million
Euro EUR0.1 million GBP0.1 million
South African Rands (ZAR52.0 million) (GBP3.0 million)
* Includes USD3.0 million restricted cash
During 2012 the Group set aside 
USD3.0 million (included in the 
above cash figures) as security for 
the issuance of a performance 
bond in respect of the Kibali 
Goldmine project. These funds 
remain restricted and are not 
currently freely available for other 
use by the Group.
Impairment of assets
An impairment review was 
conducted on all the Group’s 
tangible and intangible assets and 
it was found no further 
impairment was required.
An impairment loss reversal of 
GBP0.1 million (2012: Impairment 
loss – GBP0.3 million) was 
recognised during the year on the 
Group’s plant and equipment. The 
impairment reversals were 
identified following a detailed 
review of the fixed asset register 
and were identified on a line by 
line basis where impairments had 
previously been recognised for 
which the circumstances no 
longer existed at year-end.
Deferred revenue
Deferred revenue represents 
revenues received in advance 
from clients in line with the 
Group’s contracting model. 
Clients are generally required to 
fund the procurement of capital 
expenditures necessary for a 
project in advance of the Group 
procuring those assets. These 
revenues received in advance are 
deferred for recognition as and 
when the plant and equipment is 
brought into use on the project 
and amortised to revenue over 
the remaining life of the project.
The other expenditures on 
projects such as labour and 
consumable materials are billed to 
clients monthly and are generally 
paid within 30 days of billing.
Deferred revenues in the 
statement of financial position 
decreased to GBP8.0 million (2012: 
GBP15.7 million), primarily as a 
result of the amortisation to profit 
of revenues previously received on 
both the Hindustan Zinc and Kibali 
Goldmine projects offset by 
increases in deferred revenues on 
the Styldrift project. 
Deferred revenues released to 
profits during the year amounted 
to GBP20.0 million (2012: GBP11.5 
million) against cash received from 
clients for advance revenue of 
GBP12.3 million (20112: GBP30.7 
million).
Interest-free advances from 
clients
The interest free advances relate 
to advances received from new 
contract awards during the 2012 
financial year. These advances are 
repayable over the remaining 
contract period with the Group’s 
billing to the relevant client having 
reached 10% of the total contract 
value.
At 31 December 2013, total interest 
free advances outstanding 
amounted to GBP12.4 million 
(2012: GBP15.5 million). GOVERNANCE

THE ‘GROUP’) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 
31 DECEMBER 2013.
Review of the business
The Strategic Report has been prepared to provide 
the Company’s stakeholders with a fair review of the 
business of the Group and a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing it. The 
Strategic Report incorporates by reference into this 
report the following which collectively contain a 
discussion of the main trends and factors likely to 
affect the future development, performance and 
position of the Company’s business and the strategy 
for preserving value and for delivering objectives:
Strategic Report on pages 2 to 23 
Financial Review on pages 20 to 23
Internal Controls and Risk Management on page 36
2013 Key Performance Indicators on page 15
Sustainability Review and Corporate Social 
Investment on pages 18 to 19
The Strategic Report may not be relied upon by 
anyone, including the Company’s shareholders, for 
any other purpose. The Strategic Report is designed 
to provide shareholders with an understanding of 
the Company’s business and the environment in 
which it operates, and of necessity only focuses on 
material issues and facts. The omission of reporting 
on any specific topic should not be taken as 
implying that it is not being addressed. 
This report contains forward-looking statements. By 
their nature, forward-looking statements involve a 
number of risks, uncertainties and future assumptions 
because they relate to events and/or depend on 
circumstances that may or may not occur in the 
future and could cause actual results and outcomes 
to differ materially from those expressed in or implied 
by the forward-looking statements. No assurance can 
be given that the forward-looking statements 
contained in this report will be realised. Statements 
about the Director’s expectations, beliefs, hopes, 
plans, intentions and strategies are inherently subject 
to change and they are based on expectations and 
assumptions as to future events, circumstances and 
other factors which are in some cases outside the 
Company’s control. The information contained in this 
report has been prepared on the basis of knowledge 
and information available to Directors at the date of 
its preparation. It is believed that the expectations set 
out in these forward-looking statements are 
reasonable, but they may be affected by a wide range 
of variables which could cause actual results or 
trends to differ materially. The forward-looking 
statements should be read in particular in the context 
of the specific risk factors for the Company identified 
in this report. The Company’s shareholders are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on the 
forward-looking statements.   
The principal events of the year are covered in the 
Strategic Report. 
Dividends
During the 2013 financial year no dividends were 
paid to shareholders of the Company. In the light of 
the pressures brought to bear on the Group’s 
financial resources through poor operating results 
and increased legal fees, the Board does not 
recommend a final dividend for 2013
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) will be held on 
11 June 2014 at The Forum, 17-18 Mount Havelock,

meeting of the shareholders.
The Board is proposing to amend the third sentence 
of Article 117 of the Company’s Articles of Association

Relationship agreements
International Mineral Resources BV (‘IMR’) and the 
Company entered into a relationship agreement on 
20 December 2010 (the ‘’Relationship Agreement’’) 
which regulates the ongoing relationship between 
IMR and the Group with a view to ensuring that the 
Group is capable of carrying on its business 
independently of IMR, and that transactions and 
relationships between the Group and IMR are at 
arm’s length and on a normal commercial basis.
IMR, its direct and indirect beneficial owners and any 
subsidiary (not including the Company) are referred 
to in this paragraph as its ‘’Shareholder Group’’. For 
the purposes of the Relationship Agreement, an 
‘Independent Director’ broadly means a Director of 
the Company who is not a current or recent director, 
officer, employee or shareholder of, or consultant to, 
or a person having a relationship, association or 
interest which is material to him with or in, or who 
has been nominated by IMR or any associate (as 
defined in the Relationship Agreement) of IMR or 
with or in any person having a relationship which is 
material to it or him with IMR or any associate of IMR.
Under the Relationship Agreement, IMR and the 
Company agree, inter alia, that:
(a) IMR shall not vote on any shareholder resolution 
that is required pursuant to applicable law or 
regulation to alter the Company’s Articles or 
Memorandum of Association which would be 
contrary to the maintenance of the Company’s 
ability to manage and run its business independently 
of IMR and the Shareholder Group, unless such 
resolution is supported by the votes of the majority 
of Independent Directors;
(b) there shall at all times be a majority of 
Independent Directors on the Board, whose number 
shall not be less than the number of Directors 
nominated by IMR. In addition, the number of 
Non-executive independent directors shall not be 
less than the number of non-Independent Directors. 
IMR shall exercise the voting rights attaching to the 
ordinary shares held from time to time, directly or 
indirectly by it and/or by any of its Shareholder 
Group (and shall use reasonable efforts to procure, 
so far as it is able, that the non-Independent 
Directors shall exercise their voting rights on the 
Board) so that if it becomes aware that an 
Independent Director ceases to be an Independent 
Director of the Company for any reason, that 
Independent Director will (insofar as may be 
necessary to ensure that there continues to be a 
majority of Independent Directors on the Board and 
that the number of Non-executive Independent 
Directors shall not be less than the number of 
non-Independent Directors) be replaced or 
supplemented as the case may be by a new 
Executive or Non-executive Director, as the case 
may be, who is also an Independent Director;
(c) save to the extent required by law or as 
otherwise contemplated in the Relationship 
Agreement, they shall exercise their powers in a 
manner which shall not prevent the Company from 
being managed in accordance with the principles 
and provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code;
(d) they shall, and shall respectively use reasonable 
efforts to procure that all subsidiaries of IMR and the 
Company respectively shall, conduct all transactions 
and relationships with IMR and all subsidiaries of IMR 
(as the case may be) on arms’ length terms;
(e) no material agreement, arrangement or 
transaction between the Group and any associate of 
the Controlling Shareholder shall be entered into, 
novated, varied, abrogated nor shall any agreement 
be materially amended unless approved by a 
resolution of the Board which has been voted for by 
a majority of the Independent Directors. The Group 
must enforce the terms of agreements with IMR and 
associates of IMR unless there is a bona fide 
commercial reason not to do so and such action has 
been approved by resolution of the Board which has 
been voted for by a majority of the Independent 
Directors;
(f) if, within five years of the date on which the 
Relationship Agreement is executed, IMR is 
presented with an opportunity to develop or acquire 
a business principally concerned with shaft sinking, 
it will first offer to the Company the chance to take 
up such opportunity (and if the Company does not 
confirm in writing within 14 days of being so 
informed that it wishes to pursue the opportunity 
then it shall be deemed to have declined it); and
(g) save where the approval of the Board has been 
given, IMR shall not, and shall procure that no other 
member of its Shareholder Group shall recruit, solicit 
or entice any senior employee (of the Company or 
any member of its Group) with a salary in excess of 
GBP100,000. This prohibition shall not apply where 
such senior employee independently approaches 
IMR. IMR shall have the right to appoint two 
Directors to the Board so long as it, its Group or its 
Shareholder Group controls 25% or more of the 
voting rights at general meetings of the Company. 
Where such percentage control is 15 percent or  GOVERNANCE
28
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Directors’ Report continued
more (but less than 25%), the right is to appoint one 
Director.
At the date of this report IMR has no appointed 
Director on the Board.
Relations with shareholders
The Group aims to provide a high level of 
transparency and communication to investors and 
analysts on a regular and timely basis, through 
announcements, meetings and seminars. The Group 
seeks to develop a regular dialogue with investors 
and analysts and to respond to their challenges and 
to understand their sentiments and concerns. 
All shareholders have the opportunity to attend and 
raise questions at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting. The Group aspires to have an investor 
relations programme that meets the aspirations of 
all of its current and potential shareholders and that 
lends itself to the growth of the Group’s business 
and future sustainability.
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer aim to meet all major shareholders at least 
twice a year and to meet with a wide range of 
shareholders and prospective investors in the United 
Kingdom. These discussions will focus on the results 
and businesses of the Group but will also seek to 
learn of any concerns amongst investors and to gain 
a deeper understanding of their strategic objectives. 
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are 
available, on request, to attend investor relations 
meetings or to meet with investors or analysts 
independent of the Group’s management. The 
Chairman, Stephen Oke, remains available to 
shareholders and encourages a dialogue between 
shareholders and the Company.
Transactions with Related Parties
Loans to and from related parties are disclosed in 
note 21 to the annual financial statements.
Employees
The Group employed approximately 4,674 people as 
at the end of the 2013 financial year. Further 
information about employees is disclosed in the 
Sustainability Review on pages 18 to 19.
Post balance sheet events
The Directors are not aware of any other matter or 
circumstance not disclosed in this report and arising 
since the end of the financial year, not otherwise 
dealt with in the annual financial statements, which 
significantly affects the financial position at 31 
December 2013 or the results of the Group’s 
operations or cash flows for the year then ended.
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s financial risk management, 
objectives and policies, are described in the Internal 
Controls and Risk Management on page 36 and in 
note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on 
pages 79 to 85.
Political donations
No political donations were made during the year 
and no donations were made to any political party, 
representative or candidate in any part of the world.
Significant agreements and other potential legal 
impediments
The following represent significant agreements and 
other potential legal impediments which may entitle 
the counterparties to exercise termination or other 
rights in the event of a change of control of the 
Company. The remaining essential contractual 
arrangements can be summarised as follows:
 – Contracts for the purchase of inputs – the supplies 
needed to operate the Group’s projects are 
secured through competitive tendering in the 
open market and can be obtained from a variety 
of sources.
 – Financing arrangements – the Company and 
Group have bank facilities in place.
 – Contracts relating to labour and services – the 
principal arrangements essential to the Group’s 
business in South Africa are collective agreements 
with trade unions representing the majority of the 
Group’s employees.
Significant Agreements – change of control
A number of agreements take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid, such as borrowing facilities 
and contracts with clients. These are deemed to be 
significant to the Group’s business. The Group’s 
banking facilities (long term and on demand) with 
Standard Bank of South Africa Limited amounting to 
ZAR168 million (GBP9.7 million) require the approval 
of Standard Bank in the event of a change of 
ultimate control of its subsidiaries, Shaft Sinkers 
(Pty) Limited or Capstone 615 (Pty) Limited.
The Group does not have agreements with any 
Director or employee that would provide 
compensation for loss of office or employment 
resulting from a takeover.
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
The Group’s external auditors, KPMG Audit LLC, 
have indicated their willingness to continue in office 
and a resolution seeking to reappoint them will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM. Each of the 
Directors at the date of approval of this report 
confirms that:
1) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Group’s auditors are 
unaware; and
2) the Director has taken all the steps that he ought 
to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Group’s auditors are aware of the information. 29
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Going concern
The Group’s business activities and operational 
performance are detailed in the Strategic report 
– refer to pages 2 to 23. The financial performance 
and liquidity of the Group is described in the Chief 
Financial Officer’s report – refer to pages 20 to 23.
As described in note 1.2.3 to the consolidated annual 
financial statements, the Group has borrowings and 
facilities, which, together with receipts from clients 
fund the daily working capital requirements of the 
Group.
Volatile economic conditions may occasionally 
create uncertainty in respect of:
 – Demand for the Group’s services as a 
consequence of reduced capital expenditure 
within the mining and related industries; and
 – The availability of bank financing in the 
foreseeable future.
In assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern the Board has reviewed the following:
 – Group forecasts and projections for at least an 18 
month forward-looking period and up to 
December 2015 taking into account potential 
changes in Group performance. The forecasts and 
projections focus on both the financial 
performance as well as the liquidity of the Group;
 – The aforementioned forecasts and projections 
were further subjected to a stress test by applying 
a conservatism factor in order to ascertain 
whether the Group will be able to operate in 
periods of duress.
The Group forecasts and projections indicate the 
Group should be able to operate within the level of 
its capital structure. The Board has factored into its 
liquidity forecasts and considered the impact of 
GBP1.9m (USD3m) of cash being restricted as a 
result of the security provided to the Group’s 
bankers for the performance guarantee issued in 
respect of a project.
The following main assumptions have been used in 
making this assessment:
 – The current overdraft facilities of the Group will 
remain in place for at least the next 18 months;
 – The strike action currently being experienced in 
the mining industry in South Africa will cease and 
operations will return to normality by June;
 – The current normal operational performance 
assumptions will be met;
 – New projects have been included where formal 
tenders have been submitted and management 
have assessed the likelihood of success as strong;
 – A program of surplus asset realisations will result 
in additional cash inflows;
 – Restricted cash will remain restricted throughout 
the period of assessment.
 – In the stress test, unsecured revenues which do 
not form part of the current order book are 
removed.
The Board has also considered the claim received 
from EuroChem of an amount of approximately 
USD917 million  (GBP550 million), in determining its 
ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the 
review of the arbitration claim in consultation with 
external legal counsel the Board continues to be of 
the view that the principal claims are without merit 
and the subsidiaries concerned are contesting the 
claims robustly, as such the Board has not forecast 
any requirement to settle amounts arising from 
these claims. However, given the ongoing arbitration 
processes management forecasts include best 
estimates of expenses likely to be incurred in 
defending the Group’s position.
The amount the Group submitted as a counter-claim 
against EuroChem to the net value of USD16 million 
(GBP9.3 million) for outstanding amounts payable 
under the contract, as a result of the uncertainty 
regarding the timing of any receipts awarded from 
the arbitration processes, has not been forecast as 
received during the future period reviewed and as 
such does not have any impact on available liquidity.
Various initiatives are underway to convert some of 
the available longer-term assets of the Group into 
near-term cash. Management is optimistic that these 
initiatives will generate additional funds that should 
assist the Group to continue to support the high 
level of legal expenses related to the arbitration 
matter and enable the Group to continue as a going 
concern.
Based on the forecasts prepared the Board 
considers that the Group has sufficient ability to 
meet its scheduled debt repayments during the 
forecast period from the facilities and cash flows 
available to it. The current term facilities expire in 
December 2014 with a final repayment of R50 
million (GBP2.9 million). The Group is in discussion 
with its bankers regarding the possible extension of 
these facilities.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources in place to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The consolidated annual financial statements 
therefore continue to be prepared on a going 
concern basis.

Directors
Details of the current Directors of the Company and 
their biographies are set out on pages 24 to 25.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, 
Directors retire by rotation and all Directors are 
subject to election at the first Annual General 
Meeting after their appointment and to re-election 
at intervals of no more than three years. In 
accordance with the recommendations and 
requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
of September 2012  published by the Financial 
Reporting Council (the ‘Code’), all Directors should 
be subject to annual election by the shareholders, 
unless the Company is a smaller company below the 
FTSE 350. The Chairman confirms that each of the 
current Directors’ individual performance continues 
to be effective and demonstrates commitment to 
the role.
Directors are appointed and may be removed in 
accordance with the Articles of Association of the 
Company and the provisions of the Isle of Man 
Companies Act 2006.
The Board considers that Stephen Oke, Roger 
Williams and Ian Watson are independent Directors 
in accordance with the requirements of the Code. 
The terms and conditions of their appointment are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
address.

Board responsibility and accountability
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board and sets the agenda for all Board meetings. The 
Chairman also ensures the effectiveness of the Board on all aspects of its role.
The Board believes it has the appropriate balance of experience, skills and knowledge of the Group and 
sector to enable it and its Committees to carry out their activities and responsibilities effectively, as required 
by the Code.
The Board strives to have a majority of independent Directors and supports the principle of diversity 
amongst its members and in the Company as a whole. The Board remains open to increasing levels of 
diversity whilst ensuring that it is able to draw upon the necessary skills and experience. As the Company is 
at the date of this report small in nature, the opportunity to appoint additional female directors has not yet 
arisen.
The Non-executive Directors assist in setting the overall strategy of the Group and maintaining a sound risk 
management and internal control systems. The Board is provided with regular, timely and relevant 
information in a form that enables it to discharge its duties. The Board meets at least twice a year and strives 
to meet quarterly to assess the performance of the Group. All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary, whose terms of reference include advising the Board on corporate 
governance matters. The Group’s General Council ensures that applicable laws and regulations are followed. 
The Group’s General Council provides regular updates to the Board on the legal and regulatory environment 
and assists in providing any training needs of the Board. The Company ensures that related party 
transactions are identified disclosed and a regular report is presented to the Board for approval when 
applicable. All Directors declare their interests in other businesses on appointment to the Board and a 
review of any conflicts of interest is carried out at each Board meeting. On appointment, Directors are 
provided with adequate information to ensure that they fully understand the business of the Group and their 
legal and regulatory responsibilities as a Director of the Company. The Board undertakes an annual review of 
its own performance.
The Board has put in place a procedure whereby all Directors have access to independent professional 
advice at the expense of the Company. The Company also maintains an appropriate level of Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance. GOVERNANCE

Corporate Governance continued
Board evaluation
The Chairman carries out a formal evaluation of the Board’s performance each year in line with best practice 
standards of corporate governance. In 2014 the evaluation process was managed by Prism Cosec Limited and 
was undertaken via a series of questionnaires covering issues relating to the functioning and business of the 
Board during the year. The review remains ongoing, however a number of preliminary conclusions have been 
identified: 
 – The Board has an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Company 
and the industry in which it operates.  
 – The performance of the Chairman was assessed as being effective in managing Board processes and in 
chairing meetings in a way that allowed full and open debate.
 – The Non-Executive Directors contribute effectively and constructively to Board debate, are committed to 
their roles and challenge and robustly question management.
 – Communication with internal and external audiences is not always sufficient and could be improved. 
Improving the communication of the Company’s strategy, aims and performance will be a key focus 
during 2014.
 – There is a requirement to develop a comprehensive succession plan covering the Board and senior 
management positions across the Group. A key task of the Nominations Committee going forward will be 
the development of such a succession plan.
Once the review is complete, the Board intends to undertake a further Board evaluation process utilising 
external advisors within the next 12 months.
Board Committees
The Board has established four principal committees as follows:

Audit Committee
Each member of the Audit Committee is considered to have extensive commercial and business leadership 
experience. In particular, Roger Williams and Stephen Oke have relevant and recent financial skills and 
experience.
Under its terms of reference which are available from the Company Secretary, the Audit Committee shall 
consist of at least three members all of whom shall be independent Non-executive Directors. Only members 
of the Audit Committee have the right to attend and vote at Committee meetings. However, other 
individuals such as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, other Directors, the head of internal 
audit and representatives from the finance function may be invited to attend all or part of any meeting as 
and when appropriate. The external auditors will be invited to attend meetings of the Committee on a 
regular basis.
Appointments to the Committee shall be for a period of up to three years, which may be extended for 
further three year periods, provided the Director remains independent.
The Company Secretary or their nominee shall act as the secretary of the committee. The Secretary shall 
also act as a co-ordinating intermediary between the Board and the committee.
Membership of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three independent, Non-executive Directors: Roger Williams, as Chairman, 
Stephen Oke and Ian Watson. Stephen and Roger have recent and relevant financial skills and experience 
and all of committee members have many years of experience in business and in the mining sector in

Audit Committee Report
As Chairman of the Audit Committee, I am pleased 
to present the report of the Audit Committee for the 
financial year ending 31 December 2013.
Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling 
its oversight function by:
 – Monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
statements and reporting; 
 – Reviewing the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems;
 – Reviewing the Group’s whistleblowing procedures;
 – Reviewing the Group’s systems and controls for 
the prevention of
 – fraud and bribery;
 – Monitoring the effectiveness and independence of 
the Group’s external auditors and;
 – Overseeing the Group’s internal audit function.
The committee, ensures it has a thorough 
understanding of the business and its risks by regular 
communication, not just with the Senior Executives, 
but with other levels of management. During the year, 
in addition to formal Audit Committee meetings, we 
discussed issues informally with management on a 
regular basis, we reviewed and debated monthly 
management reports and interrogated forecasts and 
challenged the assumptions in those forecasts. 
All shareholder announcements and trading updates 
are signed off not by the Audit Committee but by 
the entire Board. 
Summary of items discussed at Audit Committee 
meetings during 2013
The Audit Committee met twice during the year in 
April and August.
At the April 2013 meeting, the following issues were 
discussed:
 – Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 
31 December 2012
 – EuroChem arbitration 
 – Collection of variation orders
 – Cashflow forecast
 – Consideration of the going concern assumption
 – Loan covenants
 – Consideration of a dividend
 – External audit report
 – Transfer pricing
 – Fraud and bribery
At the August 2013 meeting, the following items 
were discussed:
 – Working capital requirement/cash forecast
 – Banking covenants
 – Impairment
 – Whistleblowing
 – Internal audit plan
 – External audit report on reviewed interim financial 
statements
 – Review of Interim Report
 – EuroChem arbitration 
 – Principal risks and uncertainties, insurance
 – Consideration of a dividend
Significant issues in relation to the financial 
statements
EuroChem arbitration
The arbitration processes relating to the EuroChem 
claim against subsidiary companies of the Group of 
USD917 million (previously for USD1.06 billion) 
continued through the financial year. The Audit 
Committee had to consider the impact the claim may 
have on the financial statements both on the carrying 
value of the $16m net receivable for Shaft Sinkers 
claim against EuroChem and the need for any 
provisions or notes for contingent liabilities as a result 
of the claim against companies in our Group. In order 
to reach an opinion on this, we examined all the 
relevant contracts and the various submissions to the 
arbitrators and took advice from internal and external 
legal counsel. We debated the issue at length with our 
auditors and with management. We concluded that 
no adjustments were necessary to the financial 
statements. This view is shared by the external 
auditors and management.
Going-concern 
The trading environment in South Africa, a key 
component of the Group, continues to be 
challenging. Anticipated projects have been 
cancelled, some projects have ended in the period 
and new work has comprised extensions to existing 
contracts rather than new contracts.  The mining 
sector in general has been disrupted by labour 
disputes and repeated safety stoppages. In addition 
the collection of receivables relating to variation 
orders was slow in the first half of the year. All this 
put pressure on the cashflow of the South African 
operations. 
Roger Williams
Independent Non-executive Director GOVERNANCE
36
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Audit Committee has therefore given considerable 
attention to reviewing cashflow forecasts at least every 
quarter. In the latter part of the year, we have done this 
more regularly and have assessed the cashflows of the 
Group as a whole, not just South Africa. We have 
challenged assumptions on new work, variations and 
receivables as well as the operating assumptions 
where performance has been below target. Downside 
scenarios are examined. The Audit Committee agreed 
that the projected future cashflows support the 
going-concern assumption in the financial statements.
Impairment 
The Audit Committee reviewed and tested the 
carrying value of fixed assets and goodwill, as a 
committee, as part of the year end accounts approval 
process. The key areas we looked at were the 
assumptions underlying the cashflow projections and 
the discount rate used. We challenged the projected 
operational performance, asset sales and new 
business assumptions and looked at down-side 
scenarios. We concluded that the discount rate 
(Weighted Average Cost of Capital) at 24% is high 
and therefore conservative. We agreed with 
management and the external auditors that no 
impairment was necessary. Impairment tests will be 
carried out at each reporting date.
Revenue recognition
Shaft Sinkers business consists of long-term 
construction contracts. At what point and how much 
revenue can be recognised varies depending on the 
nature and terms of the contract. It is always therefore 
an area of focus for the auditors and the Audit 
Committee. 
We ensured revenue recognition was a key focus 
area for the external audit when we reviewed and 
debated the audit plan with the external auditors. 
Where new projects were undertaken involving 
upfront payments, and for variation orders, we 
obtained from management, figures for any revenue 
recognition and the reasons for doing so. We 
ascertained the status of variation order negotiations 
from management in assessing whether it was 
appropriate to recognise revenue.
Based on the above the Audit Committee concluded 
that revenue recognition is appropriate in the financial 
statements. 
Effectiveness of the external audit process
During 2013, KPMG Audit LLC was subject to external 
review by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 
England and Wales (ICAEW). The Shaft Sinkers 2012 
audit file was included in this review. No matters were 
identified with respect to the audit approach, the 
performance or the conclusions.
KPMG Audit LLC was also subject to KPMG’s own 
internal quality review in the year. The office received 
the highest possible rating.
To further assess the effectiveness of the external 
audit process, we carried out a number of activities in 
the year. We reviewed the audit plan to ensure it 
focused on the appropriate risk areas; we assessed the 
auditors’ knowledge of the business and competence 
of their personnel. We obtained the views of 
management as to the efficiency and effectiveness of 
the audit team and we took assurance from the audit 
quality reviews done by KPMG and by the ICAEW. 
We therefore recommended the re-appointment of 
KPMG. 
Auditor appointment and independence
KPMG have been the Group’s auditors since 2007. The 
Group underwent a formal tendering process in 2008 
and KPMG was chosen as the Group’s worldwide 
auditors. The Audit Committee is satisfied with KPMG’s 
effectiveness and independence and therefore we 
have not considered it necessary to retender the audit. 
One of the new provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code is that FTSE 350 companies should 
put the external audit contract out to tender at least 
every ten years. We intend following this guidance and 
at present, we envisage tendering the audit in 2017.
The external auditors are required to rotate the audit 
partner responsible for the Group every five years and 
the current engagement partner has been in place 
from the 2010 financial year. He will therefore rotate 
after the 2014 financial year end.
One of the ways we monitor the independence of the 
external auditors is through a policy we implemented 
regarding non-audit services, which have been minimal 
as indicated in the table below. The Audit Committee 
agrees the audit fee.
GBP 2013 2012
Audit services 547,256 200,531
Non-audit services 36,299 5,071
Internal controls and risk management
The Group carries out a formal risk assessment each 
year, in addition to the ongoing risk reviews at a 
project level. Based on those risks identified, an 
internal audit plan is put together. The internal audit 
function is outsourced to Deloitte and the Audit 
Committee works closely with them to agree and 
implement a rolling three year plan.
During the year Internal Audit reviewed Financial 
Reporting Procedures; Revenue Management with a 
particular focus on contract variations and how they 
are recorded and dealt with; and Treasury 
Management.  
Anti-corruption and business integrity

forms throughout its business. Employees are

either the Chairman of the Board or an independent 
Non-executive Director who shall be appointed by 
the Board. The Chairman of the Board shall not chair 
the Committee when it is dealing with the matter of 
succession to the chairmanship. Appointments to the 
Committee shall be for a period of up to three years, 
which may be extended for a further three year 
periods, provided the majority of the committee 
remains independent.
Only members of the Committee shall have the right to 
attend and vote at Committee meetings. However, 
other individuals such as the Chief Executive Officer of 
the Company, the Company’s head of human 
resources and external advisers of the Company may 
be invited to attend for all or part of any meeting as 
and when appropriate. The Committee will endeavour 
to meet at least twice a year and at such other times as 
the Chairman of the Committee shall require.
The main duties of the Nominations Committee 
include:
 – to regularly review the structure, size, diversity and 
composition of the Board and make 
recommendations to the Board with regard to any 
changes;
 – to give full consideration to succession planning for 
Directors and other senior executives;
 – to identify and nominate for the approval of the 
Board, candidates to fill Board vacancies as and 
when they arise;
 – to evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge, 
independence and experience on the Board and use 
open advertising or the services of external advisers 
to facilitate the search for new candidates when 
required;
 – for the appointment of a Chairman, to prepare a job 
specification, including the time commitment 
expected;
 – to review the results of the Board performance 
evaluation process that relates to the composition of 
the Board, and;
 – generally to provide recommendations to the Board 
on matters regarding the appointments to the 
various committees.
The committee met informally to discuss relevant 
issues during 2013 and held formal Committee 
meetings on 7 February 2014 and 2 April 2014. At  the 
latter meeting the Committee evaluated the Directors’ 
performance in light of the resolutions to re-elect all 
the Directors at the forthcoming AGM on 11 June 2014. 
The Nominations Committee concluded that the 
directors’ performance continued to be effective and 
that they demonstrated commitment to their roles. 
The committee is also satisfied that the backgrounds, 
skills, experience and knowledge of the directors 
collectively enables the board and its committees to 
discharge their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively. The committee is therefore recommending 
the re-election of all Directors.
conditions of employment. Contractors and 
suppliers also sign the policy. 
As in previous years, the Group continued with its 
whistleblowing programme at all its operations and 
sites. This programme allows all staff and contractors 
to raise any concerns about the Group’s business 
practices confidentially. The Group’s General Counsel’s 
contact details and those of the whistleblowing hotline 
are widely distributed among its operations and sites, 
and highlighted periodically to staff and contractors, to 
allow any person who has information regarding 
unethical practice within the Group to contact the 
Group’s General Counsel or hotline.
All reports received by the General Counsel are treated 
in confidence and are either investigated by the 
General Counsel or referred to an appropriate line 
manager or the Internal Audit function for investigation 
and resolution, depending on the seriousness of the 
information received by the General Counsel. Over the 
course of the year, no fraudulent incidences were 
identified under this programme.

Remuneration Report
Introduction
The Directors have pleasure in presenting their 
report on Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 
31 December 2013.
Role of the Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is a formal committee 
of the Board. Its remit is set out in terms of reference 
formally adopted by the Board in December 2010. 
The terms of reference are designed to enable the 
Committee to comply with the requirements relating 
to remuneration policy set out in the Code. A copy 
of the terms of reference can be obtained from the 
Company Secretary.
The principal responsibilities of the Remuneration 
Committee are:
 – to determine and agree with the Board the 
framework or broad policy for the remuneration 
of the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, 
the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary 
and such other members of the executive 
management as it is designated to consider;
 – to review the ongoing appropriateness and 
relevance of the remuneration policy;
 – to approve the design of, and determine targets 
and upper limits for, any performance related pay 
schemes operated by the Group and approve the 
total annual payments made under such schemes, 
and;
 – to review the design of all share incentive plans for 
approval by the Board and shareholders. For any 
such plans, determine each year whether awards 
will be made, and if so, the overall amount of such 
awards, the individual awards to Executive 
Directors and other senior executives and the 
performance targets to be used.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee, all of whom are 
independent Non-executive Directors and were 
appointed on 19 November 2010, are as follows:
 – Ian Watson (Chairman of the Committee)
 – Stephen Oke
 – Roger Williams
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee. The Chief Executive Officer and the 
head of human resources and external advisers also 
attend Committee meetings by invitation, but none 
is present when the Committee discusses issues 
relating to their own remuneration.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee used no external 
advisors during 2013. 
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is focused upon 
providing a level of remuneration which attracts, 
retains and motivates Directors and senior executives 
of sufficient calibre to achieve the Group’s strategic 
goals and enhance shareholder value, whilst ensuring 
that remuneration is consistent with best practice and 
provides an appropriate alignment with personal and 
business performance. The Committee recognises 
that there is a competitive market for successful 
executives with experience in the mining industry and 
that the provision of appropriate rewards for superior 
performance is important for the continued growth 
of the business. The Committee’s aim in formulating 
remuneration policy is to assess relevant benchmark 
data from sources such as other companies listed on 
the London Stock Exchange of a similar size and 
complexity, international mining companies and the 
market generally. In setting remuneration within this 
framework, the Committee aims to give senior 
executives every encouragement to enhance the 
Group’s performance whilst ensuring that they are 
fairly, but responsibly, rewarded for their personal 
contributions.
The Committee believes that it is important to 
periodically benchmark the remuneration packages 
of senior executives.
Components of Executive Directors’ remuneration
Remuneration packages are structured to provide 
an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
elements. The main components of the two 
Executive Directors’ remuneration and the 
percentage of each element as part of the total 
package are detailed below.
Salaries
Salaries are reviewed annually by the committee and 
take account of the relevant benchmark data, pay 
quantum and structure. 
Bonuses
For the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012, the 
performance measures for the annual bonus were 
based on a Group financial performance target and 
on personal performance. The bonus arising from the 
performance target is up to 75% of annual salary for 
the Chief Executive Officer and 50% of annual salary 
for the Chief Financial Officer with a potential to earn 
an additional 15% if targets are exceeded by 10%. If 
performance is 10% below target, no target 
performance bonus is paid. The Group failed to 
achieve the financial targets in 2013 and no target 
performance bonus is therefore payable. The bonus 
arising from personal performance is up to 15% of 
annual salary for the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chief Financial Officer. Specific financial targets have 
not been disclosed as they are considered to be 
commercially confidential but they are deemed to be 
appropriately challenging. The personal performance 
bonus is normally paid in December of the same year 
of measurement, while the financial performance 
target bonus is deferred for one year and paid in 
December of the year following measurement. GOVERNANCE

Expatriation structure
It is typical that where skilled staff are expatriated to 
work in a foreign country on a temporary basis, the 
Company provides temporary accommodation for 
its employees at no cost to the employee. This is not 
considered a permanent benefit forming part of the 
remuneration of the employee but is considered a 
cost of either the project in question or a cost of 
temporary location of the employee on a limited 
duration mission. Employees who are relocated on a 
permanent basis are granted an allowance to 
compensate for the cost to the employee of 
relocation.
Provident fund
One of the Group’s subsidiaries, Shaft Sinkers (Pty) 
Limited, contributes towards a Provident Fund. The 
Fund is a defined contribution fund. The Group 
contributes 15% of a base salary for each eligible 
member.
Long-term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP allows the committee to make awards 
which are a conditional right to receive shares in the 
Company for nil consideration. An award will 
normally vest (i.e. become exercisable) over a three 
year period from the date of its grant with a third 
being eligible for vesting each year to the extent 
that the applicable performance conditions have 
been satisfied. Benefits in the LTIP are not 
pensionable.
The initial awards of these unissued performance 
ordinary shares in the Company were made as to 
750,000 to Alon Davidov, 750,000 to Robert 
Schroder (a former director)  and 750,000 to 
Christopher Hall. The LTIP consists of a total of 
2,500,000 Ordinary Shares, although 750,000 were 
cancelled following the resignation of Robert 
Schroder in 2011. The Remuneration Committee can 
determine the allocation and offer of awards over 
the balance of 250,000 Ordinary Shares.
The total number of ordinary shares issued under 
the LTIP on any date of issue, when aggregated with 
the number of Ordinary Shares issued or issuable 
under any other share scheme for senior employees 
of the Group in any rolling ten year period, may not 
exceed five per cent of the Company’s issued 
ordinary shares.
If an award is forfeited or becomes incapable of 
vesting, the ordinary shares subject to that award 
may not be reallocated for future awards.
The performance conditions applicable to these 
initial awards are measured in stages over each of 
the vesting periods and are linked to:
 – growth in earnings per share of the Company 
(’EPS’); and
 – growth in the Company’s share price.
EPS: In respect of the financial year ending 31 
December 2011 and for each of the financial years 
ending 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013, 
the Company would have needed to have achieved 
EPS growth of at least 20% per annum in 
comparison to the previous financial year for the 
relevant proportion of awards to vest in full. If the 
Company only achieved between 10-20% per annum 
growth in EPS in the financial year under 
measurement, between 50-100% of the relevant 
proportion of awards would have vested on a 
straight line basis between those two growth points. 
If the Company had not achieved at least 10% per 
annum growth in EPS in the financial year under 
measurement, none of the relevant proportion of 
awards would have vest. If, however, over the full 
three years’ vesting periods the Company had 
achieved a compound average growth in EPS of 
20% per annum despite not having achieved that 
growth rate in any particular financial year, then the 
EPS performance criteria would have been deemed 
to have been achieved and awards would have 
vested in full.
Share Price: In respect of the financial year ended 31 
December 2011 and for each of the financial years 
ending 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013, 
the Company needed to achieve a growth in its 
share price of at least 26% per annum for the 
relevant proportion of awards to vest in full. The 
base share price for the financial year ended 31 
December 2011 was the Placing Price (124 pence) 
and thereafter any increase would be measured by 
reference to the average of the Company’s closing 
share prices for the 30 days following the 
announcement of the Company’s audited results for 
each financial year. In the event the Company only 
achieved between 13-26% per annum growth in its 
share price in the financial year under measurement, 
between 50-100% of the relevant proportion of 
awards would vest on a straight line basis between 
those two growth points. In the event the Company 
did not achieve at least 13% per annum growth in 
share price in the financial year under measurement, 
none of the relevant proportion of awards would 
vest. If, however, the average of the Company’s 
closing share prices over the 30 days following 
announcement of the Company’s audited results for 
the year ending 31 December 2013 is 100% or more 
above the Placing Price, despite not having achieved 
a 26% growth in its share price in any particular year, 
then the share price performance criteria shall be 
deemed to have been achieved and awards shall be 
capable of vesting in full.
Remuneration Report continued 41
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Each award is split into three equal annual tranches. Within each annual tranche, vesting of 50% of that 
tranche will be subject to the EPS performance criteria and 50% to the share price performance criteria. The 
Remuneration Committee will determine whether and to what extent the applicable performance conditions 
have been satisfied shortly after the announcement of the Company’s audited results for each of the years 
ending 31 December 2011, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 respectively, (and, if applicable, to total 
EPS or share price growth over the full three year vesting period).
The Remuneration Committee may, at any time, amend the LTIP in any respect provided that the prior 
approval of the Company in general meeting is obtained for amendments to the provisions of the LTIP 
relating to eligibility, the overall limits on the issue of new shares, the maximum entitlement for any 
participant and the basis for determining that entitlement where such changes are to the material advantage 
of participants. Shareholder approval is not, however, required for minor amendments to benefit the 
administration of the LTIP, to take account of changes in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable 
taxation or regulatory treatment for participants or for any member of the Group.
The grant date fair value of the LTIP was measured based on the Monte Carlo Simulation option pricing 
model. Volatility was based on the historical share price data of the constituents of the Oil services and 
equipment sector on the London Stock Exchange. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair values at 
grant date of the LTIP were as follows:

given the level of the Company’s share price at the date of this report (14.25p), there are no reasonable 
prospects that any shares shall vest and post this 30 day period the LTIP will no longer operate without a

DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS
Executive Directors
The Executive Directors have service agreements which can be terminated by either the Group or the 
Executive Director giving at least six months’ notice. Under the terms of the agreements, the Group reserves 
the right, in its absolute discretion, to terminate an Executive Director’s employment by making a payment in 
lieu of notice. In the event of a contract being terminated, the Remuneration Committee would determine 
the level of any compensation to be paid, normally by reference to fixed elements of remuneration and the 
notice period. Any annual bonus payment or vesting of shares under the LTIP would be dealt with in 
accordance with the rules of the particular scheme. Payments would normally be pro-rated and subject to 
the performance conditions under which the awards were granted. The Executive Directors are subject to 
restrictive covenants which seek to prevent them from soliciting customers or employees and/or competing 
with the Company’s business for six months following termination of employment.
Dates of the service agreements are:
Name Date of agreement Notice period
Alon Davidov 20 December 2010 6 months
Christopher Hall 20 December 2010 6 months
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive directors do not have service agreements with the Company, but each has a Letter of 
Appointment. Details of the Letters of Appointment are summarised below.
Name Effective date of agreement Notice period
Stephen Oke 23 December 2010 6 months
Roger Williams 23 December 2010 6 months 
Ian Watson 23 December 2010 6 months

appointment. Copies of all Executive Directors’ service agreements and the Letters of Appointment of the 
Non-executive directors are available for inspection during normal business hours at the office of the 
Company Secretary. 43

in respect of the Directors’ report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Directors’ Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. In 
addition, the Directors have elected to prepare the 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the 
EU.
The financial statements are required to give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and

that the Group and Parent Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Parent Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time its 
financial position. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from one jurisdiction to another.
The Directors confirm that to the best of their 
knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the Group; 
 – the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and strategy; and
 – the management report includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is 
unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Shaft 
Sinkers Holdings plc for the year ended 31 
December 2013. In our opinion the financial 
statements:
 
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 
December 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the 
year then ended; and 
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, as 
endorsed by the EU. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial 
statements, the risks of material misstatement that 
had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows: 
EuroChem arbitration claim proceedings 
Refer to pages 35 to 37 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 54, note 1.2 basis of preparation (accounting 
policy) and note 30 (contingent liability disclosure). 
The risk: During 2012, EuroChem, a former customer 
of the Group commenced arbitration proceedings 
against two South African subsidiaries of the Group 
(Shaft Sinkers Pty and Rossal 126 Pty) in the Swiss  
Chambers Arbitration institution and the International 
Chamber of Commerce International Court of 
Arbitration. These claims are for an amount of USD917 
million (previously USD1.06 billion), which is significant, 
and the application of accounting standards to 
determine the amount, if any, to be provided as a 
liability is inherently subjective. No amounts have 
been recognised in the financial statements for future 
legal costs or any settlement amount. 
Our response: In this area our audit procedures 
included, among other things, review of all of the 
submissions as at 29 April 2014 to the arbitration 
proceedings from both EuroChem and the Group 
(including Statement of Claims/Counter Claim and 
Defence, Witness Statements and Expert Witness 
reports) and also the Terms of Reference of the 
arbitration panels appointed. We have participated 
in detailed discussions and challenge with the Board, 
Group Legal Counsel and the Groups external Legal 
Advisers, based on the contracts with EuroChem, 
current arbitration submissions and proceedings. We 
have compared the information from all of these 
sources to management’s assessment of the position 
and need for a provision. We also assessed whether 
the group’s disclosures detailing significant legal 
proceedings adequately disclose the potential 
liabilities of the group. 
Going concern 
Refer to pages 35 to 37 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 54, note 1.2.3 going concern (accounting 
policy). 
The risk: The financial statements explain how the 
directors have formed a judgement that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the going concern basis 
is appropriate in preparing the financial statements 
of the company and the group. The directors have 
concluded that the range of possible outcomes they 
have considered in arriving at this judgement is not 
sufficient to give rise to a material uncertainty 
regarding the group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. As this assessment involves consideration 
of future events there is a risk that the judgement is 
inappropriate and that the uncertainty should have 
been assessed as material, in which case additional 
disclosures would have been required. 
Our response: In respect of the above, among other 
things, we have critically considered current and post 
year-end trading and outlook, cash collection, liquidity 
and forecasting for management’s assessment of 
going concern of the Group operations. 
The Group prepares forecasts for at least 18 months 
which consider the Groups performance and 
profitability as well as liquidity to enable obligations 
to be met as they fall due. These forecasts include 
legal and similar costs expected to be incurred as a 
result of defending the EuroChem proceedings. We 
have considered various stressed forecast scenarios 
and critically assessed the assumptions, including 
revenue forecasts with consideration to current 
performance and market conditions, taking into 
account the group’s forward order book and tender 
pipeline as well as the cost base and historical and 
budgeted margins. 
We have also considered management’s evaluation 
of the impacts of the current arbitration proceedings 
and possible scenarios arising from any adverse 
outcomes. This included an assessment of the 
group’s exposure to potential claims beyond the 
South African operation. 
We have considered the adequacy and 
appropriateness of the Groups disclosures with regard 
to the risks the Group faces as well as management 
assessment of the appropriateness of going concern. 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
(GBP42.8 million) and goodwill (GBP1.6 million) 
Refer to pages 35 to 37 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 59, note 1.3.9 impairment (accounting policy) 
and notes 6 and 7 (financial disclosure). 
The risk: There is a risk over the recoverability of the 
group’s fixed assets and goodwill as a result of the 
current year performance and trading outlook. 
Demand has weakened significantly in certain 
markets and the group has encountered certain 
operational difficulties with projects. Due to the 
inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and 
discounting future cash flows, which are the basis of 
the assessment of recoverability, this is one of the 
key judgemental areas that our audit is focussed on. 
Report of the Independent Auditors, KPMG Audit LLC, 
to the members of Shaft Sinkers Holdings plc ONL Y  GOVERNANCE
46
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Our response: In this area our audit procedures 
included, among others, testing of the group’s 
budgeting procedures upon which the forecasts are 
based and the mathematical integrity of the group’s 
discounted cash flow model. We critically assessed 
the assumptions used in the valuation against 
current and expected performance trends taking 
into account the open order book of the business. 
We compared the assumptions to externally derived 
data, where appropriate, and to our own 
assessments of certain key inputs. We used our own 
valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the 
discount rate used. We also assessed whether the 
group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the 
outcome of the impairment assessment of fixed 
assets and goodwill to changes in key assumptions 
reflected the inherent risks. 
Revenue recognition and profit on long term 
contracts (GBP152.2 million) 
Refer to pages 35 to 37 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 62, note 1.3.15 revenue (accounting policy) and 
note 2 (financial disclosures). 
The risk: The Group’s contracts are long term by 
nature, variable in scope and in some cases penalty 
clauses may exist. Due to the nature of activities 
undertaken, scoping and pricing changes during the 
course of contracts may occur frequently, and 
project progress can be subject to delays. 
Significant estimation and judgement is required by 
management with regard to the stage of completion 
and resultant revenue and profit recognised as 
contract performance spans multiple financial 
reporting periods. This judgement is dependent on a 
number of variables such as stage of completion, 
unforeseen technological challenges, and cost 
forecasting including any unexpected costs.
 
Our response: Our procedures included, among 
other things, analytical procedures over revenue and 
costs on each contract performed by the group, 
comparing budget to actual performance and 
agreeing amounts recognised to supporting 
documentation. These procedures consider the 
contract terms, phase and progress for onerous 
contracts or penalty obligations. In addition we 
reconcile revenue accruals recognised, deferred 
income and similar items, billings and receipts. We 
have agreed post year end invoicing and debtor 
collection.
 
We participate in discussions with management on 
contract status and performance, and contract 
basis. The stage of completion is assessed by 
reference to surveys of work performed where 
appropriate. We have inspected contracts for any 
onerous contract indicators or penalty clauses 
based on the current project performance and 
outlook. We have assessed the estimated 
profitability of each project over its estimated 
lifecycle based on current performance and 
forecasts. We have also assessed the adequacy of 
the group’s disclosures in respect of revenue 
recognition. 
3. Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit 
In establishing the overall audit strategy, and 
performing the audit, materiality for the group 
financial statements as a whole was set at GBP1.1 
million. This has been calculated with reference to a 
benchmark of total group revenue (of which it 
represents 0.7%), which we consider to be one of 
the principal considerations for members of the 
Company in assessing the financial performance of 
the group. 
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it 
all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we 
identified through our audit with a value in excess of 
GBP55,000, in addition to other audit 
misstatements below that threshold that we believe 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Audits for group reporting purposes were 
performed by component auditors at key reporting 
components in the following countries: Republic of 
South Africa (“South Africa”), Republic of India 
(“India”) and Democratic Republic of Congo 
(“DRC”) and by the group audit team in the Isle of 
Man. The effect of this approach covered 100% of 
group revenue, group profit before tax, and group 
assets. 
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes 
at the key reporting components of the group were 
all performed to materiality levels set by, or agreed 
with, the group audit team. These materiality levels 
were set to the materiality level specified above or 
lower. 
Detailed audit instructions were sent to all the 
auditors in these locations. These instructions 
covered the significant areas that should be covered 
by the component audit teams (which included the 
relevant risks of material misstatement detailed 
above) and set out the information required to be 
reported to the group audit team. The group 
engagement team maintained open dialogue with 
the group reporting auditors throughout their audit 
processes. The group audit team was physically 
present in South Africa during the conclusion of the 
substantive testing phase of the South African 
component audit. In doing so the group audit team 
was actively involved in the direction and review of 
the audit engagement performed by these 
component auditors for group reporting purposes, 
along with the consideration of findings and 
determination of conclusions drawn. Telephone 
meetings were also held with auditors in South 
Africa and the other component auditor locations 
that were not physically visited.

4. We have nothing to report in respect of the 
matters on which we are required to report by 
exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to 
report to you if, based on the knowledge we 
acquired during our audit, we have identified other 
information in the annual report that contains a 
material inconsistency with either that knowledge or 
the financial statements, a material misstatement of 
fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 – we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider that the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s 
performance, business model and strategy; or 
 – the Audit Committee Report does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by 
us to the audit committee. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 – the directors’ statement, set out on page 44, in 
relation to going concern; and 
 – the part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
on pages 30 to 34 in the Directors’ Report relating 
to the company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.
 
Scope of report and responsibilities 
We have audited the financial statements of Shaft 
Sinkers Holdings Plc for the year ended 31 December 
2013 which comprise the Group Income Statement, 
Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Group and Parent Company Statements of Financial 
Position, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity 
and the Group Statement of Cash Flows and the 
related notes. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs), as endorsed by the EU.
 
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and 
Auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on page 44, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
financial statements that give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion 
on, the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.

Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1.1 Reporting entity
Shaft Sinkers Holdings plc (“the Company”) is domiciled in the Isle of Man. The Company’s registered office 
is at 18 Athol Street, Douglas, Isle of Man. These consolidated annual financial statements as at and for the 
year ended 31 December 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the 
Group” and individually as the “Group entities”). The Group is primarily involved in shaft sinking, contract 
mining, mine operation, tunnelling and large underground excavations.
1.2 Basis of preparation
1.2.1 Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations 
adopted by the European Union.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the listing rules of the London 
Stock Exchange.
1.2.2 Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the 
following material items in the consolidated statement of financial position.
 – financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value
The methods used to measure fair value are discussed further in note 1.3.21.
1.2.3 Basis of preparation
Going concern
As described in note 18, the Group has borrowings and facilities, which, together with receipts from clients 
fund the daily working capital requirements of the Group. Volatile economic conditions may occasionally 
create uncertainty in respect of:
 – Demand for the Group’s services as a consequence of reduced capital expenditure within the mining and 
related industries; and
 – The availability of bank financing in the foreseeable future.
In assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern the Board has reviewed the following:
 – Group forecasts and projections for at least an 18 month forward-looking period and up to December 
2015, taking into account potential changes in Group performance. The forecasts and projections focus on 
both the financial performance as well as the liquidity of the Group; and
 – The aforementioned forecasts and projections were further subjected to a stress test by applying a 
conservatism factor in order to ascertain whether the Group will be able to operate in periods of duress.
The Group forecasts and projections indicate the Group should be able to operate within the level of its 
capital structure. The Board has factored into its liquidity forecasts and considered the impact of
GBP1.8m (USD3 million) of cash being restricted as a result of the security provided to the Group’s bankers 
for the performance guarantee issued in respect of a project.
The following main assumptions have been used in making this assessment:
 – The current banking facilities of the Group will remain in place for at least the next 18 months;
 – The strike action currently being experienced in the mining industry in South Africa will continue until 
June after which operations will return to normality;
 – The current normal operational performance assumptions will be met;
 – New projects have been included where formal tenders have been submitted and management have 
assessed the likelihood of success as strong;
 – A program of surplus asset realisations will result in additional cash inflows;
 – Restricted cash will remain restricted throughout the period of assessment.
 – In the stress test, unsecured revenues which do not form part of the current order book are removed.
The Board has also considered the claim received from EuroChem of an amount of approximately USD917 
million (GBP550 million), in determining its ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the review of the 
arbitration claim in consultation with external legal counsel the Board continues to be of the view that the 
principal claims are without merit and the subsidiaries concerned are contesting the claims robustly, as such 
the Board has not forecast any requirement to settle amounts arising from these claims. However, given the 
ongoing arbitration processes management forecasts include best estimates of expenses likely to be 
incurred in defending the Group’s position.
Notes to the consolidated annual financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2013 55
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
www.shaftsinkersgroup.com
The amount the Group submitted as a counter-claim against EuroChem to the net value of USD16 million 
(GBP9.3 million) for outstanding amounts payable under the contract, as a result of the uncertainty 
regarding the timing of any receipts awarded from the arbitration processes, has not been forecast as 
received during the future period reviewed and as such does not have any impact on available liquidity.
Various initiatives are underway to convert some of the available longer-term assets of the Group into 
near-term cash. Management is optimistic that these initiatives will generate additional funds that will assist 
the Group to continue to support the high level of legal expenses related to the arbitration matter and 
enable the Group to continue as a going concern.
Based on the forecasts prepared the Board considers that the Group has sufficient ability to meet its 
scheduled debt repayments during the forecast period from the facilities and cash flows available to it. The 
current term facilities expire in December 2014 with a final repayment of R50 million (GBP2.9 million). The 
Group is in discussion with its bankers regarding the possible extension of these facilities.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources in place to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. The consolidated annual financial statements therefore 
continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in British Pounds which is the functional and 
presentation currency of the parent company.
1.2.4 Use of estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Accounting estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in 
applying accounting policies that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements is supplied in the following notes:
 – Note 1.2.3: basis of preparation – going concern
 – Note 6.5: impairment of property, plant and equipment
 – Note 6.6: useful lives of property, plant and equipment
 – Note 7: assessment of goodwill impairment
 – Note 11: deferred tax assets
 – Note 13: recognition of account receivable
 – Note 22: measurement of post retirement benefit obligations
 – Note 1.3.6 and 25.1: lease classification
 – Note 1.3.21: valuation of financial instruments
 – Note 30: contingent liabilities
1.2.5 Change in accounting policy
On 1 January 2013 the Group changed its accounting policy governing the subsequent measurement of land 
and buildings from the revaluation model to the cost model. The Group believes that this approach provides 
more relevant and reliable information about the Group’s financial position as it eliminates the volatility in 
property valuations caused by market conditions. The change in accounting policy has been applied 
retrospectively for all periods presented in this report.
The impact of the change in accounting policy to all periods presented has been summarised in note 6.2.
1.3 Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all periods presented in these 
consolidated financial statements except as explained above, which addresses the change in accounting policy 
of land and buildings. The accounting policies have been applied consistently to all entities within the Group.
1.2 Basis of preparation continued FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1.3.1 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
The accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with the policies adopted by the Group. 
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the 
Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the 
original business combination and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the 
combination. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the non-controlling interest’s share of 
changes in equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the non-controlling 
interest has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses. 
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as 
transactions with owners in their capacity of owners. Adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on 
a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. No adjustments are made to goodwill and no 
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Acquisitions from entities under common control
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the control of the shareholder 
that controls the Group are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest 
comparative period presented or, if later, at the date that common control was established. The assets and 
liabilities acquired are recognised at the carrying amounts recognised previously in the Group controlling 
shareholder’s consolidated financial statements. The components of equity of the acquired entities are added 
to the same components within Group equity and any gain / loss arising is recognised directly in equity.
Jointly controlled operations
A jointly controlled operation is a joint venture carried on by each venturer using its own assets in pursuit of 
the joint operations. The consolidated financial statements include the assets that the Group controls and 
the liabilities that it incurs in the course of pursuing the joint operation and the expenses that the Group 
incurs and its share of the income that it earns from the joint operation.
Special purpose entities
Special purpose entities classified as such in accordance with SIC 12 Consolidation – special-purpose entities. 
Special purpose entities are those companies in which the Group has an interest of 50% or more of the 
voting rights or otherwise has the power to exercise control over the operations and derive the benefits 
there from. Due to the fact that a special purpose entity is deemed to be controlled by the Group, the 
financial statements of a special purpose entity are included in the consolidated annual financial statements.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from 
transactions with equity accounted investees and joint ventures are eliminated against the investment to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised 
gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
1.3.2 Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary company at 
the exchange rate at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 
the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign 
currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the amortised cost in the functional currency 
at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised 
cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional 
currency at the exchange rate at the date that their fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences 
arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
acquisition, are translated to British Pounds at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and 
expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economics, are translated 
to British Pound at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign 
currency translation reserve (“translation reserve”) in equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of such 
that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is 
reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of 
its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of 
the cumulative amount is re-attributed to non-controlling interests.
When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither 
planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such monetary 
item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
1.3.3 Financial instruments
Non-derivative financial assets
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All 
other financial assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially 
on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, 
or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred 
financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position 
when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends to either settle on a net 
basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group has the following non-derivative financial assets: financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss and loans and receivables.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or is 
designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or 
loss if the Group manages such investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value 
in accordance with the Group’s risk management and investment strategy. Upon initial recognition, 
attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in profit or loss.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, loans receivable, loans to related parties and 
cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits, with original maturities of three months or 
less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management 
are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Non-derivative financial liabilities
The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are 
originated. All other financial liabilities (including liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss) are 
recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
1.3 Significant accounting policies continued FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
58
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
The Group has the following non-derivative financial liabilities: loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and 
trade and other payables.
Such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Share capital
Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary 
shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. When share 
capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
1.3.4 Property, plant and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-
constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, and any other costs directly attributable 
to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing 
items and restoring the site on which they are located.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for 
as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the 
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net 
within other income in profit or loss. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in the revaluation 
reserve are transferred to retained earnings.
Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount 
of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group, 
and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The cost of 
day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other amount 
substituted for cost, less its residual value.
Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of each 
part of an item of property, plant and equipment, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of 
consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Leased assets are depreciated over the 
shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are: 2013 2012
Buildings 50 years 50 years
Plant and equipment 1-20 years 1-20 years
Furniture, fittings and office equipment 2-6 years 2-6 years
Motor vehicles 4 years 4 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted 
if appropriate. Estimates in respect of certain items of plant and equipment were revised – refer to note 6.6.

1.3.5 Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. For measurement of 
goodwill at initial recognition, see note 1.3.1.
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical 
knowledge and understanding is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved 
products or processes. Development expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured 
reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are 
probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use of sell 
the asset. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour, overhead costs that are 
directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use, and capitalised borrowing costs. Other 
development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the 
specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
1.3.6 Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the 
lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Other leases are operating leases and, the leased assets are not recognised in the Group’s statement of 
financial position.
1.3.7 Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the 
weighted average cost method, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or 
conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs 
of completion and selling expenses. Obsolete, redundant and slow moving inventories are identified on a 
regular basis and are written down to their estimated net realisable values.
1.3.8 Contract work in progress
Contract work in progress represents the gross unbilled amount expected to be collected from customers 
for contract work performed to date. It is measured at cost plus profit recognised to date less progress 
billings and recognises losses. Cost includes all expenditure related directly to specific projects.
Contract work in progress is presented as part of trade and other receivables in the statement of financial 
position for all contracts in which costs incurred plus recognised profits exceed progress billings. If progress 
billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits, then the difference is presented as deferred revenue 
in the statement of financial position.
1.3.9 Impairment
Financial assets
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective 
evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss 
event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
1.3 Significant accounting policies continued FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
60
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Objective evidence that financial assets (including equity securities) are impaired include default or 
delinquency by a debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not 
consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, the disappearance of an active 
market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or prolonged decline in 
its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.
The Group considers evidence of impairment for receivables at both specific asset and collective level. All 
individually significant receivables are assessed for specific impairment. All individually significant 
receivables found not to be specifically impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has 
been incurred but not yet identified. Receivables that are not individually significant are collectively assessed 
for impairment by grouping together receivables with similar risk characteristics.
In assessing collective impairment the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, timing of 
recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management’s judgement as to whether the current 
economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or less than suggested 
by historical trends.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference 
between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the 
asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance 
account against receivables. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the 
unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the 
decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amount of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are 
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use 
(including capitalised development costs), the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its 
estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses 
recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group 
of units) on a pro rata basis. In the case of land and buildings, the revaluation decrease is recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income against the revaluation reserve.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses 
recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has 
decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates 
used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
1.3.10 Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are employee benefits (other than termination benefitis) that are expected to 
be settled wholly within twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees 
render the related services. Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis 
and are expensed as the related service is provided.

for the year ended 31 December 2013
1.3 Significant accounting policies continued 61
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
www.shaftsinkersgroup.com
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing 
plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service 
provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share based payment transactions
The grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an 
employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees 
unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the number of awards for which the related service and nonmarket vesting conditions are expected to be 
met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet 
the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment 
awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to 
reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Defined contribution plan
A defined contribution plan is post-employment plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a 
separate legal entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for 
contributions to defined contribution pension places are recognised as an employee benefit expense in 
profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. 
Contributions to a defined contribution plan that is due more than 12 months after the end of the period in 
which the employees render the services are discounted to their present value.
Defined benefit plan
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net 
obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount 
of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that 
benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value 
of any plan assets are deducted. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit method.
The Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans in profit or loss. The 
scheme has no plan assets and is an unfunded scheme.
1.3.11 Black economic empowerment (BEE) transactions
Where the Group disposes of a portion of a South African based subsidiary or operation to a BEE company 
or employee benefit trust at a discount to fair value, the transaction is considered to be a share based 
payment (in line with the principles contained in South Africa interpretation AC503 Accounting for Black 
Economic Empowerment (BEE) Transactions. The discount provided or value given is calculated in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments and included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal.
1.3.12 Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at 
a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.
Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group 
from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The 
provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and 
the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group 
recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
1.3.13 Interest free advances
Interest free advances are received from clients primarily to enable the Group to meet its procurement 
obligations in respect of the contract in jurisdictions where normal business practices dictate that suppliers 
are paid upfront for products and/or services to be delivered.
1.3 Significant accounting policies continued FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
62
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Interest free advances are offset against normal monthly invoices issued to the client and are reflected in the 
statement of financial position as an undiscounted amount.
1.3.14 Sub-contractor liabilities
Subcontractor liabilities represent the actual unpaid liability owing to subcontractors for work performed 
including retention monies owed. Subcontractor liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, and are 
subsequently classified as non-trading financial liabilities and carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
1.3.15 Revenue
Revenue comprises the net invoiced value of contracts and other services rendered (excluding value 
added tax).
Contract revenue
Contract revenue includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract work, 
claims and incentive payments to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be 
measured reliably. As soon as the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and 
expenses are recognised in profit or loss in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. Contract 
expenses are recognised as incurred unless they create an asset related to future contract activity.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed. When the outcome of the 
contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs 
incurred that are likely to be recoverable. Anticipated losses to completion on a contract is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Variations in contract work and claims are included to the extent that collection is probable and the amounts 
can be reliably measured.
In limited circumstances, contracts may be materially inpacted by a client’s actions such that the Group is 
unable to complete the contracted works at all or in the manner orignially planned. This may involve dispute 
resolution procedures under the relevant contract and/or litigation. In these circumstances the assessment 
of the project outcome, whilst still following basic revenue recognition principles, becomes more 
judgemental.
1.3.16 Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease.
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the 
reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term 
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. 
A specific asset is the subject of a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that 
specific asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the Group 
the right to control the use of the underlying asset.
At inception or upon reassessment of the arrangement, the Group separates payments and other 
consideration required by such an arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the 
basis of their relative fair values. If the Group concludes for a finance lease that it is impracticable to 
separate the payments reliably, an asset and a liability are recognised at an amount equal to the fair value of 
the underlying asset. Subsequently the liability is reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance 
charge on the liability is recognised using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.
1.3.17 Finance income and costs 
Finance income comprises interest income of funds invested, dividend income, gains on the disposal of 
available-for-sale financial assets, changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, 
and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss. Interest income is recognised as it 
accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that 
the Group’s right to receive payment is established.
Notes to the consolidated annual financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2013
1.3 Significant accounting policies continued 63
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
www.shaftsinkersgroup.com
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, changes in 
the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, impairment losses recognised on financial 
assets, and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss. Borrowing costs that are not 
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in 
profit or loss using the effective interest method. Foreign currency gains or losses are reported on a net basis.
1.3.18 Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current taxation and deferred taxation. Income tax expense is recognised in 
profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income.
Current tax
Current taxation is the expected taxation payable on taxable income for the year, using taxation rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to taxation payable in respect 
of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any tax liability arising from declaration of dividends not 
paid by reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred taxation is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the 
extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred taxation is 
not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. 
Deferred taxation is measured at the taxation rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary 
differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively been enacted by 
the reporting date.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
taxation liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same authority on the same 
taxable entity, or on different taxable entities, but they intend to settle current taxation liabilities and assets 
on a net basis or their taxation liabilities and assets will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred taxation assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related taxation benefit will be realised.
1.3.19 Earnings per share
The Group presents basic earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is 
calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for the Company’s own 
shares. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting profit or loss attributable to the ordinary 
shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares 
held and for the effects of all diluted potential ordinary shares, which may comprise convertible notes and 
share options granted to employees.
1.3.20 Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may 
earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of 
the Group’s other components. All operating segments‘ operating results are reviewed regularly by the 
Group’s executive management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to 
assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Segment results that are reported to executive management include items directly attributable to a segment 
as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate 
overhead expenses and income tax assets and liabilities.
1.3 Significant accounting policies continued FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
64
Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire property, plant and 
equipment, and intangible assets other than goodwill.
1.3.21 Determination of fair values
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both 
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or 
disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the 
assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
Trade and other receivables
The fair values of trade and other receivables, excluding construction work in progress, are estimated at the 
present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the measurement date. 
Short-term receivables with no stated interest rate are measured at the original invoice amount if the effect 
of discounting is immaterial. Fair value is determined at initial recognition and, for disclosure purposes, at 
each annual reporting date.
Non-derivative financial liabilities
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future 
principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. In respect of 
the liability component of convertible notes, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar 
liabilities that do not have a conversion option. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined 
by reference to the rate per the agreement, which is linked to the prime lending rate of South Africa.
Investments in equity
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments and 
available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to their quoted bid price at the reporting date. 
The fair value of held-to-maturity investments is determined for disclosure purposes only.
Share based payments
The fair value of the Group’s long term share incentive scheme is measured using Monte Carlo Simulation 
model. Measurement inputs include the share price at measurement date, the expected volatility (based on 
an evaluation of the Company’s historic volatility, particularly over the historic period commensurate with 
the expected term of the instruments), the expected term of the instruments, expected dividends and the 
risk free interest rates based on government bonds. Service and non-market performance conditions 
attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value.
1.3.22 New standards and interpretations
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations issued are not yet effective for 
the year ended 31 December 2013, and have not been applied in preparing these annual financial statements.
The impact of these new standards, amendment to standards and interpretations issued but not yet 
effective has been calculated and is not considered to have a significant impact on the Group’s annual 
financial statements.

The results of the Group were affected by an exceptional abnormal item during the year under review. A 
reconciliation has therefore been prepared below, whereby the profit from operations as reflected in the 
consolidated income statement is reconciled to the profit from operations before exceptional abnormal 
items. Details around the nature of the exceptional abnormal item are more fully described below.

3.2 Legal fees
As more fully described in note 30.2, the Group is involved in arbitration proceedings involving one of the 
Group’s former clients. Due to the complexity of the matter the Group has and continues to incur a 
substantial amount of legal fees during the period leading up to the formal arbitration hearing that is 
currently scheduled for the second half of 2014. The nature and magnitude of the legal fees incurred in 
respect of this matter is considered to be abnormal, when evaluating the quality of earnings of the Group, 
and as a result has been separately disclosed in the statement of income. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Group’s foreign tax rate differential decreased from 9.5% in 2012 to 2.7% in 2013. The decrease was 
caused mostly by a decrease in profitability of the South African operations of the Group, resulting in a 
decrease in taxable income. 
The Company is subject to tax in the Isle of Man at the standard tax rate of 0% (2012: 0%).

6.2 Change in accounting policy
On 1 January 2013 the Group changed its accounting policy governing the subsequent measurement of land 
and buildings from the revaluation model to the cost model. The Group believes that this approach provides 
more relevant and reliable information about the Group’s financial position.
The change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively for all periods presented.
The following table represents the adjustments made to the statement of financial position on 
implementation of the new accounting policy:

6.3 Land and buildings
Land and buildings include:
Portion 305 of the farm Scheerpoort No. 477 JQ, including residential buildings and improvements, being 
Casa d’Vliet
Portion 73 (a portion of 63) of the farm Oorzak 335, for the new training centre. The construction of the new 
training centre was substantially completed in 2013.
6.4 Encumbrances
The Group’s plant and equipment is encumbered by a cession to Standard Bank of South Africa Limited, as 
security for its guarantee and banking facilities as set out in note 18.3.
6.5 Impairment
Property, plant and equipment in the South African region was subjected to an impairment test using a 
discounted cash flow model on the same assumptions as more fully decribed in note 7. Based on the results 
of the assessment no impairment losses were deemed necessary.
An impairment reversal of GBP62 540 (2012: impairment loss – GBP346 560) was recognised during the 
year on the Group’s plant and equipment. The impairment reversals arose following a detailed review of the 
fixed asset register and were identified on a line by line basis where impairments had previously been 
recognised for which the circumstances no longer existed at year end.
The impairment reversal during the current year and the impairment loss recognised during the prior year all 
relate to the South African segment of the Group.
6.6 Change in estimate
The useful lives and residual values were assessed not to have changed during the year and therefore there 
was no change in the current year depreciation charge (2012: decrease in useful life and an additional 
depreciation charge of GBP0.8 million). 
The following key assumptions were considered during the annual evaluation of useful lives:
 – mechanical stress, which refers to forces and loads applied to assets which lead to degradation over time;
 – electrical loading, which refers to stresses such as continuous loading, temporary overloading and 
exposure to short circuit fault current;
 – operational practices, which refers to how frequently an asset is subject to operations;
 – environmental conditions, including pollution, salt, acid rain, humidity and extreme temperature that are 
prevalent and causes long term degradation; and
 – maintenance practices, which refers to the frequency of routine inspection and maintenance that is 
performed on plant and equipment.
6.7 Capital work in progress
Capital work in progress relates to the construction of the Group’s new training centre and improvements to 
the Group’s Johannesburg offices, as well as items of plant and equipment which at the reporting date were 
not yet available for use.
6.8 Derecognition of components replaced
Components with a carrying value of GBP257 884 (2012: GBP459 501) were replaced with new improved 
items, resulting in the original component being derecognised to profit and loss.
6.9 Non-current assets held for sale
Plant and equipment with a net book value of GBP749 425 (2012: Nil) has been classified as held for sale. 
Management committed selling these assets during the next 12 months. No gains or losses in profit or loss 
arose on the transfer from property, plant and equipment to non-current assets held for sale.
7 Goodwill
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Rossal 126 (Proprietary) Limited by the Group during 2007. The balance 
represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of that company.

Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units
Goodwill has not been allocated to individual cash generating units as it is believed that goodwill relates to 
the specialised industry expertise and experiences within the Group itself that allows the Group to operate in 
various different geographical segments.
Impairment testing
An impairment test was performed on 31 December 2013 on the goodwill balance of the Group, whereby the 
recoverable amount of the Group’s underlying assets was based on its value in use, which was determined 
using a discounted cash flow model.
The recoverable amount was compared to the carrying amount of goodwill and it was found that the 
recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount. 
Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projections
 – The forecast earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation for the period 2014 to 2018 
submitted to the Board of Directors; 
 – No growth in earnings were taken into consideration beyond the above-mentioned forecast periods; 
 – For the purposes of a conservative impairment test, a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 
24.8% (2012: 16.9%) was used as the discount rate in determining the present value of future cash flows; 
and
 – Annual capital expenditure averages GBP6.2 million (2012: GBP14.5 million) during the period FY2014 to 
FY2018.

During the 2012 financial year the Group concluded an agreement with SightPower Incorporated, whereby

through a subsidiary of the Group.
Since the development of the intellectual property is still continuing no amortisation or impairment losses 
have been raised against the development costs incurred to date as the current net book value is deemed to 
be fully recoverable once the development of the technology is complete.

to contracts in progress. Advances for which the related work has not yet started, are presented as deferred 
revenue (refer note 24) and amounted to GBP8 023 861 (2012: GBP15 699 543).
An amount of GBP9 174 901 (2012: GBP8 084 661) is subject to arbitration as a result of a dispute with a 
former client. During the year it was determined that the account receivable would not be collected during 
the following twelve months and as a result, the account receivable was classified as a non-current asset at 
31 December 2013. 
All the necessary actions have been taken by the directors to recover the amount. The recoverability of the 
amount has been considered based on external and internal legal advice and the balance recorded at the 
reporting date is deemed recoverable based on the facts of the matter. Interest free advances received from 
the client reduced the gross balance owing by the client. It is envisaged that these will be settled 
simultaneously.

26 Financial risk instruments and risk management
The Board’s overall policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market 
confidence. Having sufficient and extensive capital, in the form of plant and equipment, is the key to success 
of the Group. Having the necessary equipment available gives the Group a competitive edge in the 
tendering process and avoids delays in the start-up of new contracts. Certain key plant items are scarce in 
the market and have a long lead time from ordering to receiving.
The Group has exposure to the following risks
 – market risk
 – credit risk
 – liquidity risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s 
objectives, policies and process for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. 
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Exposure to currency and credit risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. Forward exchange 
contracts are used as a means of reducing exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Group 
generally does not speculate in derivative instruments. There were no forward exchange rate contracts at 
the reporting date.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk 
management. The audit committee has been mandated with the responsibility of developing and monitoring 
the Group’s risk management policies. The committee is assisted in its role by internal audit. Internal audit 
undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk managements controls and procedures, the results of 
which are reported to the audit committee. The Group audit committee reports to the Board of Directors on 
a regular basis.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, 
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management 
policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s 
activities. The Group through its training, management and safety standards and procedures, aims to 
develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles 
and obligations, as well as the importance of maintaining safety standards.
26.1 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and 
equity prices that will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The 
objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, while optimising the return.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on contract revenue, purchases and borrowings that are denominated 
in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Group, primarily the South African Rand, 
U.S. Dollar (USD), Russian Rouble (RuR), the United Arab Emirate Dirham (Dirham), the Congolese Franc 
(CDF), the Euro, the Indian Rupee and the Kazakstan Tenge.
The Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying and selling foreign 
currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short term imbalances. The Group invoices in foreign 
currencies where possible where its cost base is also in foreign currencies in order to achieve a natural 
hedge position. In volatile markets the Group will consider using forward exchange contracts to mitigate 
foreign currency risks. Board approval will however be obtained before the Group enters into any forward 
foreign exchange contracts. DESPITE THE REPORTING CURRENCY BEING THE BRITISH POUND, the Group 
prefers to hold most of its surplus cash resources in the US Dollar functional currency. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows and invests excess funds at both fixed and floating 
interest rates. The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mixture between fixed and floating rate 
borrowings and placings within the market exposure expectations. The Group also uses interest rate swaps, 
where deemed necessary to hedge its exposure to floating interest rates.
Interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows where applicable, are based on the bank prime lending 
rate at reporting date and were as follows:.
Variable interest rates:
 – Loans and borrowings are linked to the Johannesburg Inter-Bank Agreed Rate (JIBAR) and ranges 
between JIBAR plus 2.2% to JIBAR plus 6.8%.
 – Loans to and from related parties bears interest at the prime lending rate of South Africa less 2.00% per 
annum.

26.2 Exposure to credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer as 
well as the demographics of the Group’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and 
country in which the customers operate.
Management has established a policy of spreading the customer base outside of Africa and into Eastern and 
Western Europe and India. This is to optimise geographical concentration of credit risk.
The Board of Directors has established parameters which, if these are to be exceeded, prior approval from 
the Board is required before submission of a tender to the potential new customer. These parameters are 
based on items such as the value of the contract, the type of contract, and location of the contract.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect 
of trade and other receivables. The main component of this allowance is a specific loss component that 
relates to individually significant exposure and a collective loss component established of similar assets in 
respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined 
based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.

Account receivable
An amount of GBP9 174 903 (2012: GBP8 084 661) is subject to arbitration as a result of a dispute with a 
former client. During the year it was determined that the account receivable would not be collected during 
the following twelve months and as a result, this was included in non-current assets at 31 December 2013. 
The directors are of the view that this remains the case at 31 December 2013.
All necessary actions have been taken by the directors to recover the amount. The recoverability of the 
amount has been considered based on external and internal legal advice and the balance recorded at the 
reporting date is deemed recoverable based on the facts of the matter.

denominated in US Dollars. The net receivable was transferred out of trade and other receivables to a 
separate line item on the statement of financial position to fall in line with the expected settlement date.
Management have raised impairments based on key assumptions and estimates in terms of the contract. 
Should management’s estimates of the future not reflect actual events, further impairments may be 
identified.
The Group believes that no further impairments are necessary other than those raised above, in respect of 
trade receivables. The balance of trade receivables relate to customers that have had a good track record

Loans and other recievables
The Group has provided funding to related parties and employees in the form of loans and finance lease 
receivables respectively. These loans and other receivables are considered low risk by management as these 
receivables are mostly secured by the underlying asset in the case of finance lease receivables. No 
allowances for impairment is therefore deemed necessary for these loans. The maximum exposure of the 
Group to credit risk relating to loans and other receiavbles are reflected by the carrying amount of these 
instruments and are summarised below:

791,717 1,261,080
Cash and cash equivalents
Management considers the credit risk relating to its cash and cash equivalents to be low due to the fact that 
all of its cash and cash equivalents are invested at reputable financial institutions with good credit ratings, 
which are monitored by the Board of Directors on an ongoing basis.
26.3 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meets its financial obligations as they fall due. The 
Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient cash 
flow and marketable securities to meet its obligations when they fall due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet unexpected operational expenses, including 
the servicing of financial obligations. This excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot 
be reasonably predicted, such as natural disasters. In addition, the Group maintains overdraft facilities with its 
Bankers to cover periods where high volumes of the operational liabilities are expected to occur. The current 
overdraft facility that the Group maintains amounts to ZAR77.5 million (GBP4.5 million).
The Board and management conducts regular and intensified planning sessions to ensure the cash resources 
available to the Group are managed in the most efficient manner, especially in times of tight cash flow 
constraints when liquidity is limited.

Description of the share based payment arrangements
On 23 December 2010 the then three executive directors of the Company were given awards over a number of 
ordinary shares of the Company. This share based payment arrangement was to be satisfied at the end of the 
vesting periods and effected through the transfer of ordinary shares to the participants. This share based 
payment arrangement is therefore considered to be equity settled as defined in IFRS 2 – Share based payments.

Terms and conditions of the share based payment arrangements
The share based payment arrangement comprise of two performance conditions that is measured in stages 
over the vesting periods. The performance conditions, described below, are independent of each other and 
therefore have been accounted for as separate share based payment arrangements. 
The performance conditions that are applied for the share based payment arrangements are as follows:
 – growth in earnings per share of the Company (“EPS”)
 – growth in the Company’s share price
EPS share based payment arrangement
In order for the shares attributable to the growth in earning per share of the Company to vest, the Group 
had to achieve a growth in earnings for each of the financial years ending 31 December 2011 to 31 December 
2013 of at least 20 per cent per annum. In the event that the growth in earnings is between 10 and 20 per 
cent per annum, between 50 to 100 percent of the shares would vest on a straight line basis. In the event 
that the growth in earnings is less than 10 percent, none of the shares would vest.
In the event that the compounded growth per annum over the three year period is 20 percent per annum  
all of the shares would vest to the participants despite not having achieved the targeted growth rate in a 
particular year.
Share price based payment arrangement
In order for the shares attributable to the growth in share price of the Company to vest, the share price of 
the Company has to achieve growth of at least 26 per cent per annum for each of the financial years ending 
31 December 2011 to 31 December 2013. The base price for the financial year ended 31 December 2011 is the 
placing price at which the Company’s shares were listed i.e. GBP 1.24 per share. In the event that the growth 
in share price is between 13 and 26 percent per annum, between 50 to 100 percent of the shares would vest 
on a straight line basis. In the event that the share price growth rate is less than 13% per annum, none of the 
relevant shares would vest.
In the event that the closing share prices over the 30 days following the announcement of the Group’s 
audited results for the financial year ending 31 December 2013 is 100 percent or more above the placing 
price, despite not having achieved the 26 percent per annum growth in its share price in any year, the share 
price performance criteria will be deemed to have been achieved and the participants will be entitled to 100 
percent of the share awards.
At 31 December 2013 and at the date of this report, neither the share price nor the EPS targets were achieved. 
Therefore at 31 December 2013 the quantum attributable to the award of the shares has been reversed.
Inputs for measurement of grant date fair values
The grant date fair value of the share based payment arrangements was measured based on the Monte 
Carlo Simulation option pricing model. Volatility was based on the historical share price data of the 
constituents of the oil services and equipment sector on the London Stock Exchange. The inputs used in the 
measurement of the fair values at grant date of the share based payment arrangements were as follows:

proceedings against Shaft Sinkers Proprietary Limited, with whom the contract was signed, and Rossal 
No. 126 Proprietary Limited, the immediate holding company, both of which are wholly owned 
subsidiaries of the Group. The arbitration proceedings are with the Swiss Chambers’ Arbitration 
Institution and the International Chamber of Commerce on substantially the same facts. EuroChem was 
claiming approximately USD800 million (GBP485 million based on current exchange rates) in alleged 
damages and loss of profits. During the current period, EuroChem initially increased the quantum of its 
claim to USD1,060 million (GBP643 million based on current exchange rates) and has, in its latest 
submission to the Swiss Chamber’s Arbitration Institution, decreased the quantum of its claim to 
USD917 million (approximately GBP556 million based on current exchange rates). Based on legal advice 
and review of the claims, the subsidiaries concerned continue to robustly defend these claims. Shaft 
Sinkers Proprietary Limited has further lodged its counter claims amounting to approximately USD16 
million (approximately GBP9.7 million based on current exchange rates), for amounts owing to it by the 
former client. The counter-claims have been lodged with the Swiss Chambers’ Arbitration Institution and 
the International Chamber of Commerce. These amounts have been included in non-current account 
receivable. The group has continued to incur legal and professional fees in respect of this matter which 
have been fully expensed as incurred up to the current period end.
As set out in note 1.2.3 it is not always possible to have absolute certainty as to the final outcome of 
any arbitration process before the arbitrators have made a final ruling. Accordingly the ultimate 
outcome of the matter cannot presently be determined, and no provision for any receipt or expense, 
aside from legal costs, that may result has been made in the financial statements.
The Board anticipates that the outcome of the proceedings will only be of practical effect in early 2015 
and some legal costs will be incurred during this period in defending these matters.
During the period under review the Group recovered an amount of Rouble 54.8 million (GBP1.1 million) 
from EuroChem through the disposal of plant and equipment that formed part of the initial claim.

Information about reportable segments
The Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. The 
strategic divisions of the Group are geographically different and are managed separately due to the unique 
challenges and risks that are present when operating in different jurisdictions. Although the METS division is 
a strategically important part of the business it is not regarded as a separate operating segment as defined 
in IFRS 8 due to the fact that the contribution that the METS division contributes to the Group is less than 
10% of the total contribution of the Group’s contracting activities.
The following describes the Group’s operating segments:
 – South Africa – Contract services provided to clients within the Republic of South Africa
 – International – Contract services provided to clients outside of the borders of the Republic of South Africa.
The Group’s international revenues are mostly derived from contract services provided in India and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the revenues generated from India making up the majority of 
foreign revenues.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured 
based on segment profit before income tax as described below. Performance is measured based on 
segment profit before income tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the 
Group’s executive management. The information is prepared under IFRS and is consistent with the Group’s 
accounting policies. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such 
information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments taking into consideration the 
unique risk characteristics of each of these segments.

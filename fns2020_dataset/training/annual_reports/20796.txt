Developments
This year marks Alumasc’s 30
th
 anniversary  
as a public company. For the past thirty years, 
our Annual Report, including my statement 
as Chairman, has covered a diverse group of 
small businesses, operating in several unrelated 
sectors. This year, following the sale of Dyson 
Diecastings, its last remaining engineering 
subsidiary, Alumasc’s continuing business  
now operates within a single market sector.
This concentration of activity within building 
and construction is the outcome of a strategy 
to focus resource where our strengths lie and 
to exchange the historic resilience of diversity 
for the greater possibilities of building on a 
winning formula, while continually developing 
our skills and sharing best practice. This 
approach is discussed in greater detail in  
the Chief Executive’s Review that follows.
In order to counter the resultant risk of 
exposure to a single industry and its cycles, 
we endeavour to direct each business towards 
sectoral opportunities where demand is 
expected to outstrip the industry benchmark 
and to seek opportunities to introduce our 
products and services to new geographic 
markets judged to hold potential. This is not 
a new endeavour; however, it has required 
patience and investment. We believe that it 
has already delivered results during the difficult 
years that followed the financial crisis and,  
with greater focus, will yield greater rewards  
in future years.
Performance
Importantly, Alumasc has delivered another 
strong performance in the review year to 
30 June 2016, with our continuing business 
progressing for the fifth consecutive year. 
The group’s underlying profit before tax from 
continuing operations grew by 7%, from  
£7.7 million to £8.3 million, and statutory profit 
before tax by 59% to £7.7 million. Our balance 
sheet was already strong as a result of this 
improving performance and, following the sale 
of Dyson Diecastings in June, included net cash 
balances of £8.6 million at the year end.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 
3.8 pence per share (2015: 3.5 pence), to give 
a total of 6.5 pence for the year. This represents 
an increase of 8% over the previous year  
(6.0 pence) and is 2.8 times covered by  
basic earnings per share of 18.2 pence.
Future development
Despite the transformation referred to above 
from diversity to greater focus, Alumasc 
remains a family of specialist businesses,  
each dedicated to satisfying specialist demands 
with specific, frequently bespoke, solutions.

Industrial Products
Strategic Focus 
Alumasc is now a strategically focused 
building products group
Building Products order book (£m)
The more we succeed, by providing outstanding 
service to discriminating customers, the more 
we can expect to win market share and grow 
our revenues. Innovation is a vital contributor  
to this process and remains high on the agenda 
of all our businesses. 
In the past, the diversity of our group may have 
provided a buffer against individual sectoral 
decline and cycles but limited opportunity for 
intra-group collaboration. The nuanced market 
focus of our continuing businesses still provides 
a degree of diversity within the sector but one 
where opportunities and best practice can 
frequently be shared. 
These two points – innovation and evolving best 
practice – give our strategy a distinctly ‘organic’ 
flavour, which we view as a strength. The 
complementary strength of our balance sheet, 
and the operational focus on margin and cash 
generation, also provides us with the wherewithal 
to supplement organic growth by acquisition. 
We will be on the lookout for such opportunities, 
where they complement the market focus that 
has been achieved in recent years.
Prospects
Alumasc ended the year to June 2016 with 
positive momentum and with rising order books, 
which have continued to grow since the year 
end to record levels, both positive indicators 
for the new financial year. A major contributor 
to the growth in order books is the success of 
Levolux in the United States, where patient 
groundwork has begun to yield tangible results. 
There are also signs of recovery in the scheduling 
of larger projects, following a quieter period 
during the past year, which will benefit the  
latter part of our new financial year and beyond.
More generally, it is still too close to the June 
referendum to predict with confidence any 
consequential change in prospects for the  
wider economy. 
We assess the impact on our business of the 
fall in Sterling to be limited at current levels 
and our businesses have not detected any 
significant change in demand for their  
products and services. 
At this moment, therefore, given the 
encouraging fundamentals outlined above, 
we continue to believe that Alumasc can 
outperform its underlying markets and that the 
group is well positioned to adapt to reality as 
necessary, with the expectation of achieving 
further progress both short and longer term.

Levolux ‘Bolt-on’ Balconies  
and Balustrading
Levolux can now provide custom,  
‘bolt-on’ fabricated steel Balconies with 
a variety of types of decking and soffit 
materials, to satisfy challenging project 
specific requirements.
To complement its ‘bolt-on’ Balconies, 
Levolux can also provide tailored 
Balustrading solutions, formed from a

including extruded aluminium, stainless 
steel, glass and timber. 
Gatic CastSlot
Gatic is committed to continuously 
innovating its patented Slotdrain products 
to ensure that they remain the preferred 
choice for our customers. This year Gatic 
has updated the successful CastSlot 
product by designing an unobtrusive 
multi-surface ductile iron inlet profile that 
allows the product to be installed neatly 
within concrete, asphalt, and block surface 
finishes. This ductile iron profile is securely 
fixed to the galvanised steel Slotdrain 
channel body and includes a pre-fitted 
integrated installation strip to prevent the 
ingress of concrete during installation.
This innovation provides an exceptionally 
robust yet discreet surface water drainage 
solution, and is an ideal choice for projects 
from car parks to heavily trafficked 
industrial units.
“We’ve worked with 
Gatic on a number of 
large projects and it’s 
a partnership. Their 
reliable, efficient  
service and 
knowledgeable team 
gives us reassurance 
that their products are 
the best solutions for 
the project in hand”
Rob Burnett
Project Manager from Winvic
“The benefit of these 
solutions is that Levolux 
can design and assemble 
the balconies and 
balustrading to meet the 
highest quality standards 
in a factory environment. 
Finished products are 
then delivered to site 
and installed by Levolux 
at the optimum time, as 
a last fix item, after the 
building envelope has 
been completed”

a Highly Commended Award courtesy  
of Registered Contractor CCG at The

The Panmure Street development in 
Glasgow demonstrates the benefits and 
versatility of utilising AVS. The key driver 
for the specification of AVS was its ability 
to replicate traditional construction design 
whilst being adaptable for the closed panel 
production line.
“The AVS can be utilised as 
an offsite manufactured 
solution that improves 
efficiency and speed  
of construction as well  
as enhancing the quality  
of finish, whilst delivering

Strategic Report 07
Alumasc Roofing’s revolutionary 
new Vtherm system provides 
insulation performance up to 
five times better than other 
commonly used insulation 
materials – with a lower overall 
system profile.
Building regulatory requirements are ever 
more stringent while economic factors and 
the need to conserve energy mean that 
energy efficiency is the highest priority. 
High performance insulation products are 
available that fulfil some, but not all, of the 
regulatory and performance requirements, 
particularly in applications where there is 
call for a thinner insulation product.
The Alumasc Vtherm Vacuum Insulated 
System has been developed to help solve 
such problems. Alumasc Vtherm can be 
utilised within an inverted or warm roof 
system, powered by the innovative Kingspan 
OPTIM-R insulation panel. This comprises rigid 
vacuum insulation panels with a microporous 
core, which is evacuated, encased and sealed 
in a thin, gas-tight envelope. The result is 
outstanding thermal conductivity in the 
thinnest possible insulation solution. 
Alumasc Rainwater’s new  
Cast Iron Spun Pipes with 
eared socket
Alumasc Rainwater has developed its cast 
iron spun pipes to include a unique integral 
eared socket. This innovative feature is a 
first in the marketplace. It improves the 
consistency of the wall thickness and the 
smoothness of the pipe internal bore.
“We’re extremely 
pleased with this latest 
development to our cast 
iron spun pipes. It puts 
us ahead of the game 
as no other spinning 
technology currently 
has this capability. For 
similar products in the 
market the socket ears 
are generally glued or 
bonded to the pipe, 
which compromises 
quality and aesthetics. 
Our new integral ear 
socket provides a  
unique solution”

Strategy
Alumasc’s strategic focus is to supply premium 
building products, systems and solutions with 
the objectives of:
1. Building strong positions in specialist niche 
markets where specifiers and end customers 
recognise the value added by our products 
and services
2. Growing group revenues on average at a 
faster rate than the UK construction market
3. Generating consistently superior financial 
returns, underpinned by strong operating 
margins and returns on investment.
All Alumasc businesses operate in niche 
segments that benefit from growing demand 
for one or more of the following:
1. The management of energy in the built 
environment
2. The management of water in the built 
environment
3. Bespoke solutions involving significant  
design input and technical expertise
4. Solutions that improve the efficiency  
and quality of the construction and 
installation process.
Alumasc leverages this strong strategic 
positioning through:
• The recruitment and development  
of talented people
• Fostering an innovative and  
entrepreneurial culture
• Dedicated management and sales focus  
for each niche market segment
• Developing synergies within the group
• The promotion of recognised and  
trusted brands
• The development of innovative products
• Expanding our geographical reach including 
internationally
• Prioritised investment: both in human and 
capital resources to support further growth  
in the business.
The above is illustrated in more detail in our 
business model on pages 14 and 15, and in the 
data illustrating our performance over the last 
five years on page 16, which demonstrates our 
track record of outperformance relative to the  
UK construction sector.
Overview of performance
Alumasc achieved its strategic ambition to 
become a focused supplier of niche building 
products at the end of the 2015/16 financial 
year, when the group sold its last remaining 
engineering products business, Dyson 
Diecastings.
Continuing operations
I am pleased to report Alumasc’s fifth successive 
year of profit and earnings growth. The results 
for the year from continuing building products 
operations were the second best on record:
• Group revenues increased by 2%  
to £92.2 million
• Underlying operating profit increased  
by 2% to £8.5 million
• We invested an incremental £1.2 million 
during the year mainly in additional sales 
resources to support the continued future 
growth in the business, the costs of which 
were absorbed within our operating profit  
for the year
• Underlying profit before tax grew by 7% to 
£8.3 million, benefiting from the increase in 
operating profit and lower interest costs on 
borrowings due to lower average levels of 
net debt during the year
• Underlying earnings per share grew by  
9% to 18.4 pence.

Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report
Levolux’s trading performance was ahead of 
expectations set at the beginning of the year, 
reporting higher revenues and profits than in 
the prior year. This was despite there being only 
one project of above £1 million revenue being 
completed in its entirety during the financial year. 
More importantly, Levolux had an excellent year 
in broadening the market reach of the business 
including exports to North America, and also 
new products in the UK. This was reflected in 
closing order books at 30 June 2016 of £18.9 
million, a substantial increase of 21% on the 
position at the beginning of the financial year. 
Chief Executive’s Review 
in new capacity for Alumasc Water Management 
Solutions and Timloc, described further below, to 
fully realise this potential.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 3.8 pence per share (2014/15: 3.5 pence), 
taking the total dividend for the year to 6.5 
pence (2014/15: 6.0 pence), an increase of 8%.
The dividend will be paid, subject to 
shareholder approval at the AGM to be held 
on 27 October 2016, on 1 November to 
shareholders on the register on 7 October. 
Operational review
Health & safety
Alumasc’s priority is to provide a safe place 
for our employees to work. The group further 
improved its safety performance in the year and 
recorded its second best safety performance 
rate on record. Details are given in the 
Corporate & Social Responsibility report  
on pages 24 and 25. 
The quality of the group’ s earnings in the 2015/16 
financial year was high for a number of reasons:
• The majority of our businesses improved  
their profit in the year, with profitability  
far more evenly balanced throughout the 
group than has been the case in prior years, 
see chart 1 opposite.
• The impact of large projects on group revenues 
and on group results was far less than it 
has been in recent years. We estimate that 
revenues from day to day business, excluding 
the impact of projects worth £1 million or 
more, increased by 9% in the year. This was 
a far stronger performance than the headline 
figures suggest, see chart 2 opposite.
• Conversion of profit into operating cash flow 
was strong, with operating cash flow of £11.2 
million in excess of earnings before interest,  
tax, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’)  
of £9.7 million, see chart 3 opposite. 
Discontinued operations
Profit before tax from discontinued operations 
was £0.9 million, mainly arising from the gain 
on sale of the Dyson Diecastings business, which 
had traded at just above break-even levels for 
the year prior to its sale.
Statutory profit and earnings per share
Statutory profit before tax grew by 59% to £7.7 
million, benefiting from the growth in underlying 
profit, the £0.9 million profit from the sale of 
Dyson Diecastings and non-repeat of operating 
losses from the engineering products business 
sold towards the end of the prior year.
Basic earnings per share of 18.2 pence were 
48% ahead of the prior year’s 12.3 pence  
per share.
Outlook
The group’s positive momentum and rising 
order books, together with signs of recovery in 
the scheduling of larger construction projects 
referred to in the Chairman’s Statement, are 
encouraging signs for this financial year. The 
timing of the larger projects in the current order 
book suggests there could be a second half bias 
to this financial year’s performance.
More broadly, we believe all our businesses 
have significant medium and longer term 
growth opportunities because of their strategic 
positioning in growing market niches and 
international potential. 
As Alumasc’s building products business 
approaches record ever levels of revenue and 
profit, it will require continued investment in 
human resources, together with investment

Strategic Report 11
Around a third of Levolux’s 30 June 2016 
order book is for export sales to North America 
and we expect this to be reflected in the 
sales mix later in the 2016/17 financial year. 
This is testament to the significant business 
development effort of recent years where 
Levolux has now established strong positions 
for the provision of premium and unique 
shading and screening solutions in a number  
of key regions in North America. Levolux plans 
to build on this success by adding two further 
vice presidents of sales in North America in  
the current financial year. 
When Alumasc acquired Levolux in 2007 
it was principally a UK solar shading and 
internal blinds business with the potential 
to expand its product range both in the UK 
and internationally. Ten years later it has been 
transformed into a business with a strong 
presence in both the UK and North America 
and that now provides: 
• Bespoke architectural solutions for architects 
and building owners encompassing innovative 
external façade and internal features
• Innovative screening solutions for otherwise 
architecturally uninteresting buildings such  
as power plants and car parks
• Bespoke balcony solutions, including off-site 
construction options, to prestige residential 
developments
• Unique solar shading solutions that, where 
specified, can include electronic automation 
and photovoltaics, enabling architects and 
building owners to manage and reduce 
energy use in buildings
• Bespoke internal blind solutions to reduce 
glare and improve the comfort of building 
occupants. 
This business segment performed strongly  
and remained the most profitable in the group, 
albeit with a marginally lower outturn for the 
year due to:
The new BREEAM ‘excellent’ 
rated Manchester Cancer 
Research Centre (MCRC) 
building, harnesses the latest 
building technology, including 
a custom solar shading and 
screening solution from Levolux.
Supporting sustainable 
construction
BREEAM (BRE Environmental 
Assessment Method) and 
LEED (Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design), 
are established, internationally 
recognised green building 
certification systems. The 
certifications promote sustainable 
building and development 
practices that exceed minimum 
environmental regulations  
and standards.
Both systems provide an assessment platform 
for a broad range of building categories at 
particular stages in their lifecycle with values 
assigned to factors such as design impact, 
carbon emissions, durability, resilience, 
biodiversity protection and ecological value.
By focusing on these key areas, architects and 
developers are able to identify those products 
with true environmental credentials, enabling 
the realisation of innovative, next generation 
buildings that make effective use of all 
resources and enhance the wellbeing of  
those who live and work within them.
Levolux’s shading systems and Alumasc’s 
aluminium and cast iron rainwater goods, 
civil drainage, fascia and soffit systems are 
examples of products that, due to their 
recyclability, low-carbon manufacture and 
responsible sourcing, can make a strong 
contribution to achieving high BREEAM and 
LEED ratings. Promotion of these ecologically-
balanced solutions bring benefits to the 
specification process, helping achieve the 
desired effect of minimising the environmental 
impact of the construction process.

• Lower revenues and profits from the large 
£12 million Kitimat smelter refurbishment 
project, which was already substantially 
complete in the 2014/15 year, with only  
the final account settled in the 2015/16 
financial year
• Lower activity levels in England and Wales for 
exterior wall insulation following government 
funding cuts to the Eco and Green Deal 
schemes for social housing refurbishment work.
Our roofing business started the year more 
slowly than expected with delays caused by 
market-wide shortages of installation labour. 
However it recovered to have a much stronger 
second half of the year, with the core business 
reporting its best performance on record for the 
year as a whole and strong trading momentum 
in both new build and refurbishment markets 
carrying through into the new financial year. 
Further significant investment was made in high 
quality technical sales resources during the year, 
and the larger sales team is broadening the 
geographic reach of the business within the UK 
and is attracting higher levels of specifications 
for our products and solutions.
Alumasc Roofing is benefiting from the  
much wider product range introduced over  
the last few years, including the integration 
of the Blackdown green roofing and Roof-
Pro roofing services businesses into the core 
waterproofing business. This has been combined 
with a comprehensive service offer including 
the Alumasc Promise. This enables us to offer 
specifiers, main contractors and building owners 
high quality solutions that provide longevity and 
lower the life cycle costs of the roof, assist in 
the management of energy and water and help 
provide a safe roof environment.

Investment has been made in additional sales 
and management resources during the year 
and a new business system was successfully 
launched in October. These provide the 
firm foundations needed to further grow 
the business and enhance its reputation for 
excellent customer service.
Timloc leveraged revenue growth with further 
purchasing, manufacturing and warehousing 
efficiencies in the year, supported by investment 
in new plant and equipment, allowing the 
business to earn improved operating margins.  
A lease on a new expanded facility was signed 
in July 2016 to support plans to further grow 
the business. The new facility is planned to  
be available for occupation in late 2017.

AWMS further developed its strategy to provide 
a comprehensive water management within 
the built environment offer to the marketplace, 
including the ‘Rain to Drain’ concept illustrated 
opposite, and is actively working with specifiers 
and industry bodies to help evolve our business 
to meet growing demand in this area. 
It remains the intention to relocate the AWMS 
business to a new facility in the Kettering area 
at capital cost of circa £10 million in the next 
two to three years, as this business approaches 
physical capacity.
The Gatic engineered access covers business 
had a solid year, but unusually and for no other 
reason than timing, did not benefit from any 
large £1 million or more revenue projects in 
2015/16 and therefore was unable to match the 
prior year’s financial performance. Encouragingly, 
there are now a number of large projects both in 
the order book and in the pipeline beyond that, 
mainly for export markets. 
Timloc Building Products goes from strength 
to strength, reporting another record year and 
continuing to out-perform a buoyant UK house 
building products sector through the addition 
of new products to its range and expansion  
of it its geographic reach within the UK.  
This business has close to trebled its operating 
profit since acquisition by Alumasc in 2004.
The first products in the new ‘Above the 
Roofline’ range were successfully launched in 
the second half of the year and the remainder 
of the products in this range will be rolled out 
in the coming months.
Our walling business had a transitional year 
as we invested in new sales resources and 
new products to build our positions in new 
build markets to offset the cuts to funded 
refurbishment work in England and Wales. 
The new build business began to gain traction 
towards the end of the financial year, with 
encouraging initial sales of the recently 
introduced Alumasc Base Coat Render and the 
Alumasc Ventilated System. The latter offers 
off-site construction options. We have also had 
interest from new export markets in the Middle 
East and initial sales were made in summer 
2016. The exterior wall insulation refurbishment 
business in Scotland remains very strong, 
supported by ongoing funding under the 
Scottish government’s HEEPS and forthcoming 
SEEPS schemes. 
The Alumasc Water Management Solutions 
(‘AWMS’) brand launched a year ago, which 
brought together in a holistic way our approach 
to the market for the Alumasc Rainwater, Harmer 
building drainage and Gatic civil drainage product 
ranges, was well received by customers and 
helped to drive a strong performance throughout 
most of the financial year. The new Gatic Filcoten 
and Harmer SML drainage products introduced a 
year ago, together with the new generation Gatic 
Slotdrain range introduced during the year each 
bedded in well.
The business was impacted by slowing UK 
economic growth rates towards the end of 
the financial year, including uncertainty ahead 
of the UK’s Referendum on membership of 
the European Union, where some investment 
decisions in the UK relating to new infrastructure 
and industrial projects were delayed affecting 
order intake and sales for Gatic Slotdrain 
in particular. We also began to see upward 
pressure on galvanised steel costs towards the 
end of the financial year as part of an apparent 
over-correction to recent global over supply, 
and this is expected to impact Gatic Slotdrain 
margins in at least the first part of the new 
financial year.

From Rain to Drain, 
Alumasc is leading  
the way
The challenge
Planning constraints on a new, larger lecture 
theatre for the University of Bristol meant 
that a new and innovative approach was 
needed to provide a cost effective solution. 
Planning stipulations were that there should 
be no increase in the amount of excess water 
that was discharged into the existing drain 
infrastructure.
The solution
Alumasc’s pioneering BluRoof waterproofing 
system was used, making this the first 
ever BluRoof installation in the UK. 
Alumasc’s BluRoof is a new concept in 
water management, offering the combined 
400m

of the innovative BluRoof system 
was installed on this University of 
Bristol Lecture Theatre.
expertise of Alumasc Roofing Systems and 
Harmer Engineered Drainage Systems in order 
to manage the rate of water discharge from 
the roof. As part of the project, 400m
2
 of 
the innovative BluRoof system was installed, 
along with a Blackdown fully bio-diverse 
Green Roof system also from Alumasc.
The combination of Alumasc’s BluRoof and 
Blackdown Green Roof systems meant that 
the retention of storm water in the green 
roof’s build-up – i.e. the plants, substrate 
and drainage/reservoir layer – complemented 
the detention of storm water by the 
BluRoof, thus releasing valuable additional 
downstream drainage capacity and avoiding 
the need for additional attenuation tanks in 
Bristol City Centre.
From Rain to Drain
Alumasc businesses work together 
to provide a comprehensive water 
management solution within  
the built environment. 
Our ‘Rain to Drain’ concept  
illustrates how our systems manage 
water originating both outside and 
within a building, through to its 
discharge into water courses,  
sewers or the ground.

Taxation
The group’s underlying tax rate reduced from 
22.0% in 2014/15 to 20.8% in 2015/16, 
broadly in line with the reduction in the UK 
statutory rate. 
The group’s overall tax rate increased from 
9.2% in 2014/15 to 15.6% in 2015/16 
mainly due to the year on year reduction in 
non-taxable profits from business and related 
property disposals.
Cash flow and year end cash position
The group’s cash flow performance for the  
year is summarised in the table opposite. This 
was another strong year for cash generation  
in Alumasc, with:
• Net operating cash flow from continuing 
activities of £11.2 million (2014/15 £9.3 
million), benefiting from EBITDA of £9.7 million 
and a strong working capital performance. 
Rolling average trade working capital as a 
percentage of sales for the year improved to 
11.3% from 11.6% a year ago and some 
£1.8 million of cash was received in excess 
of profit recognised during the year on larger 
construction contracts, reflecting the timing  
of milestone payments under those contracts
• Relatively modest capital investment of £1.1 
million, broadly similar to the depreciation 
and amortisation charge for the year and the 
capital spend in the prior year. Investments 
were made principally in replacement plant 
and machinery, additional machinery to 
expand capacity at Timloc, and in new 
business systems at Levolux and Timloc
• Cash contributions to legacy defined 
benefit pension schemes were £2.9 million, 
unchanged on the prior year
• The net cash inflow for the year from 
continuing operations was £3.2 million,  
prior to the business disposal proceeds  
and trading cash flows of £4.5 million  
from Dyson Diecastings in the year
• A total cash inflow for the year of £7.7 
million, including the Dyson Diecastings  
cash flows.
Alumasc’s net cash resources at 30 June 2016 
were therefore £8.6 million, an increase of £7.7 
million on the 30 June 2015 net cash position 
of £0.9 million. 
In the last five years Alumasc has generated 
£19.3 million of net cash, transforming a net debt 
position of £10.7 million at 30 June 2011 into a 
net cash position of £8.6 million at 30 June 2016.

The Alumasc Group plc
Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report
Our strategy to focus the group on building 
products activities has benefited both the 
group’s operating margin and returns on 
investment over recent years as lower margin 
and higher capital intensity engineering 
products businesses have been sold whilst the 
ongoing building products business, which 
generates higher operating margins at lower 
capital intensity, has expanded. 
Post tax return on investment from continuing 
operations was 24.3% in the 2015/16 financial 
year, substantially above the group’s weighted 
average cost of capital.
Alumasc has a strong balance sheet. This will be 
used (together with the bank facilities described 
below as needed) to finance the anticipated 
further organic growth of the group and 
complementary acquisitions should the right 
opportunities arise at the right price. 
Banking facilities
Alumasc’s banking facilities comprise:
• An unsecured committed five year revolving 
credit facility of £12.5 million, expiring in  
August 2020
• The ability to extend this facility to  
£30 million, subject to further credit  
approval by relationship banks
• Overdraft facilities, repayable on demand,  
of £2 million. 
Going concern and viability
In view of the current and anticipated trading 
position of the group, its strong balance 
sheet including substantial cash resources and 
the unutilised committed banking facilities 
described above, and based on information 
available to it as at the date of this report, 
the Board does not foresee issues with regard 
to going concern status of the group or its 
viability during the three year period for which 
it prepares financial plans. Please see the 
going concern assessment on page 55 and the 
viability statement on page 21 for further detail.
Pensions
The Pension Trustees are in the process of 
finalising the triennial valuation of Alumasc’s 
legacy defined benefit pension liabilities as at 
31 March 2016. The draft valuation shows 
a deficit of £33 million, which equates to a 
funding level of 73%. The deficit is unchanged 
on the position three years ago, with the 
impact in the intervening period of falling gilt 
yields that are used to value pension liabilities 
offset by lower long term inflation expectations, 
mortality experience, transfers out of the 
scheme and investment performance.
The impact of the 2016 triennial valuation  
on recovery plan payments to be made by  
the company is still under discussion with  
the Pension Trustees. In view of the improved 
profitability of the group in the period since the 
2013 actuarial review, it is likely that company 
contributions will increase, albeit by a relatively 
modest amount.
The valuation of Alumasc’s pensions deficit for 
accounting purposes, using IAS 19 valuation 
conventions, which are less stringent than those 
used in the formal triennial review, resulted in 
an increase in the deficit to £22.7 million at 
30 June 2016, compared with £20.9 million 
at 30 June 2015. The increase is largely due to 
a reduction in the corporate bond yield used 
to value gross pension liabilities, particularly in 
the final quarter of the 2015/16 financial year, 
including the initial impact on bond yields of 
the UK referendum decision on 23 June 2016. 
Balance sheet and capital structure
The group’s net assets and shareholders’ funds 
increased from £15.9 million at the beginning 
of the financial year to £16.6 million at 30 
June 2016 as retained profits for the year were 
partially offset by pension scheme actuarial 
losses as described above.
The group defines its capital invested as the 
sum of shareholders’ funds, plus the pension 
deficit (net of the related deferred tax asset), 
less net cash resources. On this basis capital 
invested reduced from £31.8 million at the  
end of the prior year to £26.5 million at  
30 June 2016, largely reflecting the sale  
of Dyson Diecastings for net proceeds  
of £4.0 million at the year end.
Business risk, internal control and systems
The group continues to improve its risk 
management and control processes. Risk 
management is embedded in the way we work 
across the group and in addition to the formal 
annual review process, it is considered wherever 
appropriate in monthly Board meetings at both 
operating business and group levels. Internal 
audits carried out by group finance concentrate 
on compliance with internal financial controls 
across Alumasc, and are increasingly focused  
on higher risk and judgmental areas. 
Two new business systems were implemented 
during the year at Timloc and Levolux and 
substantial enhancements to the AWMS  
system are planned in 2017. At the end of 
the 2016/17 financial year, almost all of the 
Alumasc group will be supported by Microsoft 
Dynamics business systems.

Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 
revision of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the viability 
of the group over a three year period, as this 
is consistent with Alumasc’s formal three year 
financial planning process. 
The three-year financial plan comprises the 
group’s expected income statement and cash 
flow performance; its maximum expected and 
period end net cash/debt positions relative 
to committed financing facilities; its forecast 
financial position; and other key financial ratios. 
The Board has performed a robust assessment 
including sensitivity analyses on the base 
case plan by flexing a number of the main 
assumptions including those set out below, 
both individually and in combination, to 
illustrate the impact of potential downside risks 
that could affect the financial viability of the 
group. The more significant sensitivities include:
• The group’s ability to adapt to changes  
in revenue expectations caused by cyclical  
or adverse changes in the macroeconomic 
and UK construction market environments  
in which it operates; 
• A material erosion of operating margins; and
• The potential impact of Brexit-related 
uncertainties, particularly on changes  
in revenue expectations and the impact  
of foreign exchange rates on the group’s  
cost base.
In making this statement, the Directors have 
also given specific consideration to the principal 
risks faced by the group as described on pages 
22 to 23.
Whilst this review does not consider all of the 
risks that the group may face and it is recognised 
that the level of uncertainty with regard to a 
three year planning horizon increases over time, 
the Directors consider that their assessment of 
the group’s prospects is reasonable in current 
circumstances, having regard to the level of 
inherent uncertainty involved.
Based on the analysis performed for the 
three-year review period, the group’s net cash 
position of £8.6 million at 30 June 2016 and 
the group’s committed financing facilities of 
£12.5 million which do not expire until August 
2020, the Directors confirm that they have 
a reasonable expectation that the group will 
be able to continue in operation and be able 
to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period to 30 June 2019. 22

Strategic Report
Risks and uncertainties Mitigating actions taken
Economic, construction market 
and foreign exchange risks 
Comment 
Alumasc is a UK-based group 
of businesses with the majority 
of group sales made to the 
construction sector in the UK,  
which can be cyclical in nature. 
The UK’s ‘Brexit‘ vote adds  
to economic uncertainty at the  
current time.
• Strategic positioning in markets/sectors anticipated to grow faster than the UK construction market with 
potential for growth through the cycle.
• Develop international sales (particularly in North America, the Middle East and Far East).
• Increasing sales to the more resilient building refurbishment (relative to new build) markets.
• Increasing mix of UK sales towards the stronger London & South East regional markets. 
• Development of added value systems and solutions that are either required by building regulation  
and/or specified by architects and engineers.
• Develop and retain strong management teams.
• Ensure Alumasc products are market leading and differentiated against the competition to improve 
specification and to protect margin. 
• Management has developed contingency plans to mitigate risks arising from Brexit uncertainty, including 
the further development of international markets in view of the recent depreciation of Sterling.
• The group has some exposure to currency risk, particularly the Euro, following Sterling’s recent 
devaluation. This is being mitigated by purchasing efficiencies, some selling price increases and  
currency hedging.
Loss of key employees
Comment
Generally staff turnover is low.
• Market competitive remuneration and incentive arrangements.
• Changes in numbers of people employed monitored in monthly subsidiary board meetings.
• Key and high potential employees identified and monitored on a local and group basis.
• Focused training and development programmes for high potential and key people.
• Exit interviews held for senior people who leave the business, with learning points shared.
Product/service differentiation 
relative to competition not 
developed or maintained 
Comment
Innovation and an entrepreneurial 
spirit is encouraged in all group 
companies. Some 20% of sales are 
earned from products launched  
in the last three years.
• Devolved operating model with both group and local management responsible for identifying opportunities 
and emerging niche market trends.
• Group-wide innovation best practice days are held annually.
• Innovation and new product development workshops held regularly in most group companies.
• Annual group strategic planning meetings encourage innovation and ‘blue sky’ thinking, with group 
resources allocated and prioritised as appropriate to support approved ideas.
Risk of loss of customers
Comment 
Generally good track record of 
customer retention. The group has 
a diversified customer base with the 
largest customer representing only 
circa 2% of group revenues.
• Develop and maintain strong relationships through regular contact and seeking always to provide superior 
products, systems, solutions and service.
• Good project tracking and enquiry/quote conversion rate tracking.
• Increasing use of, and investment in, customer relationship management (CRM) software.
• Organisational and cultural flexibility to adapt to changing and emerging customer needs.
Pension obligations
Comment
Alumasc’s pension obligations 
are material relative to its market 
capitalisation and net asset value.
• Continue to grow the business so the relative affordability of pension contributions is improved over time.
• Maintain a good, constructive and open relationship with Pension Trustees.
• Meet agreed pension funding commitments.
• Pension scheme management is a regular group board agenda item.
• Use of specialist advisors on actuarial, investment and advisory matters.
• Monitor and seek market opportunities to reduce gross pension liabilities, through, for example, transfers 
or partial buy outs.
Product warranty/recall risks
Comment 
The group has a good track 
record with regard to the 
management of these risks and 
does not have a history  
of significant claims.
• Robust internal quality systems, compliance with relevant industry standards (eg ISO, BBA etc) and close 
co-operation with customers in their design and specification of the group’s products.
• Group insurance programme to cover larger potential risks and exposures, where applicable.
• Back to back warranties from suppliers, where appropriate.
• Seek to manage contractual liabilities to ensure potential consequential losses are minimised and 
proportionate, and overall liabilities are capped, where possible.
• Specific local risk management procedures in group brands that also install (as well as supply) building 
products (i.e. Levolux and Blackdown).
• Internal audits of quality and supply chain and design procedures targeted at higher risk areas, particularly 
Solar Shading and Roofing.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties The Alumasc Group plc
Report and Accounts 2016
Governance
Financial Statements
Strategic Report 23
Risks and uncertainties Mitigating actions taken
Reliance on key suppliers
Comment 
Whilst the group does not have 
undue concentration on any single 
or small group of suppliers, certain 
Alumasc businesses do have key 
strategic suppliers, some of whom 
are located in the Far East.
• Annual reviews of supplier concentration as part of strategic planning/formal business risk review process, 
with alternative suppliers sought and developed where practicable.
• Regular key supplier visits, good relationships maintained and quality control checks/training carried out.
• Regular reviews as to whether work should be brought back to the UK (or elsewhere) as economic 
conditions evolve, including the impact of foreign exchange rate movements.
Business continuity risks
Comment
The group has not previously 
experienced any significant loss 
of operational capability causing 
business continuity issues. Whilst 
the likelihood of a catastrophic 
loss is low, the impact if it 
were to happen could be high. 
Particular areas of focus this year 
with regard to risk mitigation 
have been cyber security and 
resilience of energy supplies.
• Business continuity plans prepared at each business, having regard to specific risk factors.
• Advice is being taken from insurers on continuous improvement of these plans.
• IT disaster recovery plans are in place, with close to real time back up arrangements using either off-site 
servers or cloud technology.
• Cyber security reviews carried out at group level and in all operating companies during the year. 
• Reviews of energy supply and contingency arrangements reviewed during the year, with back up supplies 
in place as needed. 
• Critical plant and equipment is identified, with associated breakdown/recovery plans, including assessment 
of engineering spares held on site.
Strategic development risks 
and change projects 
Comment 
There are execution risks around 
a number of current strategic 
change projects, including new 
product launches,the relocation 
of Timloc to a new property in 
2017 and various ERP and CRM 
system implementations.
• Key strategic change projects are governed by Steering Committees sponsored by the managing 
director of the business, with group executive director involvement, supported by independent specialist 
consultants where necessary (for example IT and property).
• Project risk reviews conducted and updated regularly.
• Project plans established and monitored monthly.
• Project boards established. The project manager reports to the Steering Committee.
• Use of proven, reliable software solutions and avoidance of bespoking wherever possible.
• Careful documentation and challenge of legacy business processes prior to implementation of new systems.
• Pre-implementation testing, training and communication, with go-live delayed if implementation risk  
is judged to be too high.
Health and safety risks 
Comment 
The group has a strong overall 
track record of health & safety 
performance, with the number 
of lost time accidents significantly 
reduced over the last 10 years.
• Health and safety is the number one priority of management and the first agenda item on all subsidiary 
and group board agendas.
• Risk assessments are carried out and safe systems of work documented and communicated.
• All safety incidents and significant near misses reported to board level monthly. Appropriate remedial 
action taken.
• Group health & safety best practice days are held twice a year, chaired by the Chief Executive.
• Annual audit of health and safety in all group businesses by independent consultants.
• Specific focus on improving health and safety for higher risk operations.
Credit risk 
Comment 
The group has a generally good 
record in managing credit risks. 
Risks can be higher amongst 
smaller building contractor 
customers, who are often 
installers of the group’s products.
• Most credit risks are insured. 
• Large export contracts are backed by letters of credit, performance bonds, guarantees or similar.
• Any risks taken above insured limits in the Building Products division are subject to strict delegated 
authority limit sign offs, including group executives’ sign off for uninsured risks above £50k.
• Credit checks when accepting new customers/prior to accepting new work.
• The group employs experienced credit controllers, and aged debt reports are reviewed in monthly  
Board meetings. 24
The Alumasc Group plc
Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report
Health and safety 
The Alumasc Group plc places the highest 
priority on health and safety matters and seeks 
to achieve high standards for the well-being of 
its employees. There is a clear group policy to 
this effect and it remains the first agenda item 
for all subsidiary and group board meetings. 
Achieving an embedded health and safety 
culture and the reduction of accident risk  
is the responsibility of management and 
employees alike.
The majority of Directors and many senior 
managers within the group have been 
trained to Institution of Occupational Safety 
and Health (IOSH) accreditation standard 
with others trained and certified to National 
Examination Board in Occupational Safety 
and Health (NEBOSH) standards. The group 
holds regular health and safety best practice 
days. In addition, each operating business 
has local health and safety committees that 
meet regularly and are subject to an annual 
health and safety audit, carried out by external 
consultants, with consequential action plans 
being monitored in board meetings. 
Further progress has been made during the  
year in ensuring our strong health and safety 
ethos is fully embedded throughout the  
group. Our principal health and safety KPI,  
the performance rate index (a relative measure 
capturing the total number of lost time and 
other safety incidents, relating the result to the 
overall number of hours worked), improved to 
3.1 from 3.8 in the previous year. This reflected 
a reduction in both the number and severity 
of incidents, particularly in the higher risk 
engineering business, Dyson Diecastings, which 
was sold on 30 June 2016. The improvement 
in health and safety performance over the 
last year is consistent with the longer term 
trend, resulting from prioritisation, focus and 
continuous improvement actions taken by both 
management and employees over many years. 
Following prior initiatives of strengthening risk 
assessments, safe systems of work and training 
in those areas of our businesses judged to 
be those capable of causing the most serious 
incidents, work continues to ensure that 
improvements are continually made.
Employee matters
The group is an equal opportunities employer 
and its policies for recruitment, training, career 
development and promotion are based on 
the aptitude and abilities of the individual 
regardless of religion, gender and sexual 
orientation. An analysis of our employees  
by gender at 30 June 2016 appears above.
Those who are disabled are given equal 
treatment with the able-bodied. Should 
employees become disabled after joining  
the company, every effort is made to ensure 
that employment continues and appropriate  
training is given.
Employees are kept informed of changes in the 
business and general financial and economic 
factors influencing the group, this is done 
through briefing sessions and presentations. 
The group values the views of its employees 
and consults with them on a regular basis 
about matters that may affect them.
Environmental and sustainability matters
Alumasc is cognisant of the impact its business 
operations may have on the environment, and 
where practical, we seek ways of working to 
improve our environmental footprint. Each 
operational business is also subject to an annual 
independent Environmental Compliance audit. 
Our strategy of focussing on building products 
activities and divesting our engineering and 
industrial products businesses over recent years 
has significantly reduced the impact of the 
group’s operations on the environment.
The Board is committed to applying best practice 
environmental standards throughout the 
business. This is achieved through a variety of 
methods, including product process development, 
promoting use of recycled materials, waste 
minimisation, energy efficiency and reducing  
the emissions from company vehicles.
Many of our building products businesses 
are strongly focused on providing effective 
solutions to enhance sustainability in the built 
environment. The group has established leading 
positions in water management, through 
brands such as Alumasc Water Management 
Solutions, Alumasc Roofing and Gatic; and 
energy management through Levolux and 
Alumasc Façades. We are committed to 
complementing this leadership by adopting 
environmentally sound business practices 
throughout our operations. 
The wider group is well positioned to benefit 
from environmentally-driven changes in policy 
and regulation. In particular, the growing 
awareness of sustainability and life-cycle cost 
amongst building and construction specifiers 
should benefit those group businesses that 
assist their customers to manage energy and 
water use in the built environment.
Subscription to the BREEAM (BRE Environmental 
Assessment Method) Points System and LEED 
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design) (see page 11), allows a specifying 
architect or engineer to differentiate between 
those products with true sustainable credentials 
and those not achieving the benchmark, 
enabling the realisation of innovative, next 
generation buildings that make effective use of 
all resources, for example the Alumasc BluRoof 
system (see page 13).  
Corporate and Social Responsibility
Committed to Sustainability 
Many of our building products businesses are strongly focused  
on providing effective solutions to enhance sustainability in the  
built environment. The group has established leading positions in 
energy and water management, through brands such as Alumasc, 
Levolux, Harmer, Gatic and Blackdown.

Strategic Report 25
Indicative ratings for building materials given 
in the BRE Green Guide to Specification (‘BRE 
Guide’) also allows designers to choose those 
products or construction methods that will be 
most beneficial to reducing carbon emissions, 
protecting biodiversity and that are the most 
ecological. Alumasc roofing systems, for 
example, score highly in BREEAM ratings – 
notably for responsible sourcing of materials. 
They also contribute to a very good generic 
rating in the BRE Guide, capable of an A+ 
rating when installed on timber or metal decks. 
Our programme of environmental audits, carried 
out and certified by external consultants, has 
continued through the year. These audits are 
designed not only to highlight areas in which 
we can improve, but also to form a basis 
for our achieving ISO14001 Environmental 
Management accreditation in a number  
of our businesses. 
The group has an ongoing programme to 
monitor progress of a number of criteria 
against which improvements in environmental 
performance can be measured in operating 
businesses. This programme has delivered 
continuous year-on-year improvements  
against measures from the use of recycled 
paper to energy usage and efficiency. 
As new environmental regulations come into 
force, the group takes active steps to comply. 
We continue to ensure compliance with the 
REACH Regulations on the manufacture and 
import of chemicals in the EU.
All operational sites segregate their process  
waste to allow direct recovery and recycling.  
Our obligations to recover and recycle  
packaging waste are discharged by  
membership of an independent  
compliance scheme operated by Valpak. 
Carbon Management & Greenhouse gas 
(‘GHG’) emissions
The group continues to work with Carbon 
Footprint Limited, the carbon and sustainability 
management specialists, as part of our 
initiatives to improve our environmental  
and sustainability credentials. 
The group’s strategy of becoming a focused 
supplier of premium building products, 
culminating in the sale of Dyson Diecastings, 
has enabled the group to reduce its overall CO
2
 
emissions by nearly 80% over the last two years 
to 3,225 tonnes from continuing operations in 
2015/16 from 15,245 tonnes in 2013/14, see 
the graph above.
Whilst the majority of our reduction in CO
2
 
emissions have resulted from the sale of our 
engineering businesses, our building products 
businesses also saw a prior year reduction in 
emissions by 3.6%, or 5.3% when adjusted for 
revenue growth in 2015/16. This demonstrates 
the effect of continuing process efficiencies on 
group emissions as a whole. The full statutory 
report on greenhouse gas emissions can be 
found in the Directors’ Report on page 45.
Community
In addition to the wider community benefits 
arising from our environmental programme, 
the group is committed to supporting 
local community initiatives and a number 
of charitable donations have been made 
throughout the year by our subsidiaries 
including to schools, youth charities and health 
and armed forces charities. Donations in the 
year amounted to £1,983 (2015: £2,438).
Human Rights
Alumasc has long had a culture of seeking to 
treat people fairly and of being honest and 
straightforward in its business relationships. 
As Alumasc comprises a number of relatively 
small businesses operating from the UK and 
exporting to mainly developed countries, the 
Board does not consider it necessary to have  
a formal human rights policy. 
The group does have policies on the related 
topics of equal employment rights and 
communication with employees as highlighted 
earlier in this report. It also has the following 
policies in place all of which can be found on 
the company’s website (www.alumasc.co.uk):
• Business Ethics policy
• Anti-Bribery and Corruption policy
• Whistleblowing policy.
Modern Slavery Act 2015
Following the enactment of the Modern Slavery 
Act 2015, Alumasc has introduced a new 
Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy. 
The Alumasc Group plc has a zero-tolerance 
approach to modern slavery and is committed 
to act ethically and comply with all laws and 
regulations, which are relevant to the group's 
businesses and in all countries where the group 
operates. The group expects its suppliers to 
hold their own suppliers to the same high 
standards.
We also work with Carbon 
Footprint Ltd, the carbon and 
sustainability management 
specialists, to help us to seek  
to reduce emissions over time.

How we govern the group
There is a commitment to high standards of corporate governance 
throughout the group. The Board endorses the general principles set 
out in The UK Corporate Governance Code September 2014 (‘The 
Code’) (which is available on www.frc.org.uk) and is accountable  
to the group’s shareholders for good governance.
Board
The Board is responsible for the  
overall governance of the group.  
Its responsibilities include setting the 
strategic direction of the group, providing 
leadership to put the strategy into action 
and to supervise the management of the 
business. 
The Nomination Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the 
size, structure and composition 
of the Board, including 
the consideration of skills, 
knowledge and experience 
of the Board members. It also 
manages succession planning 
and selects potential new Board 
candidates when appropriate.
The Audit Committee is 
responsible for monitoring and 
reviewing the integrity of the 
financial reporting process, 
including the appropriateness  
of any judgments and estimates 
taken in preparing the financial 
statements; internal and external 
audit functions; and internal 
financial control.
The Remuneration Committee 
is responsible for determining 
the remuneration policy and 
the application of the policy 
in relation to the Chairman’s 
and Executive Directors’ 
remuneration. The remuneration 
of the Non-Executive Directors 
is determined by the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors.

Statement of compliance
During the year ended 30 June 2016 the group has complied with the requirements of The Code save for the following:
Three of the Board’s Non-Executive Directors, Jon Pither, Philip Gwyn and Richard Saville, have been members of the Board for more than the 
recommended nine years. The Board has reviewed the role of each of these Directors and concluded that each is independent in character and free 
from any relationship that could affect exercise of their independent judgement. It is felt that their knowledge and understanding are fundamental 
to the Board’s deliberations and each Director has other significant commercial commitments. Following the resignation of John Pilkington in 
September 2015 the group now has one independent (as defined by provision B.1.1. of The Code) Non-Executive Director, David Armfield. Since 
4 September 2015 the company has therefore not been compliant with The Code provisions B.1.2., B.2.1., C.3.1. and D.2.1., having only one 
independent Non-Executive Director.
Directors
At the beginning of the year, the Board consisted of a Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and five Non-Executive Directors.  
John Pilkington, a Non-Executive Director, retired from the Board on 3 September 2015, leaving four Non-Executive Directors. Jon Pither is the  
Senior Independent Director.
In accordance with the articles of association, any Director appointed during the year by the Directors is required to retire and seek election by 
shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) following their appointment. Additionally, one-third of the Directors retire by rotation each 
year and seek re-election at the AGM. The Directors required to retire are those in office longest since their previous re-election. Accordingly, John 
McCall and Paul Hooper retire by rotation at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. In addition, Jon Pither, Philip 
Gwyn and Richard Saville, having served on the Board for more than nine years, also retire and offer themselves for re-election. The unexpired term 
of their service contracts can be found in the Remuneration Policy overview on page 44.
No individual or group of individuals dominate the Board’s decision-making. 
Profiles of the Board members appear on pages 26 and 27 of this report. These indicate the high level and range of business experience which 
enables the group to be managed effectively. 
The Board meets at least seven times a year and more frequently where business needs require. Two of these meetings are focused upon strategic 
matters. The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its decision which includes appointments to the board, material capital commitments, 
commencing or settling major litigation, business acquisitions and disposals and monitoring the effectiveness of the group’s risk management 
processes. The full schedule can be found on the group’s website www.alumasc.co.uk. Directors are given appropriate information for each  
Board meeting, including reports on the current financial and trading position.
All Directors have access to independent professional advice if required and at the company’s expense. This is in addition to the access that every 
Director has to the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is charged by the Board with ensuring that Board procedures are followed.
Chairman and Chief Executive
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the roles of the Chairman and of the Chief Executive.
The role of the Chairman is to conduct Board meetings and to ensure that all Directors are properly briefed in order to take a full and constructive 
part in Board discussions. He is responsible for evaluating the performance of the Board and of the executive management team and of the other  
Non-Executive Directors and has active involvement in all key strategic decisions taken by the group. 
The role of the Chief Executive is to oversee the day to day running of the group’s business including the development of business strategies  
and processes to enable the group to meet shareholder requirements. The role involves leading the executive management team and evaluating  
their performance. Together with the Group Finance Director, he is also responsible for dealing with investor and public relations, external 
communications and corporate governance. 
Board evaluation
In line with The Code, a formal evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors was carried 
out during the year. A briefing paper was prepared by the Chairman and formed the basis of one-to-one discussions between each of the Directors 
and the Chairman and, in the case of the Chairman, between the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director. Issues arising from this process 
were discussed with the Board with recommendations for actions where appropriate. The Senior Independent Director in conjunction with the  
Non-Executive Directors is responsible for evaluating the performance of the Chairman.  The Alumasc Group plc

Introduction
The members of the Audit Committee (the ‘Committee’ in this report) who served during the year were Richard Saville (Chairman), Jon Pither, 
Philip Gwyn, John Pilkington (retired 3 September 2015) and David Armfield. The Board considers that Richard Saville has relevant, recent financial 
experience. The Committee met three times in the year and a record of the meeting attendance by Committee members is set out on page 30.  
The Committee’s main duties are as follows:
• monitoring and reviewing the integrity of financial reporting process and reviewing the financial statements, including the appropriateness  
of judgments and estimates taken in preparing the financial statements;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the group’s internal financial controls including approval of the scope and review of the results  
of internal audit activities;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the company’s part-time internal audit function;
• monitoring and reviewing the external auditor’s independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into 
consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements;
• making recommendations to the Board, for it to put to the shareholders for their approval in general meeting, in relation to the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of the external auditor and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditor; and
• to develop and implement policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services, taking into account relevant  
ethical guidance regarding the provision of non-audit services by the external audit firm; and to report to the Board, identifying any matters  
in respect of which it considers that action or improvement is needed and making recommendations as to the steps to be taken.
The Group Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Financial Controller attended the meetings of the Committee. In addition, 
the external auditors attended two meetings during the year and the members of the Committee met with the external auditors on one occasion 
without members of the management team being present.
Activities of the Committee in the 2015/16 financial year
The main activities of the Committee during the year were:
• reviewing the interim and full year results announcements and financial statements, with particular focus on the key estimates and judgments 
taken by management in the preparation of those statements and the external auditor’s comments in those areas;
• review and approval of the audit plan of the external auditor, including the scope of the work, the key areas of focus in terms of audit risk  
and judgment, and the basis on which the auditor assesses materiality;
• considering the effectiveness of the external audit and the independence of the auditor, and recommending the re-appointment of KPMG LLP 
as external auditor;
• review and approval of the plan and scope of internal audit work, including consideration of internal audit reports issued during the year  
and discussion of the key matters and improvement points arising from those audits with management; 
• a review of the group’s approach to cyber security and associated controls; and
• to review and update the Committee’s terms of reference in light of the new EU Audit Regulation and Directive.
Significant issues considered in relation to the financial statements
The Committee considered, in conjunction with management and the external auditor, the significant areas of estimation and judgment in preparing 
the financial statements and disclosures, discussed how these were addressed and approved the conclusions of this work. The principal areas  
of focus in this regard were:
(i) Revenue and profit recognition on construction contracts
Revenue and profit recognition on construction contracts that span more than one accounting period is an inherently judgmental area, involving 
estimation of the percentage of contract completion and estimates of costs to complete the work, as described in the accounting policy note  
on page 60. Having reviewed the contract accounting judgments taken at the year end with management and the external auditors, the Committee 
was satisfied with the level of revenue and profit recognised on construction contracts for the financial year.
(ii) Defined benefit pension schemes’ valuation
As described in the risk review on pages 22 and 23, Alumasc has relatively significant legacy defined benefit pension obligations in the context of the 
overall size of the group. Therefore, relatively small changes to market assumptions (particularly the discount rate and inflation rate) and mortality 
assumptions used to value defined benefit pension obligations under IAS 19 can have a material impact on the group’s Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Further details are given in note 23 to the consolidated financial 
statements. Having reviewed the valuation assumptions adopted by management, in conjunction with actuarial advice received and the review  
of those assumptions by the external auditor, the Committee was satisfied that the group balance sheet reflects an appropriate valuation of the 
group’s pension obligations using IAS 19’s valuation methodology.

Assessment of the effectiveness of external audit
The Committee assesses the performance of KPMG both through formal Committee meetings, KPMG’s reports to the Committee and more  
informal interaction throughout the year. The Committee also receives structured feedback from senior group and operational management  
on the robustness, value added and efficiency of the external audit. 
Having considered this information, the Committee concluded that the external audit continues to operate effectively and that KPMG continued  
to be effective in their role. 
Assessment of the independence of the external auditor
The group’s policy on the independence of auditors is consistent with the Revised Ethical Standard published by the Financial Reporting Council.
The firm carrying out the group’s external audit was last changed eight years ago, and the Committee assesses the effectiveness and independence 
of the external auditor every year.
Any non-audit services proposed to be carried out by the external auditor are discussed and approved in advance by the Committee. During both  
the financial year under review and the prior financial year, no non-audit services were provided by KPMG. 
In accordance with best practice and professional standards, KPMG rotated the audit partner responsible for the audit three years ago, when the 
original audit partner had served for five years. The current audit partner had not previously been involved in providing any audit or non-audit 
services to Alumasc. 
KPMG have confirmed to the Committee that they consider themselves to be independent within the meaning of regulatory and professional 
requirements. 
In view of all the above, the Committee remains satisfied with the independence of the external auditor.
Re-appointment of the external auditor
Having reviewed the performance and independence of the external auditors during the year, the Committee has recommended to the Board  
to propose to shareholders that KPMG LLP are re-appointed until the conclusion of the annual general meeting in 2017.
Effective internal control and risk management
The Alumasc Board as a whole acknowledges that it is ultimately responsible for the group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The system is designed to be robust in its management of the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. This risk, however, cannot 
be wholly eliminated and therefore the system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against the risk of material misstatement, 
fraud or loss.
The group has an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the business. The process was in place 
during the year and remained in place on the date that the Annual Report and Financial Statements were approved by the Board. The main elements 
of the group’s internal control process are as follows:
(i) Risk management
Risk management is a continuing activity throughout the year, dealt with through the board meetings of operating companies. In addition, a formal 
business risk review exercise is conducted every year at each operating company and for the group as a whole. This identifies the most important 
risks, their likelihood of occurrence and possible business and financial implications and the effectiveness of mitigating controls. A group level 
summary of these risk reviews is provided on pages 22 and 23. Each operating company has implemented procedures for controlling the relevant 
risks of their business.
Based on their attendance at the board meetings of each operating company, the Executive Directors report periodically to the Board on the risk 
management processes that have been in place during the year and the effectiveness of the level of control in managing the identified risks.  
The Board is able to confirm that these procedures are ongoing.

Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report
Financial Statements
Governance 33
(ii) Financial reporting and monitoring
The Board receives regular financial reports, including monthly management accounts, monthly rolling re-forecasts, annual budgets and three year 
plans. These procedures are intended to ensure that the Board maintains full and effective control over all financial issues. An Executive Committee, 
comprising the group’s Executive Directors and the Divisional Managing Directors of the group’s operating segments, reviews trading activities and 
addresses matters of common interest with regard to safety, strategic development, performance, risk and other matters of mutual group interest. 
Day to day management of the group companies is delegated to operational management with a clearly defined system of control, including:
• An organisational structure with an appropriate delegation of authority within each company;
• The identification and appraisal of business and financial risks both formally, within the annual process of preparing business plans and budgets, 
and informally, through close monitoring of operations;
• A comprehensive financial reporting system within which actual results are compared with approved budgets, re-forecasts and  
the previous year’s figures on a monthly basis and reviewed at both local and group level; and
• An investment evaluation procedure to ensure an appropriate level of scrutiny and approval for all significant items of capital expenditure.
(iii) Internal controls assurance
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board has reviewed during the year the effectiveness of the system of internal financial control from 
information provided by management, the group’s external auditor and the results from internal audits. The Board as a whole assessed internal 
control more generally, including the key risks affecting the group in the delivery of its long-term strategies, as summarised on pages 22 and 23.  
No material weaknesses in internal control were identified in the year.
(iv) Internal audit
The Committee’s view is that the size and complexity of the group and the close involvement of the Executive Directors make it unnecessary for 
Alumasc to have a dedicated internal audit function, although part of the Group Financial Controller’s role, and that of her team, is to carry out 
internal audits in each of the group’s principal operating locations each year. This position is kept under annual review by the Committee.
The principal focus of this internal audit work is to check the existence and effective operation of key internal financial controls. 
The Committee reviews and approves the proposed scope of internal audit activities each year, and ensures that key risk areas are covered, and  
that agreed recommendations arising from previous internal and external audits are re-reviewed to assess whether they have been implemented.
Whistleblowing policy
The group has a Whistleblowing policy, which provides a formal mechanism whereby every group employee can, on a confidential basis, raise 
concerns over potential malpractice or impropriety within the group. This policy was reviewed by the Committee and updated during the year.  
Bribery and Corruption policy
The group has in place a policy with regard to compliance with the Bribery Act 2010. The group’s anti-bribery policy and guidelines reflect the 
Directors’ zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption of all kinds.
This policy has been cascaded down into the operating companies and training held at head office and subsidiary level. Any matters of particular 
concern whether arising from due diligence or otherwise with regard to related parties as defined in the Bribery Act 2010 are raised and discussed  
at monthly operating board meetings.
Business Ethics policy
The group has in place a Business Ethics policy, setting out the standards of business conduct that the group expects from its executives and 
employees. This policy is subject to periodic review to ensure it reflects the operation of the group and the business environment in which it 
operates. 
Copies of this policy, the Whistleblowing policy and Bribery & Corruption policy can be found on the group’s website www.alumasc.co.uk.
Going concern and longer term viability
The Committee is satisfied that the group has adequate resources to continue for the foreseeable future for the reasons given on page 20 and 
recommends to the Board the adoption of the going concern basis of accounting. This view is further supported by the viability statement found  
on page 21.

Directors’ Remuneration Report  
– Statement from the Chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ending 30 
June 2016. The Remuneration Committee’s  
(the ‘Committee’ in this report) overall approach 
remains unchanged from prior years. We are 
focused on ensuring the group’s remuneration 
policy is aligned with shareholders’ interests 
and the company’s strategic goals, whilst also 
enabling us to attract, retain and motivate high 
quality executive management.
In making remuneration decisions, the 
Committee considers the group’s overall 
performance against its long-term goals. 
For the year to 30 June 2016, the group has 
delivered another positive set of results as 
described in the Strategic Report. Particular 
highlights include:
• Group revenues from continuing operations 
increased by 2% to £92.2 million
• Underlying profit before tax from continuing 
operations increased by 7% to £8.3 million
• The strategically important divestment  
of the Dyson Diecastings business was 
completed on 30 June 2016.
The Committee met three times during the year 
– the topics under discussion included:
• A review of the base salaries of the  
Executive Directors and group employees 
more generally
• A review and establishment of the  
achievement of the bonus criteria for  
the Executive Directors
• Decisions on the performance criteria  
to be applied to the LTIP and ESOS awards  
to be made in October 2016
• Decisions on the achievement of the 
performance criteria in relation to the  
LTIP and ESOS awards maturing in  
October 2016 
• A review of and decisions on the way 
company pension contributions are made 
to individuals in light of the new pension 
rules introduced in April 2016.
Summary of any discretion  
applied in the year 
The Committee used its discretion in amending 
the administrative rules of the LTIP originally 
approved by shareholders in 2008 to allow  
for current and future awards to become  
nil-cost options bringing these in line with the 
Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders 
in October 2014.
The committee used its discretion in respect  
of the 2012 LTIP award which vested in the 
year to include loss-making discontinued 
operations in the calculation of the EPS 
performance criteria and to align the TSR 
performance period with the group’s financial 
year end. The impact of the discretion 
exercised was to reduce the award to 25%  
in respect of EPS performance criteria and  
25% in respect of the TSR criteria, resulting  
in 50% of the overall award vesting.
The detail of the Directors’ remuneration is 
contained in the report that follows and an 
overview of the Remuneration Policy can be 
found after the report.

 Actual values based on the vesting of the 2012 LTIP award at a mid-market price of 178.5 pence on 18 March 2016, restated.
* Estimated values as at 12 July 2016, pending the end of the period for calculating the TSR element, being 6 weeks after the date of the results announcement, subject to actual vesting of the 2013 LTIP 
award in October 2016.
The group’s Remuneration Policy caps bonuses payable to Executive Directors at 100% of base pay. In practice, bonuses will only exceed 50%  
of base pay in exceptional circumstances (for example successful execution of major strategic projects). For the year to 30 June 2016 the minimum 
bonus target was to achieve underlying PBT from all (including Dyson Diecastings) operations of £8.75 million. On the basis of actual underlying  
PBT from all operations of £8.3 million, the target for the profit linked bonus were not met therefore no bonus was paid in this respect. However 
success bonuses of £50,000 to each of G P Hooper and A Magson (20% and 28% of salary respectively) were paid in relation to the marketing  
and sale of the Dyson Diecastings business, concluding the strategic withdrawal of the group from its engineering products activities.
The group operates a policy whereby Executive Directors are provided with health insurance, disability insurance and life cover, and are given  
a cash alternative to a company car and associated expenses. None of these are considered individually significant.
The performance metrics used for the 2013 LTIP award, which will vest later in 2016, were stretching to incentivise a significant recovery in the 
group’s profitability compared with the 2012/13 financial year. They comprised an earnings target based on underlying profit before tax (meaning 
profit before tax prior to deduction of non-cash pension interest and brand amortisation charges, ‘UPBT’), which was used by the Committee  
as a proxy for growth in earnings per share (‘EPS’), and a total shareholder return (‘TSR’) target.
The group’s total UPBT from continuing operations for the 2015/16 year was £8.3 million. The Committee in determining that the threshold  
level of £6.9 million UPBT had been achieved, granted a 25% vesting in respect of the total award. In respect of the actual UPBT figure achieved  
of £8.3 million, the committee determined that a further 20.8% had vested in respect of the UPBT element of the award.

It is expected that the group will achieve a second quartile performance in respect of the TSR element of the award. The TSR performance period, 
being the three years from September 2013 to September 2016, uses the average share price of the six-week period following the date of 
announcement of the annual results.
Therefore the Committee determined that, subject to the final calculation in October 2016 of the TSR element of the award, approximately 49.6% 
of the full LTIP award should vest, comprising 45.8% in respect of the earnings element and an estimated 3.8% in respect of the TSR element. 
Therefore, in October 2016, it is estimated that approximately 66,644 shares will vest in respect of G P Hooper and 30,907 shares in respect  
of A Magson. The actual figures, determined following vesting in October 2016, will be reported in the 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report.

J Pilkington retired as a Director on 3 September 2015, no payment was made for loss of office. The Non-Executive Directors’ fees were reviewed  
in the year (the previous review took place in 2013) and were increased by 23% in respect of J P Pither and R C C Saville and 27% in respect of  
P H R Gwyn and D Armfield with effect from 1 January 2016 bringing them back into line with current market rates. The Chairman declined the  
offer of an increase.
Total pension entitlements
The group’s defined benefit pension schemes are closed to future accrual and neither G P Hooper nor A Magson have benefits provided under 
these schemes. The group makes provision to pay 20% of G P Hooper’s base salary and 15% of A Magson’s base salary into a defined contribution 
pension scheme of each Executive’s choosing or as a cash alternative.
Payments to past Directors
There were no payments to past Directors during the year (2015: £nil).
Payments for loss of office
There were no payments in relation to loss of office during the year (2015: £nil).

Executive share option scheme
G P Hooper has in the past, been able to participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme approved by shareholders in 2004. This scheme was 
designed to encourage the matching of interests between management and shareholders. The Chief Executive’s 2006 award lapsed during the year. 
This scheme ended in 2014 and was replaced by a new scheme approved by the shareholders on 30 October 2014 (the ‘2014 Scheme’). Currently 
none of the Executive Directors have any awards under the 2014 Scheme.

Long term incentive plans
Each award is dependent partially on an EPS performance condition and partially on TSR, meaning a measure of the growth in value of the ordinary 
shares of the company over the performance period, assuming that all dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares. The relative weighting 
to be attributed to EPS and TSR in a particular award is decided upon by the Remuneration Committee. All awards under the 2008 Plan have a £nil 
exercise price. The aggregate of gains made by Directors on the exercise of share options during the year was £220,978 (2014/15: £nil).

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in the following financial year
The following sections show how the Remuneration Policy will be applied in 2016/17.
Base salary
Both the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director base salaries were raised by 2.8% with effect from 1 July 2016 to £257,000  
and £181,000 respectively. 
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The policy of the Board is that the  
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors should be consistent with the levels of remuneration paid by companies of a similar size and  
complexity. Non-Executive Directors receive an annual fee and are reimbursed expenses incurred in performing their duties. They do not receive  
any performance related remuneration or pension contributions. The non-executive fees were increased during the year (as detailed on page 37)  
and there are no plans to make further increases in the 2016/17 financial year. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have contracts of service but their terms are set out in letters of appointment. 
Bonus
For 2016/17 the annual bonus for Executive Directors will be determined by growth in group underlying profit before tax relative to stretching 
targets set at the beginning of the financial year. The board considers that these targets are commercially sensitive and therefore full details  
will not be disclosed until the 2016/17 report.
Long Term Incentive Plan
It is intended that awards will be made in October 2016 for the Chief Executive, to the extent of 75% of base salary, and to the Group Finance 
Director, to the extent of 50% of base salary.
The earnings performance criteria for these awards over a three year period will be the growth in basic EPS from continuing operations above  
14.5 pence per share base level as at 30 June 2016.
Threshold EPS growth above 14.5 pence (25% of award) is: Vesting level
At least growth in RPI plus 2.5% per annum over the performance period 100%
If threshold performance is achieved then:
2015/16 EPS growth (50% of award) is: Vesting level
Equal to or greater than the growth in retail prices index (‘RPI’) plus 10% per annum over the performance period 100%
Between RPI growth plus 2.5% and RPI growth plus 10% per annum over the performance period Straight line between 0%-100%
Total shareholder return (25% of award) is: Vesting level

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
During the year the Committee considered the remuneration of the Chairman and the Executive Directors. 
Details of the committee members who served during the year can be found on page 34. The Committee met three times during the year  
and a record of the meeting attendance by Committee members is set out on page 30. The Group Chairman generally attends meetings of the 
Committee but takes no part in deliberations relating to his own position. The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director can attend meetings  
of the Committee as requested but take no part in deliberations relating to their own position. 
The increases in base salary for the Executive Directors were awarded within the range of salary increases granted to employees across the group,  
no external advice was taken on these matters.
Neither of the Executive Directors has any external paid directorships. Executive Directors may be permitted to accept external board or committee 
appointments provided they do not interfere with their obligations to the company. The Board will decide at the time of appointment whether the 
Executive Director may retain the fees for such appointments.
Statement of voting at general meeting
At last year’s Annual General Meeting (2015) the Directors’ Remuneration Report received the following votes from shareholders:
  Total number of votes cast % of votes cast
For   18,281,047 99.8
Against   35,449 0.2
Total votes cast (for and against)   18,316,496 100
Votes withheld   4,750 n/a
Total votes cast (including withheld votes)*   18,321,246 n/a
* A vote withheld is not a vote in law and is not counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes cast ‘For’ or ‘Against’ a resolution.

The Remuneration Policy was approved at the company’s annual general meeting (‘AGM’) on the 30 October 2014 and is intended to apply  
for three years. The full policy can be found in the company’s 2014 Remuneration Report and at the Investor Relations section of the website  
(www.alumasc.co.uk/investors).
In setting the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors the Committee takes into account wider considerations in order to agree the key 
principles of the policy. 
Wider considerations Key policy principles
The need to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and  
senior management.
Competitive incentive arrangements underpinned by a balance  
of financial measures and linked to corporate performance, ensuring  
a focus on business performance and alignment with the interests  
of shareholders.
Periodic external comparisons to examine current market trends  
and practices and equivalent roles in similar companies.
Base salaries set at around median level for a group of Alumasc’s size, 
complexity and industry sectors, but with the potential to earn  
upper-quartile rewards for sustained medium to longer term  
exceptional performance.
Internal pay and benefits practice and employment conditions  
within the group as a whole.
A reward structure that balances short-term and long-term performance. 
As a result, the Committee has determined that the remuneration of Executive Directors will provide an appropriate balance between fixed and 
performance-related elements. The remuneration package for Executive Directors is broken down into five key elements – base salary, benefits, 
pension provision, annual bonus and long term incentives. 
Base salary for each Executive Director is reviewed annually by the Committee, taking account of 
the Director’s performance, experience and responsibilities. The Committee has regard to salary 
levels paid by UK listed companies of a similar size and nature, ensuring that the appropriate 
benchmark data is used and also considers wider economic factors, the performance of the 
group as a whole and the general level of salary increases across the group.
The group operates a policy whereby Executive Directors are provided with health insurance, 
disability insurance and life cover, and are given a cash alternative to a company car.
Pension provision is provided by company contributions into defined contribution schemes and/or  
as a separate cash allowance.
The Committee’s general policy is that Executive Directors should receive a bonus in relation 
to the achievement of stretching performance targets which reflect how well the group has 
performed against budget. The Committee wishes to retain the flexibility to set bonus targets 
which reward outperformance against predetermined performance objectives and which reflect 
the needs of the business.
The group operates the Long Term Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’) which was approved by shareholders 
in October 2008. The purpose of the LTIP is to motivate key individuals to take the company 
upon a programme of long term growth and to reward them for exceptional performance.  
Under the LTIP each participant is allocated a number of shares. The vesting of shares under  
the LTIP is subject to the achievement of performance targets.
The Committee will continue to review the Remuneration Policy to ensure it takes due account of best remuneration practice and that it remains 
aligned with the interests of shareholders. A new Remuneration Policy will be subject to a shareholder binding vote at the 2017 AGM.

How shareholders’ views are taken into account 
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received at the AGM each year. This, plus other feedback received during the year, is then considered 
as part of the group’s annual review of remuneration. 
How employees’ pay is taken into account
Pay and conditions elsewhere in the group were considered when finalising the current policy for Executive Directors and continues to be considered 
in relation to the implementation of this policy. In order to do so, the Committee assesses the wider pay and employment conditions in other parts  
of the group.
How the Executive Directors’ remuneration policy relates to the wider group 
Both Executive Directors, and employees below executive level have their base pay reviewed each year taking into account wage and general 
inflation, affordability to the group/relevant operating company, performance/development of the individual in their role and general market rates 
for specific skills. Employees below executive level have lower proportions of their total remuneration subject to incentive based rewards. Long term 
incentives are reserved for those judged as having the greatest potential to influence the group’s earnings growth and share price performance.
Service contracts
The Committee’s policy on service contracts for Executive Directors is that they should provide for termination of employment by either side giving 
12 months’ notice. The group’s policy stipulates that no Executive Director should be entitled to a notice period or payments in excess of their 
contractual arrangements.
No Executive Director has the benefit of provisions in their service contract for the payment of predetermined compensation in the event of 
termination of employment.

Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are engaged for fixed terms, with an entitlement to accrued fees and expenses only up to the date of termination. 
These appointments are subject to the Articles of Association. Directors submit themselves for re-election at the AGM in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the company’s articles of association.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company  
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions  
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them  
to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary  
for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of The Alumasc Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2016 set out on pages 51 to 102. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2016 and  
of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted  
by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied  
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit,  
in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
Accounting for long term contracts, Risk vs 2015: tu
Revenue £18.0m (2015: £17.6m) 
Refer to page 31 (Audit Committee Report), page 60 (accounting policy) and page 61 (financial disclosures).
The risk The response
Where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated  
reliably the recognition of revenue and expenses is based on the  
stage of completion of work performed. In most cases this is assessed 
by reference to surveys of work performed at the balance sheet date. 
When the outcome cannot be estimated reliably contract revenue  
is recognised only to the extent of costs incurred that are likely  
to be recoverable.
Forecast profit or loss on contracts is a key risk for our audit because of 
the high degree of judgment involved in preparing suitable estimates of 
the forecast costs and revenue on contracts. A variance in the amount 
of profit or loss recognised to date, and therefore also in the current 
period, could arise as a result of changes in estimates of contract  
costs and revenues.
The forecast profit on contracts includes key judgements over the 
expected recovery of costs arising from variations and claims.  
The inclusion of these amounts in the contract forecast where they are 
not recoverable could result in a material error in the level of profit or 
loss recognised by the group.
In this area our audit procedures included: 
• testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness  
of the group’s controls over the budgeting and tendering for  
new long term contracts; 
• selecting those contracts that could have the greatest impact on the 
group’s financial results to assess whether the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements were in line with the group’s accounting 
policy, had been calculated in line with underlying assumptions 
and whether they represented a balanced view of the risks and 
opportunities in respect of the forecast profit to completion;
• challenging management’s judgement by obtaining and assessing 
information to support the forecast assumptions, including 
correspondence with quantity surveyors, to assess the level of work 
performed, communication with customers regarding contract 
variations and claims and agreeing post year end cash receipts;
• assessing the accuracy of management’s forecasting by comparing 
the historical financial performance of completed contracts with the 
original budgets and forecast margins for those contracts;
• evaluating the current margin recognised for a sample of 
contracts by reviewing the performance to date and assessing 
the reasonableness of forecast costs to complete, which included 
reviewing supplier quotations; and
• considering the adequacy of the group’s disclosures about the 
degree of judgement involved in arriving at the contract revenues. The Alumasc Group plc

Gross liability £115.5m, net liability £22.7m (2015 gross liability: £111.1m; net liability: £20.9m) 
Refer to page 31 (Audit Committee Report), page 58 (accounting policy) and pages 78 to 80 (financial disclosures).
The risk The response
Due to the materiality of the defined benefit pension obligation,  
small changes in the key assumptions, being the discount rate, inflation 
and mortality rates, can have a significant effect on the group’s results 
and financial position.
In this area our audit procedures included:
• challenging the key assumptions used in the group’s valuation  
of the defined benefit pension obligation, with the support  
of our own actuarial specialists. This included critically assessing the 
key assumptions against those used by other comparable companies 
and comparing these assumptions with externally derived market 
data; and
• considering the adequacy of the group’s disclosures of the 
assumptions and the sensitivities of these.
We continue to perform audit procedures over the risk of misstatement of the carrying value of inventory and the carrying value of goodwill. 
However, following the sale of the Alumasc Precision Components business and the integration of Roof-Pro and Blackdown within the existing 
Alumasc Roofing business, at the end of the prior year, we have not assessed these as risks that had the greatest effect on our audit and, therefore, 
they are not separately identified in our report this year. 
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £325,000 (2015: £400,000), determined with reference to a benchmark  
of group profit before tax, normalised to exclude the one-off profit of £0.9 million on the sale of Dyson Diecastings, as disclosed in note 6, of which 
it represents 4.8% (2015: 4.9%).
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £16,250 (2015: £20,000), in addition to other 
audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the group’s nine (2015: eleven) reporting components we subjected eight (2015: eight) to audits for group reporting purposes and one  
(2015: three) to specified risk-focused audit procedures over revenue and trade receivables. The latter was not individually financially significant 
enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes, but did present a specific individual risk that needed to be addressed. The work on all  
the reporting components was performed by the group audit team.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the group’s results:
   2016   2015
 Audits for Specified  Audits for Specified
 group reporting risk-focused  group reporting risk-focused
 purposes procedures Total purposes procedures Total
Group revenue 99.4% 0.6% 100% 94.3% 5.7% 100%
Group profit before tax 99.6% 0.4% 100% 76.4% 23.6% 100%
Group assets 99.8% 0.2% 100% 95.2% 4.8% 100%
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes at the key reporting components of the group were all performed to materiality levels set  
by the group audit team. These materiality levels were set individually for each component and ranged from £70,000 to £300,000 (2015: £93,000 
to £360,000).
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 28 to 30 with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.  50

5 We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ statement of risk, control and viability on page 21, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based  
on that, the Directors’ assessment and expectations of the group’s continuing in operation over the 3 years to 30 June 2019; or 
• the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting. 
6  We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider 
that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 21, in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 28 to 30 relating to the company’s compliance with the ten provisions of the 2014  
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.

Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
1 Basis of preparation
The Alumasc Group plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The company’s ordinary shares are traded on the  
London Stock Exchange.
The group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by  
the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the year ended 30 June 2016, and the Companies Act 2006.
Prior year figures have been restated, where applicable, due to the presentation in 2015/16 of Dyson Diecastings as a discontinued operation.  
This business was sold on 30 June 2016.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out  
in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 25. The financial position of the group, its cash flows and liquidity position are set out in these  
financial statements. Details of the group’s borrowing facilities are described within note 21. 
The group has committed borrowing facilities of £12.5 million which expire in August 2020. In addition, the group has recently renewed  
overdraft facilities totalling £2 million for another year. At 30 June 2016 the group’s net cash resources were £8.6 million (2015: £0.9 million).
On the basis of the group’s financing facilities and current operating and financial plans and sensitivity analyses, the Board is satisfied that the 
group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Further information is set out in the viability statement on page 21.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
The following new standard, amendment and interpretation is effective for the period beginning on or after 1 July 2015 and has been adopted 
for the group financial statements where appropriate with no material impact on the disclosures made by the group:
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and each of its subsidiaries made up to 30 June each year. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control in this context means the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All inter-
company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated.
Judgments and estimates
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and valuation of defined benefit pension obligations and the recognition of 
revenues and profit on construction contracts. 
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of future changes in inflation, mortality rates and the selection  
of a suitable discount rate (see note 23).
Revenue recognised on construction contracts is determined by the assessment of the stage of completion of each contract. The requirement 
for Directors’ judgment is limited in most cases due to the involvement of quantity surveyors during the assessment process, as detailed within 
the revenue recognition accounting policy. 56

Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
As part of its transition to IFRS, the group elected to re-state only those business combinations that occurred on or after 1 July 2004.  
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 July 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the group’s previous accounting framework, 
UK GAAP. For acquisitions on or after 1 July 2004, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. When the excess is negative (negative goodwill),  
it is recognised immediately in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for 
impairment at least annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The carrying 
amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit, or of 
an operation within it. 
Other intangible assets
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination 
is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured 
reliably. Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the income statement in the year in 
which it is incurred. 
Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after all the following criteria are met:
• the project’s technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated;
• the availability of adequate technical and financial resources and an intention to complete the project have been confirmed; and 
• the correlation between development costs and future revenues has been established.
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives, as follows:
Computer software – 2 to 5 years
Development expenditure – up to 10 years
Brands  – 3 to 20 years
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. In addition, the carrying value of capitalised development expenditure is reviewed for impairment annually and before being 
brought into use.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to 
making the asset capable of operating as intended. Under IFRS transitional provisions, the group elected to bring in previous valuations of 
freehold and long leasehold land and buildings at a valuation frozen under FRS 15, and these amounts are carried forward at deemed cost.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The cost of other property, plant and equipment is written off by equal monthly instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings  – 25 to 50 years
Long leasehold property  – over the period of the lease to a maximum of 50 years
Short leasehold improvements – over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment  – 3 to 15 years
Motor vehicles  – 4 to 5 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, each part is accounted for as a separate item. Useful lives 
and residual values are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively. The Alumasc Group plc

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Impairment of fixed assets
The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each individual 
asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business 
segment level or business level as the case may be. 
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Leased assets
Assets held under leasing arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the group are classified as finance 
leases and are capitalised with a corresponding liability being recognised for the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income  
in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and rentals 
payable are charged in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Financial assets
When financial assets are recognised initially under IAS 39, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus directly attributable 
transaction costs.
The group’s investments are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. As there is no active market for these investments their fair value 
cannot be reliably measured subsequent to initial recognition, and they are therefore held at cost less impairment.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first in first out basis after making due allowance for any obsolete 
or slow moving items. In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate 
proportion of manufacturing overheads. The allocation of manufacturing overheads has regard to normal production.
The group holds certain raw materials from suppliers on an inventory held on consignment basis, which are accounted for as consumed.  
This inventory remains the property of the supplier until used. 
Biological assets
Biological assets relate to the value of horticultural inventories at Blackdown greenroofs, which form part of the green roof systems supplied. 
The assets are measured at fair value, being discounted market value less estimated point-of-sale costs, with any change therein recognised  
in the statement of comprehensive income. Point-of-sale costs include all costs that would be necessary to sell the assets.  58

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Pension costs
The group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes as follows:
(i) Defined benefit pensions
The group operates two principal defined benefit schemes which require deficit reduction contributions to be made to separately administered 
funds. One of the schemes was closed to future benefit accrual in 2009, the other in 2010, with neither closure resulting in a curtailment gain 
or loss. Prior to this, benefits were accrued under the career average revalued earnings (CARE) basis.
Prior to the closure of these schemes to future benefit accrual, the cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans was determined 
separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine 
current service cost) and is based on actuarial advice.
The group determines finance income/expense for the period relating to defined benefit pension schemes by applying the discount rate used 
for valuing the schemes’ liabilities to the value of the net pension liability at the beginning of the year.
The net pension scheme finance costs are charged to finance costs within the statement of comprehensive income.
The expense of administering the pension schemes is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. These comprise, for scheme assets, 
the difference between the expected and actual return on assets, and, for scheme liabilities, the difference between the actuarial assumptions 
and actual experience, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the statement of financial position comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds), and less the fair value of plan assets out of which 
the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published 
bid price. The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any 
amount the group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
(ii)  Defined contribution pensions
The pension cost charge to the statement of comprehensive income of the group’s defined contribution schemes represents the contributions 
payable by the group to the funds. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax 
rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, where the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the year end  
date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised in the consolidated  
income statement. The Alumasc Group plc

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Own shares
The Alumasc Group plc shares held by the group are classified in shareholders’ equity as ‘own shares’ and are recognised at cost. Consideration 
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being 
taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Equity settled share based payment transactions
The fair value of long term incentive awards and share options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense from the date of 
grant, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions  
are met.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and  
are subsequently re-measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the statement  
of comprehensive income. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends  
on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar  
maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate cap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. 
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how 
effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such items are expected at inception to be highly effective.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, the hedges used by the group are classified as cash flow hedges, as they hedge exposure to variability  
in cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. 
The portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge is initially recognised directly in equity, while 
the ineffective portion is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement at the time when the underlying transaction being hedged affects profit  
or loss, such as when the forecast sale or purchase of the hedged item occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset  
or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the statement of 
comprehensive income.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction being hedged occurs and are transferred to the income 
statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the 
amount is taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
Information regarding both the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the group’s treasury activities is presented to enable the improved 
evaluation of the group’s exposure to risks arising from financial instruments. 60

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, and is stated net of rebates, and before VAT and other sales 
taxes or duty. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, 
usually on despatch of the goods.
Tooling
Revenue generated on tooling work is recognised when work on the tool has been completed and it has been accepted by the customer.
Construction contracts
Contract revenue includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments to the 
extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. As soon as the outcome of a construction contract can 
be estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive Income in proportion  
to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion, in most cases, is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed. When the outcome of a contract cannot be 
estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. An expected loss 
on a contract is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision is made when there 
is objective evidence that the group will not be able to recover balances in full. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance 
revenue and finance costs. Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense over the period to the maturity of the underlying instrument.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow  
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Where the group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example 
under an insurance policy, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when recovery is virtually certain. The expense relating 
to any provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement. 
New standards and interpretations not applied
The group is currently assessing the impact that IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ and IFRS 16 
‘Leases’ will have on the group’s revenue recognition, assets and liabilities. The Alumasc Group plc

4 Segmental analysis – continuing operations 
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the segmental analysis below follows the group’s internal management reporting structure. 
The Chief Executive reviews internal management reports on a monthly basis, with performance being measured based on segmental operating 
result as disclosed below. Performance is measured on this basis as management believes this information is the most relevant when evaluating 
the impact of strategic decisions.
Inter-segment transactions are entered into applying normal commercial terms that would be available to third parties. Segment results,  
assets and liabilities include those items directly attributable to a segment. Unallocated assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, deferred 
tax assets, income tax recoverable and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a reportable segment. Unallocated 
liabilities comprise borrowings, employee benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities, income tax payable and corporate liabilities that cannot  
be allocated on a reasonable basis to a reportable segment. 
Since the publication of Alumasc’s 2015 Report and Accounts the group’s operating segments have been revised to reflect changes to  
internal management responsibilities and the reports reviewed by the Chief Executive. The principal changes are the combination of our  
former Construction Products and Rainwater and Drainage businesses into the new Water Management segment to reflect the formation  
of the Alumasc Water Management Solutions brand in July 2015, and the separate analysis of our Housebuilding & Ancillary Products business 
this year. The segmental analysis of comparative data for the period ended 30 June 2015 has been re-presented to show Dyson Diecastings  
as a discontinued operation where necessary.

The group’s total tax charge in 2015/16 of £1,203,000 (2014/15: £446,000) benefited from the impact of business disposals where capital 
gains on sale of assets were shielded by indexation allowances and capital losses brought forward.
(c) Unrecognised tax losses
The group has agreed tax capital losses in the UK amounting to £20 million (2015: £20 million) that relate to prior years. Under current 
legislation these losses are available for offset against future chargeable gains. The capital losses are able to be carried forward indefinitely. 
Revaluation gains on land and buildings amount to £1 million (2015: £1 million). These have been offset against the capital losses detailed 
above. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of the net capital losses carried forward of £19 million (2015: £19 million)  
as they do not meet the criteria for recognition.

(e) Factors affecting the tax charge in future periods
In the Budget on 16 March 2016, the UK Government announced its intention to further reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% 
with effect from 1 April 2020. Existing temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided may therefore unwind in future periods 
at this reduced rate. This rate change was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been 
calculated based on the rate of 18% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

12 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit 
attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, after 
allowing for the exercise of outstanding share options. The following sets out the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings

Impairment testing of acquired goodwill
The group considers each of the operating businesses that have goodwill allocated to them, which are those units for which a separate 
cashflow is computed, to be a cash generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. In assessing whether 
an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of 
its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is 
deemed to be its value in use. Each of the CGUs are either operating segments as shown in note 4, or sub-sets of those operating segments.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of CGUs is based on value in use calculations. The value in use is derived from 
discounted management cash flow forecasts for the businesses, based on budgets and strategic plans covering a five year period. 
The growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond this period was 1% (2015: 1%) for each CGU.
Key assumptions included in the recoverable amount calculation include:
(i) Revenues
(ii) Gross margins
(iii) Overhead costs
Each assumption has been considered in conjunction with the local management of the relevant operating businesses who have used their past 
experience and expectations of future market and business developments in arriving at the figures used. The potential for a reduction in short 
term demand which is possible as a result of uncertainties following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union was also considered.
The range of pre-tax rates used to discount the cash flows of these cash generating units with on balance sheet goodwill was between 10% 
and 11% (2015: between 10% and 13%). These rates were based on the group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital (W.A.C.C.), 
which was risk-adjusted for the specific circumstances of each CGU. The group’s W.A.C.C. in 2016 was similar to the rate used in 2015. 
The surplus headroom above the carrying value of goodwill at 30 June 2016 was significant in the case of Alumasc Roofing, Timloc, Levolux 
and Rainclear Systems, with no impairment arising from either a 2% increase in the discount rate; a growth rate of -1% used to extrapolate 
the cash flows; or a reduction of 25% in the cash flow generated in the terminal year for any CGU.  72

The group has a £12.5 million committed revolving credit facility which expires in August 2020. The group has the option to cancel and repay 
elements of the committed facility at short notice should it wish to do so. The following financial covenants applied to the facility: group 
interest cover, based on underlying EBITDA (i.e. from continuing operations and before non-recurring items), to be at least four times; and  
net debt as a multiple of underlying EBITDA (i.e. from continuing operations and before non-recurring items) to be below three times.
Group interest cover was 44.2 times at 30 June 2016 (2015: 17.3 times) whilst the net debt (net debt plus contingent liabilities) multiple  
of EBITDA was zero given the group’s net cash position at 30 June 2016 (2015: 0.1 times). 
At 30 June 2016 the group also had £3 million (2015: £3 million) of bank overdraft facilities repayable on demand. The Directors chose  
to reduce the group’s overdraft facilities to £2 million on annual renewal post the year end. The Alumasc Group plc

Financial risk management 
The group’s treasury activities are carried out in accordance with policies set by the Board and are managed on a centralised basis across 
the group. The purpose of treasury activities is to ensure that adequate, cost effective funding is available to the group at all times and that 
exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty risks are managed within acceptable levels. The group uses derivative financial 
instruments as economic hedges to manage foreign exchange and, where necessary, interest rate risks. It is the group’s policy that no trading 
in financial instruments is undertaken. Hedge accounting treatment has been applied to all of these hedging activities. All derivative financial 
instruments are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts has been determined by marking those contracts to market against prevailing forward 
foreign exchange rates.
Trade and other payables balances do not include other taxation and social security costs or construction deposits received on account,  
as these balances do not meet the definition of financial liabilities in IAS 39.

Liquidity risk management
The group manages liquidity risk by monitoring its net cash/debt position regularly and ensuring that committed and uncommitted banking 
facilities are in place to provide adequate headroom for anticipated future cash flows. Details of the facilities are given above. The group’s net 
cash position at 30 June 2016 was £8.6 million (2015: £0.9 million). 
Details of the group’s approach to capital structure are given within the Financial Review on page 20.
The maturity profile of the group’s interest bearing financial liabilities is as follows:
    2016 2015
    £000 £000
Floating rate interest bearing financial liabilities:
In less than one year    – 5,000
In two to five years    1,908 –
    1,908 5,000
Interest rate risk management
The group had no net indebtedness at 30 June 2016. It is the group’s policy and intention to hedge against significant upwards movement  
in LIBOR, typically using interest rate Caps or Swaps should the income statement become exposed to material interest rate risk in future.
The group’s marginal pre-tax cost of debt finance at interest rates in place at 30 June 2016 under the banking facilities in existence at that  
time was approximately 1.3% (2015: 1.7%).
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise the drawn down element of the revolving credit facility in existence at the balance sheet date  
that bears interest based on LIBOR. 
In view of the group’s positive net cash position at 30 June 2016, the impact of a reasonable foreseeable change in interest rates on the  
group’s profit before tax through the impact of floating rate borrowings is not considered material.
Credit risk
The risk of financial loss due to a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations arises principally in relation to transactions where the group 
provides goods and services on deferred terms. There are no concentrations of credit risk which amount to more than 10% of group revenues. 
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by its carrying value less amounts recoverable from credit insurance 
contracts, where applicable, as at the balance sheet date and is limited to the value of trade and other receivables. In addition the group may 
from time to time have credit exposures relating to bespoke inventories. The group’s cash deposits are only lodged with approved institutions 
that have strong credit ratings.
Group policies are aimed at minimising credit losses, and require that deferred terms are granted only to customers who demonstrate an 
appropriate payment history and satisfy creditworthiness procedures. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit terms 
to ensure that the group’s exposure to bad debts is minimised. Goods may be sold on a payment with order basis to mitigate credit risk. Most 
group businesses purchase credit insurance and the group has increased its overall levels of credit insurance in recent years.

Foreign currency risk
The group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than 
the companies’ operating currency (mainly Pounds Sterling). Transactional currency risks are managed by offsetting as far as possible purchases 
and sales by group companies in the same currency. A proportion of the residual risk is managed, where appropriate, through the use of 
forward currency contracts. 
None of the derivative financial instruments held at 30 June 2016 or 30 June 2015 related to derivative trading activity. Where cash flow  
hedge accounting is applied, gains or losses on the financial instrument hedges are held in equity and only recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income when the losses or gains on the hedged transactions are recognised in the consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income.
The following shows the amounts of foreign currency denominated receivables, payables and cash balances at 30 June stated in local currency:

Forward foreign exchange contracts    (269) (247)
At 30 June 2016 the group had forward foreign exchange contracts with principal amounts equivalent to £3,642,000 (2015: £3,636,000).  
The forward foreign exchange contracts hedge foreign currency price risks of various currency purchases and sales across the group.  
The cash flows associated with the forward foreign exchange hedges are generally expected to occur within the next 12 months.
The derivative financial instruments carried at fair value have been valued using directly observable market inputs and therefore they are all 
considered to have been valued at Level 2, as described in the amendments to IFRS 7.  78

23 Retirement benefit obligations
The group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes, funded by the payment of contributions into 
separately administered funds. The defined benefit schemes, which have been closed to future accrual since 2010, provide defined benefits 
based on a career average revalued earnings (CARE) basis.
Defined contribution schemes
Of the amount charged to operating profit in the statement of comprehensive income for pension contributions, £629,000 (2015: £676,000) 
was in respect of defined contribution schemes. At 30 June 2016 there was an accrual of £75,000 payable in respect of defined contribution 
schemes (2015: £17,000).
Defined benefit schemes
The two principal defined benefit schemes are The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme and The Benjamin Priest Group Pension Scheme.  
The rate of contributions to fund the deficits in the schemes is assessed by the schemes’ actuary on a triennial basis. 
The level of deficit reduction contributions agreed with the Pension Trustees is £2.5 million per annum.
The group’s defined benefit pension funds are currently undergoing their formal triennial valuation, with a valuation date of 31 March 2016. 
The company has until 30 June 2017 to agree the new valuation and deficit reduction plan with the Pension Trustees. Further details can be 
found in the Financial Review on page 20.
Disclosures in accordance with IAS 19 are set out below in respect of the defined benefit schemes.
Pension charges are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit 
credit method. Under the projected unit method, for closed schemes the amounts allocated to service cost in future periods will tend to be 
higher as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the IAS 19 valuations are set out below:

A discount rate of 3.0% has been used in calculating the present value of liabilities of the pension schemes at 30 June 2016. A 0.1% change 
to this rate would have changed the present value of the pension fund liabilities at that date by approximately £1,716,000 before tax. 
A Retail Price Index inflation rate of 2.9% and a Consumer Price Index inflation rate of 1.9% have been used in calculating the present value  
of liabilities of the pension schemes at 30 June 2016. A 0.1% change to these rates would have changed the present value of the pension 
fund liabilities at that date by approximately £743,000 before tax.
In valuing the liabilities of the pension schemes at 30 June 2016, mortality assumptions have been assumed as indicated above. If life 
expectancy had been changed to assume that all members of the schemes live for one year longer on average, the value of the reported 
liabilities at 30 June 2016 would have increased by approximately £4,934,000 before tax. The Alumasc Group plc

£2,500,000) to eliminate the past service shortfall over ten years. Further contributions of £510,000 (2015: £455,000) were payable by the 
group to fund the administrative expenses and the Pension Protection Fund Levies on the schemes, of which £413,000 (2015: £455,000)

Based on the draft triennial valuation, the pension deficit on a technical provisions basis was £33 million at 31 March 2016, largely unchanged  
on the previous valuation in 2013. Following the EU referendum vote on 23 June 2016 the gilt rate used to value pension schemes on a technical 
provisions basis decreased, generating an estimated pension deficit on a technical provisions basis on 30 June 2016 of circa £44 million.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 June 2016
1 Basis of preparation
The Alumasc Group plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), and the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and equity settled share based 
payments which are stated at their fair value.
The financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis with the Alumasc Group plc consolidated financial statements. As permitted 
by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the company profit and loss account is not presented. The profit for the year after tax was 
£9,771,000 (2015: loss £5,443,000).
Transition to Adopted IFRSs
The company is preparing its financial statements in accordance with Adopted IFRS for the first time and consequently has applied IFRS 1.  
An explanation of how the transition to Adopted IFRSs has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows  
of the company is provided in note 21.
Going concern
The company participates in the Alumasc group’s overall borrowing facilities and treasury operations are managed on a centralised basis 
throughout the group. The company’s borrowings are subject to cross-guarantees and offset arrangements with positive cash balances 
elsewhere in the group. 
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in 
the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 25. The financial position of the group, its cash flows and liquidity position are set out in these financial 
statements. Details of the group’s borrowing facilities are described within note 10. 
The group has committed borrowing facilities of £12.5 million which expire in August 2020. In addition, the group has recently renewed 
overdraft facilities totalling £2 million for another year. At 30 June 2016 the group’s net cash resources were £8.6 million (2015: £0.9 million).
On the basis of the group’s financing facilities and current operating and financial plans and sensitivity analyses, the Board is satisfied  
that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly continues to adopt  
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Further information is set out in the viability statement on page 21.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial 
statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 July 2014 for the purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRSs. Prior year 
financial information has been re-stated accordingly to reflect the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS.
The following new standard, amendment and interpretation is effective for the period beginning on or after 1 July 2015 and has been adopted 
for the company financial statements where appropriate with no material impact on the disclosures made by the company:
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
Judgments and estimates
The key source of estimation uncertainty that has a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year is the measurement and valuation of defined benefit pension obligations. Measurement of defined benefit pension 
obligations requires estimation of future changes in inflation, mortality rates and the selection of a suitable discount rate (see note 12).
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises  
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable  
to making the asset capable of operating as intended. 
Under IFRS transitional provisions, the company elected to bring in previous valuations of freehold and long leasehold land and buildings  
at a valuation frozen under FRS 15, and these amounts are carried forward at deemed cost.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The cost of other property, plant and equipment is written off by equal monthly instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings  – 25 to 50 years
Long leasehold property  –  over the period of the lease to a maximum of 50 years
Plant and equipment  – 3 to 15 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, each part is accounted for as a separate item. Useful lives 
and residual values are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively. The Alumasc Group plc

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Impairment of fixed assets
The company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, 
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the company makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. 
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Leased assets
Assets held under leasing arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the company are classified as 
finance leases and are capitalised with a corresponding liability being recognised for the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and rentals 
payable are charged in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Financial assets
When financial assets are recognised initially under IAS 39, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus directly  
attributable transaction costs.
Pension costs
The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which is constituted as a separately administered fund and which is closed to future 
accrual. Deficit reduction contributions are agreed with the pension trustees on the basis of actuarial advice to fund this scheme. The company 
also operates defined contribution schemes where agreed contractual contributions are paid into separately administered funds.
(i)  Defined benefit pensions
Prior to the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future benefit accrual, the cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan  
was determined using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current 
service cost) and is based on actuarial advice.
The company determines finance income/expense for the period relating to the defined benefit pension scheme by applying the discount rate 
used for valuing the scheme’s liabilities to the value of the net pension liability at the beginning of the year.
The net pension scheme finance costs are charged to finance costs within the statement of comprehensive income. The expense  
of administering the pension scheme is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income. These comprise, for scheme assets, the difference 
between the expected and actual return on assets, and, for scheme liabilities, the difference between the actuarial assumptions and actual 
experience, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the statement of financial position comprises the total of the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds), and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the 
obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid 
price. The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any 
amount the company expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
(ii) Defined contribution pensions
The pension cost charge to the statement of comprehensive income of the company’s defined contribution schemes represents the 
contributions payable by the company to the funds. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the company in independently 
administered funds. 90

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based  
on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 
that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, where the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the year end  
date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised in the income statement.
Own shares
The Alumasc Group plc shares held by the company are classified in shareholders’ equity as ‘own shares’ and are recognised at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale  
and the original cost being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue  
or cancellation of equity shares.
Equity settled share based payment transactions
The fair value of long term incentive awards and share options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense from the date  
of grant, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.  
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares for which the related service and non-market  
vesting conditions are met.
Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, or revalued amount, less provisions for impairment where appropriate.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its, and the group’s exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and  
are subsequently re-measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the statement  
of comprehensive income. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends  
on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar  
maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate cap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. 
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how 
effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such items are expected at inception to be highly effective. The Alumasc Group plc

Strategic Report

Financial Statements
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments and hedging (continued)
For the purpose of hedge accounting, the hedges used by the company are classified as cash flow hedges, as they hedge exposure to variability 
in cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the statement  
of comprehensive income. 
The portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge is initially recognised directly in equity,  
while the ineffective portion is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement at the time when the underlying transaction being hedged affects profit  
or loss, such as when the forecast sale or purchase of the hedged item occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset  
or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the statement of 
comprehensive income.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction being hedged occurs and are transferred to the income 
statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur,  
the amount is taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision is made when  
there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to recover balances in full. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance 
revenue and finance costs. Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense over the period to the maturity of the underlying instrument.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Where the company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for 
example under an insurance policy, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when recovery is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to any provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement. 
New standards and interpretations not applied
The company is currently assessing the impact that IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ will have on the company’s assets  
and liabilities. 92

In August 2015 the group entered into a £12.5 million committed revolving credit facility which expires in August 2020. The group has  
the option to cancel and repay elements of the committed facility at short notice should it wish to do so. The following financial covenants 
applied to the facility: group interest cover, based on underlying EBITDA (i.e. from continuing operations and before non-recurring items),  
to be at least four times; and net debt as a multiple of underlying EBITDA (i.e. from continuing operations and before non-recurring items)  
to be below three times.
Group interest cover was 44.2 times at 30 June 2016 (2015: 17.3 times) whilst the net debt (net debt plus contingent liabilities) multiple  
of EBITDA was zero given the group’s net cash position at 30 June 2016 (2015: 0.1 times). 
At 30 June 2016 the group also had £3 million (2015: £3 million) of bank overdraft facilities repayable on demand. The Directors chose  
to reduce the group’s overdraft facilities to £2 million on annual renewal post the year end. The Alumasc Group plc

The company’s net debt position at 30 June 2016 was £16.6 million (2015: £19.5 million). 
The company’s overdraft and revolving credit banking facilities are part of the group’s overall credit facilities and are subject to cross guarantees 
from other group companies. The group as a whole had net cash resources at 30 June 2016 of £8.6 million (2015: £0.9 million).

Foreign currency risk
The group has transactional currency exposures as noted within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The company manages this risk 
in part, through the use of forward currency contracts. None of the derivative financial instruments held at 30 June 2016 or 30 June 2015 related 
to derivative trading activity. Where cash flow hedge accounting is applied, gains or losses on the financial instrument hedges are held in equity 
and only recognised in the income statement when the losses or gains on the hedged transactions are recognised in the income statement.
Hedging activities
The net fair values of the company’s derivative financial instruments at 30 June designated as hedging instruments are set out below:
    2016 2015

Forward foreign exchange contracts    (273) –
At 30 June 2016 the company had forward foreign exchange contracts with principal amounts equivalent to £3,039,000 (2015: £nil).  
The forward foreign exchange contracts hedge foreign currency price risks of sales across the group. The cash flows associated with the 
forward foreign exchange hedges are generally expected to occur within the next 12 months.
The derivative financial instruments carried at fair value have been valued using directly observable market inputs and therefore they  
are all considered to have been valued at Level 2, as described in the amendments to IFRS 7.  The Alumasc Group plc

12 Retirement benefit obligations
Defined contribution schemes
£79,000 (2015: £89,000) was charged to operating profit in the statement of comprehensive income for defined contribution pension scheme 
contributions. At 30 June 2016 there was an accrual of £75,000 payable in respect of defined contribution schemes (2015: £15,000).
Defined benefit scheme
The company participates in a defined benefit scheme, The Alumasc Group Pension Scheme, which has been closed to future accrual since 2010.
The defined benefit scheme maintained by the company is a multi-employer scheme. For the purpose of allocating the total assets and liabilities 
of the scheme between the various group companies, the Directors have used as a basis the existing participating employer or the participating 
employer at the point of the employee leaving employment.
Following the conclusion of the 2013 triennial actuarial review in the 2013/14 financial year, deficit reduction contributions increased from 
£90,000 to £110,000 per year, with effect from 1 July 2014. 
The principal assumptions used by the actuary in valuing the assets and liabilities of the Scheme for IAS 19 purposes were:
    2016 2015
    % %
Discount rate    3.0 3.7
Expected rate of deferred pension increases    1.9 2.3
Future pension increases    1.7 – 3.5 1.7 – 3.7

Consumer Price Index inflation rate    1.9 2.3

Post retirement mortality:    
Current pensioners at 65 – male    22.2 22.4
Current pensioners at 65 – female    23.9 24.1
Future pensioners at 65 in 2036 – male    23.9 24.1
Future pensioners at 65 in 2036 – female    25.4 25.6
A discount rate of 3.0% has been used in calculating the present value of liabilities of the pension scheme at 30 June 2016. A 0.1% change  
to this rate would have changed the present value of the pension fund liabilities at that date by approximately £75,000 before tax. 
A Retail Price Index inflation rate of 2.9% and a Consumer Price Index inflation rate of 1.9% have been used in calculating the present value 
of liabilities of the pension scheme at 30 June 2016. A 0.1% change to these rates would have changed the present value of the pension fund 
liabilities at that date by approximately £26,000 before tax.
In valuing the liabilities of the pension scheme at 30 June 2016, mortality assumptions have been assumed as indicated above. If life expectancy 
had been changed to assume that all members of the scheme live for one year longer on average, the value of the reported liabilities at  
30 June 2016 would have increased by approximately £230,000 before tax.
The following information relates to the company’s element of the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
The combined assets and liabilities of the scheme at 30 June are:

Share capital and share premium
The balances classified as share capital and share premium are the proceeds of the nominal value and premium value respectively on issue  
of the company’s equity share capital net of issue costs. 
Capital reserve – own shares
The capital reserve – own shares relates to 622,528 (2015: 485,171) ordinary own shares held by the company. The market value of shares  
at 30 June 2016 was £756,372 (2015: £802,958). These are held to help satisfy the exercise of awards under the company’s Long Term 
Incentive Plans. A Trust holds the shares in its name and shares are awarded to employees on request by the company. The company bears  
the expenses of the Trust.
Hedging reserve
This reserve records the post-tax portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an  
effective hedge.
Distributable reserves
In connection with the capital reorganisation in 2007, the company reached agreement with the Pension Trustees that £14 million of the  
profit and loss account reserve would be retained as a non-distributable reserve until the group’s pension deficits reduced below £14 million  
(as determined by full actuarial valuations). Therefore the Directors consider that £14 million of the company profit and loss account reserve 
remains non-distributable. 
In addition, cumulative actuarial losses relating to defined benefit pension schemes of £1,073,000 within the profit and loss account reserve  
are non-distributable (2015: losses of £831,000).

Under UK GAAP the pension deficit shown on the face of the statement of financial position is disclosed net of the related deferred tax asset. 
However, under IFRS the pension deficit is shown gross with the associated deferred tax asset disclosed separately within non-current assets.
At 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2015, the related deferred tax asset was £166,000 and £195,000 respectively. These assets have therefore been 
reclassified above to non-current deferred tax assets.
(c) Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities in respect of accelerated capital allowances with a value under UK GAAP of £18,000 at 1 July 2014 and £17,000 at  
30 June 2015 have been restated under IFRS to a value of £211,000 at 1 July 2014 and £210,000 at 30 June 2015. As required by IFRS 1  
the resultant net asset impact has been taken to retained earnings.
Further to this, deferred tax assets of £1,000 at 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2015 in respect of short term timing differences have been reclassified 
on the face of the statement of financial position to non-current assets. These were previously included within deferred tax liabilities given the 
immaterial value and nature of the asset. The Alumasc Group plc

whichever is earlier. No purchases pursuant to this authority have been made during the year. Renewal of this authority will be proposed at the

interest of shareholders and could be expected to result in an increase in earnings per share.

Explanatory notes to the Resolutions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12 to be proposed at the 2016 Annual General Meeting
Resolution 4 – Re-election of John McCall
Your Board recommends that John McCall be re-elected as a Director.
Resolution 5 – Re-election of Paul Hooper
Your Board recommends that Paul Hooper be re-elected as a Director.
Resolutions 6 to 8 – Re-election of Jon Pither, Philip Gwyn and Richard Saville
Your Board recommends that Jon Pither, Philip Gwyn and Richard Saville be re-elected as Directors. As they have served on the Board for longer than 
nine years, and in order to comply with the best practice provisions of The Code, they offer themselves for re-election.
The Board has concluded that the five Directors standing for re-election are effective, committed to their role, and subject to 
shareholder approval, should continue in office. The biographical details of each Director is set out on pages 26 and 27 of the  
Annual Report 2016. 
Resolution 10 – Renewal of Directors’ authority to allot shares
By virtue of Section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 the Directors require the authority of shareholders of the Company to allot shares or other 
relevant securities of the Company, Resolution 10 authorises the Directors to make allotments of up to an additional 12,044,519 shares (being 
approximately one third of the issued share capital of the Company as at 31 August 2016). This authority will lapse at the conclusion of the next 
annual general meeting, unless renewed earlier. The Directors have no present intention to exercise the authority proposed to be conferred by 
Resolution 10.
Resolution 11 – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights
By virtue of Section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 any issue by the Company of equity capital for cash made otherwise than to existing 
shareholders on a proportional basis requires the consent of the shareholders of the Company unless the Company has obtained the authority of the 
shareholders under Section 571 of the Act. The purpose of Resolution 11 is to authorise the Directors to allot shares by way of rights or pursuant to 
an open offer or otherwise than strictly pro rata when they consider it expedient to do so and allows them to issue for cash up to 1,806,677 shares 
other than on a pre-emptive basis (representing 5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 31 August 2016).
Resolution 12 – Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
The Directors consider it desirable that the Company should have the authority to make market purchases of its own shares. The purpose of Resolution 
12 is to authorise the Directors generally to purchase up to 5,383,900 ordinary shares in the market (being 14.9% of the issued share capital of the 
Company as at 31 August 2016). The Directors will only exercise the authority granted by Resolution 12 (if passed) if to do so would result in an increase 
in earnings per share and is in the best interests of shareholders generally. This authority will lapse on the 26 October 2017, unless renewed earlier.

Our profile
Interserve is a services, maintenance
and building group. We provide
services across the whole life of
many types of buildings and
infrastructure such as hospitals,
schools, offices, industrial plant,
bridges, waterworks or roads. We
offer our services at each stage of
the asset lifecycle: we build, we help
others build by hiring them
equipment, we maintain, we support
operations and we replace. Around
70 per cent of our services are
delivered into the built environment
and 30 per cent to plant and
infrastructure.
A common theme throughout our
services is that we manage complex
environments to enable our clients’
businesses to run more effectively.
The core competencies that enable
us to deliver the services our
customers need are:
• Service integration
• Direct delivery and supply chain
management
• Productivity improvement
• Development of long-term working
relationships
• Driving and managing change
Increasingly our customers wish to
buy more services from fewer
suppliers. With our breadth of skills
and services, we are able to respond
to that customer need and to deliver
a ‘one-stop-shop’, integrated service.
Private Finance Initiative (PFI)
projects are an excellent example of
where the customer wants to work
with an organisation that can design,
build, operate, maintain, replace and
finance their asset. Our ability to
tailor our services to meet individual
client needs by harnessing expertise
from across the Group differentiates
us and means that we can achieve
growth with existing clients by
delivering additional services. For
example, in a number of cases we
are developing facilities management
(FM) services from our existing
construction framework agreements.
Interserve’s value chain shows how
our services support the creation and
management of assets throughout
their lives and how we add value at
each stage. Our strategy is to build
long-term relationships, and these
can relate to any of the links in the
value chain, although our longest
contracts are for operational and
maintenance services.

Works bills (pass-through costs on certain MoD
contracts on which no margin can be earned)
were £60.9m (2004: £114.5m).
2
Headline profit comprises profit on ordinary
activities before taxation of £47.9m (2004:
£41.4m) less profit on disposal of property and
investments of £0.2m (2004: £2.2m).
3
Headline earnings per share are based on profit
attributable to equity holders of £29.9m (2004:
£27.5m) less profit on disposal of property and
investments of £0.2m (2004: £2.2m).
In my first statement as Chairman of
Interserve I am pleased to report
that the Group made good progress
in 2005, delivering strong results
and advancing our strategy to
develop as an added-value
infrastructure and facilities
management provider.
We traded well in most markets,
with the bulk of our revenue
reflecting our focus on long-term
customer relationships.
Our results are summarised in the
table below:
Dividend
The directors are recommending a
final dividend of 10.1p (2004: 9.7p),
bringing the total dividend for the
year to 14.7p (2004: 14.1p). 
Subject to shareholder approval 
at the Annual General Meeting, 
the final dividend will be paid on 
9 June 2006 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on
24 March 2006.
Board
Several changes were implemented
during the year as part of a planned
Board succession. This involved my
appointment and that of one other
non-executive director, Les Cullen,
together with the retirements of
John Padovan and Mike Bottjer, both
of whom left with the gratitude of
the Board for their contribution to
the Group. Mike left the Board on 
31 December 2005 after 43 years’
service with the Group, 26 of which
were as a director, having been
Chairman since 1996. On behalf of
the Board and all colleagues in the
Group, I would like to thank Mike
for his leadership over many years
covering a period in which the
Group has made remarkable
progress.
People
Our results are testimony to the 
hard work, skill and enthusiasm of
our people. During my first months
with the Group I have been able to
meet many of our teams and have
been consistently impressed with
their energy, professionalism and
dedication to customer service
across our broad spectrum of
services and operating
environments. On behalf of the
Board, I thank them for their
performance in 2005 and look
forward to their continued
commitment in the future.
Prospects
In light of the earnings progress
made in 2005, together with
favourable trading conditions,
particularly in our Middle Eastern
markets, the Board remains
confident of the Group’s
encouraging prospects for continued
growth. We have excellent forward
visibility, in both workload and
opportunities, are well-positioned in
our markets and have skilled
management in place with a clear
strategic plan and a determination
to succeed.

Business overview
Our overall performance in 2005 was
strong. Key drivers were the growing
trend towards public sector
outsourcing in the UK together with
an increased level of activity in our
Middle Eastern businesses enabled
by timely investment in people,
systems and business infrastructure. 
The highlights of our 2005
performance were:
• A strong set of results driven by
the performance of Facilities,
Project and Equipment Services
• Continued focus on driving
through strategic change in
Industrial Services
• Headline profit
1
grew by 21.7 per
cent to £47.7 million (2004: £39.2
million) 
• 77 per cent of revenue was
generated from long-term client
relationships (2004: 75 per cent) 
• UK future workload remains very
strong, standing at £4.8 billion at
the year end (2004: £4.9 billion)
• Growing contribution from our PFI
portfolio

Operations
A segmental analysis of results is
shown on page 64 of this report.
The Group reports under six
headings: we have five market-
facing divisions and 
a sixth, Group Services, which
principally represents our PFI
bidding activity, a range of
centrally-provided services and the
costs of the Board. Group Services’
overall cost was £14.8 million (2004:
£12.0 million). This net increase was
substantially due to a greater level
of investment in PFI bidding costs as
we pursue growth in this long-term
market, with some incremental
impact from share-based payments.
Facilities Services drives structural,
cultural and performance change
into the processes that support the
occupancy of the built environment.
Increasingly our clients and
prospective clients are seeking to
consolidate their supply chain
solutions into larger, broader-based
contracts as the UK outsourcing
market continues to become more
sophisticated. By combining an
anticipation of these trends with our
integration, management and
delivery capabilities, we believe we
are well positioned to deliver on
growing client expectation and to
maintain our competitive
advantage.
Our 2005 performance was
excellent, resulting in a 39 per cent
increase in operating profit to £17.8
million (2004: £12.8 million). The
majority of this increase came from
volume growth in existing contracts
in the defence, health and
education sectors, together with the
ramp-up of activity on new MoD
Prime contracts mobilised during
the year. Margins on revenue (net of
works bills) further improved to 4.6
per cent (2004: 3.9 per cent).

Proportions of Group revenues
Significant developments during
the year included:
• Financial close on three
significant new contracts:
• South East Regional Prime, 
worth some £400 million
• Newcastle Hospitals PFI project, 
worth over £130 million
• Telford & Wrekin Schools PFI 
project, worth over £40 million 
to the division
• Five major contract mobilisations:
• University College London
Hospital PFI project –
concentration of facilities
management (FM) activities 
in a new 595-bed acute 
health and teaching facility 
in central London
• Dudley Group of Hospitals PFI
project – migration from four
existing facilities in the West
Midlands to a new 757-bed
acute centre
• South Atlantic Prime –
operational and logistics
support for the MoD on
Ascension Island and the
Falklands
• Project Armada – delivery 
of FM services for the Fleet
Accommodation Centre in
Devonport naval base
• Defence Sixth Form College –
migration of FM and bursarial
services to a new purpose-built
residential teaching facility in
Loughborough
Through focusing on complex
outsourcing projects, typically
involving the supply of a broad
range of services with an integrated
management and direct delivery
role, we develop durable and
committed relationships with our
clients. This, together with our
ability to deliver continuous
performance improvement, was a
significant factor in again achieving 
a client retention rate in excess of
90 per cent.
Industrial Services delivers a range
of maintenance-led services, co-
ordinated through a single-point
relationship with our clients. Much
of our work is undertaken in safety-
critical environments, where our
ability to combine continuous
improvement and the breadth of our
service offering set us apart from
our competitors. 
Our strategy is to develop a broad-
based presence in the UK industrial
facilities management market,
generating revenue dominated by
maintenance-led services, the aim
of which is to enhance visibility and
reduce risk by diluting our historic
reliance on cyclical markets and
‘one-off’ projects. Whilst we
continue to make progress in
developing new revenue streams
and customers in line with this
strategy, its implementation has
been more protracted than at first
anticipated and we have faced a
number of issues relating to the
conclusion of legacy contracts. This,
together with the cost of further
investment in management
resources and improved control
systems, has impacted operating
profit, which was £6.3 million
(2004: £10.1 million) on 
revenue of £163.5 million
(2004: £164.5 million). 
During the year we made further
progress towards our strategic goals,
achieving a more evenly balanced
segmentation of revenue within which
the oil and gas sector accounted for
around 15 per cent of activity
(2004: 28 per cent) and increasing
the proportion of revenue from 
long-term relationships to above 
60 per cent (2004: 55 per cent).
Other developments included:
• an initial five-year contract with
BAA for building fabric, mechanical
and electrical maintenance at
Heathrow Airport Terminals 1-4,
worth around £50 million
• an initial three-year agreement
with British Energy to provide a
range of maintenance services at
Hartlepool, Hunterston, Sizewell
and Torness nuclear power
stations, worth in aggregate 
some £30 million
• a number of further contracts in
the high voltage power
transmission market, including a
framework agreement with
National Grid, contributing to
over 20 per cent growth in this
part of our business
• strong growth in our
environmental services business
(formed in 2004), providing
asbestos surveying, testing and
remediation services to clients
such as Thomas Cook, British Gas,
Circle 33 Housing Group, Slough

Longer-term relationships Projects
and shorter-term
relationships Our client retention rate was again
over 90 per cent, reflecting the
durability of the relationships we
form. Our ability to deliver
productivity improvements through
outsourcing in a range of complex,
safety-critical operations, together
with the breadth of service range in
both process and the built
environments, provides our clients
with a highly differentiated
offering. We see a trend amongst
our industrial clients to ‘bundle’
their procurement of services
through integrated contracts and,
increasingly, believe we have a
range of opportunities to extend our
role further, through leveraging the
capabilities of other parts of the
Group, and offering a ‘total’ FM
product to the industrial market.
Project Services provides a
comprehensive service covering all
stages of the design and
construction process in the UK and
certain overseas markets. Whilst the
time, cost and quality of on-site
delivery are vitally important in our
risk management, increasingly,
critical differentiators for our
clients are derived from our early
involvement in feasibility, pre-
design, procurement and just-in-
time production/fabrication
processes as well as in after-care
and maintenance activities. 
Our strategy is to work with clients
who look for this increased level of
involvement and partnering with
their supply chain and who
recognise the advantages of
procuring services from a ‘one-stop-
shop’ provider. In the UK this
approach is manifested in our focus

million). In the UK we completed a
number of large contracts including
Peterborough Prison, Liberty
Stadium in Swansea, the Defence
Sixth Form College near
Loughborough and the HM Revenue
& Customs’ Newcastle Estate
development, which contributed to
strengthened margins of 2.4 per
cent (2004: 2.1 per cent) and
growth in UK operating profit to
£12.2 million (2004: £11.2 million). 
Developments in the UK during the
year included:
• further progress with framework
agreements:
• a five-year, £400 million, 
agreement (in joint venture) 
for United Utilities 
• a seven-year, £175 million, 
agreement for HM Prison 
Service
• cumulative orders to date of 
over £275 million in NHS 
ProCure21
• growing relationships with BT , 
Barclays, Mapeley and the 
Highways Agency
• a new agreement with the 
Home Office
• further PFI/PPP successes:
• financial close on the Telford & 
Wrekin Schools PFI project, 
worth some £60 million to 
the division
• preferred bidder on the 
Addiewell Prison PFI project
Our international operations are an
important element in Project
Services’ strategy. They delivered an
outstanding performance, increasing
their aggregate contribution to total
operating profit by 56 per cent to
£6.1 million (2004: £3.9 million).
Our businesses, in Dubai, Qatar and
Oman, focus on being their clients’
contractor of choice, building
reputational strength for performing
on technically and logistically
complex projects. Market conditions
have been buoyant in the Middle
East, fuelled by oil price movements
and further expansion in tourism
and real estate, backed increasingly
by government policies to encourage
development. 
Notable successes in the year
included:
• completion of the Mall of the
Emirates, Dubai, reported to be
the third largest shopping centre 
in the world, comprising over
240,000 square metres of retail
space for 440 tenants
• new contracts for the Wafi Raffles

Equipment Services provides
temporary structural equipment
solutions for complex infrastructure
projects. The business operates in
many major construction economies
and we differentiate ourselves on
the basis of our design and
engineering expertise, client
relationship management and the
breadth of our integrated product
range. 
Our strategy is to operate across a
wide range of geographies and
market sectors to mitigate the
effects of inherent country-specific
cyclicality, whilst focusing on
boosting efficiency through
enhancing the composition,
procurement and deployment of our
centrally-coordinated fleet. Our
design services are delivered from
three centres of excellence in the
UK, UAE and Australia. We rank
fourth by revenue in terms of global
competitors and aim to be the
leading player in our chosen
geographies and niche markets.
Our 2005 performance was excellent
and benefited from the significant
fleet investment made in 2004,
which enabled growth in most
markets, particularly in the Middle
East. Operating profit grew by some
40 per cent to £20.5 million (2004:
£14.6 million) on revenue of £107.2
million (2004: £87.7 million), an
increase of 22 per cent. 
The business generates revenue
through both hire contracts and
equipment sales (of both new and
used components). Hire income,
which typically accounts for about
half of our revenue, increased by 18
per cent. Revenue from equipment
sales grew by 31 per cent, fuelled in
particular by a number of unusually
large orders in the Middle East.
Overall the significant volume
growth led to an improvement in
operating margin to 19.1 per cent
(2004: 16.6 per cent).
Regionally:
Middle East – Our performance was
outstanding. Through early
investment and excellent market
conditions, our operations in the
region have more than trebled in
size in the last few years. Having
already invested significantly in
design capabilities in the region, we
see further opportunity and are now
focusing on the expansion of our
materials storage and handling
infrastructure, management
development and management
information systems. 
Australasia – Having experienced
softer market conditions in later
2004 and early 2005, our Australian
business showed improving
performance throughout the second-
half, with recovery being led by
infrastructure investment in
Queensland and through the 
La Serna Bridge
Three tonnes of Interserve formwork
and falsework were used in the
construction of La Serna Bridge

largest single building project for
which we have undertaken formwork
and falsework design and supply in
the Middle East to date.

introduction of new products, such
as Alshor Plus, to the fleet. Market
conditions in New Zealand were less
favourable, with increasing
competition; however, our operation
is lean on cost and the introduction
of a number of new products should
enable a niche-based approach
going forward.
Europe – The UK infrastructure
market was quiet in 2005 with a
number of high-profile projects
suffering delayed starts, particularly
in the roads sector. We took the
opportunity to improve cost-
efficiencies through a branch
rationalisation programme and
through a reorganisation of our sales
force into a sector-based structure.
Albeit there are some encouraging
signs in terms of project start-ups in
roads, any material upturn in the UK
market is expected only in the
medium term. Our Spanish operation
had a strong year, benefiting from a
significant investment in a new
depot and the associated fleet
expansion this enabled.
Far East – We had a strong year in
Hong Kong but were frustrated in
Korea, where progress was hindered
by the prolonged delay of a major
project. Whilst this specific issue
has now been resolved, our priority
in Korea is to make good progress
with market entry into new sectors,
such as high-rise residential
building. We have significantly
retrenched our position in Taiwan,
with any future business being
operated on an export basis from
other locations. 
PFI Investments is a growing
element of our overall business mix.
Whilst our core strategic interest in
PFI/PPP projects is as a significant
channel to market for our Facilities
Services and Project Services
businesses, the investment
opportunities associated with the
project financial structures are
attractive to the Group and we 
are an active primary investor in
projects where we have a direct
involvement in the downstream
facilities management and/or
construction services. 
We manage our investment
activities through a centrally-run
team, which is responsible for co-
ordinating Group-wide business
development activities, particularly
in the PPP market. This involves
leading the bidding process for PFI
opportunities, managing our
investment portfolio and, in many
cases, delivering management
services to Special Purpose
Companies.
2005 performance from our PFI
investments was good. Operating
profit was £0.6 million (2004: £0.6
million). However, the pre-tax
contribution (including net interest
receivable on subordinated debt
investments) grew by 23 per cent to
£3.2 million (2004: £2.6 million),
reflecting an increase both in the
number of investments and their
overall maturity: 18 out of our 23
projects have reached the
operational stage in their life cycle
(2004: 13 out of 21 projects). There
were no disposals during the year. 
We achieved financial close on two
projects, those being for Telford &
Wrekin Borough Council and for the
Newcastle Hospitals NHS Trust, with
a combined equity commitment of
£8.7 million. In both cases
Interserve will deliver facilities
management services over the life
of the concession, and at Telford &
Wrekin we are well advanced in the
design and build stage of the
project. This takes the total
committed value of our PFI
investment portfolio to £49.5
million (2004: £42.4 million).
We were appointed preferred bidder
on two further projects, for Holy
Cross School in Northern Ireland,
where we will deliver facilities
management services, and for the
Scottish Prison Service at Addiewell
Prison, where we will deliver the
design and build stage of the
project. The combined equity
requirement of these projects will
be around £4.5 million.
Health and safety remains a key
priority for all our operations,
wherein our objective is to achieve
an accident-free environment. To
this end we continue to invest in
ensuring that we provide a safe and
healthy environment for our
employees, the contractors working
with us and for the clients to whom
we deliver our services. We operate
under established safety
management arrangements that are
actively monitored through audit by
safety professionals and inspection
by senior management, including

in a further reduction in the rate of

Our performance and commitment
to continuous improvement was
recognised in two British Safety
Council International Safety Awards
and in a total of 15 safety awards
from the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA).
Strategy and outlook
The Group is well placed to make
further progress as an infrastructure
and facilities management provider,
delivering services at each stage of
the asset lifecycle. 
The UK facilities management
market continues to provide an
attractive breadth and quality of
opportunities, particularly in
relation to the integrated, broad-
based offering on which we focus.
Long-term relationships continue to
dominate the work-mix within
Facilities Services, with over 95 per
cent of 2005 revenue being derived
from such sources. Our future
workload at the end of 2005 was
£3.3 billion (2004: £3.2 billion),
within which our longest contracts
extend over 30 years. 
The UK industrial facilities
management market continues to
develop towards the model of multi-
service contracts in which we
specialise. We remain convinced 
that the change programme being
implemented in our business will
position us well to access the
growth opportunities in markets
such as nuclear decommissioning,
high voltage power transmission,
and environmental services. At the
end of 2005 our future workload was
£659 million (2004: £690 million).
The outlook for the UK construction
market is mixed, although the
sectors on which we concentrate
remain the focus of government
investment policy. Progress with our
framework activities is encouraging;
however, following the completion
of the major contracts mentioned
earlier, future workload in the UK
for Project Services at 31 December
2005 stood at £790 million (2004:
£930 million). Internationally,
market conditions in the Middle East
remain very buoyant and we expect
to deliver further growth in this
region.
Contract durations and sales lead-
times are generally shorter in
Equipment Services than in other
parts of our business; however,
forward visibility of our workload
has improved through investments
made in our systems to track
opportunities and predict market
trends. Our markets continue to
offer favourable trading conditions
and with the recent investment in
our operations we are very well
placed to take advantage of these.
Nevertheless, we do not expect, in
the short term, to repeat the
exceptional level of performance
achieved in 2005.
Demand for infrastructure projects
delivered through Public/Private
Partnerships remains strong in the
UK and our opportunity and bidding
pipeline remains healthy, comprising
over 40 projects in our chosen
sectors. The downstream services
activities associated with our PFI
project investments represent over
60 per cent of our total future
workload and provide the Group
with an excellent source of high
visibility, high quality earnings flow.
Our expertise in delivering
outsourced services, maintenance
and building activities and in
developing long-term relationships
with our clients remains central to
our growth strategy. Overall healthy
trading conditions, together with
the excellent visibility of our future
workload, underpin our confidence
in achieving continued growth.

When the Ministry of Defence set out to find a
partner to create and run its new sixth form
college, it was breaking new ground in several
ways. The innovative solution developed by
Interserve was equally unusual.
The MoD's Strategic Defence Review was one
of the key drivers behind the Defence Training
Review published in March 2001. This
identified an increased demand for
technically-trained officers in the changing
military environment and proposed the
foundation of a new Defence Sixth Form
College (DSFC). This would be purpose-built
with modern educational facilities and would
replace the highly-respected Army Sixth Form
College at Welbeck Abbey that had been
operating since 1953.
The new college would be quad-service,
encompassing not just the Army but also the
Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and MoD civil
service. It would be built from scratch on a
former barracks site near Loughborough,
Leicestershire and, for such a long-term
commitment, the MoD chose PFI as the most
appropriate procurement route. Following a
rigorous selection process the Interserve
consortium, known as Minerva, was awarded
the contract.
Uniquely, the DSFC is the first school or
college in the UK being operated entirely
through a PFI:  the construction, facilities
management and educational services are all 
outsourced to the private sector. As an
integrated support services group with long
experience of working with the MoD and with
one of the largest portfolios of PFI contracts,
Interserve had the capabilities and capacity to
undertake both the construction of the college
and its subsequent management; to
complement these skills it brought in a
specialist partner, TQ Education and Training,
to provide the educational expertise.
Equally unusual is the fact that performance
measures in the contract include an element
based on academic achievement: the system
will assess the value added to students at A
level by comparing their results with a
benchmark derived from their GCSE
performance.
The speed and efficiency of the bidding 
process was testimony to the MoD’s
commitment and to Interserve’s understanding
of the client’s requirements. The Industry Day,
the MoD’s forum for discussing the project 
with potential suppliers, was in November
2001, only 15 months before the preferred
bidder was announced, and three months later
the 30-year contract was signed - a record for 
an MoD accommodation-related project.
Construction took just 16 months and the
college welcomed its first students in
September 2005. The buildings are grouped 
into four zones with unrestricted access 
across a wide expanse of sports fields:
• The central forum contains the entrance
concourse hall, dining rooms and kitchen,
the main hall, administration, medical wing,
student club and learning resource centre.
• A bright and airy teaching wing includes 
high-specification, computer-networked
laboratories, workshops and classrooms.
• Student accommodation is flexible,
comprising five boarding houses and
integrated houses for residential house
staff. 
• The fourth zone consists of the parade
ground and extensive sports facilities.
The college employs just over 30 teaching 
and 50 support staff and has a capacity of 
340 students, delivering around 170 young 
men and women educated to A-level standard 
each year. In keeping with the technical 
bias, the curriculum is geared to the pure 
and applied sciences, information technology
and mathematics.
Speaking at the time of the official opening,
Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram said,
“Welbeck offers its students an education 
that is unique anywhere in the United
Kingdom, matched by resources and
opportunities that are second to none. 
I congratulate the Defence Academy and 
the Minerva Consortium on their constructive
partnership to provide this excellent, 
purpose-built college.”

7 July 2005 is a date likely to be remembered
for many years to come. It was a day when, as
the tragedy of the London bombings unfolded,
many people were faced with extreme
situations where their reactions could make a
real difference to the lives of others.
Interserve staff were deeply involved in two of
the most critical areas: at University College
Hospital (UCH), to which many of the
casualties were rushed; and with the
Metropolitan Police, handling the aftermath of
the events on the streets and below ground.
The new UCH building has recently been
completed as part of a PFI contract in which
Interserve provides comprehensive support
services across the medical campus in existing
facilities as well as new. At the time of the
explosions Interserve and the NHS Trust were
undertaking a phased transfer of the various
departments from the old premises to the
new.  Maria Kitching was Interserve's general
manager at UCH.
“We were in the middle of a highly complex
migration programme,” she explains. “If you
consider that we have over 300 staff in seven
disciplines, most of whom were adapting their
working methods to a completely different
environment and to the associated changes in
medical practices - while always staying on
top of the service we were delivering - you’ll
begin to see the scale of the management
task. About half the departments had moved
across at that stage. Accident and Emergency
was the first and had been running in the new
building for about four weeks when the bombs
went off. 
“We’d been through several dry runs as part of
London’s emergency planning exercises and
had handled a number of smaller incidents but
this was the biggest real one we’d dealt with,
as well as being the first in the new building -
and we were still moving in. Fortunately,
we’ve always regarded disaster planning as a
fundamental part of our operations, and the
plan was already in place.
“The first we knew of the attacks was when
our Duty Manager received a ‘Majax’ alert on
his duty pager.” (Majax is the term used for a
major incident.) “We alerted key staff through
our emergency bleep procedure and they then
attended the new hospital for a briefing from
the Trust’s Majax co-ordinator. Following the
meeting we immediately implemented our
disaster plan and adjusted our response
continually as the nature and scale of the
tragedy became apparent. 
“We deployed an extra 25 porters to deal with
the influx of around 90 patients to A&E on the
morning of the crisis. They helped the new
arrivals as well as managing the discharge and
transfer of some existing patients to the
Middlesex Hospital to make space for the
casualties - that’s also part of the Trust’s
estate and we provide the services there, too.
“As the news spread, many of our people who
were not on duty came in to add their
support. And as shifts ended, many who could
have left stayed on, which was a huge help
since it meant they could cover for those
who’d been unable to get to the site due to
the travel restrictions. The suddenly increased
numbers placed an extra requirement on our
catering staff who delivered an additional
1,000 meals for patients, staff and on-site
emergency services.
“We organised an extra 30 staff to cope with
the significant increase in cleaning and
laundry requirements, and our waste services
function, meanwhile, had to deal not only
with an increase in waste but also with the
constraints imposed as a result of the
potential for further explosive devices having
been placed in waste bins and loading bays.
Logistically the hospital required the ongoing
delivery of sterile services - that’s everything
surrounding the provision of sterile
instruments and packs and their collection and
sterilisation once used - and the rescheduling
of just-in-time deliveries to meet the spike in
demand.”
Interserve is also responsible for security at
the hospital, and as the city remained on high
alert an additional 50 security staff were
deployed to manage the establishment of
checkpoints and barriers at the hospital,
undertake searches, remove individuals
without security credentials and control the
traffic to accommodate the high number of
“code blue” ambulances.
Vital support at a critical time
Case studies Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005 17 18 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005
Meanwhile Interserve staff operating with the
Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) were equally
busy. Since 1999 Interserve has delivered an
exclusive service to the Metropolitan Police in
support of all major operational activities
associated with scenes of crime and major
incident response. The Special Events team of
highly trained staff works on a 24/365 basis to
support all the MPS’s major operational
activities, whether these are planned events,
such as Wimbledon and the London Marathon,
or in response to crimes, accidents or
disasters.
The team became aware of the terrorist
attacks on 7 July through the radio. As soon as
it was clear what had happened they loaded
two 7-tonne lorries with the kind of equipment
they knew from experience would be needed -
tarpaulins, emergency lighting, tents, body
bags, masks, traffic cones and much more -
and sent it to the location that would be co-
ordinating the MPS’s operational support.
“By the early afternoon it was obvious that
this was a major incident and we’d be heavily
involved,” comments Paul Starkey, Interserve’s
General Manager on the MPS contract. “One
immediate issue was organising sufficient staff
to support the police over such a wide area
while maintaining our cover for all the more
normal incidents - which, of course, continue 
to occur regardless of whether there’s been a
major incident. We brought in 20 additional
staff who are usually responsible for
maintaining the MPS’s properties and set up a
12-hour shift system with them working
alongside a similar number from our Special
Events core team.”
The MPS uses various buildings around London
to help manage such events. In this case it was
also necessary to co-opt other properties and
sites near the bomb locations, and Interserve
needed to set these up and run them for the
duration of the alert. They ranged from
command-and-control centres to bereavement
centres and casualty bureaux providing
information and comfort to relatives. “In effect
we had to create about 10 fully-functional
offices from scratch,” continues Starkey.
“Tables, chairs, paper, pens, boards, fridges,
kettles, air conditioning, fans, computers - and
it all needed to be assembled, wired up and
working.
“Then there were the incident locations
themselves - our teams were working in
conjunction with the police officers at the
four incident scenes within hours of the blasts,
providing water supplies, rubble sacks, gloves,
masks, goggles, body bags, lighting towers,
generators, brushes, disinfectant, footbaths,
tents, cutting tools and more. We keep a lot
of these items in stock, but the scale of this
incident was such that we had to hire and
procure a considerable amount on top of that.
As the days progressed we found ourselves
exhausting local supplies of the more unusual
equipment and had to look further afield. I
think the furthest source was a supplier in
Liverpool for some special-purpose head
lamps. We also established a rolling programme
for the replenishment of fuel supplies to
generators - and they got through a lot of fuel.
“Our key role was managing the logistics of
sourcing, delivering and deploying all this
equipment, in addition to dealing with the
rapid response for day-to-day emergency
work.” The nights were very busy initially and
the pressure kept up for almost two weeks as
the focus moved from dealing with the
casualties and the bereaved to running the
criminal investigation.
Throughout this time Interserve worked very
closely with the officers and staff of the MPS.
Malcolm O’Connor, the MPS’s Assistant Director
of Operational Support, summed up his
appreciation for the dedication of those
involved, saying, “Thank you to you and your
staff for your help in this policing challenge.
Throughout the crisis Interserve remained at
its core providing vital technical support and
solving procurement problems.”

Interserve - so much so that it forms
part of our mission statement. We
work actively to ensure an accident-
free environment for our
employees, the contractors who
work for us and members of the
public who interface with our
operations.
In 2005 we placed additional focus
on health and safety. Among the
initiatives we undertook were:
• The Chief Executive met the
Chairman of the Health and
Safety Commission to discuss the
Interserve approach
• We initiated an ongoing Group-
wide “Don't Walk By” campaign to
encourage everyone to play an
active role in achieving our
accident-free environment
• The Chief Executive wrote to
every employee specifically to
emphasise the importance of
health and safety in our
operations
• We have appointed a full-time
occupational health adviser
• Health and safety is the first item
on the agenda of every Board
meeting at both Plc and divisional
level
• All executive directors are
committed to undertaking a
programme of dedicated health
and safety visits to our

John Vyse is the executive director
nominated as the health and safety
director, and senior directors are
appointed with responsibility for
health and safety in each operating
division.
With the wide range of activities
carried out across the Group, our
workforce is exposed to a variety of
risks to their safety and health. We
engage with our regulators,
workforce, contractors and clients
to ensure risks are appropriately
identified and managed to current
best practice. Delivering a safe
workplace is a line management
responsibility and we provide robust
safety management systems and

Environment
Many of our activities improve the
working and living environments for
individuals and communities. We
have the opportunity to work with
our clients to provide innovative
solutions to minimise environmental
impact. For example, during the
year we completed the three-year
project to upgrade the Little Marlow
sewage treatment works. The work
not only doubled capacity but also
ensures that clean water is being
returned to local rivers.
We also recognise that our
operations have an environmental
impact and we are committed to
managing that impact to ensure we
are running a sustainable business.
We use the ISO 14001 standard to
develop appropriate environmental
management systems (EMSs) across
the Group. Project Services holds
ISO 14001 registration for all of its
core operations, and in Facilities
Services the Metropolitan Police,
Slough Borough Council, Office for
National Statistics and Carlisle
contracts are also registered.
Facilities Services will roll out a
corporate EMS to extend its
coverage and Industrial Services will
pursue a company-wide registration.
We are regular winners of
Considerate Constructors awards
through our Project Services division
and in 2005 received two Gold,
three Silver and one Bronze award.
We also received a National Gold
Green Apple Award for our work on
the River Gaunless Flood Alleviation
Scheme.
To help us focus on reducing our
environmental impact we have
adopted the following policy:
Group Environmental Policy
Statement
The policy of the Group is to
conduct its operations in an
environmentally sustainable
manner in order to protect the
environment for future
generations.
In implementing its policy the
Group will seek, through its
operating companies, to ensure:
• Compliance with relevant 
environmental legislation 
and regulation
• Prevention of pollution
• The efficient use of natural 
resources
• The minimisation of waste and 
emissions to air and water
• Environmental awareness of 
all employees
• Effective monitoring of 
environmental performance
• Continual improvement in 
environmental performance
The Group will set targets and
objectives for the improvement 
of environmental management 
and will publish details of its
environmental performance.
All employees have a role to play
in care of the environment. The
Group has appointed a director to
be responsible for environmental
issues, and environmental
responsibilities are allocated 
Corporate Social Responsibility continued
Landmarc supports RNLI 
Interserve subsidiary Landmarc
Support Services Limited launched its
support for the RNLI crew training
campaign to Train One and Save Many
with an initial corporate donation of
£5,000. Landmarc employees are also
supporting the campaign by organising
team and community events and
recycling toner and printer cartridges.
Cooking with Rick Stein
Celebrity chef Rick Stein was so
impressed with the efforts of Cornwall
Schools Meals Service to improve
school meals that he invited a group
of school cooks to spend a day at his
Padstow Seafood School to cook fresh
fish. Two of the attending cooks were
from the Cornwall School PFI project,
where Interserve provides FM services.
Photo: Nigel Millard at the RNLI to line management throughout
the organisation.
This policy will be subject to
periodic review to ensure it
continues to meet the Group's
environmental requirements.
We use a variety of indicators
relevant to each of our operating
companies to monitor environmental
performance, but the following core
impacts are identified for the Group
as a whole:
• Greenhouse gas emissions from
our use of energy, including
electricity, gas, fuel in vehicles,
transport and travel
• Use of resources including water
and timber
• Generation and disposal of waste
Unless otherwise specified, the data
cover the Group’s UK-based
operations.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Carbon-dioxide-equivalent
greenhouse gas emissions can be
attributed to the direct and indirect
use of energy in the delivery of our
services and represent the Group’s
main environmental impact. The 
key elements are:
• Fuel (diesel and petrol)
consumption in vehicles being
used on company business
• Electricity used at fixed sites -
offices, branches etc. - for
lighting, cooling, IT equipment,
heating and process equipment
• Gas and oil used to heat premises
• Travel by employees on company
business in the UK and overseas,
including train journeys and flying
Our estimate of carbon dioxide
emissions in 2005 is 27.0 tonnes per
£million of revenue (2004: 28.8
tonnes per £million), a total of
33,238 tonnes (2004: 35,658
tonnes). This was apportioned:
Equipment Services improved the
management of its stock transfer
operations in the UK and reduced
haulage by 241,430 miles,
representing a saving of 416 tonnes
of CO
2
.
Resource use
Water is used to provide welfare
facilities in offices. Process water is
used in heating systems, cleaning
operations and spray booth filters.
For our fixed sites an estimated
43,500m
3
of water was used.
Timber scaffold boards and
formwork panels are sold and hired
out in our scaffolding and formwork
operations. Timber used in these
products is sourced from suppliers
who confirm that it is being
obtained from managed sustainable
sources.
We use timber both in the
construction process and in the
fabric of the buildings we construct.
During the year Project Services
adopted a Sustainability Policy and
has committed to sourcing all its
timber from suppliers certified by
the Forest Stewardship Council (or
an equivalent).
Waste
All fixed and temporary sites
operate procedures to stream and
recycle waste wherever possible. In
offices this includes recycling paper,
printer cartridges and redundant
equipment, and on sites can include
timber, metals and inert hardcore
etc.
• Equipment Services reclaimed a
total of 394 tonnes of steel and
14 tonnes of aluminium from the
end-of-life scrapping of products.
• At the Project Services head
office a total of 21.28 tonnes of
paper and cardboard were
recycled. 10.81 tonnes were
recycled at the Group head office
with a further 1.06 tonnes at the
Equipment Services head office.
• The Project Services waste skip
service handled a total of 56,287
tonnes of waste collected from
Interserve and customers' sites. Of
this 18,699 tonnes (33 per cent)
went through our licensed waste
transfer station and 2,513 tonnes
were recovered and not sent to
landfill. This represents 13 per
cent of the waste passing through
the transfer station.
Pollution
Arrangements are in place to record
and address any pollution incidents
and environmental near misses. No
enforcement action was taken
against Interserve or any Group
company in 2005.

Corporate Social Responsibility continued
Social and ethical
Diversity and Equal opportunities
Diversity is at the heart of our
business. We operate in many
different environments, in numerous
roles, for a wide range of clients. 
To do this effectively we need an
equally diverse workforce, and in
order to maintain our success we
welcome the widest variety of
people who have the appropriate
skills and enthusiasm.
Once someone is part of the
Interserve Group they should have
the chance to contribute and develop
in whatever way their abilities and
the opportunities we can offer them
allow. We need to make the most of
all that our employees have to offer
so that we can give the best possible
service to our clients and develop
our business for the future.
Fairness and respect for individuals
results in the sort of positive
atmosphere that generates its own
success. Our policy supports the
fundamental belief that all our
employees, including potential
recruits, are equal regardless of
gender, race, disability, sexual
orientation, age, religion, religious
belief or any other reason that 
might be assumed to limit their
contribution or potential.
All employees have a personal
responsibility for the practical
application of equal opportunities,
demonstrated by respect for the
individual, in their everyday
dealings and working relationships
with colleagues, customers, 
suppliers and other parties.
Ethics
It is important that individuals
throughout all of Interserve’s
operations retain a set of core
values and approaches to the
process of doing business. The
reputation of the Group and the
trust and confidence of those with
whom it deals are among its most
vital resources, and the protection
of these is of fundamental
importance. We demand and
maintain high ethical standards in
carrying out our business activities
and tolerate no form of corrupt
practice. To support an open and
honest operating environment,
Interserve has a whistleblowing
policy and procedure which is
available to all employees.
Our ethical policy includes guidance
for managing our relationships with
customers, suppliers and competitors
and addresses the specific issues
associated with international
business. We consider harassment 
of any employee for any reason 
to be unacceptable.
Employee consultation
We believe in involving our
personnel in matters affecting them
as employees and have continued to
keep them informed of all relevant
factors concerning the Group’s
performance, strategy, financial
status, charitable activities and
other issues. We achieve this
through formal and informal
briefings, through our Group
magazine, Focus, which is issued
three times a year, and through our
intranet. Employee representatives
are consulted regularly on a wide 
range of matters affecting their
current and future interests.
Investors in People
Investors in People (IiP) is the
national standard which sets a level
of good practice for training and
development of people to achieve
business goals. It provides a
framework for improving business
performance and competitiveness
through a planned approach to
setting and communicating business
objectives and developing people 
to meet these objectives.
Our strategy of rolling out IiP
recognition across the Group is
maintaining its momentum with
comprehensive plans in place for 
all divisions to achieve or retain the
standard. The Metropolitan Police
Service contract was successfully
reaccredited in 2005. 
In support of good people-
management practices, other
initiatives have been implemented
during the year including Leadership
and Management training in
Equipment Services and Safety 
Skills passports in Industrial 
Services. Diversity and Equality
policies have been updated and
monitoring has been introduced 
in most parts of the Group. 
The success of individuals
committed to their personal training
and development is recognised
through the well-established
Interserve Training Trust. The 
Chief Executive presented 35 
people from across the Group 
with awards in May 2005. Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005 27
Charitable giving
Interserve believes in contributing 
to the well-being of the communities
in which it operates. We have a
programme which operates at
different levels: at Group level we
select a charity every two years 
and make an annual donation; we
encourage business units to run
charitable events, either for the
Group charity or for another cause
that is important to the area or 
the people involved; and we offer
support for employees to undertake
sponsored activities.
Throughout 2004 and 2005
Interserve worked with Macmillan
Cancer Relief as its chosen charity.
Macmillan provides expert care and
practical support to improve the
quality of life for people living with
cancer. Its activities include funding
specialist Macmillan nurses and
doctors, building cancer care 
centres and providing a range of
information and support services.
We formed committees in divisional
and business unit locations across
the Group to organise fund-raising
events and assist individuals in
undertaking sponsored activities. 
As a result of their work, the
commitment and dedication shown
by many employees in their own
sponsored activities and the
generosity of numerous people in
Interserve and beyond, nearly
£40,000 was raised in 2005 to
complement the Group donation 
of £25,000, bringing the grand total
for the two years to over £103,000.
Beyond Macmillan, all Interserve
divisions took part in the Financial
Times’ Crisis at Christmas Card
Challenge, where money is donated
to charity instead of being spent on
Christmas cards. We donated a total
of £10,000: £2,000 to the appeal,
with the remainder going equally to:
• Learning Through Landscapes,
Winchester
• CLIC Sargent (Caring for Children
with Cancer), London
• National Association for Colitis
and Crohns Disease, St Albans
In addition various parts of the
Group gave to a range of causes
including £5,700 to Project
Compass, £4,500 to Inspire, £5,000
to the RNLI, £1,000 to Defence
Estates’ Cardiac Risk in the Young
initiative and £11,000 to local
community events associated with
the Army Defence Estate.
Our chosen charity for the next 
two years is ChildLine. ChildLine 
is the UK’s free, 24-hour helpline 
for children in distress or danger.
Trained volunteer counsellors
comfort, advise and protect children
and young people who may feel
they have nowhere else to turn. 
We have established fund-raising
committees throughout Interserve
and are already generating
donations through a number 
of activities.
Coffee morning success
As part of the support for Macmillan
Interserve sites across the country
took part in the World’s Biggest
Coffee Morning. Always popular, the
event was well supported with raffles,
quizzes and, of course, plenty of cups
of coffee. Interserve sites raised over
£5,000 at the event.
The Sahara Challenge
In October, Mason Laird and Rob
Lindeman walked the 100km Sahara
Trek for Macmillan raising over 
£5,000 - an exhilarating and thought-
provoking experience for them both. 28 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005
Finance Director’s report
The Chairman’s statement and Chief
Executive’s review provide an
overview of the Group’s results for
2005. This report provides further
information on key aspects of the
performance and financial position
of the Group.
International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’)
2005 is the first year that the Group
has prepared consolidated accounts
on the basis of IFRS, as adopted by
the European Union.
A full explanation of accounting
policies is included as note 1 to the
consolidated accounts. The main
areas where the introduction of IFRS
has impacted the Group’s results are
as identified in this report last year,
namely: 
• Employee Benefits (IAS 19)
• Business Combinations (IFRS 3)
• Share-based Payment (IFRS 2)
• Financial Instruments 
(IAS 32 & 39)
• Income Taxes (IAS 12)
• Events after the Balance Sheet
Date (IAS 10)
• Interests in Joint Ventures (IAS 31)
The main area of continuing
uncertainty is around Accounting for
Service Concessions where we await
further and final guidance from the
International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS
has been a reduction in headline
earnings per share for 2005 against
2004 UK GAAP of approximately 
14 per cent, reflecting principally
the impact of higher pension costs
under IAS 19. Basic earnings per
share are approximately 18 per cent
higher as goodwill is no longer
amortised annually under IFRS 3. 
A reconciliation to 2004 UK GAAP 
is detailed in note 32 to the
consolidated accounts.
Net assets on transition are reduced
by approximately 55 per cent,
resulting principally from
recognition of the Group pension
funding deficit under IAS 19.
Investment revenue and
finance costs
The net interest charge of £1.0
million is analysed in Table 1. As
permitted by Statutory Instrument
2005/2947 amending the Companies
Act 1985, we have taken the
decision not to apply IFRS to the
accounts of the Group holding
company and subsidiaries in this
period in order to minimise the
impact of the transition and to
preserve net asset values and
distribution capacity at a local
level. Accordingly the balance sheet
for Interserve Plc is given on page
90 with accounting policies and
notes as detailed on pages 91 to 98
in accordance with UK GAAP .
Taxation
The tax charge for the year of £15.4
million represents an effective rate
of 32.2 per cent on profits. This
rate reflects the mix of the Group's
businesses both within the UK and
overseas. We expect our tax rate to
remain at broadly similar levels for
the next few years.
Net debt and cash flow
Year end net debt was £17.7
million, representing a net inflow of
£0.1 million over the year. This is
analysed in Table 2.
Operating cash inflow remained at a
similar level to 2004.
Tax paid at £10.7 million remains
lower than the Income Statement
charge incurred by the Group due
principally to the utilisation of

consortium relief losses from a
number of joint venture investments
against the Group’s tax liability. The
increase in the amount paid in 2005
is due to rising profitability over the
past two years and the consequent
increase in payments made on
account.
Free cash flow of £21.1 million for
the year remained at a similar level
to 2004, representing a conversion
of 64.9 per cent (2004: 72.0 per
cent) of post tax profits. 
Through 2005 average net debt was
£5.2 million (2004: £23.6 million).
Accounting for financial
instruments 
During the year the Group adopted
IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement and
IAS 32 Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and Presentation. The
Group has taken advantage of the
exemption in IFRS 1 to apply these
standards from 1 January 2005,
without restating comparatives.
Details of the accounting policy 
are set out in note 1(n) and full
disclosures, as required, in 
note 18.
Assets created under PFI, and
similar, contracts have been
assessed in relation to the balance
of risks and rewards assumed by the
Group and are accounted for as
financial assets, classified as
available-for-sale. As such these
assets are held at their assessed fair
value at the balance sheet date,
with movements over the period
being taken directly to equity.
Dividend
The directors recommend a final
dividend for the year of 10.1 pence,
to bring the total for the year to
14.7 pence, an increase of 4.3 per
cent over last year. This dividend is
covered 1.8 times by headline
earnings per share.
PFI/PPP investments
The credit in the Income Statement
relating to performance of the
Group’s share of the PFI equity
portfolio is analysed in Table 3.
The increase in interest receivable
reflects the increasing maturity of
the Group’s PFI portfolio and, in
particular, the fact that 18 projects
have now reached their operational
stage (2004: 13). 
Interest on non-recourse debt held
within concession contracts is
capitalised as a cost of construction
until the project is completed and 
is amortised over the remaining
income generating life of the asset. 
At the balance sheet date the 
Group had £49.5 million of
committed investment in 23 
PFI/PPP projects which had 
reached financial close. Of this
£31.7 million had been invested 
at that date, with the balance 
due to be invested over the 
next three years.
The Group’s share of gross liabilities
of £508.7 million principally
represents non-recourse debt within
these ventures to fund capital
building programmes and working
capital requirements.
On a further two projects the Group
has been nominated as preferred
bidder but these had not reached
financial close at the year end.
Completion of these projects will
entail a further investment
commitment of £4.5 million.

Pensions
The Group’s principal pension
scheme is the Interserve Pension
Scheme (the ‘Scheme’). The defined
benefit section of the Scheme is
now closed to all but a very few
new entrants and those employees
who, under agreement, transfer
under TUPE to the Group. A defined
contribution section of the Scheme
has been established for all new
eligible employees.
At 31 December 2005 the Group
pension deficit, net of deferred tax
under IAS 19, was £92.8 million
(2004: £90.2 million). The increase
in the deficit during the year was
driven both by changes in market
conditions, principally a significant
decrease in the liability discount
rate, and by the adoption of
updated mortality assumptions. 
These factors outweighed the
impact of a substantial increase 
in asset prices over the period.
Full IAS 19 disclosures relating to
the key underlying assumptions 
and elements of the Group pension
position are provided in note 29 
to the consolidated accounts. 
The principal sensitivities to the
assumptions made with regard 
to the balance sheet deficit are
shown in Table 4.
A triennial valuation of the Scheme
funding position is being undertaken
as at 31 December 2005, following
which the Group shall agree with
the trustees of the Scheme a revised
schedule of cash contributions in
order to fund ongoing service cost
accrual and to recover the measured
deficit over an agreed timescale.
Treasury
The Group operates a centralised
Treasury function whose primary
function is to manage funding,
liquidity and financial risks. The
Treasury function is not a profit
centre and it does not enter into
speculative transactions. It aims 
to reduce financial risk in the 
Group by the use of hedging
instruments. Management and
control of identified risks is carried
out by reference to a framework 
of policies and guidelines approved
by the Board within which Treasury
must operate.

Interest rate risk 
The objectives of the interest 
rate policy for the Group are 
to match funding costs with
operational revenue performance
and to ensure that adequate
interest cover is maintained in 
line with Board approved targets
and banking covenants. 
Group borrowings are principally
denominated in sterling and mostly
subject to floating rates of interest
linked to LIBOR. The Group has in
place an interest rate cap expiring
in late 2007 which limits interest
rate risk.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to maintain
sufficient facilities to ensure 
that it has access to funding to
meet current and anticipated 
future funding requirements
determined from budgets and
medium-term plans.
At the balance sheet date the 
Group had total facilities in place 
of £207 million, including the main
syndicated revolving credit facility
of £165 million. The remaining
facilities are provided in the form 
of short-term overdraft and money
market lines.
During the year the terms of this
main facility were amended, with
the agreement of the participating
banks, including a reduction in the
margin due on both borrowed and
available funds and extension to 
the term by a further two years 
to 2010. Total facilities are
sufficient to meet forecast
borrowing requirements for at 
least the next two years.
Foreign currency risk
Where the Group has overseas
operations, the revenues and costs
of the business will typically be
denominated in local currency.
Where material trade is transacted
in non-local currency, the Company
is required to take out instruments
(which ordinarily will be forward
contracts) to hedge the currency
exposure. 
In preparing the accounts, profits
and losses from overseas activities
are translated at the average
exchange rates applying during 
the year. The balance sheet is
translated at the year-end
exchange rates. The impact of
fluctuations in exchange rate
during the year did not have a
significant effect upon the 
reported results. 
The Group has a number of
overseas subsidiaries and associates
whose net assets are denominated
principally in local currencies. 
It is Group policy to protect the
sterling value of those assets 
where appropriate.

Group Finance Director
13 March 2006 The directors of Interserve Plc present their report and the audited accounts
and notes for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Principal activities and business review
Interserve Plc is the holding company of a group of integrated businesses
providing facilities services, industrial services, project services and
equipment services in the United Kingdom and overseas and with a range of
PFI investments.
The principal companies of the Group, together with details of their 
individual activities and their locations, may be found on pages 99 to 103 and
in the Chief Executive’s review on pages 7 to 13. The Chairman’s statement
on page 6 covers prospects for the future.
Group results and dividends
The Group profit before taxation was £47.9 million (2004: £41.4 million).
The detailed results of the Group are given in the accounts on pages 52 to 88
and further comments on divisional results are given in the Chief Executive’s
review.
An interim dividend of 4.6p per 10p ordinary share was paid on 31 October
2005 and the Board recommends a final dividend of 10.1p per 10p ordinary
share, making a total distribution for the year ended 31 December 2005 of
14.7p per 10p ordinary share (2004: 14.1p).
Subject to approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”),
the final dividend will be paid on 9 June 2006 to shareholders appearing on
the register at the close of business on 24 March 2006.
Share capital
The authorised share capital of the Company is 150,000,000 ordinary shares 
of 10p each (£15,000,000). During the year 399,700 shares were allotted to
participants in the executive share option schemes on the exercise of options
at prices of 212p, 253.25p and 346p per ordinary share.
As a result of the foregoing allotments, the issued share capital at the end of
the year stood at 114,156,032 ordinary shares of 10p each (£11,415,603.20).
The issued share capital at the date of this report stands at 114,156,032
(2004: 113,756,332) ordinary shares of 10p each (£11,415,603.20) (2004:
£11,375,633.20).
Details of outstanding options over shares in the Company as at 31 December
2005 are set out in note 25 to the accounts on page 79.
The Company has authority under a shareholders’ resolution passed at the
AGM held on 17 May 2005 to purchase up to 11,387,303 of the Company’s
ordinary shares at prices ranging between the nominal value for each share
and 105 per cent of the average of the middle market price of the ordinary
shares for the five business days immediately preceding the date on which the
Company agrees to buy the shares concerned. This authority expires on the
date of the forthcoming AGM or 17 August 2006, whichever shall be the
earlier. Shareholders will be asked to renew the authority, which will include
the purchase of shares for treasury, for a further period of up to 15 months 
at the AGM.
The Companies Act 1985 requires that any shares issued wholly for cash must
first be offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings
unless authorised to the contrary by a resolution of the shareholders.
Resolutions giving such authority were passed in 2005. Authorities to renew
for one year the power of directors to allot shares pursuant to sections 89 and
95 of the Companies Act 1985 will be sought from shareholders at the AGM.

Directors’ remuneration report on pages 45 to 47 of this Report and Accounts.
There have been no changes in the directors’ beneficial interests in and
options to acquire ordinary shares of the Company and Company loan stock
between the year end and the date of this report.
The directors do not have any interest in any other Group company. No director
has, or has had, a material interest, directly or indirectly, at any time during
the year under review in any contract significant to the Company’s business
(other than Mr Ringrose’s interest in the sale and purchase agreement and

remuneration report on page 46).
Substantial shareholdings 
As at 13 March 2006 the Company has been notified of the following interests
in shares:
10,101,390 (8.85%) Henderson Global Investors Ltd
8,281,534 (7.25%) Aviva plc
4,749,580 (4.16%) Prudential plc (M&G Investment Management Ltd)
3,690,897 (3.23%) Legal & General Investment Management Ltd 
3,478,300 (3.05%) Aberforth Smaller Companies Trust plc
There are no other notifiable interests, so far as the directors are aware,
comprising material interests of 3 per cent or more, or an aggregate of
material and non-material interests of 10 per cent or more, in the issued
share capital of the Company.
Charitable and political donations
Charitable donations made during the year amounted to £36,000 (2004:
£35,000). Details of the beneficiaries of donations by the Company are 
given on page 27 of the charitable giving section of the Corporate Social
Responsibility report. No political donations were made during the period.
Creditor payment policy
It is the Group’s normal practice to agree payment terms with its suppliers
and abide by those terms. Payment becomes due when it can be confirmed
that goods and/or services have been provided in accordance with the
relevant contractual conditions. The Company’s trade creditors at 31 December
2005, calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
1985, were 7 days (2004: 4 days). This represents the ratio, expressed in days,
between the amounts invoiced to the Company in the year by its suppliers and
the amounts due, at the year end, to trade creditors falling due for payment
within one year. As figures for the Company alone are not representative,
trade creditors for the Group (calculated on the above basis) at 31 December
2005 were 66 days (2004: 55 days).
Health and safety
Mr Vyse is the nominated Executive Director champion for safety. A report on
health and safety is contained in the Corporate Social Responsibility report 
on pages 21 to 23 of this Report and Accounts. 
Employee involvement
Within the bounds of commercial confidentiality, management disseminates
information to all levels of staff about matters that affect the progress of the
Group and are of interest and concern to them as employees. Information on
the Group’s strategy, performance, range of activities, training developments,
the launch of the Group’s “Don’t Walk By” health and safety campaign and
charitable activities was given within the May, August and December editions
of Focus, the Group newsletter produced on behalf of the Executive Committee.
Disabled employees
The Group has an established policy that disabled persons, especially should
they become disabled in the course of their employment with the Group, be
employed where circumstances permit. The Group endeavours to ensure that
disabled employees benefit from training and career development
programmes in line with other employees.
Social and ethical policies
The Chief Executive is responsible for the Group social and ethical policies.
A separate report on Corporate Social Responsibility is contained on pages 20
to 27 of this Report and Accounts.
Auditors
Resolutions to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company’s auditors
and to authorise the directors to determine their remuneration will be
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Annual General Meeting resolutions
The resolutions to be presented at the AGM to be held on 17 May 2006,
together with the explanatory notes, appear in the separate Notice of
Annual General Meeting sent to all shareholders and which is also available 
on our website at www.interserveplc.co.uk.

Company Secretary
13 March 2006
Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005  33 The Company is committed to achieving and maintaining high standards of
corporate governance throughout the Group and to integrity and high ethical
standards in all its business dealings.
The Company is required to comply with the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority which require the Company, amongst other things, to make
a statement on whether it has complied throughout the accounting period with
the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance, published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 (the
“Combined Code”). The Company must also provide an explanation of how it
has applied the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code to enable
its shareholders to evaluate how the principles have been applied. Where the
Company has not complied with the Combined Code provisions it must specify
which it has not complied with and (where relevant) for what part of the
accounting period such non-compliance continued, giving reasons for any non-
compliance.
The directors consider that the Company has complied with the provisions of
the Combined Code throughout the accounting period ended 31 December 2005
with the following minor exceptions:
• In view of the appointment of Lord Blackwell and Mr Cullen in September
and October 2005, respectively, and Mr Bottjer’s retirement as Group
Chairman at the end of December 2005 and Mr Padovan’s retirement in
September 2005, it was considered inappropriate that their performance
be appraised during the period under review (Code Principle A.6); and
• Mr Bottjer chaired the Nomination Committee during the recruitment
process of the new Group Chairman and additional non-executive director.
In view of the two recruitment processes being conducted in parallel and
the delegation by the Nomination Committee of the day-to-day
management of this process to the Chief Executive and the Group
Chairman, this was considered by the Nomination Committee to be
appropriate in the circumstances (Code Provision A.4.1).
Directors 
The Board 
The Board is responsible for overall Group strategy and core values including:
the creation, acquisition or disposal of corporate entities or the disposal of
material assets; financial reporting; approval of annual budgets and major
capital expenditure projects; the Group’s finance, banking and capital
arrangements; Stock Exchange/Listing Rule/Companies Act matters; material
contracts and contracts otherwise than in the normal course of business of the
Company and its subsidiaries; matters which could affect the Group’s
reputation; employee issues and key appointments; risk management strategy
including internal controls and Group insurances; health and safety; defence
and settlement of material litigation; and social, environmental and ethical
matters. It also has oversight of the Group’s operations. These responsibilities
are set out in a schedule of matters reserved for the approval of the Board.
In order to facilitate the efficient use of its time the Board has delegated
certain of its powers to Board committees, details of which are set out later in
this report. From time to time the Board also establishes certain other
committees with defined terms of reference to deal with a specific issue which
the Board has approved, such as the acquisition or disposal of a business.
Below the Board is the Executive Committee, comprising the executive
directors, the senior executives Mr S Dance, Mr B Melizan and the Company
Secretary.
The Board normally meets monthly throughout the year and on an ad hoc
basis to consider any matters which are time-critical. Attendance at Board
and committee meetings by individual directors during the year is set out in
the table below.

Mr Padovan retired from the Board on 30 September 2005
The Group Chairman held two meetings with the non-executive directors
during the course of the year, without the executive directors being present.
The non-executive directors also met once during the year, under the
chairmanship of Mr Padovan, without either the Group Chairman or the
executive directors being present. 
The Company maintains an appropriate level of directors’ and officers’
insurance in respect of legal actions against the directors. The insurance does
not provide cover where the director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Chairman and Chief Executive 
The roles of the Group Chairman and Chief Executive are split and clearly
defined. The Group Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board
and creating the conditions for overall Board and individual director
effectiveness, both inside and outside the boardroom. The Chief Executive is
responsible for running the Group’s business.
The Group Chairman (Mr Bottjer to 31 December 2005, Lord Blackwell from 
1 January 2006), assisted by the Company Secretary, sets the agenda for Board
meetings. The Group Chairman also ensures that Board members, especially
the non-executive directors, receive timely information and are briefed on
Corporate governance for the year ended 31 December 2005
34 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005 Corporate governance continued for the year ended 31 December 2005
issues arising at Board meetings to assist them in making an effective
contribution. The Company Secretary is responsible for disseminating Board
papers, which are normally circulated in advance of each meeting, presenting
certain papers to the Board and its committees, advising on Board procedures
and ensuring the Board follows them.
The Board has concluded that Lord Blackwell was independent upon
appointment on the basis of the criteria specified in paragraph A.3.1 of the
Combined Code and generally.
Board balance and independence
The Board, which operates as a single team, comprises four executive
directors, four non-executive directors and the Group Chairman. The
individual directors have different skills, experience and qualifications with
certain of their number presently or previously working in other sectors of the
economy, and are able to bring independent judgement to bear on matters for
consideration by the Board.
The Board considers each non-executive director to be independent, on the
basis of the criteria specified in paragraph A.3.1 of the Combined Code and
generally, and free from any relationships or circumstances which are likely to
affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement. Furthermore, the Board
considers its non-executive directors to be of sufficient calibre and number
that their views may be expected to be of sufficient weight that no individual
or small group can dominate the Board’s decision-making processes.
Mr Balfour, as Senior Independent Director, is available to shareholders should
they have any concerns which contact through other channels has failed to
resolve or for which such contact may be inappropriate.
Appointments to the Board
Nominations for appointments to the Board are made by the Nomination
Committee, which comprises the Group Chairman, who is chairman of the
Committee, the Chief Executive and all the non-executive directors. The
Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee. The Committee has its own
terms of reference which deal clearly with its authority and duties, and which
are available on the Company’s website at www.interserveplc.co.uk and on
request. The role of the Nomination Committee is to consider and review the
structure, size, composition and balance of skills, knowledge and experience
of the Board and to make recommendations to the Board with regard to any
changes. The Committee is responsible for the supervision of the recruitment
process of potential Board appointees, considering any candidates who are put
forward by the directors and external consultants and recommending to the
Board the appointment of all directors after having interviewed short-listed
candidates. It is also responsible for making recommendations to the Board
concerning the re-appointment of any director retiring by rotation.
During the period under review the Nomination Committee made
recommendations to the Board in respect of candidates for the role of Group
Chairman and an additional non-executive director after ensuring that upon
appointment each individual would have sufficient time to meet what is
expected of them. To assist it in the recruitment process the Nomination
Committee engaged the services of KPMG LLP , Executive Search and Selection,
who worked with the Committee in framing candidate profiles and person
specifications, drawing-up long lists of candidates, conducting interviews with
the candidates short-listed by the Committee and co-ordinating meetings
between the preferred candidates and the Committee members prior to any
candidates’ recommendation to the Board. In order to facilitate the
recruitment process the day-to-day conduct of the process was delegated to
the Group Chairman and Chief Executive, both of whom reported back to and
sought guidance from the Committee on a regular basis.
The terms and conditions of appointment of all the non-executive directors
and those of the Group Chairman are available for inspection at the
Company’s registered office during normal business hours and for at least 
15 minutes prior to and during the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). Each
letter of appointment specifies the anticipated level of time commitment
including, where relevant, additional responsibilities derived from
involvement with the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
Non-executive directors and the Group Chairman are required to confirm, on
appointment, that they have sufficient time to meet what is expected of
them and to seek the Committee Chairman’s agreement, or in the case of the
Group Chairman the Senior Independent Director’s agreement, before
accepting additional commitments that might impact upon the time they are
able to devote to their role as a non-executive director of the Company.
Information and professional development
The Board papers include information from management on financial, business
and corporate issues to enable the directors to be properly briefed on issues
to be considered at Board meetings. Matters requiring Board and committee
approval are generally the subject of a proposal formulated by the executive
directors and circulated, together with supporting information, as part of the
Board papers.
The Group has a comprehensive system for reporting financial results, cash
flows and projections to the Board on a monthly basis. These are compared
with budgets approved by the Board prior to the commencement of each
financial year. The financial summaries are accompanied by a written report
explaining operating and financial performance, the cause and effect of
variance from the agreed budgets and other information that may be relevant
from time to time. Monthly written reports on the performance of each
division are provided as part of the Board papers. Those members of the
Executive Committee who are not Board directors attend that part of each
Board meeting dedicated to management and financial reporting, during
which health, safety and environmental matters are discussed, to present
their reports and respond to any matters concerning their division raised by
the Board. They also attend the relevant part of the Board meeting at which
the annual budget and plans are presented for approval and adoption.
The Board also receives monthly reports from the Group Health, Safety and
Environmental Manager covering the Group’s health and safety performance,
periodic environmental reports and an annual presentation covering both
performance during the past year and targets for the forthcoming year. The
Board also receives quarterly written reports from the Group Insurance
Manager and Group General Counsel covering any matters of significance.
Interserve Plc Annual Report 2005 35 On appointment, the directors take part in an induction programme given by
the Company Secretary during which they receive information about the
Company, the role of the Board and the matters reserved for its decision, the
terms of reference and membership of the Board and its committees, the
powers delegated to those committees, the Company’s corporate governance
practices and procedures, including the power reserved to the Group’s most
senior executives, and the latest financial information. In addition to this,
visits to certain of the Group’s operations are undertaken in order for the new
directors to gain an appreciation of, and familiarise themselves with, the
business of the Group. There is also in place an ongoing programme providing
opportunities for non-executive directors to visit various of the Group’s
operations.
The Company Secretary also keeps the directors informed of appropriate
briefings, seminars and training courses and makes the necessary arrangements
for their attendance. Most non-executive directors attended one or more
briefings or seminars relevant to their role during the year under review. 
Throughout their period in office the directors are updated on the Company’s
business and the competitive and regulatory environments in which it
operates.
Directors may, after consultation with the Chairman, take independent legal
advice in furtherance of their duties at the Company’s expense up to a limit
of £10,000 in relation to any one event. All directors have access to the
advice and services of the Company Secretary, whose appointment or removal
is a matter reserved for the approval of the Board or any duly delegated
committee thereof. 
Performance evaluation 
During 2005, the performance of the directors (excluding Lord Blackwell and
Messrs Bottjer, Cullen and Padovan) was appraised by Mr Bottjer, Group
Chairman, and the Chief Executive and, in the case of the Chief Executive, by
Mr Bottjer, with feedback being provided as appropriate. The Board also
conducted an evaluation of its own performance, that of its committees, and
reviewed its procedures. As a result of this review an annual major strategy
meeting, away from the boardroom, has been instigated.
The Audit Committee also conducted a review of its terms of reference and
effectiveness for the year under review.
Re-election 
All directors are required by the Company’s Articles of Association to be
elected by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment, if
appointed by the Board. Directors must subsequently retire by rotation and
may offer themselves for re-election at the AGM at intervals of not more than
three years. The Board typically expects non-executive directors to serve two
three-year terms, although a non-executive director may be invited to serve
one additional three-year term. Should this be the case the non-executive
director concerned would be expected to retire annually and offer himself for
re-election. Biographical details of all the directors, including those subject to
re-election, are set out on pages 4 and 5 of this Report and Accounts to
enable shareholders to take an informed decision on any re-election. 
Remuneration 
The level and make-up of remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee, composed entirely of independent
non-executive directors, was chaired by Mr Balfour until 30 September 2005
and is now chaired by Mr Trapnell. The names of the Committee members are
set out in the table on page 34. The responsibilities of the Committee,
together with an explanation of how it applies the directors’ remuneration
principles of the Combined Code, are set out in the Directors’ remuneration
report on pages 39 to 48. 
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting 
The Board aims to provide a balanced and understandable assessment of the
Company’s position and prospects. It uses the Chairman’s statement, the
detailed reviews of the performance and financial position of the Company’s
operations included in the Chief Executive’s review, the Finance Director’s
report, and the Directors’ report to assist with this. The directors’
responsibility for the preparation of the accounts and notes and the statement
by the auditors about their reporting responsibilities are described on
page 49, and pages 50 to 51, respectively, of this Report and Accounts. 
Going-concern basis
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement, at the time
of approving the accounts and notes, that there is a reasonable expectation
that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence
for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going-
concern basis in preparing the accounts and notes.
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for internal control, including risk
management, and sets appropriate policies having regard to the objectives of
the Group.
The Executive Committee is responsible for the identification and evaluation
for consideration by the Board of risks faced by the Group and for designing,
operating and monitoring a suitable system of internal control embracing the
policies adopted by the Board.
The principal features of the system of internal control are: 
• An established management structure comprising the Board with its
various committees and an Executive Committee. The Executive
Committee is responsible for the operational management and delivery
against budget and forecast of the Group, implementing resolutions of the
Board, formulation of strategy, annual budgets and other proposals for
consideration by the Board and devising and implementing suitable
policies and procedures for health and safety, environmental, social and
ethical, treasury, human resources and information technology.
• The Board receives comprehensive monthly reports against that budget.
Each division prepares monthly trading reports (except January) with a
comparison against budget or forecast, together with certain key
performance indicators. The Board reviews these for the Group as a whole
and determines appropriate action. 
Corporate governance continued for the year ended 31 December 2005
36 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005 Corporate governance continued for the year ended 31 December 2005
• All proposals for capital expenditure above £10,000 and below £1 million
are submitted for approval to the Executive Committee. Larger value
proposals and business acquisitions and disposals are controlled by the
Board. 
• A PFI Committee, comprising any two executive directors (one of whom
shall be the Chief Executive), whose main areas of responsibility are to
review, approve and authorise the execution and delivery of contractual
documentation for PFI projects where prior approval of the Board has
been given to participation in a particular PFI project, and to report to
the Board on its actions.
• A Risk Committee, comprising the Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director, Group Internal Audit Manager, Group Health, Safety and
Environmental Manager, Group Insurance Manager, the Company Secretary
(who is its secretary) and a representative from each of the Group’s
operating divisions. The Risk Committee meets at least four times a year,
has written terms of reference and provides copies of its meeting minutes
to the Board. 
• A General Purposes Committee, comprising any two executive directors
(one of whom shall be the Chief Executive or, in his absence, the Group
Finance Director), with written terms of reference, which exercises
certain powers of the Board delegated to it and reports upon its actions to
the Board. 
• An Inside Information Committee, comprising the Group Chairman, Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director, with written terms of reference,
which is empowered to assess quickly if information is inside information,
release inside information to the regulatory information service in the
event that it is not possible to convene a Board meeting at very short
notice and is responsible for setting up and monitoring the systems and
controls with regard to insider information.
• Manuals setting out Group policy and financial and operating procedures,
with which all Group companies must comply. These manuals set out the
necessary levels of authorisation applicable for different transactions.
• A risk management policy document including the Board’s own risk
management matrix. 
• The Group has certain key areas which are subject to central management
or control, which include health, safety and environmental, legal,
insurance, treasury and company secretarial. These functions report to
executive directors and operate within defined limits and levels of
authority. 
• An internal audit function whose responsibility is to provide an objective
appraisal to the Board, through the Audit Committee, of the adequacy and
effectiveness of the processes established to control the business to assist
the Board in meeting its objectives and discharging its responsibilities. 
• One or more members of the Executive Committee attend each of the
monthly divisional board meetings. 
• During the course of each year members of the Executive Committee or
other senior operational and financial management visit all trading
companies, including those located overseas, to discuss and monitor
performance of those businesses. 
• The Group has in place a whistleblowing policy which is reviewed and
publicised from time to time.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant
risks faced by all companies within the Group has been in place for the period
under review and until the date of approval of this Report and Accounts.
There is also an ongoing process to embed internal control and risk
management further into the operations of the businesses, to deal with areas
of improvement which are identified from time to time and to derive the
maximum benefit to the business through the use of risk management
procedures.
Internal controls are reviewed in September and March by the Board, which
accords with the Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code
produced by the Financial Reporting Council in October 2005. The Board has
reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control for the
period under review. During the course of its review of the system of internal
control, the Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings or
weaknesses which it has determined to be significant. Therefore a
confirmation in respect of necessary actions has not been considered
appropriate.
Because of the limitations that are inherent in any system of internal control,
the Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss. 
Audit Committee and auditors 
The primary role of the Audit Committee is to review the integrity of the
financial reporting and audit process and to provide an independent overview
of risk management and internal control processes and make
recommendations to the Board. In fulfilling this role the Committee oversees
relations with the external auditors and reviews the effectiveness of the
internal audit function. 
The Audit Committee, composed entirely of independent non-executive
directors, was chaired by Mr Padovan until his retirement from the Board on
30 September 2005 and is now chaired by Mr Keegan. The names and tenure
in office of the Committee members are set out in the table on page 34. The
Board is satisfied that the Committee includes members with recent and
relevant financial experience. The Committee has written terms of reference,
dealing clearly with its authority and duties, which are available on the
Company’s website at www.interserveplc.co.uk and on request. 
Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005  37 The Committee met six times during 2005, to coincide with the key dates in
the Company’s reporting cycle, with the external auditors and the Group
Internal Audit Manager present at three and four of the meetings,
respectively. The Group Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Group Finance
Director also attended the meetings by invitation. The Company Secretary is
secretary to the Committee. The Committee has taken the opportunity to
seek the views of the external and internal auditors in private and both the
external and internal auditors have the opportunity to address the Committee
in private at any time should they so wish.
In fulfilling its responsibility of monitoring the integrity of the Company’s
financial reports to its shareholders, the Committee has evaluated whether
they provide a true and fair view, reviewed the appropriateness and
consistency of application of accounting policies adopted in their preparation
and assessed the basis of any major judgements and estimates. The
Committee also reviewed the audit findings, audit management letter and
audit representation letter before signature on behalf of the Board. 
The Committee evaluated the external auditors’ performance, reviewed and
approved the external auditors’ terms of engagement, the audit scope and
fees and made a recommendation to the Board as regards their 
re-appointment. It also reviewed auditor independence and objectivity and
the effectiveness of the audit process at the end of the audit cycle. As part of
its review of auditor independence, the Committee has a policy for the award
of non-audit work to the auditors comprising a set of authority limits in
relation to various categories of work. After reviewing the actual fees for non-
audit work for the Group during 2005, the Committee concluded that the
nature and extent of non-audit fees did not compromise auditor
independence. Further details of the auditors’ fees are included in note 4 to
the accounts on page 66.
The Committee monitored the role and effectiveness of the internal audit
function, in the context of the Company and the Group’s overall risk
management system, and received periodic reports against an annually agreed
work plan, which included an assessment of management’s responses to the
internal auditors’ findings and recommendations. The Committee also
commissioned an independent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on the
effectiveness of the internal audit function, with the key objectives of
supporting the Committee in discharging its responsibility to monitor and
review internal audit’s effectiveness and to assist in further improving or
developing the Company’s internal audit function. 
The Committee has, during the 2005 financial year, reviewed its terms of
reference as part of its annual review of its own effectiveness. 
The Committee Chairman reports to the Board on the work carried out,
including any improvement actions required. Copies of the minutes of
Committee meetings are also circulated to the Board. 
Relations with shareholders 
Dialogue with institutional shareholders 
The Company encourages two-way communication with both institutional and
private investors. The Chief Executive, accompanied by the Group Finance
Director, attended 65 meetings with analysts and institutional investors during
the year ended 31 December 2005. In addition, the Chief Executive and Group
Finance Director attended a further three and nine meetings, respectively,
accompanied by another member of staff. 
The Chief Executive arranges for the Company’s brokers to produce a note of
the feedback from institutional investors which is reported upon at the next
meeting of the Board. All directors and the members of the Executive
Committee also have, and indeed take, the opportunity to attend analyst
briefings. 
Shareholders are also kept up to date with Company affairs through the
Annual and Interim Reports, trading updates and, increasingly, the Company’s
website. 
Constructive use of AGM 
All shareholders are given at least 20 working days’ notice of the AGM, at
which all directors and committee chairmen are introduced and are available
for questions.

38 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005 Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2005
Introduction
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee (the
“Committee”) and approved by the Board of Interserve Plc. The report
complies with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the
“Regulations”), meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and explains how the Company has complied with
the principles and provisions of the July 2003 Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the “Combined Code”). A resolution to approve this report will
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company. 
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company’s members 
on the auditable section of this report and to state whether in their opinion
that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore
been divided into separate sections containing unaudited and audited
information. Pages 39 to 43 of this report contain unaudited information and
pages 43 to 48 (beginning with Directors’ emoluments and compensation and
ending with Directors’ pension entitlements) contain audited information.
Remuneration Committee
The Board is responsible for determining the remuneration of all directors 
and the Company Secretary. It has delegated responsibility for determining
the remuneration of the Group Chairman, the executive directors and the
Company Secretary, to the Committee. The terms of reference of the
Committee are available on the Company’s website at
www.interserveplc.co.uk and on request. 
The Committee’s role is, after consultation with the Group Chairman and/or
the Chief Executive (except where conflicted), to set the remuneration policy
and determine the individual remuneration and benefit packages of the Group
Chairman, the Chief Executive and the senior management team, comprising
the executive directors, the Company Secretary and the other senior
executives below the Board who report to the Chief Executive. This includes
formulating for Board approval long-term incentive plans which require
shareholder consent and overseeing their operation. The Committee also
monitors the terms of service for, and level and remuneration structure of,
other senior management.
The non-executive directors who have served on the Committee during 
the year are: 
D A Trapnell (Chairman from 1 October 2005)
G P Balfour (Chairman until 30 September 2005)
L G Cullen (from 14 November 2005)
N F Keegan 
J M F Padovan (until 30 September 2005)
all of whom the Board regards as independent.
The Committee meets as often as is necessary to discharge its duties and met
nine times during the year ended 31 December 2005. The Group Chairman,
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director are invited to attend meetings 
as appropriate. They are not present when matters affecting their own
remuneration arrangements are considered. 
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the
Company (other than as a shareholder), any conflict of interest arising from
cross-directorships, or any day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
In determining the executive directors’ remuneration, the Committee
consulted with and received recommendations from Mr Bottjer, the then
Group Chairman, and Mr Ringrose, Chief Executive. The Committee also
received advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , Sacker & Partners
LLP , Lane Clark & Peacock LLP , Wragge & Co LLP and Mr Bradbury, the
Company Secretary, which materially assisted the Committee in relation to
the 2005 financial year. New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , appointed by the
Committee during 2001, did not provide any other service to the Group.
Sacker & Partners LLP and Lane Clark & Peacock LLP , who were appointed by
the Committee, are both advisers to the Interserve Pension Scheme and also
provide advice to the Group on pension-related matters from time to time.
Wragge & Co LLP , who were appointed by the Committee, provide legal
services to the Group.
Remuneration policy 
Executive directors’ remuneration packages are designed to attract, retain
and motivate directors of the quality required to improve the Company’s
performance, to align the interests of the executive directors with those of
the shareholders and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value. The
determination of the executive directors’ annual remuneration packages is
undertaken by the Committee in accordance with this policy and will be the
subject of regular review during this and future financial years. 
During the year, a comprehensive review of executive directors’ remuneration
packages (including pensions) was undertaken during which it was confirmed
that remuneration levels should be in the median range (when compared with
a comparator group of listed companies), should remain weighted in favour of
performance-based incentives (rather than base salary) and that long-term
incentive schemes should be separated from short-term bonus arrangements.
It was also identified that: 
• the predominantly option-based strategy was inefficient both in terms 
of share usage and income statement impact (relative to a policy based
around conditional awards of shares) and increasingly at variance with
current market practice;
• the use of earnings per share as the sole performance measure for the
annual bonus, the Interserve Plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme 
(the “2002 Scheme”) and Interserve Plc Share Matching Plan (the “Share
Matching Plan”) was too narrowly focused;
• whilst the compulsory deferral of bonus and the matching “free shares”
element of the remuneration package had been successful in ensuring that
the relatively new management team steadily built an interest in shares 
in the Company, it was considered that a simpler long-term incentive
structure, using a single plan to replace the two existing schemes, 
would be beneficial; and
Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005  39 Directors’ remuneration report continued for the year ended 31 December 2005
40 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005
• the requirement for executive directors to invest a proportion of their
bonus in shares was desirable as a continuing encouragement to regularly
purchase and hold Company shares.
The main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors for
2006 and beyond will therefore be: 
• basic annual salary and benefits; 
• annual bonus payments with a requirement to invest a proportion of 
the bonus in Company shares; 
• participation in a new long-term incentive plan – the Interserve
Performance Share Plan 2006 (the “Performance Share Plan”) – to be
introduced subject to shareholder approval at the AGM; and 
• pension arrangements. 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board
and reviewed biennially within the limits set out in the Articles of Association
and is designed to attract and retain non-executive directors of sufficient
calibre to undertake the responsibilities entrusted to them. Non-executive
directors do not receive a bonus or participate in any incentive arrangements.
Basic annual salary and benefits 
The executive directors’ salaries are reviewed by the Committee annually for
implementation from 1 July in each year. Ad hoc reviews can also be made.
In deciding upon appropriate salary levels, the Committee takes into account
current remuneration trends, relative up-to-date information from the
comparator group, the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code and
increases in pay across the Group. 
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain 
benefits-in-kind, principally a fully-expensed car or car allowance and 
medical and permanent health insurance. 
Annual bonus payments 
The Committee establishes performance conditions annually which govern 
the amount of bonus payable to the executive directors in respect of each
financial year, subject to a maximum bonus of 100 per cent of basic salary. 
Performance conditions under the 2005 bonus scheme, based on headline
earnings per share, i.e. before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation
calculated using 2004 UK GAAP , were set such that 50 per cent of base salary
would be payable upon achievement of budgeted EPS with a range between
33.33 per cent and 100 per cent of base salary.
Under the rules of the 2005 bonus scheme 50 per cent of the net bonus
receivable must, unless the executive director is within three years of
retirement, be invested in Company shares under the Share Matching Plan
with the balance being payable in cash.
In view of the proposal to introduce (subject to shareholder approval) the
Performance Share Plan, to replace the Share Matching Plan and the policy 
of granting options under the 2002 Scheme and the introduction of the
shareholding guidelines set out below, the Committee considered it
appropriate to vary the requirement to invest 50 per cent of the 2005 bonus
under the Share Matching Plan in favour of the following arrangements:
(a) for any bonus in excess of 25 per cent of base salary, there will be an
element which will be required to be invested in Company shares (once
the shareholding guideline has been achieved, bonuses will be retained 
in cash);
(b) for the balance of any bonus between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of
base salary, 30 per cent of the net cash bonus will be required to be
invested in Company shares and 70 per cent may be retained in cash; and
(c) for the balance of a bonus payable between 50 per cent and 100 per cent
of base salary, 50 per cent of the net cash bonus will be required to be
invested in Company shares and 50 per cent may be retained in cash.
Company shares so acquired must be held for three years.
The above arrangements have also been incorporated into the rules of the
2006 bonus scheme, the performance conditions for which are based on the
achievement of IFRS (as applied to the 2006 budget) normalised EPS, 
i.e. basic earnings per share, adjusted to remove the IAS 19 Employee
Benefits, IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement charges over the financial year.
Share incentives
Share Matching Plan
The Share Matching Plan was introduced following its approval at the AGM on
9 May 2002. Under this arrangement participants are required to invest up to
50 per cent of their net annual cash bonus in Company shares (“Investment
Shares”). The percentage of bonus applicable for each year (not exceeding
50 per cent) was determined annually by the Committee. To the extent that
Investment Shares are retained for a three-year period, the participant
remains employed and if certain conditions are satisfied, they will receive
free shares from the Company (“Free Shares”) that will “match” the number
of Investment Shares deemed acquired (on a pre-tax basis) and retained. 
Awards made under the first and second cycle of the Share Matching Plan,
in connection with the bonuses earned in 2002 and 2004, respectively, are set
out on pages 46 and 47 of this report. 
In view of the proposal to introduce the Performance Share Plan no awards
have been granted under the Share Matching Plan in 2006.
Share option schemes
The earliest executive share option scheme under which options are still
outstanding (the “1997 Scheme”) was introduced on 17 April 1997. There are
currently options granted under the 1997 Scheme which remain unexercised,
the details of which are set out on pages 45 and 46 of this report. Options will
no longer be granted under the 1997 Scheme.  Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005  41
Directors’ remuneration report continued for the year ended 31 December 2005
The Interserve Plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme (the “2002 Scheme”)
was introduced following its approval at the AGM on 9 May 2002. There are 
no plans for options to be granted under the 2002 Scheme.
Options granted to executive directors under the 2002 Scheme since its
introduction, together with options granted during the year ended
31 December 2005, together with the performance conditions attaching
thereto, are set out on pages 45 and 46 of this report. 
As the calculation of EPS will be affected by the introduction of International
Financial Reporting Standards, the Committee will cause an EPS calculation to
be performed using the UK GAAP applicable for the base year for each year
where performance is tested against a base year where the EPS is calculated
under UK GAAP . The Committee may also seek advice from the auditors,
should it be deemed necessary, to verify any matter to ensure consistency in
accordance with the terms of the relevant performance conditions.
No amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any
entitlement of an executive director to share options. Non-executive directors
are not eligible to participate in the Group’s share option schemes. 
New long-term incentive plan – the Performance Share Plan (the “Plan”)
A detailed description of the Plan is given in the Notice of Annual General
Meeting but, in summary, the key features are:
• the face value of regular annual awards of shares (“Awards”) to an
individual will be limited to 150 per cent of salary per annum. It is
intended that initial Awards will be made over shares worth up to 
100 per cent of salary for the most senior executives, with lower grant
levels for less senior executives;
• dividends will accrue on Awards from the date of grant, payable on
vesting (to the extent that the shares ultimately vest); and
• Awards will normally vest no earlier than the third anniversary of grant,
provided the performance conditions (see below) have been satisfied and
the participant is still employed. 
For initial Awards to the most senior executives there will be two separate
performance conditions, each applying to half of an Award.
The performance condition attached to one half will require normalised EPS
(basic EPS excluding the effect of the IAS 19 Employee Benefits, IAS 36
Impairment of Assets and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement) growth of between UK Retail Prices Index (“RPI”) plus 12 per
cent to RPI plus 30 per cent over a single three-year financial year period for
between 30 per cent and 100 per cent vest (i.e. between 15 per cent and 50
per cent of the total Award).
The performance condition attached to the other half, will be based on total
shareholder return (“TSR”) performance measured against a comparator group
of 16 companies comprising similar companies drawn from the FTSE
Construction & Materials and Support Services sectors. These are considered
to provide an appropriate mix of businesses against which the Company’s
performance is measured over a single three-year period, with 30 per cent 
of the Award vesting for median performance, increasing on a straight-line
basis to 100 per cent of the Award vesting for upper quartile performance
(i.e. between 15 per cent and 50 per cent of the total Award).
The Committee considers that a combination of EPS and TSR is the most
appropriate measure of performance for the time being for the 
following reasons:
• the EPS target will reward significant and sustained increases in value
that would be expected to flow through into shareholder value. 
This will also deliver strong “line of sight” for the executive directors 
as it will be straightforward to evaluate and communicate;
• the addition of the TSR performance condition to the long-term incentive
arrangements will provide a balance to the package (particularly
compared to the current package, which is entirely EPS-focused). TSR
will reward good relative stock market performance and ensure that
there is still a share price-based discipline in the package (in the absence
of options). Many of the comparator companies are recognised by
management as competitors of the Company, which will ensure that this
is an effective incentive from the management’s perspective; and
• whilst TSR can be sensitive to the precise measurement period, the
combination of EPS and TSR can be a more consistent basis for
measurement.
Shareholding Guidelines
Shareholding Guidelines for executive directors will be introduced linked to
the out-turn from the Plan. At the time Awards vest under the Plan (or any
other executive plan established in the future), executive directors will be
expected to retain no fewer than 50 per cent of shares net of taxes until 
such time as a shareholding equivalent to 100 per cent of base salary has been
achieved. Shares purchased under the annual bonus arrangements will also
count towards this limit.
Dilution limits
At 31 December 2005 there remained 3,545,606 shares over which options
may be granted under the Company’s share schemes. All exercises of options
awarded under the 1997 and 2002 Schemes will be satisfied by the issue of
new shares.
Pension arrangements 
All executive directors are members of the defined benefits section of the
Interserve Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”). In general the Scheme provides 
a pension on retirement equal to 1/60 of basic annual salary for each year
and proportionately for each month of pensionable service, subject to this 
not exceeding the HM Revenue & Customs limits in force prior to 5 April 2006
(“Cap”), for which the executive directors make a contribution of 8 per cent
of their Capped salary. A similar Cap on accrual and contributions will (other
than for Mr Ringrose) apply after 5 April 2006. After 5 April 2006, Mr
Ringrose’s contributions will be 8 per cent of basic salary and there will 
be no Cap on pension accrual. 42 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005
Directors’ remuneration report continued for the year ended 31 December 2005
In the event of death in service the executive directors in the Scheme are
covered for a lump sum benefit of four times basic salary (subject to
HM Revenue & Customs limits) payable by the Trustee of the Scheme at its
discretion to one or more of their dependants. In addition, a pension would 
be payable to their spouse. 
The normal retirement age for executive directors is 60 years. There are no
unfunded or unapproved pension promises or similar arrangements for
directors. 
Executive directors’ service contracts 
The Company’s policy on the duration of directors’ service contracts is that all
newly appointed executive directors should have contracts terminable at any
time on one year’s notice save where it is necessary to offer longer notice
periods to any new directors recruited from outside the Group, in which case
such periods would be reduced to one year after an initial period. 
Details of service contracts of the executive directors who held office during
the financial year ended 31 December 2005 are summarised as follows: 
Unexpired
Date of term at Notice 
Name contract 13 March 2006 period
S B Hagerty 13 December 2001 indefinite one year 
T C Jones 1 August 2003 indefinite one year 
A M Ringrose 13 December 2001 indefinite one year 
J H Vyse 13 December 2001 indefinite one year 
In the event of the termination of any service contract the policy of the
Company would be not to make payments beyond its contractual obligations. 
The service contracts provide that if the contract is terminated summarily 
(for reasons other than gross misconduct), liquidated damages equal to the
executive’s annual basic salary are payable. The executive’s entitlement to
this payment would not be affected if the executive was in fact able to
reduce his loss by obtaining alternative employment during the normal notice
period. There are no provisions entitling the executive to terminate his
employment or receive damages in the event of a change in control of the
Company. Copies of the service contracts are available for inspection by
shareholders at the AGM.
None of the executive directors, save for Mr Ringrose, who is a non-executive
director of The Business Services Association, hold non-executive directorships
at other companies.
Group Chairman and non-executive directors 
Mr Bottjer retired from the Board on 31 December 2005 and was succeeded by
Lord Blackwell as Group Chairman.
Non-executive directors are appointed initially until the first AGM of the
Company following appointment when they are required to stand for re-
election and, subject to their re-election, thereafter for a maximum period 
of three years, renewable on the agreement of both the Company and the
director. These appointments are terminable upon one month’s notice by
either party, without compensation, save for the Group Chairman whose
appointment is terminable upon six months’ notice by either party, without
compensation. The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the
Board as a whole, taking into account amounts paid by other similar-sized
companies within the FTSE 350 index. Details of non-executive appointments
are as follows:

The Transfer Values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual executive director. Instead they represent a potential liability of
the Scheme. 
Non-executive directors’ fees are not pensionable and they have therefore not been included in the above table. 
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions. Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the
above tables.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
13 March 2006 
Directors’ remuneration report continued for the year ended 31 December 2005
48 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the
accounts and notes. The directors are required to prepare accounts and notes
for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and have chosen to prepare Company accounts and notes in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP).
In the case of UK GAAP accounts, the directors are required to prepare
accounts and notes for each financial year which give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company
for that period. In preparing these accounts and notes, the directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
accounts.
In the case of IFRS accounts, International Accounting Standard 1 requires
that accounts and notes present fairly for each financial year the Company’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for
assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting
Standards Board’s Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of
Financial Statements. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be
achieved by compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting
Standards. Directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific
requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards is insufficient
to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial
performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the
preparation of a directors’ report and directors’ remuneration report which
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.

Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005  49 50 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Interserve Plc
We have audited the Group accounts and notes of Interserve Plc for the year
ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the consolidated income statement,
the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, the
consolidated statement of recognised income and expenses and the related
notes 1 to 32. These Group accounts and notes have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in
the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the individual Company accounts and notes
of Interserve Plc for the year ended 31 December 2005. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the directors’
remuneration report and the Group accounts and notes in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted for use in the European Union are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group accounts and notes and the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited in
accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group accounts and notes
give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting
framework and whether the Group accounts and notes and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. We report to you if the directors’ report is not
consistent with the Group accounts and notes, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ transactions with the Company and other
members of the Group is not disclosed.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not complied with
any of the four directors’ remuneration disclosure requirements specified for
our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. These
comprise the amount of each element in the remuneration package and
information on share options, details of long-term incentive schemes, and
money purchase and defined benefit schemes. We give a statement, to the
extent possible, of details of any non-compliance.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statement on internal control covers all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained in the
annual report for the above year as described in the contents section
including the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report and we
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group accounts
and notes. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the Group accounts and notes and the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors
in the preparation of the Group accounts and notes, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group accounts and
notes and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having
been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group accounts
and notes and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as
having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group accounts and notes give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its profit for the year
then ended; and
• the Group accounts and notes and the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005  51
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS
As explained in note 1 of the Group accounts and notes, the Group, in addition
to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted for use
in the European Union, has also complied with the IFRS as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board. Accordingly, in our opinion the
accounts and notes give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS, of the
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its profit for the
year then ended.

# Restated under IFRS 58 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005
Notes to the consolidated accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005
Basis of preparation note
Interserve Plc has prepared consolidated accounts and notes under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Commission.
That is those International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and related Interpretations (SIC-IFRIC interpretations), subsequent
amendments to those standards and related interpretations, future standards and related interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting
Standards Board (“IASB”) that have been endorsed by the European Commission.
The directors are not aware of any standards or interpretations that are in issue and not yet effective, and as such have not been applied in these accounts, that
will have a material impact on the accounts of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and accounts when the relevant standards come into effect for
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
IFRS 1 exemptions
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards sets out the procedures that the Group must follow when it adopts IFRS for the first time
as the basis for preparing its consolidated accounts and notes.
The Group is required to establish its IFRS accounting policies as at 31 December 2005 and, in general, apply these retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening
balance sheet at its date of transition, 1 January 2004.
This standard provides a number of optional exceptions to this general principle. The most significant of these are set out below, together with a description in each
case of the exception adopted by the Group.
1. Business Combinations that occurred before the opening IFRS balance sheet date (IFRS 3 Business Combinations)
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place before the date of transition. As a result, in the opening balance
sheet, goodwill arising from past business combinations of £154.3 million remains as stated under UK GAAP at 31 December 2003.
2. Employee Benefits – actuarial gains and losses (IAS 19 Employee Benefits)
The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at the date of transition. The Group has
recognised actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur in a statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with the amendment
to IAS 19, issued on 16 December 2004.
3. Share-based Payments (IFRS 2 Share-based Payment)
The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 to all relevant share based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002.
4. Financial Instruments (IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation)
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 that enables the Group to only apply these standards from 1 January 2005. Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005  59
1. Accounting policies
The financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
Interserve Plc (the Company) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. These accounts are presented in pounds
sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with
the policies set out below.
These accounts and notes have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
During the period the Group adopted IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 that enabled the Group to apply these standards from 1 January 2005 - accordingly
comparatives are not restated. The effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39, following the fair valuing of certain of the Group’s financial assets and derivatives, is
to increase shareholders’ funds at 1 January 2005 by £5.2 million (net of deferred tax).
The particular policies adopted by the directors are set out below.
(a) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts incorporate the accounts of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). The results, assets and liabilities of
associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are
included from the effective date of acquisition or until the effective date of disposal respectively. Profits arising on trading between Group undertakings are
excluded.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the accounts of the joint ventures to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation, that company proportionately accounts for its share of the income and expenditure, assets,
liabilities and cash flows on a line by line basis. Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated accounts on the same basis.
(b) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is
recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on
disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition of IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP accounts value subject to being tested for
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any
subsequent profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of shares in associated undertakings is included within investments in associated
undertakings.
(c) Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.  These translation differences are dealt with in the profit for
the year.  The financial results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated into sterling at the average
rate of exchange for the year, the balance sheets are translated into sterling at the closing rate of exchange, and the difference arising from the translation
of the opening net assets and financial results for the year at closing rate is taken directly to reserves.

1. Accounting policies (continued)
(d) Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of goods and services supplied to external customers and the value of work executed in respect of contracts, excluding VAT .
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on construction contracts (see below). Investment
revenue is recognised on an accruals basis.
(e) Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity
at the balance sheet date. When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that it
will be recoverable. Expected losses are recognised immediately.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Properties in the course of construction are carried at
cost less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their expected useful lives.
(i) Depreciation is provided on a straight line or reducing balance basis at rates ranging between:
Straight line Reducing balance
Freehold land Nil –
Freehold buildings 2% to 5% –
Leasehold property over the period of the lease –
Plant and equipment 10% to 50% 11.5% to 38%
(ii) Fixed assets leased under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives.  The finance charges are allocated over the
primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
(iii) The costs of operating leases are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
(g) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that
those assets have suffered impairment loss. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
(h) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable
value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
(i) Borrowing costs
Project-specific finance costs are capitalised until the asset becomes operational. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement on an
accruals basis or the effective interest method as appropriate.
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005  61
1. Accounting policies (continued)
(j) Pre-contract costs
Pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset when it is virtually certain that a
contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash flows.
In the case of PFI bid costs, on financial close of the project the Group recovers bid costs by charging a fee to the relevant project company. If the fee
exceeds the amount held by the Group as an asset, the excess is credited to the balance sheet as deferred income and is released to the income statement
over a period appropriate to the risks concerned.
(k) PFI projects
The Group has determined the appropriate treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from, PFI and similar contracts.  Where the balance of
risks and rewards derived from the underlying assets is not borne by the Group, the asset provided is accounted for as a financial asset and is classified as
available-for-sale.
Income is recognised on PFI projects both as operating revenue and interest income: a proportion of total cash receivable is allocated to operating revenue by
means of a margin on service costs taking account of operational risks, and interest income on the financial asset is recognised in the income statement using
the effective interest method. The residual element is allocated to the amortisation of the financial asset.
During construction the financial assets are carried at fair value which is assumed to be equivalent to cost, plus attributable profit to the extent that this is
reasonably certain after making provision for contingencies, less any losses incurred or foreseen in bringing contracts to completion, and less amounts
received as progress payments. Costs for this purpose include valuation of all work done by subcontractors, whether certified or not, and all overheads other
than those relating to the general administration of the relevant companies.
Once the project reaches its operational phase, the fair value of the financial asset is measured at each balance sheet date by computing the discounted
future value of the cash flow allocated to the financial asset. The movement in the fair value of the financial asset since the previous balance sheet date is
taken to equity.
(l) Pensions
The Group’s principal pension scheme for the benefit of permanent members of staff is the Interserve Pension Scheme, which is both of the defined benefit
and defined contribution type. For defined benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of
recognised income and expense.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the income statement is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during the year.
(m) Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences which arise on the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability and the tax base of
the same item. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable they will be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
not discounted. 62 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005
1. Accounting policies (continued)
(n) Financial instruments
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income
statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at fair value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only.  The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure
to interest rate and foreign currency risk.  To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for using
hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows and net investments are recognised directly in
equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction
results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had
been previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an
asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised in the income
statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their economic risks and characteristics
are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity, until the asset is disposed of or is
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period. From
1 January 2005 onwards, assets constructed by PFI concession companies are classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
(o) Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants
of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2004.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that business
combination. Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:

Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 70 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005
11. Goodwill (continued)
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those
regarding the discount rates, growth rates and margins during the period. Management estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on current Board approved budgets and
forecasts and are extrapolated based on expectations of future changes in the market (these growth rates vary between 2 per cent and 10 per cent per
annum). The Group produces 3-year plans and these are extrapolated for a further 17 years reflecting the long-term nature of the investments.
The rate used to discount the future cash flows is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (8.2 per cent) as adjusted for the specific risk profile
of each division.

At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax
liabilities have not been recognised was £2.0 million (2004: £1.5 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group 
is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

Borrowings bear interest at floating rates related to relevant LIBOR equivalents, apart from small amounts that are related to base rates. The Group had an
interest rate cap hedging interest rate exposure on £20 million at 31 December 2005. The strike price for the cap has not been triggered, whilst this remains
the case fair value adjustments relating to the cap are accounted for through the income statement. The fair value of this cap at 31 December 2005 was £nil
(2004: £0.1 million).

Deposits receive interest at floating rates related to base rates. Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with
an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments, which represent the Group’s maximum
exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful
receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with strong credit ratings assigned by
international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

19. Unsecured loan notes
2005 2004
£million £million
Floating rate loan notes 2.2 3.9
The floating rate unsecured loan notes are redeemable at par by the noteholder giving not less than 30 days’ prior notice in writing to expire on or before any
interest payment date. Unless redeemed earlier, repayment will be made on 1 July 2008. Interest is payable half-yearly on the loan notes at rates ranging
between 0.5 per cent and 1.3 per cent below six-month LIBOR.
20. Derivative financial instruments
(a) Currency exposures
Gains and losses relating to monetary assets and liabilities of Group companies that are not denominated in their functional currency will be recognised in the
income statement. Taking into account the effect of forward contracts, Group companies did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses
on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 December 2005.
Gains and losses arising on the re-translation of overseas net assets are recognised directly in equity. Loans held by Interserve Plc denominated in the
currency of the foreign operations are designated as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge. Hedges were in place at the year end to hedge the
translation exposure on £19.8 million of net assets in order to protect Group consolidated net worth. Where these hedges were effective, gains and losses
arising on the re-translation of these hedges were also recognised directly in equity.
(b) Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
For the whole Group, financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.
(c) Market price risk
The Group seeks to control its exposures to changes in interest rates by limiting their impact on the interest charge in the income statement. This is achieved
through the use of interest rate caps where appropriate. An instantaneous 1 per cent increase across all relevant interest rates would increase the Group’s
interest charge by less than 0.5 per cent of consolidated Group profits before before tax.
(d) Gains and losses on hedges
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to eliminate the currency exposure that arises on sales or purchases denominated in foreign
currencies immediately those sales or purchases are contracted. It also uses interest rate derivatives to manage the interest rate profile. Changes in the fair
value of instruments which are effective as hedges are recognised directly in equity. Gains or losses on hedges held within joint venture entities that were
recognised in equity during the year amounted to £4.0 million net of deferred tax (2004: £nil). There were no unrecognised gains or losses on hedges at
31 December 2005 (2004: £nil).

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain of its fixtures and equipment under finance leases. The average lease term is three to four years. For the year ended 
31 December 2005, the average effective borrowing rate was 6.35 per cent. Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment
basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
All lease obligations are denominated in sterling.
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.
The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ charges over the leased assets.

The £16.4 million merger reserve represents the premium on the shares issued on the acquisition of Robert M. Douglas Holdings PLC in 1991.
The own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in Interserve Plc held by the trustee of the How Group Employee Benefit Trust. The market value of
these shares at 31 December 2005 was £835,000 (2004: £790,000).
27. Contingent liabilities
In the normal course of business, the Group is involved in disputes and litigation with third parties. Appropriate provision has been made in these accounts for
all material liabilities resulting from proceedings that are, in the opinion of the directors, likely to materialise.
At 31 December 2005 there were guarantees given in the ordinary course of business of the Group. The Company has given guarantees covering bank
overdrafts in its subsidiary and associated undertakings. At 31 December 2005 these amounted to £0.4 million (2004: £3.8 million). 27. Contingent liabilities (continued)
The Group has given guarantees in respect of bank borrowings and guarantees made available to associated undertakings for sums not exceeding £4.2 million
(2004: £7.1 million) in respect of borrowings and £36.7 million (2004: £28.0 million) in respect of guarantees. At 31 December 2005 £0.9 million (2004: £nil)
had been utilised in borrowings and £24.7 million (2004: £13.1 million) in guarantees.
28. Share-based payments
1997 Share Option Plan / 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme
The executive share option schemes provide for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant. 
The vesting period is generally three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
Furthermore, options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

The average share price during the year was £3.46. The outstanding options granted between 7 November 2002 and the end of the period, had exercise prices
ranging from £2.06 to £3.59 and had a remaining weighted average contractual life of 8.7 years.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years. The expected life used in
the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non–transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural
considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £0.7 million related to equity–settled share–based payment transactions in 2005 (2004: £0.2 million) in respect of the
executive share option schemes.

Share Matching Plan
The Share Matching Plan provides for an effective grant price of £nil on the granting of “Free Shares”  to match Investment Shares deemed acquired with a
proportion of the gross annual bonuses of the participants, subject to performance criteria. The vesting period is three years. If the awards remain
unexercised after a period of 42 months from the date of grant, the awards expire. Furthermore, awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group
before the awards vest.

Matching Plan.
29. Retirement benefit schemes
The principal pension schemes within the Group have been valued for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits. For each of these pension schemes valuation
information has been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP , qualified independent actuaries, to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in 
order to assess the liabilities of the various schemes as at 31 December 2005.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. As permitted by IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside
profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense. The liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of
the various defined benefit obligations, as reduced by the fair value of plan assets. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit
Credit Method.
The following table sets out the key IAS 19 assumptions used to assess the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Assumptions: 2005 2004
Retail price inflation 2.6% pa 2.9% pa
Discount rate 4.9% pa 5.5% pa

General salary increases 3.35 – 4.1% pa 3.65 – 4.4% pa Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005  83
29. Retirement benefit schemes (continued)
The expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ending 31 December 2005 was 7.6 per cent pa (2004: 7.7 per cent). The rate is derived by taking
the weighted average of the long–term expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that the pension schemes were invested in at 31 December 2005.
For 2005 a deduction of 0.3 per cent was then made from the expected return on assets for the expenses incurred in running the schemes (where these were
not met separately).
The post–retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation allows for future improvements in mortality and implies for the majority of the
obligation (that associated with the Interserve Pension Scheme) that a 65-year-old current pensioner is expected to live until age: male 84.0 (2004: age 82.6)
and female 86.9 (2004: age 85.6). A future pensioner who is aged 65 in 2025 is expected to live until age: male 85.1 (2004: age 84.0) and female 87.9 
(2004: age 86.9).

Notes to the reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004
i The Group has adopted IAS 19 Employee Benefits in respect of its defined benefit pension schemes. The balance sheet impact of the implementation of this standard is to recognise a pension liability of
£127.5 million in the Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet in place of the £33.2 million SSAP 24 prepayment previously held under UK GAAP . Net of the deferred tax associated with both of these balances,
the net impact is to reduce consolidated net assets by £112.5 million.
ii As required by IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date no provision is made within the opening IFRS balance sheet for the final proposed dividend for 2003 because at the balance sheet date it was still
subject to approval and is thus not considered to be an adjusting event. The result is a £10.6 million increase in reported net assets due to the non–provision for the 2003 final proposed dividend.
iii As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has decided to apply UK GAAP in the comparative information in relation to financial instruments within the scope of IAS 32 and IAS 39. Had the comparative information
been prepared in full compliance with IAS 32 and IAS 39, the main adjustment would have been to the share of reserves consolidated in respect of PFI Joint Venture arrangements reflecting the fair value
of available–for–sale financial assets and interest rate swaps entered into within these special purpose companies. This would result in a net increase in the net asset carrying value for these investments
and an equal increase in consolidated reserves.
iv IAS 12 Income Taxes requires that a deferred tax liability be recognised for all non–controllable taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates. The Group has thus
provided a deferred tax liability for the additional tax that would arise on the distribution of reserves held by its overseas associates. It is estimated that at 1 January 2004 this would amount to £2.0
million and this is the consequent reduction in Group net assets. Notes to the consolidated accounts continued

Notes to the reconciliation of profit or loss for the year to 31 December 2004
i IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires separate recognition of the operating and finance costs of defined benefit pension schemes in the income statement. Any variations due to actuarial gains and losses are
recognised immediately in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The impact of the transition to IFRS in 2004 is an additional charge of £2.4 million to profit from operations with a further £1.4 million charge to net interest and a related tax credit of £1.2 million.
The actuarial loss for the year of £2.1 million (net of deferred tax of £0.6 million) is taken directly to reserves.
ii IFRS 3 no longer permits the amortisation of goodwill. Instead goodwill is carried at cost and is subject to regular impairment reviews.
Interserve has chosen, under the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1, to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from the transition date. Hence all prior business combination accounting is frozen at the transition date
and the value of goodwill is frozen at 1 January 2004 and amortisation previously reported under UK GAAP for 2004 is reversed for IFRS statements. The impact in 2004 is a reduction in the amortisation
charge of £9.6 million. There are no associated tax impacts.
iii As required by IFRS 2 Share–Based Payment a charge of £0.2 million has been made to profit from operations recognising the fair value of outstanding share options granted since 7 November 2002. The fair
value has been calculated using the Black–Scholes options valuation model and is charged to income over the relevant vesting periods, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting. There is no
impact on net assets as a result of this charge.
iv As allowed within IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures Interserve has opted to equity account for its interests in joint ventures. Whilst this is a continuation of the equity accounting adopted under UK GAAP ,
there is a presentational change under IFRS that requires the presentation of the net result after tax as part of the profit from operations. There is no net profit impact but the result is to reduce Profit
from Operations by £1.2 million, Finance Income by £9.9 million and Finance Costs by £10.9 million. Tax expense reduces by £0.2 million.
v IAS 12 Income Taxes requires that a deferred tax liability be recognised for all non–controllable taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates. The Group has thus
provided a deferred tax liability for the additional tax that would arise on the distribution of reserves held by its overseas associates. It is estimated that this would amount to a further £0.2 million on
additional reserves accumulated during the year and this is the consequent reduction in Group net assets. Notes to the consolidated accounts continued

i The Group has adopted IAS 19 Employee Benefits in respect of its defined benefit pension schemes. The balance sheet impact of the implementation of this standard is to recognise a pension liability of
£128.9 million in the Group’s IFRS balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 in place of the £37.7 million SSAP 24 prepayment previously held under UK GAAP . Net of the deferred tax associated with both of
these balances, the net impact is to reduce consolidated net assets by £116.6 million.

Interserve has chosen, under the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1, to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from the transition date. Hence all prior business combination accounting is frozen at the transition date
and the value of goodwill is frozen at 1 January 2004 and amortisation previously reported under UK GAAP for 2004 is reversed for IFRS statements. The impact in 2004 is a reduction in the amortisation
charge of £9.6 million. There are no associated tax impacts. Consequently consolidated net assets increase by £9.6 million from those reported under UK GAAP .
iii As required by IAS 10 Events After the Balance Sheet Date no provision is made within these accounts for the final proposed dividend because at the balance sheet date it was still subject to approval and
is thus not considered to be an adjusting event. The result is an £11.0 million increase in reported net assets due to the non–provision for the 2004 final proposed dividend.
iv As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has decided to apply UK GAAP in the comparative information in relation to financial instruments within the scope of IAS 32 and IAS 39. Had the comparative information
been prepared in full compliance with IAS 32 and IAS 39, the main adjustment would have been to the share of reserves consolidated in respect of PFI Joint Venture arrangements reflecting the fair value
of available–for–sale financial assets and interest rate swaps entered into within these special purpose companies. This would result in a net increase in the net asset carrying value for these investments
and an equal increase in consolidated reserves.
v IAS 12 Income Taxes requires that a deferred tax liability be recognised for all non–controllable taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates. The Group has thus
provided a deferred tax liability for the additional tax that would arise on the distribution of reserves held by its overseas associates. It is estimated that at 31 December 2004 this would amount to £2.2
million and this is the consequent reduction in Group net assets. Notes to the consolidated accounts continued

We have audited the individual Company accounts and notes of Interserve
Plc for the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the balance
sheet and the related notes 33 to 48. These individual company accounts
and notes have been prepared under the accounting policies set out
therein.
The corporate governance statement and the directors’ remuneration
report are included in the Group annual report of Interserve Plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2005. We have reported separately 
on the Group accounts and notes of Interserve Plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2005 and on the information in the directors’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the
individual Company accounts and notes in accordance with applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement 
of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the individual Company accounts and notes
in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the individual Company
accounts and notes give a true and fair view in accordance with the
relevant financial reporting framework and whether the individual
Company accounts and notes have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We report to you if the directors’ report is
not consistent with the individual Company accounts and notes, if the
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained 
in the annual report for the above year as described in the contents
section and consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the individual Company accounts and notes. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the individual Company accounts and
notes. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the individual
Company accounts and notes, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the individual
Company accounts and notes are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the individual Company accounts and notes.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the individual Company accounts and notes give a true and fair view,
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December
2005; and 
• the individual Company accounts and notes have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

33. Accounting policies
The accounts and notes have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and with the Companies Act 1985. Other than the change
in accounting policies noted below, the accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and the previous year. The Company adopted 
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, FRS 20 Share-based Payment, FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement. The effect of adopting FRS 17, FRS 20, FRS 21 and FRS 26 is set out in note 46 below.
The particular policies adopted by the directors are described below.
(a) Basis of accounting
These accounts and notes have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
(b) Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. These translation differences are dealt with in the profit for
the year.
(c) Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
(i) Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight line or reducing balance basis at rates ranging between:
Straight line
Freehold land Nil
Freehold buildings 2% 
Leasehold property Over period of lease
Computer hardware 33.3%
Computer software 33.3%
Furniture and office equipment 33.3%
Motor vehicles 25%
Plant and equipment 10% to 20%
(ii) The costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
(d) Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
(e) Pensions
The Company operates two principal pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff: the Interserve Pension Scheme, which is of the defined
benefit type, and the Interserve Retirement Plan, which is of the defined contribution type. The Company also set up a new defined contribution section of
the Interserve Pension Scheme with effect from 1 November 2002. Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years.
For the purposes of FRS 17, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the main Group scheme, the Interserve
Pension Scheme, on a consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore, following full implementation of FRS 17, the Company will account for contributions to the
scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Note 29 to the consolidated accounts of the Group sets out details of the IAS 19 net pension liability of
£132.6 million.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the profit and loss account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during the year. 92 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005
33. Accounting policies (continued)
(f) Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a
future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of
income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the accounts. Deferred tax is not provided on
timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries or
associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not
that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
(g) Financial instruments
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income
statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at fair value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instrument.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its
exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk. To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for
using hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows and net investments are recognised directly in
equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction
results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had
been previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an
asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised in the income
statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their economic risks and characteristics
are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.

33. Accounting policies (continued)
(g) Financial instruments (continued)
Convertible capital bonds
Convertible capital bonds are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component. The Company has a convertible
capital bond that is being carried at historic cost. It has not been considered possible to value the separate components of the instrument on the basis that
this is an equity instrument that does not have a quoted market price in an active market and the derivative which is linked to and must be settled by
delivery of such an instrument is not reliably measurable.
(h) Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment. In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all
grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2004. The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to
certain employees. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate
of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. Note 28 to the consolidated accounts of the Group sets out
details of the share-based payments.
34. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. Interserve Plc
reported a profit after taxation for the financial year ended 31 December 2005 of £33.8 million (2004: £53.8 million as restated).
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £0.2 million (2004: £0.2 million).
35. Employees
The average number of persons employed, being full time equivalents, by the Company during the year, including directors, was 68 (2004: 61).

Notes to the reserves
i The Company has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme. The balance sheet impact of the implementation of this standard is to remove the £36.3 million
SSAP 24 prepayment previously held. Net of the deferred tax associated with this balance, the net impact is to reduce the Company net assets by £25.4 million.
ii As required by the adoption of FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date dividends declared after the balance sheet date but before the accounts are authorised for issue are not recognised as an
asset/(liability) at the balance sheet date. The prior period impact is to recognise the final dividends received/(paid) for the year ended 31 December 2003 and make no provision for the final dividends
received/(paid) for the year ended 31 December 2004. The result is a £4.6 million decrease in reported net assets.
iii The Company has adopted FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement. The balance sheet impact of the implementation of this standard is to reduce the value of the interest rate caps. The result is
a £0.2 million decrease in reported net assets.
iv Of the balance of £109.5 million standing in the profit and loss account at 31 December 2005 £56.5 million is considered to be unrealised and is therefore not distributable. 98 Interserve Plc  Annual Report 2005

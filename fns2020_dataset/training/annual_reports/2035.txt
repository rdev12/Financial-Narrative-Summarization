CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
This has been an important year for Betfair, with the Company 
showing great momentum and entering a phase of exciting 
innovation in both its product and brand. This is the first full  
year of our new and energetic management team. There is  
real purpose in the business and we are executing a strategy  
that is focused on delivering sustainable growth.
It is over a year since discussions with the private equity group 
CVC were terminated and in that time we have been able to see 
the value that the new team and strategy will be able to produce. 
There is much to be done, and many challenges ahead, but a good 
start has been made.
Strategy
Betfair’s strategy has been to refocus the business on regulated 
jurisdictions whilst refreshing our unique product and brand so  
we have greater appeal to a wider range of customers. 
We have continued to see signs of success on both fronts. Betfair 
has always been a unique betting company and it remains so. 
Following recent product innovations, we are now steadily building 
a highly exciting sports betting platform and have increased our 
marketing spend to take it to a wider audience. 
We now concentrate investment in markets with regulatory visibility 
and have subsequently been able to focus our resources on growing 
our active customer base in key territories. Sustainable revenues 
now make up far more of our total revenue base, lending the 
business stability and significantly improving our quality of earnings. 
We have started to use our strong cash position to make selected 
investments in some promising international opportunities, with 
exciting developments in New Jersey and Italy coming within the year.
Financial performance
The financial performance in the year has been encouraging, 
with double-digit growth in sustainable revenues in the last three 
quarters. Overall revenue was up 2% to £393.6m, with growth 
diluted by the reduction in revenue from other markets, in line 
with our strategy. The cost savings we announced last year have 
been delivered and this contributed to underlying EBITDA growth 
of 24% to £91.1m. 
Cash flow remains strong and we ended the year debt free and 
with £209.8m of cash.
Regulation
As with all businesses in our industry, the constantly evolving 
regulatory landscape provides both opportunities and challenges. 
This year, as a result of positive regulatory change, we have been 
able to launch an online casino in New Jersey and an Exchange in 
Italy, the latter the culmination of several years of hard work. The 
industry is likely to see significant disruption in the coming year as 
the effect of the incoming Point of Consumption tax in the UK plays 
out. We expect operators with scale, like Betfair, to be best placed 
to adapt to this change. In unregulated markets, visibility remains 
low, validating our strategy of focusing on regulated jurisdictions. 
Board
There have been a number of changes to Betfair’s Board over the 
year, with the addition of significant experience from major PLC 
and digital consumer businesses. 
Mike McTighe, Fru Hazlitt and Josh Hannah have all stepped 
down from the Board. They all served as Non-Executive Directors 
of Betfair with distinction for a long period of time, and we thank 
them again for their invaluable contribution over the years. We 
have welcomed to the Board Zillah Byng-Maddick, CEO of Future 
plc; Leo Quinn, CEO of QinetiQ Group plc; and Peter Rigby, 
former CEO of Informa plc as Non-Executive Directors. All three 
are already proving to be valuable additions to the Company.
Dividend
The Board targets a progressive and sustainable dividend 
and continues to consider the appropriate payout ratio to be 
approximately 40% of profit after tax in the medium term. 
This dividend policy reflects the strong cash flow characteristics 
and long-term earnings potential of the Betfair Group, whilst 
allowing it to retain sufficient capital to fund ongoing operating 
requirements and investment. The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 14.0 pence per share, taking the full year dividend to 
20.0 pence per share, a 54% increase on last year.
Finally, the Board and I would like to thank all Betfair’s employees for 
their hard work and commitment over the past year. Betfair is a vibrant 
place to work, full of enthusiasm, and I am delighted that their efforts 
are starting to be recognised in improved business performance.

REVIEW
In December 2012 we announced a strategy to turnaround 
Betfair’s performance: moving the business onto a more 
sustainable revenue base; investing in our product and brand so 
that we could address the wider recreational market; and using 
our strong balance sheet to access growth opportunities as and 
when they emerge.

LEAN, DYNAMIC, INNOVATION DRIVEN
 
Our belief was that Betfair had significant potential but that its 
product and brand needed adapting to appeal more to the mass 
market, and the business itself needed to operate more efficiently 
to fund the investment required to grow our customer base and 
revenues in sustainable markets. 
Following the encouraging early developments announced in 
FY13, we are pleased that Betfair has this year been able to 
switch gears and start making significant progress towards  
our strategic objectives. 
Overview of results
Revenue of £393.6m (FY13: £387.0m) reflected strong growth  
in Sportsbook and Betfair US, partly offset by a weak Gaming 
performance. This result included significant adverse impacts from 
market exits (£13.3m) and the absence of a major international 
football tournament (£7.8m from Euro 2012). 
Underlying EBITDA was up 24% to £91.1m (FY13: £73.3m). 
The improvement in profitability was driven primarily by cost 
savings, which were in excess of our £30m target. This, along 
with lower depreciation and amortisation, resulted in underlying 
basic earnings per share increasing by 57% to 49.0 pence 
(FY13: 31.2 pence).
The Group ended the year with a cash balance of £209.8m 
(FY13: £168.1m) and no debt.
Strategy update
Betfair’s objective is to achieve profitable scale in sustainable 
markets and during FY14 we have continued to focus Betfair’s 
marketing activities towards licensed operations. As a result the 
business faces substantially less regulatory risk. Sustainable 
markets (defined as the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Malta, Gibraltar 
and US) now contribute 78% of Group revenues (FY13: 72%). 
Sustainable revenues were up 9% over the year, with growth 
across all products. This contrasts markedly with revenue from 
other markets, which was down 18%.
We believe that the key to winning in our target markets is 
to create differentiated products that give Betfair customers 
unique advantages over those using other brands. Betfair is 
now in a position to do this through integrating its Exchange 
and Sportsbook, both of which possess functionality that, when 
put together, can create a truly unique sports betting platform. 
We are now making significant investment to develop products 
that enable every customer to access the full range of both 
platforms. To this end, this year has seen us launch new products 
that are rapidly changing the traditional Sportsbook model: 
• The ability to Cash Out both singles and accumulator 
Sportsbook bets brings a concept historically only available on 
the Exchange to new customer segments and is redefining the 
boundaries of how customers bet on live sport. 
• Our recent launch of Price Rush, a simple product feature that 
boosts the odds offered to Sportsbook customers by matching 
their bets seamlessly on the Exchange. 
‘ WE BELIEVE THAT THE KEY TO 
WINNING IN OUR TARGET MARKET  
IS TO CREATE DIFFERENTIATED 
PRODUCTS THAT GIVE BETFAIR 
CUSTOMERS UNIQUE ADVANTAGES 
OVER THOSE USING OTHER BRANDS.’

STRATEGIC REPORT  
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Through integrating our products we believe we can restore 
Betfair to its position as a disruptive frontrunner within a market 
where differentiation between operators is otherwise almost 
non-existent. Integration provides inherent benefits to our ongoing 
business. Recreational customers who might not always take the 
time to learn the functionality of the Exchange can now access it, 
and in doing so, they increase liquidity on the Exchange.
The ongoing integration of these two products means we will  
report a combined Sports revenue number in FY15.
The product successes mean we will continue to invest over  
£100m in sales and marketing this year, including entering high 
profile partnerships with Channel 4 Racing, Sky Sports and ITV 
Sport, accompanied by investment in social channels. Our brand 
messaging seeks to place Betfair at the heart of the excitement 
generated around live sport and we are a Gold partner of ITV’s 
World Cup football coverage, enabling us to target a significant 
recreational audience at the world’s most watched sporting event. 
The early results of our product and brand investment have  
been encouraging. We have seen sustained increases in  
our customer acquisition numbers in UK and Ireland (up 54% 
year on year). This has driven strong growth in Betfair’s active 
customer base, with UK and Ireland active customer numbers up 
35% in FY14. The increase in customer numbers has in turn driven 
double-digit growth in sustainable revenues in each of the last 
three quarters. Mobile continues to be a key channel and revenue 
was up 70% following a 50% increase in active mobile customers.
We are focused on achieving sustainable international expansion 
and have therefore been encouraged by the launches of both  
our online casino in New Jersey and our Exchange in Italy,  
two markets which we believe possess attractive long-term 
characteristics. Whilst it is very early days for both products,  
we believe our 8% share of the New Jersey casino market to 
date represents a fair start and that our Italian Exchange, which 
is the first into the new market, offers a compelling experience  
for sports bettors in Italy. 
Betfair’s strategic objectives are supported by our ongoing  
drive to become a leaner, more dynamic organisation. In FY13,  
we undertook a thorough review of our cost base and identified  
a number of areas where the business could become leaner and 
we delivered £33m of cost savings in FY14. This has led to 
improved margins and is enabling us to make further investments 
in product and marketing to drive future revenue growth.
Outlook
Betfair operates in an uncertain marketplace where many 
governments, including in the UK, are either introducing or 
contemplating new regulatory or fiscal arrangements. Whilst this 
makes any future predictions on financial performance difficult, our 
strategy is working and the business is seeing good momentum. 
Outside of our sustainable jurisdictions, we continue to expect 
regulatory uncertainty and declining revenue as a result of lack 
of investment and market exits. Our best estimate is that revenues 
in other markets will reduce by between 15% and 25% per 
annum. However, we remain confident that we can grow 
sustainable revenues in line with the online market growth rate.

GENERATING VALUE  
FOR SHAREHOLDERS
EXCHANGE
CUSTOMER v CUSTOMER
Betfair’s pioneering Exchange 
matches customers to bet against 
each other. This eliminates the 
financial risk borne by bookmakers 
generally resulting in better odds. 
Betfair earns a small commission 
on each bet regardless  
of sporting outcome.
SPORTSBOOK
CUSTOMER v BETFAIR
Betfair’s Sportsbook is a traditional 
fixed odds bookmaking product 
where customers bet directly 
against Betfair on sporting 
outcomes. Betfair builds a margin 
into these odds and over time, 
we expect these margins to allow 
us to generate revenue.
GAMING
CUSTOMER v CUSTOMER & 
CUSTOMER v BETFAIR
Betfair’s Gaming product has 
varied models - some, such as 
Casino see customers bet against 
Betfair while others, such as Poker, 
see customers bet against each 
other with Betfair taking a share 
of the winnings.

STRATEGIC REPORT  
BUSINESS REVIEW
SPORTS
14 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 STEP 1 COMPLETING  
OUR PRODUCT SET
Betfair’s Exchange revolutionised the sports betting industry when 
it was launched in 2000; providing better value by eliminating the 
bookmaker, and empowering customers by offering trading 
opportunities, both before an event and in-play. 
However successful the Exchange has been, it does not suit all 
customers all of the time. It can often be perceived to be complicated, 
and liquidity is not always available in all markets. To close market gaps 
and increase the recreational appeal of our brand, Betfair launched a 
Sportsbook in early 2013. The theory was that a fixed odds product 
would allow us to access a greater share of the recreational market, by 
providing an attractive, simple product with broader market coverage. 
Since launch, we have seen evidence that this theory is correct. The 
Sportsbook has enabled more effective marketing and has increased 
customer acquisition in sustainable regions.
STEP 2 INTEGRATION
Whilst our two products work well as standalone platforms, the real 
potential lies in bringing them together into an integrated sports 
offering that provides the best of both to all customers. 
Betfair is now focused on presenting the customer with products that 
offer the twin advantages of both platforms; harnessing the simplicity 
and market range of the Sportsbook to the superior value and trading 
functionality available on an Exchange. By doing this, we believe we can 
truly stand out in a crowded market. 
This concept has so far been illustrated by our pioneering ‘Cash Out’ 
feature, which we have brought from the Exchange to the Sportsbook 
and placed at the centre of our marketing.
STEP 3 RE-SETTING THE AGENDA
The most recent stage of our integration process is ‘Price Rush’ – a 
feature that uses sophisticated technology to do something relatively 
simple, boosting the odds offered to certain Sportsbook customers by 
matching them seamlessly into the Exchange. 
The product allows customers who do not know how to use the 
Exchange to receive the inherent pricing benefits, and feed liquidity 
back into those who do. The initial results have been encouraging with 
36% of eligible singles bets being ‘Rushed’ and customers on average 
receiving 24% better odds on those bets. The product has already 
proved a hit with customers who have shared a whole range of early 
anecdotal examples of the tool in action on Twitter.
BETFAIR IS EVOLVING:
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 STRATEGIC REPORT  
BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
SPORTS
EXCHANGE
Betfair was built around its Exchange and 
the superior value provided by this product 
remains central to maintaining our competitive 
advantage in the marketplace. 
The Exchange provides inherently strong value within a wide 
range of sports markets and subsequently enjoys excellent 
brand affinity with its users. It forms the foundation of 
the integrated products we are now taking to both the 
sophisticated and recreational sports betting markets.
Overview of results
Exchange revenue was down 1% to £244.3m (FY13: £247.5m). 
The first half of the year saw a decline of 7%, largely due to the 
absence of a major international football tournament (Euro 2012) 
and the adverse impact of market exits. In sustainable markets 
Exchange revenue was up 2%. 
Operational developments
We continue to focus on increasing liquidity on the Exchange, 
recognising that this is the key factor behind attracting and 
retaining customers and the ultimate driver of better value.  
Price Rush is one high profile way we are boosting liquidity 
and we continue to work on initiatives to increase activity 
in less liquid markets. 
The Exchange remains a natural home of in-play sports betting 
and this year has seen strong revenue performance in sports that 
have trading dimensions such as tennis and cricket. The 2014 
World T20 cricket tournament saw close to £1bn matched between 
customers in total. The 2013 home Ashes series was also popular 
with the dramatic First Test at Trent Bridge becoming the second 
highest single event traded ever on the Exchange at £61m. The 
historic 2013 Wimbledon final between Andy Murray and Novak 
Djokovic saw £48m traded across all markets.
Mobile is an extremely important channel, with around 52% of 
active Exchange customers placing a bet via mobile in the year. 
We have also continued to improve our products for our high 
end Exchange customers, with a number of improvements to our 
Application Programming Interface (API), which allows customers 
to bet directly into our Exchange without using our own website 
or mobile channels, launched over the year.
The hugely popular Cash Out product started on the Exchange. 
We have recently taken the concept further through Cash Out+, 
which allows customers to partially cash out their bets, further 
differentiating the product from competitors’ offerings.
The Exchange continues to provide inherent value on popular sports such as Football and Horse Racing
For further information about exchange visit:  
www.betfair.com/exchange 
16 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The Sportsbook has been placed at the centre of Betfair’s 
marketing and customer acquisition, with several of Betfair’s 
television advertising campaigns this year focusing on market 
leading functions it possesses, such as the aforementioned ‘Cash 
Out’, and more recently its ability to ‘Price Rush’ bets to better 
odds through the Exchange. This has come alongside more 
traditional promotional activity, with some of these offers now 
benefiting from Betfair’s technology capability, such as Cash 
Back Extra, which allows customers to select their own trigger 
for returning stakes on losing bets. The interactive nature of 
these products has meant they have become an organic source 
of social media and PR activity between Betfair and customers.
Mobile delivered 56% of all Sportsbook revenues in the year, 
rising to 64% in the fourth quarter.
SPORTSBOOK 
This has been a transformational year for Betfair’s 
Sportsbook. The team began this financial year 
with a focus on closing competitive market 
coverage gaps, before making significant 
improvements to the user experience.
The focus in FY14 was on creating a competitive Sportsbook 
and we are now entering an exciting development phase where 
innovative products are making our product stand out from a 
crowded marketplace.
Overview of results
Sportsbook revenue grew by 50% to £36.2m (FY13: £24.1m)  
following a 50% rise in the number of active customers.
Operational developments
For a new product in a competitive marketplace, the underlying 
performance of the Sportsbook has been highly encouraging. 
Volume more than doubled over the year, with particularly high 
levels of activity on football. We now offer fixed odds betting on 30 
sports and have continued to broaden our market coverage in order 
to build a fully competitive product. In April 2014 our Sportsbook 
ran 4,100 football matches, 1,200 tennis matches and 300 other 
sports events, which is three times the number of events offered at 
the start of the year. The number of ‘in-play’ markets within these 
events also more than doubled over the year.

STRATEGIC REPORT  
BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
GAMING
Overview of results
Gaming revenue decreased by 13% to £66.2m (FY13: £75.9m). 
The reduction was primarily due to the continued decline in Poker 
and the adverse impact on other markets following the decision to 
focus on sustainable revenues, partly offset by UK Casino growth.
In sustainable markets, Gaming revenue was up 2% in the year.
Operational developments
We have taken significant steps to address two issues that have 
affected Betfair’s ability to compete in Gaming: by closing product 
gaps and improving cross-sell from recreational sports customers.
The work undertaken falls broadly into two areas. Firstly, we have 
made product upgrades to our Casino so that it now hosts the top 
level of content offered by Playtech, introducing popular features 
such as Live Dealer and more recently a tailored site for VIPs, a 
key way of serving and driving revenues from this important 
customer group. 
Accompanying this has been structural work designed to make our 
site easier for customers to use. Customers now get a more 
intuitive welcome experience, meaning a higher percentage of new 
sign ups now fund their accounts. We have launched a ‘seamless 
wallet’ between sports and gaming products, meaning it is now 
easier for customers to use funds between Sports and Gaming. 
This, alongside more effective promotional activity, is increasing 
our cross-sell from Sports into Gaming. 
We have recognised the need to make a greater impact across all 
channels, and have subsequently made significant investment in 
mobile gaming, recently launching new Bingo and Casino mobile 
apps. The number of active customers using mobile rose 155% 
year on year.

www.tvg.com and www.betfaircasino.com 
Betfair US has expanded this year with our existing 
TVG horseracing business being joined by a 
New Jersey online casino site which launched 
in November. 
Betfair US now consists of two operations:
( i )  T VG – an advanced deposit horserace wagering 
business, which operates primarily in both California 
and New Jersey; and
(ii)  Betfair New Jersey, a new online Casino site which was 
launched in November 2013 following the regulation of  
online gaming in the state. 
TVG performed well in FY14, against a weak economic backdrop 
in the US Racing industry. Revenues increased 19% (constant 
currency) to £44.5m as handle, which is the volume of wagers 
placed, increased by 33% (constant currency), against a wider 
industry handle that was flat in the period. This was helped by the 
launch of advanced deposit wagering in New Jersey following our 
exclusive agreement to operate the 4NJbets platform on behalf 
of the State of New Jersey and the racing industry. Since taking 
over the responsibility for the platform, TVG has modernised the 
product offering, helping to drive a 57% increase in wagering 
volumes. The revenue growth and management of costs have 
resulted in substantial margin expansion.
The business has continued to make significant strides, recently 
investing to upgrade the TVG cable channel to High Definition, 
which we believe will consolidate our viewing share in the future. 
The attractiveness of the TVG brand worldwide was recently 
illustrated by the signing of a strategic partnership with the world 
famous Hong Kong Jockey Club, which will link pari-mutuel 
wagering from both the US and Hong Kong for the first time.
Betfair New Jersey was launched in November 2013. Whilst the 
overall market size is smaller than originally expected, Betfair 
New Jersey’s total gross gaming revenue (GGR) was £1.8m, 
representing a 6% share of the nascent market. Our share 
of the casino market to date is 8%.
Further detail on the financial performance of Betfair US is 
provided in the Financial Review on pages 21 to 24.
BETFAIR US 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 19 UK and Ireland
The Government has recently introduced legislation that 
will change the basis of licensing and taxation to a Point of 
Consumption basis from December 2014. This will require all 
operators selling into the UK market, whether based domestically 
or overseas, to hold a UK Gambling Commission licence to 
transact and advertise within the UK and to pay betting duty   
at a rate of 15% of revenue generated from UK persons. 
Betfair continues to engage with the Government to emphasise 
the importance of effective enforcement of any new rules to 
ensure player protection and fair competition in the marketplace. 
We expect a system of taxation for online sports betting to be 
in place in Ireland before the end of FY15, although exact timings 
remain uncertain. The Irish government is considering introducing 
a new licensing system for operators although the timeline for its 
introduction is also uncertain.
International
Betfair continues to engage within international markets where 
there is the prospect of fair and workable regulation.
We have seen significant developments in the US this year,  
with New Jersey opening its market for online gaming to sites run 
by partnerships between online operators and local casinos. Betfair 
partnered with the Trump Plaza Casino and in November 2013 was 
one of several operators to be awarded a ‘Transactional Waiver’, 
which allowed us to launch our new site www.betfaircasino.com 
in New Jersey. 
In Italy, we have recently launched our Exchange with national 
liquidity, having worked with the regulator for a significant period 
of time to achieve this. Over the past year we have been building 
our brand presence in the Italian market, launching a new Italian 
Sportsbook in November 2013 which featured a major update to 
the site’s design and functionality. The Exchange launch supports 
our strategy to grow sustainable revenues and to find new  
overseas markets.
We have recently been awarded a licence in Bulgaria, and launched 
an Exchange in April 2014 which now operates in line with the 
country’s newly adopted online gaming regulation, taxing operators 
at 20% of gross gaming revenue. 
We continue to monitor developments elsewhere and participate 
where appropriate. Whilst we cannot predict with any degree  
of certainty, we continue to expect further market exits from 
territories where the future of online gaming regulation is unclear. 
We are particularly monitoring current developments in Eastern 
European territories. Our objective remains to mitigate any loss  
of revenue from other markets through the ongoing growth  
of sustainable revenues.
Gaming taxes
If both the proposed UK and Irish taxation changes had been in 
place for the whole of FY14 along with the gaming taxes we are 
now incurring in Italy, we estimate that the cost would have been 
approximately £36m.
REGULATION
Betfair continues to operate within an evolving 
regulatory environment and there have been  
a number of significant developments in the  
past year.

to underlying figures is set out on page 24.
Summary
Revenue increased by 2% to £393.6m (FY13: £387.0m), with 
strong growth in Sportsbook and Betfair US partly offset by a 
weak Gaming performance. Revenue included significant adverse 
impacts from market exits (£13.3m revenue impact from Greece, 
Germany, Cyprus and Spain) and the absence of a major international 
football tournament (FY13: £7.8m revenue from Euro 2012).
Reported profit before tax for the year was £61.1m (FY13 loss: 
£49.4m). In the prior year £104.5m of expenses and charges 
were separately disclosed due to their exceptional nature. These 
items included non-cash charges relating to impairment of the 
carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets as well as 
restructuring costs. The prior year also included £16.8m profits 
arising on disposal of Kabam.
Management believes that underlying results, which exclude these 
separately disclosed items, provide additional guidance to statutory 
measures to help understand the underlying performance of the 
business during the financial year. Underlying EBITDA was up 
24% to £91.1m (FY13: £73.3m) and underlying profit before tax 
was up 61% to £61.1m (FY13: £38.0m), with the improvement 
driven primarily by the cost savings announced in FY13. This, 
along with lower depreciation and amortisation, resulted in 
underlying basic earnings per share increasing by 57% to 
49.0 pence (FY13: 31.2 pence).
The Group ended the year with a cash balance of £209.8m 
(FY13: £168.1m) and no debt.

Sportsbook represents the segment previously described as Sports.
Exchange revenue was down 1% to £244.3m (FY13: £247.5m). The first half of the year saw a decline of 7%, largely due to the adverse 
impact of market exits and the absence of a major international football tournament. 
Sportsbook revenue was up 50% to £36.2m (FY13: £24.1m), driven by a 137% increase in the amount staked following a 50% rise in 
the number of active customers.
Gaming revenue decreased by 13% to £66.2m (FY13: £75.9m). This was primarily due to the continued decline in poker and lower 
revenues in other markets following the decision to focus on sustainable jurisdictions, partly offset by UK Casino growth. 
US Revenue increased by 20% to £45.7m (FY13: £38.0m), mainly driven by TVG where handle (which is the volume of wagers placed) 
and revenue increased by 33% and 19% respectively (both constant currency). Revenue was also boosted by the launch of New Jersey 
Casino in H2 (£1.2m).

Technology costs before capitalisation of internal development 
expenditure were down 16% on the prior year following 
headcount reductions, a shift of development activity to Romania

of internal development expenditure was capitalised compared 
with £17.4m in FY13. Technology costs after this capitalisation 
were down 5% on the prior year.
Operations spend was down 16% in the period with savings in 
office costs partly offset by increased investment in customer

General & administrative (G&A) costs were down 30%, primarily 
driven by lower headcount.
Depreciation and amortisation of £29.5m was 22% lower than

91.1 73.3 +24%
EBITDA increased by 78% to £91.1m, partly due to separately

£22.1m). Excluding these, Underlying EBITDA increased by 24% 
to £91.1m.
Underlying EBITDA excluding US increased by 27% to £89.1m 
(FY13: £70.4m), with the improvement driven primarily by the 
cost savings announced in FY13.
Betfair US Underlying EBITDA decreased by 31% to £2.0m 
(FY13: £2.9m). A positive performance in TVG, driven by a 
combination of increased operating leverage and cost savings, 
was offset by significant start-up costs incurred as part of our 
multi-year investment in New Jersey Casino. In addition to the 
start-up costs already incurred, the Group has committed to 
prepay a revenue share to a third party which is contingent on 
that third party meeting specific requirements. As at 30 April 
2014, the Group deems the fulfilment of these criteria as 
uncertain. In the event that the payment was to crystallise, there 
would be no significant impact on the profitability of the Group.
Finance income and expenses
Net interest income from corporate funds was £0.7m 
(FY13: income of £1.4m). Total finance income and expenses 
include a net foreign exchange loss of £0.4m (FY13: gain of 
£0.3m). Excluding the foreign exchange impact, finance income  
of £1.1m was unchanged from the prior year.
Share of profit from equity accounted investments – 
Betfair Australia
Our share of operating losses in Betfair Australia was £1.2m 
(FY13: profit of £1.4m), driven by a combination of increased 
marketing spend and higher variable costs reflecting additional 
race fields fees (charges for betting operators set by state 
racing authorities).
Taxation
The Group had a tax charge of £10.1m in the period (FY13: credit 
of £4.2m). The Group’s effective and underlying tax rate was 
16.5% (FY13 underlying: 16.4%) and we continue to expect 
the long-term sustainable tax rate to remain around this level.
Dividend 
The Board is recommending the payment of a final dividend 
of 14.0 pence per share. Together with the interim dividend 
of 6.0 pence per share, the proposed full year dividend is 
20.0 pence per share (FY13: 13.0 pence). The full year dividend 
represents 41% of profit after tax, in line with the Company’s 
dividend policy. The ex-dividend date will be 3 September 2014, 
the record date will be 5 September 2014 and payment will be 
on 3 October 2014.

(FY13: £276.3m) of which 75% were current assets (FY13: 68%). 
Current assets increased primarily as a result of the positive cash 
generated from operations in the year, while an increase in trade 
and other receivables was predominantly due to additional prepaid 
marketing expenses. 
Current liabilities reduced from £142.7m to £137.4m as a result of 
a reduction in provisions, including utilisation of the redundancy

STRATEGIC REPORT  
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
24 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 PRINCIPAL RISKS  
AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
controls and risk management framework which is designed to 
identify, manage and mitigate risks and exploit opportunities.  
It is based on the ‘three lines of defence’ model below.
During the year a comprehensive review of risks has been 
undertaken throughout the Group, principally through facilitated 
risk workshops, to ensure that all potentially material risks have 
been identified, owners agreed and management/mitigation plans 
established accordingly. The material risks were reviewed at an 
Executive level workshop plus subsequent Executive meetings and 
at both Audit Committee and Corporate Risk Committee meetings.
Risk governance and responsibilities
The Board has overall responsibility for the framework and the 
Audit Committee for assessing the scope and effectiveness of the 
systems established by management to identify, assess, monitor, 
manage and mitigate the risks and exploit opportunities.
The Corporate Risk Committee is responsible for ensuring that the 
various levels of management and lines of defence are performing 
their roles in risk management, that the risk register is properly 
maintained, material risks are being properly addressed and 
emerging risks identified and monitored.
Executive Management are responsible for ensuring that risk 
management is an integral part of business as usual, that appropriate 
internal controls are in place and that all key risks are identified, 
assessed, monitored, managed and mitigated.
STRATEGIC REPORT 
Operational Management as the first line of defence has primary 
responsibility to embed and manage internal controls and risk 
management on a day to day business as usual basis.
The second line oversight and assurance functions set appropriate 
policies, provide guidance, advice and direction on implementation 
of those policies and monitor the first line of defence.
The third line and external audit provide independent challenge 
and assurance on the above and advice on improvements. 
Regulators periodically check our compliance with legislation  
and licence requirements.
The principal risks and uncertainties which are considered to have 
a potentially material impact on the Group’s long-term performance 
and achievement of strategy are set out on the following pages, 
in no particular order, but grouped by type of risk. External and 
internal risk factors are considered. This is not intended to be 
an exhaustive and extensive analysis of all risks which may affect 
the Group. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known 
to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may 
also have an adverse effect on the business. Further details of 
how our risk management framework and policies are embedded 
can be found on pages 46 to 49.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED
KEY RISK/UNCERTAINTY DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT HOW WE MANAGE/MITIGATE
Online gambling regulation and licensing (EU/non-EU) – Strategic/External
Many jurisdictions are in the process of 
regulating their online gambling market  
by introducing regulation and licensing.
While opportunities exist, they are not 
without risks – such as commercial viability, 
delays in licensing of betting exchanges 
compared with other products, how our 
products are taxed and licensing one section 
of the online market, such as sports betting, 
but not another, such as casinos or poker.
Our strategy is to focus on sustainable 
regulated jurisdictions.
Any new licensing regime, adverse regulatory 
decisions or tax base that makes it commercially 
unviable for Betfair to operate its Exchange, 
Sportsbook and Gaming products could 
restrict our ability to grow the business, 
gain access to new customers and, ultimately, 
increase revenues.
Consequently this could impact our  
strategic objectives to focus on sustainable 
revenues and accelerate growth through 
international opportunities.
We work closely with regulators and governments 
involved in the regulation of online gambling 
throughout the EU and elsewhere to ensure that 
we secure favourable regulation for our products.
External third parties help us to substantiate 
evidence to support using a gross profits  
tax model.
We have dedicated internal and external legal, 
tax, compliance and public affairs resources  
with responsibility for advising business units  
in these matters.
Overall taking into account these factors and the 
focus on regulated jurisdictions there has been a 
substantial reduction in the potential impact on 
our licensed operations during the year.
Our products/competition – Strategic/External
Online gambling is a very competitive 
industry. Our competitors are constantly 
looking to gain advantage through aggressive 
marketing campaigns, pricing, promotional 
behaviour and new product features which 
could impact revenue or margins. Product 
and delivery to market is vital to gain 
competitive edge over other operators. 
We rely on a number of third parties  
in particular to support our Sportsbook  
and some of our Gaming products.
Our product offering could become less 
attractive in relation to competitors’ offers. 
Disproportionate growth in risk products such 
as multiples and fixed odds could result in a 
volatile earnings pattern.
We could fail to maximise the revenues earned 
from products offered.
We could have to find alternative suppliers  
in the event of their failure to provide the 
services contracted.
Consequently this could impact our strategic 
objectives to focus on sustainable revenues 
and to invest in product and brand.
Our product delivery activity includes an 
approval process whereby appropriate products 
are assessed for suitability and priority to bring 
to market.
Our experienced Trading Team and Sportsbook 
Risk Team constantly monitor client activity and 
betting patterns relating to those risk products. 
We monitor competitor promotional activities, 
pricing and products and continue to invest in 
brand, technology and product development.
We have strong relationships with key suppliers 
and continue to assess their resilience and to 
review options in the event of a need  
for change.
We have increased our investment in product, 
brand and marketing in regulated jurisdictions.
Overall taking into account the above, although 
the risk is being addressed there has not been 
any material change in potential impact.
Infrastructure and systems – Operational
We rely on IT infrastructure and systems 
for our core operations and their overall 
management.
Potential risks include:
site outages and/or loss of customer 
connectivity;
software error;
reliance on third parties; 
unauthorised access to customer or other 
sensitive data by employees, third party 
providers or through cyber-attack; and
as we increase our reliance on third parties, 
the potential to maliciously access data and 
for data compromise could increase.
We rely on our customers being able to access 
markets via the internet and any extended loss 
of connectivity could have a material effect 
on revenues.
Any failure of the Group’s and/or third party 
infrastructure could lead to significant costs and 
disruptions that could reduce revenue and harm 
our business reputation.
Breach or loss of customer or other sensitive 
data could lead to significant costs and 
disruptions that could impact revenue 
and harm our business reputation.
Consequently this could impact all of our strategic 
objectives, to focus on sustainable revenues, to 
invest in product and brand and to accelerate 
growth through international opportunities.
We regularly review our business continuity and  
IT disaster recovery plans and have service level 
agreements in place with third parties.
Our Group Security Team regularly reviews and 
assesses our systems in terms of potential threat 
and vulnerability. We carry out targeted 
infrastructure testing and have implemented our 
own Secure Coding Standard for use within the 
business. We use a variety of systems and 
applications testing tools for critical customer 
facing applications.
Overall taking into account these factors there 
has not been any material change in potential 
impact during the year.
26 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 KEY RISK/UNCERTAINTY DESCRIPTION AND IMPACT HOW WE MANAGE/MITIGATE
Customers – Strategic/Operational
Our customers are at the heart of the 
business. Macroeconomic factors such 
as licensing, regulatory, tax or other 
developments outside Betfair’s control 
could deter a significant number of 
customers from using our products.
Reduced activity by a significant number  
of customers could have a material adverse 
effect on our operations, financial  
performance and prospects.
Consequently this could impact all of our 
strategic objectives, to focus on sustainable 
revenues, to invest in product and brand and  
to accelerate growth through international 
opportunities. 
We closely monitor the behaviour of customers 
and have teams focused on their management 
and retention. 
We aim to ensure we provide a service and 
platform which grow value for both the 
customer and Betfair, and significantly  
reduce the risk of customers leaving.
We have increased our investment in product, 
brand and marketing in regulated jurisdictions.
Overall, taking into account the above, although 
the risk is being addressed there has not been 
any material change in potential impact.
Financial
Certain jurisdictions have put pressure 
on banks to refuse to process transactions 
from online gaming companies.
There are tax risks around the governance 
of tax planning structures which could result 
in unexpected liabilities.
Due to the international nature of the 
business, the Group is exposed to the impact 
of foreign exchange fluctuations on deposits 
as well as cash flows.
Whilst the future of some member countries 
of the Eurozone remains uncertain this could 
expose the Group to a wide range of issues, 
such as currency payment methods and loss 
of business in certain jurisdictions.
Under the terms of a Trust Deed, Betfair 
generally holds all customer monies in 
separately managed bank accounts which 
are safeguarded independently of Betfair’s 
corporate funds.
We hold the majority of Client and Corporate 
funds with separate counterparties.
Reduced ability to transact with customers.
Various taxes could materialise.
Adverse foreign exchange exposures could 
impact on Group revenues.
A break-up of the Eurozone, or defaults within  
it, could have a wide range of negative impacts.
Actual or perceived mismanagement of  
customer funds could have severe financial 
and reputational impacts.
There is a possibility of loss arising in the event 
of failure of counterparties.
Consequently this could impact all of our  
strategic objectives, to focus on sustainable 
revenues, to invest in product and brand and  
to accelerate growth through international 
opportunities.
We have strong relationships with key  
suppliers and continue to assess both their 
resilience and to review options in the event  
of a need for change. 
We monitor our adherence to tax planning 
through regular reviews of the governance 
structures.
We monitor exposure to foreign exchange risk 
and where appropriate use financial instruments 
to mitigate any associated risk.
Incident management plans are in place to 
address the unpredictable nature of events which 
could lead to the potential default or break-up  
of the Eurozone.
Daily and monthly reconciliations of the 
customer funds balance take place to ensure 
timely detection, in the event of fraud or error.
Client and Corporate funds are subject to 
the group treasury policy which is reviewed 
annually by the Board. Funds are spread across 
a number of highly rated or systemically 
important counterparties in short-term liquid 
instruments. In certain jurisdictions we hold 
short-term operational balances with strong local 
banks. Exposures to counterparties are regularly 
reviewed by Chief Financial Officer and adjusted 
accordingly. At 30 April 2014 the majority of the 
Group’s Client and Corporate funds were held 
with major systemically important counterparties 
or pooled AAA rated money market funds.
Overall taking into account these factors there 
has not been any material change in potential 
impact during the year.
People/key employees – Operational
Our success and anticipated future growth  
is in part dependent on the continued services 
and performance of certain Directors,  
managers and key staff. 
Our ability to continue to attract, retain  
and motivate highly skilled employees in 
an intensely competitive environment means 
that competitive packages and development 
opportunities must be available.
If we are unable to remain competitive  
in our compensation packages and career 
development, this would reduce our ability to:
retain Executives, managers and key staff; 
attract, retain and motivate highly skilled 
employees; and
engage staff with their jobs and the Group’s 
objectives.
Consequently this could impair our operations, 
financial performance and ultimately impact our 
strategic objectives, to focus on sustainable 
revenues, to invest in product and brand and 
to accelerate growth through international 
opportunities.
Group HR actively manage succession planning 
and processes which are in place throughout the 
business to identify key roles, conduct regular 
succession and talent reviews, and to provide 
competitive package and career development 
opportunities.
Our employees participate in engagement 
surveys which help us to link improvements to 
achieving our corporate goals while reducing 
employee turnover and improving productivity 
and wellbeing.
Overall taking into account these factors and 
completion of the group restructure, there has 
been a reduction in potential impact during  
the year.

Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 27 CORPORATE  
RESPONSIBILITY  
REPORT
Introduction: Committed to Corporate Responsibility
Betfair continues to be willing to do things differently for the 
benefit of our customers. Innovation, transparency and fairness  
for the customer are the core values that continue to underpin  
the business. In recent years we have started to focus more  
on Corporate Responsibility (CR) and will continue to do so  
in the future.
There is no one area of CR which is more important than any 
other. However, Betfair remains particularly proud of its track 
record in the areas of integrity and customer protection. With 
regard to integrity, in the last year Betfair has been one of the first 
operators to sign a permanent Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), as well 
as continuing to strengthen its partnerships with the Professional 
Players Federation (PPF) and British Athletes Commission (BAC). 
The past year has also seen pioneering developments in the field 
of consumer protection with new Time Out options added for all 
products allowing customers to take even greater control of their 
gambling behaviour. 
In this section we set out in full Betfair’s ongoing commitment  
to all areas of CR.
Corporate Responsibility Committee
The CR Committee is responsible for ensuring the company fulfils 
its four core values. The Committee meets at least four times a 
year and reviews Betfair’s policies and advises the Board on all 
aspects of CR, including social, ethical and environmental matters. 
Members of the CR Committee include:
• Gerald Corbett (Chair of Committee from March 2014)
• Ian Chuter – Group Operations Director
• Lisa Hillier – Group HR Director
• Ross Lane – Group Financial Controller
• Fiona Russell – Chief Legal Officer.
Fru Hazlitt chaired the Committee until March 2014.

OUR FOUR CORE VALUES:
28 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 1. BEING TRUSTED BY OUR CUSTOMERS 
Betfair wants to ensure all customers have an enjoyable and safe 
gambling experience. Where this becomes difficult, we seek to do 
all we can to help and support.
Betfair has established responsible gambling policies and strategies 
to ensure that we listen and respond to customers and help them 
when needed.
Our responsible gambling policy sets out our commitment  
to promote responsible gambling practices. You can read it  
at http://responsiblegambling.betfair.com. All customers can  
click through to this site directly from every page on Betfair’s 
website by clicking the link ‘Responsible Gambling’.
Betfair seeks to go above and beyond licensing conditions and 
operate innovative, industry leading best practice. We offer our 
customers the following methods to help them control their 
gambling activity:
Game session timers
Betfair allows customers to limit their session times for games 
or events that have no natural end, giving customers greater 
control over their gambling. On Betfair’s games, session timer 
technology gives customers an on-screen reminder 60 minutes 
(or a shorter period if selected) after the customers have placed 
their first bet, and will give the option to continue playing or to 
exit the gaming application. 
Customer-driven deposit and loss limits
Customers can limit the amount they can deposit into their Betfair 
account on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, and the amount that 
they are able to lose over a given period of a week, month or 
year. If a customer chooses to make their deposit or loss limit 
more restrictive, the settings on their account are changed with 
immediate effect. If a customer sets a deposit or loss limit which 
is less restrictive than their previous limit, there is a ‘cooling-off’ 
period of at least seven days before the settings come into effect.
Time Out options
Since January 2014 customers have also been able to elect to use 
a ‘Time Out’ option which sees their Betfair accounts closed for a 
period of their choosing (24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days or 30 days) 
which allows them to take a short-term break from gambling  
with Betfair. 
Self-exclusion options
Customers who elect to self-exclude will have their Betfair 
accounts closed for a minimum of six months from the date 
of self-exclusion. After this date, the customer can apply by 
email or letter to have their account re-opened with a deposit 
limit compulsorily applied. Each application is considered on 
an individual basis by our dedicated Responsible Gambling team. 
Customers are always free to choose that their Betfair account 
be closed permanently.

Preventing under-18s and the vulnerable from gambling
Betfair is particularly concerned about preventing under-18s and 
vulnerable groups from gambling. In accordance with the law, 
children are prohibited from betting on the Betfair site. Betfair has 
a strict underage policy and a rigorously applied age verification 
process. Betfair’s specialist Verification Team has developed a 
number of Know-Your-Customer checks in order to age verify 
customers and prevent under-18s from betting on the site.  
We are registered as a ‘gambling content’ site with the Internet 
Content Rating Association (ICRA), part of the Family Online 
Safety Institute, which provides general information and advice 
about internet safety. We also encourage customers to use 
parental filtering solutions. 
Responsible advertising
Given our focus on the protection of minors and vulnerable people  
we endeavour not to direct our advertising at these two groups. Our 
advertising and marketing comply with UK Committee of Advertising  
Codes (‘CAP Codes’: www.cap.org.uk/Advertising-Codes.aspx) 
which seek to ensure that advertising and sales promotion 
activities do not give gamblers misleading information, such  
as a false impression of the odds on winning.
Self-help and awareness information to help prevent  
problem gambling
Early identification of a problem can help combat its development 
into something more serious. By clicking on the link entitled 
‘Responsible Gambling’, customers are linked through to information 
to make them aware of the relevant issues. If a customer identifies 
that they may have a problem by answering a series of questions, 
they are advised to use Betfair’s tools to limit their behaviour and 
seek help and support.
Details of professional organisations that can help
Betfair also provides information on its website on organisations 
that can help people work through their concerns, including the 
National Problem Gambling Clinic, GamCare, Gambling Therapy 
and Gamblers Anonymous.
Funding the research, education and treatment  
of problem gambling
In the UK Betfair makes annual voluntary contributions to the 
Responsible Gambling Trust. Since April 2009, the gambling 
industry has voluntarily contributed over £24 million. Major 
operators, like Betfair, donate on the understanding that a 
minimum target, currently set at £6 million, will be reached  
each year.
Responsible gambling training for employees
All Betfair employees receive responsible gambling awareness 
training within their first three months of employment, and this 
training is refreshed annually. Customer facing employees receive 
additional in-depth training which is refreshed regularly. Training 
includes identifying the triggers and causes of problem gambling; 
the risks specific to remote gambling; knowledge of available 
support agencies; self-exclusion and other player protection 
functionalities; and policies, processes and regulatory requirements.

STRATEGIC REPORT  
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT CONTINUED
30 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 2. ACTING WITH INTEGRITY 
Safeguarding the integrity of sport
Information sharing agreements with sports
We are committed to assisting sports governing bodies (SGBs) 
in helping to maintain the integrity within their sports. Betfair 
has always been on the front foot in sharing information with 
sports. We have a team of dedicated experts making use of 
cutting edge technological capabilities to ensure that Betfair 
remains a recognised leader in integrity.
Betfair now has 58 MoUs with SGBs around the world. In 2013 
Betfair signed a permanent MoU with the IOC, as well as the 
Spanish Football League La Liga Nacional de Futbol Profesional 
(LFP), the Scottish Football Association and the International 
Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) covering the 2013 
World Championships. MoUs allow Betfair’s Integrity Team to 
share any relevant customer and transactional data, at an account 
level, with SGBs if a betting integrity related issue is detected. 
Educational partnerships with sports
Betfair continues to strengthen its educational partnerships with 
the PPF and the BAC.
In July 2013 Betfair committed to extending its partnership with 
the PPF for a further three years. This was announced in the 
House of Commons by the Sports Minister Hugh Robertson MP, 
who praised the partnership and highlighted the common interests 
between sports and betting operators in this important area. The 
funding will ensure ongoing education on sports betting integrity 
for at least 7,500 sports men and women in the UK.
As part of our partnership with the BAC Betfair has co-authored  
a guide on the rules to betting for all Olympic and World Class 
Athletes. Given the wide variety of sports covered, some of which 
do not have specific rules on betting, this straightforward guide 
aims to increase awareness of the issues and provide some basic 
rules for athletes. The guide is available on the BAC’s website at 
www.britishathletes.org.
Continuing a pioneering partnership with British Racing
Betfair’s relationship with British Racing continues to grow 
stronger, underpinned by the unique five-year commercial deal 
signed in July 2012. Under the terms on the deal Betfair has now 
made direct payments of over £16 million to British Racing.
Betfair’s commitment to British Racing extends beyond direct 
payments under the terms of the deal. Over the past year Betfair 
has invested a significant six-figure sum supporting a wide range of 
organisations, charities and initiatives including (but not limited to):
• continuing as Racing Welfare’s biggest corporate sponsor and 
supporter of the fifth Pride of Racing Awards at Haydock Park 
in September 2013;
• supporting the Injured Jockeys Fund and sponsoring the Betfair 
Wing at Oaksey House in Lambourn;
• funding 50% of ‘the jockeys’ doctor’, Anna Louise Mackinnon, 
in partnership with the Professional Jockeys Association;
• sponsoring the Animal Health Trust’s annual raceday at 
Newmarket in June 2013;
• sponsoring the World Horse Welfare’s Annual Conference  
for the third year running; 
• sponsoring the Betfair Scottish Flat Racing Series 2013;
• sponsoring the Betfair Novice Flat Amateur Series 2013; and
• being title sponsor of Open Days at Lambourn, Newmarket, 
Middleham and Malton.
WORKING WITH THE IOC BEYOND  
LONDON 2012
PERMANENT MOU WITH THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC 
COMMITTEE (IOC)
In December 2013 Betfair was one of the first betting operators 
to sign a permanent MoU with the IOC which enables Betfair  
to share customer information and betting patterns in the rare 
event of an integrity issue emerging within a relevant market.  
This replaces previous MoUs Betfair signed with the IOC to 
cover each Games since the Beijing Games in 2008. Under a 
permanent MoU Betfair is fully integrated into the IOC’s new 
Integrity Betting Intelligence System (IBIS) and can share 
information with the IOC as and when required during and 
between Games.
 ‘ The MoUs between the IOC and various betting operators 
and regulators, including Betfair, are part of our concerted 
strategy to support clean sport and protect major 
competitions from any form of manipulation, particularly 
those linked to betting. We are very pleased with these 
agreements, which build on our successful collaboration 
during London 2012.’  
Mark Adams, IOC Communications Director
INVESTING IN BRITISH RACING 
Betfair has continued to build on its relationship with British 
Racing since being the first ever betting operator to establish 
a landmark five-year commercial agreement in July 2012 worth 
at least £40 million to the sport. Under the terms of the deal 
Betfair has regular meetings with key organisations within 
British Racing, including the British Horseracing Authority, the 
Racecourse Association, the Horsemen’s Group and Horserace 
Betting Levy Board. The deal ensures Betfair is fully integrated 
in supporting British Racing on key issues to help ensure the 
sport is as attractive a betting product as possible and can 
maintain its share of the betting market.
The deal has the full support of the British Government.
‘ The five-year commercial deal agreed between 
British Racing and Betfair was a move welcomed by 
the Government… there is a common interest between 
racing and the betting industry to make sure the sport 
has a healthy future and we want to see further such 
deals in place.’

Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 31 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 31 3. ENSURING OUR PEOPLE ARE INSPIRED, 
ENGAGED AND DEVELOPED 
Communicating with employees
We employ 1,800 employees globally, with major sites in the UK, 
Ireland, Malta, Gibraltar, Romania, Portugal and the US. We 
embrace cultural diversity across the organisation; we value and 
respect local practices across all of our locations whilst maintaining 
a consistent company culture which aligns us all to our core values 
and our relentless appetite to attract, grow, develop, retain and 
reward our key talent. 
Performance management, reward and engagement
We have continued to drive reward being based on a meritocratic 
basis for FY14. Bonuses are an incentive to drive high performance 
and business delivery within Betfair. During FY14, we launched a 
new approach to performance management measuring individual 
performance every 90 days, providing greater alignment to our 
business performance which is also measured on a quarterly basis 
and increased transparency for individuals in terms of progress 
against objectives, achievement and priorities going forward. 
We also value non-financial incentives; we care what our employees 
think and ask them for their opinion through engagement surveys. 
As advocates of enhanced performance through employee 
engagement we believe that there are a number of factors which 
drive higher engagement and performance, which in turn makes 
the organisation more effective. One of these factors is that 
people want to see meaning in their work, not only in terms 
of how they fit into the organisation but also in terms of the 
organisation’s wider purpose and our corporate social 
responsibility agenda. 
Employee welfare
We have adopted a number of policies relating to CR on aspects 
of people management. 
We are focused on ensuring our HR policies and practices have 
a clear ethical component and are effectively and fairly applied, 
and that Betfair is an employer of choice for our existing and 
potential employees. 
We offer a variety of employee benefits to enhance the wellbeing 
of our employees, which include a core package incorporating 
private medical insurance, life assurance, income protection and 
critical illness insurance and a voluntary benefits package offering 
a choice of benefits including health assessments, a health cash 
plan, dental insurance and discounted gym membership.
We operate a Save-As-You-Earn (‘SAYE’) share option scheme, 
which encourages employees’ participation in Betfair’s performance 
and alignment with shareholder values. An offer was made to 
employees during FY14 and further details of this are included in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 55 and in note 20 
to the Financial Statements.
During the year, regulations came into force requiring employers 
to automatically enrol certain employees (based on certain income 
and age levels) into a workplace pension scheme with contributions 
that meet new standards. At Betfair, we believe that all UK 
employees should be eligible to receive an employer pension 
contribution and save for their retirement, so our policy is to 
enrol all UK employees into the Betfair Group Pension scheme 
irrespective of their earnings or age. 
Human rights
Betfair is committed to the human rights of all its employees and 
the communities in which we operate. Our operations are entirely 
in developed countries and we comply fully with all appropriate 
legislation in these countries. The Board does not consider that it is 
necessary to develop a specific policy in relation to human rights. 
Equal opportunities
While our industry continues to be male dominated, this year has 
seen two women being appointed to the Executive Committee. 
We continue to work hard to attract and retain a diverse, inclusive 
and representative workforce where everyone is treated with 
dignity and respect. The following table is a breakdown by 
gender of our Board, senior managers and all employees as

 Senior managers as defined in legislation includes persons responsible  
for planning, directing or controlling the activities of the Company (or a 
strategically significant part of the Company) and any other Directors of 
undertakings included in the consolidated accounts. However, the Board 
considers that this definition does not reflect the way that Betfair operates, 
and so has also presented a more appropriate measure, comprising the 
members of the Executive Committee (excluding Executive Directors). 
32 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Health and safety
Alongside our commitment to providing a vibrant working 
environment that values wellbeing and diversity, we recognise our 
wider legal and moral obligation to provide a safe and healthy 
working environment for our people, visitors and members of the 
public who may be affected by our activities. This commitment 
underpins our approach to health and safety (H&S), with Board 
level responsibility being apportioned to the Director of Operations, 
supported by specialist technical advisers in safety and 
occupational health, employed across all our global locations.
Our operations are fully compliant with all aspects of the current 
H&S law, codes of practice and approved industry standards. 
Our H&S policy statement, management system, practices and 
procedures reflect Betfair’s commitment to managing health, 
safety and welfare across our international portfolio through 
selected senior representatives and H&S professionals who form 
the National Health and Safety Forum. In addition, all of our 
facilities managers have Institution of Occupational Safety and 
Health (IOSH) accreditation and two employees are accredited 
at National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health 
(NEBOSH) level.
Betfair provides an occupational health helpline through the 
Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), providing independent 
and confidential support for all employees. EAP is an expert 
provider of employee support services and is completely 
independent from the Company. The EAP is designed to help 
employees in times of need, whether due to stress, anxiety, 
managing money, relationships or work. 
We regularly review and audit the quality and effectiveness of 
our risk assessment and incident investigation processes and the 
completeness of our H&S management system. In addition we 
continue to develop our procedures for measuring and supporting 
a proactive approach to meeting our commitments to the safety 
and wellbeing of all our people, clients and suppliers.
Health and safety activity
During FY14, priority was focused on fully implementing the 
revised H&S management system at Betfair. In doing so Betfair 
carried out the following actions:
• H&S management system implemented at all European 
locations;
• roles and responsibilities updated and formal appointments 
made at all levels;
• practices and procedures, including all risk assessment activities, 
carried out in line with current legislation and good practice;
• chaired by the Executive representative, regular meetings of 
the National H&S Forum; and
• H&S training provided to all relevant people.
It is a statutory requirement to keep a record of all accidents, 
incidents and near misses that occur at work. Our H&S record 
in FY14 was good. There were no RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, 
Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013) reportable 
fatalities or major injuries across our business. A health, safety and 
environment inspection visit in the UK resulted in no enforcement 
notices or prosecutions for health, safety or environmental offences.
4. TAKING PRIDE IN THE COMMUNITIES  
WHERE WE LIVE AND WORK
Engagement with local communities and charities
Betfair believes in being a good corporate citizen. We seek to 
support and be part of the local community wherever we have 
an office. We also support community working offering every 
employee up to two days’ paid leave per year for volunteer work 
and we offer employees the opportunity to make charitable 
donations direct from their salary through payroll. 
As part of this commitment each of our offices around the 
world makes a CR investment with employees actively engaged 
in deciding what organisations and charities Betfair should support 
at each location. 
Case studies:
• Maggie’s Cancer Care Centre is located at Charing Cross 
Hospital only a few hundred metres from Betfair’s 
Hammersmith HQ. It offers emotional, practical and social 
support for those suffering from cancer and relies entirely on 
donations. In FY14 Betfair made a financial donation and a 
group of employees also volunteered to help tidy up the 
grounds and keep the centre looking its best.
• Square Chapel Trust, a thriving arts centre for the local 
community, is supported by Betfair’s Halifax office which 
continued to be a ‘Corporate Friend’.
• Inspire Foundation provides a range of services to people with 
disabilities, championing their equal inclusion in society. Betfair’s 
office in Malta supported Inspire with a financial donation and 
by providing staff volunteers to assist with cleaning up the 
Foundation’s Animal Park following an incident of vandalism. 
• Christmas Shoebox Appeal is one of the charities that

Supporting grassroots sport: Cash4Clubs
Sport in its numerous different forms is an exciting part of so 
many of our lives and an important leisure pastime for individuals 
and communities. Recognising the importance of sport, we set up 
Cash4Clubs in 2008 in partnership with SportsAid to offer sports 
clubs in the UK the chance to be awarded grants ranging from 
£250 to £1,000. To date in the UK we have supported 327 clubs 
with grants totalling over £261,000. Cash4Clubs continues to 
have a real impact on local communities.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT CONTINUED
Betfair’s procurement process ensures that 
our environmental responsibility is a key 
factor in any purchasing decisions, including:
• consideration of location of manufacture;
• giving preference to items that are manufactured with a high 
recycled content;
• considering the ‘whole life’ costs and energy usage when 
assessing equipment for purchase; and
• carrying out environmental assessment of suppliers, and 
favouring suppliers that are committed to environmental 
improvement.
Betfair is committed to transferring  
its operations to more energy efficient  
data centres. In addition:
• a data centre management tool is used to track power  
usage and improve planning for the efficient utilisation  
of the data centre facility; 
• an ongoing program of consolidation, including cloud 
computing solutions, enabling us to switch off older 
inefficient equipment across the whole estate;
• complying with WRAP UK guidelines when carrying out all fit 
out, dilapidation and construction works and ensuring our 
contractors work to these same standards; and
• re-using all redundant furniture through resale, charity 
or school donation, or disposing of it responsibly.
Betfair aims for 100% waste recycling,  
with no waste going to landfill, including:
• all offices, as a minimum, separate waste at source; 
• mixed waste is sorted and recycled, wet waste is composted, 
glass is sorted and recycled, and cooking oil is collected and 
recycled, where internal catering facilities are provided;
• we currently recycle 100% of our waste from our largest 
office and HQ in London; and 
• multi-functional secure network printing devices at all 
locations, reducing paper waste.
We continue to review our energy use,  
and implement new ways to manage our 
consumption, including:
• data collection of environmental indices across all  
Betfair offices;
• ‘one switch’ desktop power modules as standard, to  
switch off all power to their desk from a single switch; 
• air conditioning settings programmed geographically  
to match our working patterns; 
• capital improvement projects including equipment qualifying 
for enhanced capital allowances in line with the Carbon 
Trust’s energy technology; 
• retiring end of serviceable life equipment allowing for  
the purchase of modern efficient replacements; and
• recycling surplus equipment and furniture through sale  
and reuse.
ENERGY KPIs
Betfair is committed to continuous 
improvement in reducing our carbon

TRANSPORT AND TRAVEL KPIs CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT KPIs
WASTE KPIs
34 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Environmental matters
Betfair has reviewed and updated our environmental policy to 
include new mandatory reporting requirements and to renew our 
commitment to considering the environment when conducting 
our business.
As a minimum, Betfair meets or exceeds all relevant environmental 
legislation. Where no environmental legislation exists, we will 
develop and implement our own appropriate standards, practices 
and procedures. Across all business units, we take all reasonable 
steps to manage our operations, so as to minimise our environmental 
impact and to deliver excellence in environmental practice across 
our business.
Respect for the environment is fundamental to assuring a 
sustainable future. Betfair recognises that, by managing our day  
to day activities efficiently, we can have a positive impact on the 
environment. We aim to minimise harmful effects whenever we 
can, and will work through a continuous improvement process to 
achieve this.
Betfair assesses its environmental impact as very low. The 
business is 100% online with no retail premises and its key servers 
are housed within modern, state of the art data centre facilities. 
As a result of our data centre consolidation programme, Betfair 
has this year decommissioned three large office communications 
rooms, serving development and corporate systems, which 
resulted in retiring a number of legacy operations. 
We operate in modern office environments, which have been 
designed to have minimal impact on the environment. All our 
office spaces operate with high densities of occupation in the 
workplace and have features such as perimeter infrared motion 
detector lighting, low energy lighting, energy efficient air 
conditioning systems and power factor correction. Following the 
2013 restructure, Betfair has continued its office consolidation 
programme and has closed c.61,000 sq. ft. (20%) of office space 
during the past 12 months. Plans for further reduction in the 
coming financial year are already under way.
We operate largely out of leased premises. Accordingly, we work 
with our landlords to encourage their investment in energy efficient 
systems, waste recycling and water consumption. 
Stakeholders
As a matter of course, we gauge stakeholder views on 
environmental matters and these views are reported to the CR 
Committee. This process enables us to increase our responsiveness 
to matters raised by stakeholders, find new ways to reduce our 
impacts and maximise opportunities, balance business efficiency 
with economic success and, ultimately, continue to make the 
business more competitive, profitable and sustainable. The 
environmental management forum is chaired by the Group 
Operations Director, being a member of the CR Committee.
Betfair’s greenhouse gas emissions
The mandatory requirement to report our greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions has supported a greater emphasis on data collection, 
interrogation and comparatives across all offices, helping to further 
develop best practice across the business.
We have reported on all of the GHG emission sources required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013. We have adopted an Operational 
Control approach to define our organisational boundary for the 
reporting of emissions data. The reported figures therefore exclude 
our joint venture, Betfair Australia, as this is activity not subject to 
operational control by the Group. Our reporting year is the same 
as our financial year, being 1 May 2013 to 30 April 2014.
Our emissions data is reported through a system which meets 
industry standards for data collection. The methodology used 
is based on voluntary and mandatory GHG reporting guidance 
issued by Defra. We have also utilised Defra’s 2013 conversion 
factors within our reporting methodology.
We have used revenue as our intensity ratio as this provides the 
best comparative measure over time and is the most relevant 
indication of our growth. 
Betfair’s total emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 reporting were 
7,494 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO
2e) for the period. 
The majority of our emissions are stated within Scope 2, including 
utilities consumption for leased premises and/or proportional 
landlord charges, and contract operations for data centres.

Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions including own fuel combustion and refrigerant losses

Refrigerant losses are excluded for landlord systems and data centre services provided to Betfair under lease and service provision.

Includes electricity, gas and heating purchased by direct use or proportional charge by landlord. Emissions calculated using UK Government and international GHG 
conversion factors. Our facility in New Jersey has been included by assessment, due to the required information not being available from the serviced office lease provider.

GOVERNANCE
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION  
TO GOVERNANCE
Chairman’s introduction
We believe that a robust corporate governance structure helps us 
to continue to maintain Betfair’s reputation and relationships, and 
to deliver sustainable value.
I am pleased to introduce our Corporate Governance Report 
which incorporates reports from the Chairmen of each of our 
Board committees. These reports explain our governance policies 
and procedures in detail and describe how we have applied the 
principles of corporate governance contained in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code), which was enhanced in 2012; the 
changes apply to Betfair for the first time this year. 
New regulations also came into force this year around the disclosure 
and approval of Directors’ remuneration. There had already been 
a significant amount of work carried out by the Remuneration 
Committee in 2013 to develop a remuneration policy that aligns 
reward with delivery of shareholder value, and in this year, 
considerable time and effort has been taken to ensure that 
the Remuneration Report provides the disclosure required. 
As already mentioned in the Chairman’s Statement on page 4, 
there have been some changes to the membership of the Board. 
We have appointed three new independent Non-Executive 
Directors, who bring with them significant commercial and 
financial expertise and are well placed to support the Executive 
Team in implementing Betfair’s strategy. We have also refreshed 
the membership of our committees. We continue to review the 
composition of the Board to ensure that it has the skills and 
balance required for the proper stewardship of the business. 
As well as ensuring that the mix of skills, experience and expertise 
on the Board is appropriate, we are committed to the need to 
remain effective as a Board. As most of the Directors on the 
Board were newly appointed during 2013-2014, we decided to 
carry out an internal Board evaluation process this year and will 
carry out an external review in 2014-2015. A description of this 
year’s process is set out in this report. All Directors will be 
submitted for re-election (or, in the case of the newly appointed 
Directors, election) by the shareholders at our AGM.
The AGM provides a useful interface with private shareholders, 
many of whom are also customers. All Directors will be in 
attendance at our AGM on 4 September 2014, and we hope  
to see many of our shareholders there.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 37 Statement of compliance
The Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) issued a revised version 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) in September 
2012, which is available on www.frc.org.uk. The Board has 
reviewed its governance arrangements against the revised Code, 
and considers that the Group complied with the main principles  
of the Code for the whole of the year ended 30 April 2014. 
In addition, the Company complied with the main principles of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010, as required by the 
Listing Rules 9.8.6. More detail is provided throughout this 
statement which incorporates the Directors’ Report, Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Remuneration Report by reference.
Provision B.6.2 of the Code requires the evaluation of the board 
of FTSE 350 companies to be externally facilitated every three 
years. Due to the changes in the Board this year, the Board 
decided to delay this external review until FY15. An internal 
evaluation of Board effectiveness was completed instead. 
The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the strategic direction, development 
and control of the Group. It sets strategic aims and approves 
strategic plans and annual budgets, ensuring that the necessary 
financial and human resources are in place for the Group to meet 
its objectives. It reviews significant investment proposals and the 
performance of past investments.
It maintains an overview of the Group’s operating and financial 
performance and monitors the Group’s overall system of internal 
controls, governance and compliance. 
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters 
which are reserved for its decision. This is published 
on the Group’s corporate website at:  
corporate.betfair.com/about-us/governance/committees.aspx, 
and includes:
• determining the overall business and commercial strategy;
• identifying long-term objectives;
• determining the Group’s risk appetite;
• reviewing the annual operating plan and budget;
• considering all matters relating to major Group policy and 
regulatory policy;
• determining the basis of allocation of capital; 
• approving the appointment and removal of any Board member 
and the Company Secretary; 
• undertaking an annual review of Board, Committee and 
individual Director’s performance; and
• reviewing and approving the terms of reference for Board 
Committees and receiving reports on their activities.
Authority is delegated by the Board in certain circumstances including 
the approval of delegated authorities for the Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and other senior management 
to approve expenditure, investments and other matters as the Board 
may determine, and in granting powers of attorney.
Division of responsibilities
In accordance with main principle A.2 of the Code, there is a clear 
division of responsibilities at the head of the Group between the 
Board and executive responsibility for the running of the Group’s 
business. No one individual has unfettered powers of decision.
The roles of the Chairman, CEO and Non-Executive Directors 
have been defined in writing. 
Role of the Chairman
In accordance with main principle A.3 of the Code, Gerald Corbett 
as Chairman is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of 
the Board, including ensuring that the Board is run smoothly and 
that appropriate communication is maintained with shareholders. 
He is available to meet with shareholders at the AGM.
The Chairman ensures that the Board has the right composition 
and that the debate is effective and at the right level, involving all 
members, and that appropriate conclusions are drawn. For Betfair, 
it is vital that the Chairman is accessible and can play an important 
role in providing support and wise counsel to the CEO and wider 
management team. The Chairman effectively challenges when 
required and takes a ‘helicopter view’ of the business. The 
Chairman has a key role in instilling behaviours appropriate to  
a publicly listed company environment and is able to maintain 
relationships with shareholders and other stakeholders, as 
necessary. The Chairman has a proven track record as a plc 
Chairman and currently acts as Chairman to two other publicly 
quoted companies. Gerald Corbett’s biography can be found  
on page 37.
Role of the CEO
Breon Corcoran as CEO has responsibility for implementing the 
strategy agreed by the Board and for the executive management 
of the Group. This includes responsibility for: 
• developing and proposing the Group strategy, annual plans 
and commercial objectives to the Board, having regard to the 
Group’s responsibilities to its shareholders, customers, 
employees and other stakeholders; 
• managing the Group’s risk profile in line with the extent of risk 
identified as acceptable by the Board and to ensure appropriate 
internal controls are in place; 
• ensuring the development needs of the Executive Directors 
and senior management are identified and met and ensuring 
succession planning; 
• effective communication with shareholders; and 
• appropriate, timely and accurate disclosure of information to the 
market, with issues escalated promptly to the Market Disclosure 
Committee. 
Role of the Senior Independent Director
Ian Dyson was appointed as Senior Independent Director on  
1 April 2014, replacing Mike McTighe who retired from the Board 
on 31 March 2014. Ian is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns which are not resolved through the normal channels of 
Chairman, CEO or CFO. He meets with the other Non-Executive 
Directors without Executive Directors present and leads the annual 
evaluation of the Chairman’s performance. In addition, Ian is 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. Ian’s biography can be found 
on page 37.
Non-Executive Directors
The Company has five Non-Executive Directors on its Board,  
all of whom are considered to be independent in character and 
judgement and are free from any business or other relationship 
which could materially influence their judgement. Other than their 
fees, which are disclosed on page 60, the Non-Executive Directors 
received no additional remuneration from the Group during the 
year. The Non-Executive Directors are a strong source of advice 
and independent challenge. 
Josh Hannah, who retired from the Board on 17 January 2014, 
was not deemed to be independent under the provisions of 
the Code as he had served as a director for over ten years. 
Mike McTighe and Fru Hazlitt were considered independent at 
the date of their retirement from the Board on 31 March 2014. 
All of the Directors’ biographies can be found on page 37 and all 
will stand for re-election or election in accordance with the Code.

Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 39 Appointments to the Board
To ensure a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for 
the appointment of new Directors to the Board, a Nomination 
Committee has been established, comprising independent 
Non-Executive Directors and chaired by the Chairman. 
Information on the work of the Nomination committee is 
described on page 42.
Appointments are made on merit and measured against objective 
criteria and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the 
board. When prospective Non-Executive Directors are considered 
for appointment, the Nomination Committee will take into account 
their other responsibilities in assessing whether they can commit 
sufficient time to their prospective directorship. 
All Directors are briefed by the use of comprehensive papers 
circulated in advance of Board meetings and by presentations at 
the meetings in addition to receiving minutes of previous meetings. 
Their understanding of the Group’s business is enhanced by 
business specific presentations and operational visits to the Group’s 
businesses. Separate strategy meetings and meetings with senior 
executives are also held throughout the year. Where a Director is 
unable to attend a meeting, they are provided with all the papers 
and information relating to that meeting and were able to discuss 
issues arising directly with the Chairman and CEO. There are nine 
Board meetings and a two day off-site meeting currently scheduled 
for the financial year ending 30 April 2015.
Service contracts and letters of appointment
Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are set out 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 57. The Chairman 
and the Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment 
which are available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during normal business hours and at the place of  
the AGM from at least 15 minutes before and until the end  
of the meeting.
Independent advice
Members of the Board may take independent professional advice 
in the furtherance of their duties and they have access to the 
advice and services of the Chief Legal Officer and Company 
Secretary, the Group’s legal advisers and external auditor.
Training and development
In accordance with main principle B.4 of the Code, there is a 
comprehensive induction for newly appointed Directors and 
regular updates, tailored to individual requirements and including 
guidance on requirements of, and Directors’ duties in connection 
with, the Code and the Companies Act 2006 as well as other 
relevant legislation. The Board as a whole is updated as necessary 
in light of any governance developments as and when they occur. 
The training needs of Directors and of members of the Board’s 
Committees are formally considered on an annual basis.
Conflicts of interest 
Executive Directors may be permitted to accept one external 
Non-Executive Director appointment with the Company’s prior 
approval as long as this is not likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
The Board has a formal system in place for Directors to declare 
situational conflicts to be considered for authorisation by those 
Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered. 
The Board believes that the systems it has in place for reporting 
and considering conflicts continue to operate effectively.
Once appointed, all Directors are required to submit themselves 
for re-election on an annual basis at the Company’s AGM, in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and 
provision B.7.1 of the Code. Zillah Byng-Maddick, Leo Quinn 
and Peter Rigby will stand for election at the 2014 AGM. 
Further information is set out in the Notice of Meeting.

40 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Shareholder relations
The Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders for 
the performance and activities of the Group. The Group formally 
updates the market on its financial performance at least four times 
a year, at the half year and full year results in December and June 
respectively and in the interim management statements in March 
and September. The content of these updates is posted and 
webcast on the Group’s website, together with general information 
about the Group so as to be available to all shareholders. The 
Group has a regular programme of meetings with its major 
institutional shareholders which provides an opportunity to discuss, 
on the back of publicly available information, the progress of the 
business. The Head of Investor Relations regularly reports to the 
Board the views of major shareholders in respect of the Group, and 
the Senior Independent Director and other Non-Executive Directors 
are available to meet shareholders on request and are offered the 
opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders.
All proxy votes received in respect of each resolution at the  
AGM are counted and the balance for and against, and any votes 
withheld, are indicated. At the meeting itself, voting on all the 
proposed resolutions is conducted on a poll rather than a show 
of hands, in line with recommended best practice. The Chairmen 
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees attend 
to answer questions.
Board effectiveness evaluation
The Code requires an externally facilitated evaluation of the Board 
every three years. The external evaluation was due this year, but 
the Board decided to delay this until 2014/2015 following the 
various changes in Board composition. 
Instead, a formal internal evaluation of the Board, Committees and 
individual Directors has taken place during the year. The process 
included the completion of a detailed questionnaire by each of the 
Board Directors, covering the Board’s role in strategic leadership, 
key Board relationships, Board composition and succession planning, 
quality of debate and decision making, Board support and 
information flows, Board Committees, risk management, relations 
with shareholders and other stakeholders, and the Board’s priority 
tasks. In addition, an assessment of the Chairman’s performance 
was carried out, led by the Senior Independent Director. The 
results were reviewed by the Chairman and the principal findings 
were fed back to the Board in May 2014. The recommendations 
arising will be discussed and addressed by the Board during 
2014/2015. 
Committees

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 41 Role of the Committee
The Nomination Committee is responsible for identifying and 
nominating, for the approval of the Board, candidates for 
appointment to the Board. The Committee has written terms  
of reference which are available on the Company’s website.
Activities during the year
The Committee met three times during the year. Matters 
considered by the Committee included:
• anticipating Josh Hannah’s retirement from the Board and 
implementing a search to identify an independent candidate 
with appropriate financial experience, resulting in the 
appointment of Zillah Byng-Maddick as an independent 
Non-Executive Director; 
• considering the composition and balance of the Board and 
implementing a search to identify independent candidates with 
relevant commercial experience, resulting in the appointment 
of Leo Quinn and Peter Rigby as independent Non-Executive 
Directors; and
• making recommendations to the Board for changes to 
Committee chairmanship and membership following the 
departure of Fru Hazlitt and Mike McTighe from the Board, 
taking into account the relevant skills and experience of each 
of the Non-Executive Directors.
Policy on appointments to the Board
All appointments are made on merit and measured against 
objective criteria and with due regard for the benefits of diversity 
on the board. The Board is committed to ensuring a broad mix  
of gender, age, nationality, experience and skills throughout the 
business and that the composition of the Board itself is based on 
a range and balance of skills, knowledge, experience and merit 
and remains appropriate for a business of this size. The Board has 
noted the contents of the Davies Report on Women on Boards 
in February 2011 and Code revision to strengthen the principle of 
board diversity. The Board does not believe that setting a target 
for the number of women on our Board is appropriate as all our 
appointments are made on merit. 
The process of identifying candidates for Board appointment  
is led by the Committee. Comprehensive candidate search briefs 
are agreed. An external executive search firm is engaged and  
a shortlist of candidates is drawn up. A number of shortlisted 
candidates are invited for meetings with Committee members  
as appropriate. After these meetings, a review of the candidates 
takes place and the preferred candidates are recommended for 
appointment to the Board. 
During the year, The Zygos Partnership (which has no other 
connection with the Company) managed the search process for  
all three of the Non-Executive Director appointments. 
Action plan
In the coming financial year, the Committee’s activities will include:
• continuing to support the development of the Executive Team;
• considering the effectiveness of the Non-Executive Directors 
seeking re-election at the 2014 AGM, taking into account 
the outcome of the internal board evaluation; and
• continuing to ensure that we plan for the evolution of the 
Non-Executive Directors to maintain the appropriate mix  
of skills.
Close
We have conducted a thorough and transparent appointment 
process for the recommendation of three new Directors

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONTINUED
During the year, the main activities that the Committee considered 
were as follows:
• review of the integrity of the financial statements and 
recommendation of interim and full year financial results to  
the Board;
• the scope and cost of the external audit;
• non-audit work carried out by the external auditor and trends in 
the non-audit fees in accordance with the Committee’s policy to 
ensure the safeguarding of auditor independence; 
• periodic internal control and assurance reports from Group 
Internal Audit & Risk Management;
• the effectiveness of the external auditor and consideration  
of its reappointment;
• compliance with the Code of Conduct and whistleblowing 
procedures and the effectiveness of these procedures;
• the effectiveness of Group Internal Audit & Risk Management, 
the scope of the annual internal audit plan, internal audit reports 
of significance, its resourcing and external support;
• management representations provided to the external auditor 
and the Company’s procedures to ensure all relevant audit 
information has been disclosed;
• the co-ordination of the internal and external audit functions;
• the Group’s framework for the identification, assessment, 
monitoring and management/mitigation plans for major risks, 
and the annual assessment of the effectiveness of access  
to significant systems, authorisation controls and other  
internal controls;
• corporate governance developments;
• review of the suitability of the Group’s accounting policies  
and practices and significant matters of judgement;
• the status of material litigation involving the Group; 
• the Committee’s own terms of reference and membership; and
• in-depth reviews of strategy, security, IT disaster recovery, 
technology risks, customers’ account security, tax, insurance, 
treasury, anti-money laundering, compliance, related party 
transactions and financial authorisation controls.
Financial statements
The primary role of the Audit Committee in relation to financial 
reporting is to review and monitor the integrity of financial 
statements and other trading statements.
The Committee assessed whether suitable accounting policies had 
been adopted and whether management had made appropriate 
estimates and judgements. The Committee reviewed accounting 
papers prepared by management in respect of the main financial 
reporting judgements, the clarity of disclosures and compliance 
with financial reporting standards and governance. After discussion 
with both management and the external auditor, the Audit 
Committee determined that the key risks of misstatement of the 
Group’s financial statements related to revenue recognition which 
is dependent on data integrity and IT security to ensure correct 
calculation of commission revenues and appropriate wins and 
losses, the management and safeguarding of client funds and 
online gambling regulation, licensing and tax.
The Committee also reviewed reports by the external auditor  
on the full year and half year results.
The primary issues of risk and accounting judgement considered 
by the Committee during the year were as follows:
• Data integrity and IT security
These are key to the effective operation of the business and 
integral to recognising revenue appropriately. Technology and 
Security management and personnel report regularly on the risks 
and controls around security and IT operations to the Corporate 
Risk Committee and Audit Committee throughout the year. 
The external auditor IT specialists reviewed the effectiveness of 
controls during the audit. The Audit Committee has challenged 
both management and the external auditor and based on the 
above is satisfied with the current level of risk and internal control.
• Management and safeguarding of client funds 
The Group holds a significant balance of client funds off balance 
sheet, mainly in ring-fenced accounts under a Trust Deed. 
£269.0m was held at 30 April 2014 (£284.1m at 30 April 2013), 
as disclosed in note 16 to the financial statements. The 
appropriate recognition of revenue is dependent on client funds 
and core finance processes and controls accurately reporting on 
and reconciling the transactions from the IT systems. Daily and 
monthly reconciliations of these funds are performed to reduce 
the risk of misstatement and to detect fraud. The external 
auditor and Group Internal Audit & Risk Management have 
reviewed controls around the client funds and reported to the 
Audit Committee during the year without any significant issues 
being raised. The Audit Committee has challenged both 
management and the external auditor and based on the above 
is satisfied with the current level of internal control.
• Online gambling regulation, licensing and tax
The strategy is designed to achieve sustainable revenues from 
regulated jurisdictions, however there is judgement around the 
interpretation of international tax laws and how they interact 
within each jurisdiction and this may have a significant impact 
on the financial statements. Presentations by senior members 
of the Compliance, Anti-Money Laundering and Tax teams 
have been made to the Audit Committee demonstrating how 
we manage these areas. The Chief Executive Officer reports 
monthly to the Board on significant matters (e.g: New Jersey 
and Italian licences plus UK Point of Consumption tax). 
The Audit Committee is satisfied with the level of risk and 
internal control. 
The Group’s financial statements are reviewed by the Committee 
in advance of their consideration by the Board.
Management confirmed to the Committee that they were not 
aware of any material misstatements made intentionally to achieve 
a particular presentation. The auditor reported to the Committee 
the misstatements that it had found in the course of its work and 
no material amounts remained unadjusted. The Committee 
confirms that it is satisfied that the auditor has fulfilled its 
responsibilities with diligence and professional scepticism.
After reviewing the presentations and reporting from management 
and consulting where necessary with the auditor, the Audit 
Committee is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately 
address the critical judgements and key estimates (both in respect 
to the amounts reported and the disclosures).
On the basis of the above the Committee consider that the  
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced  
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
44 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 External auditor’s independence, performance  
and reappointment
The Committee has primary responsibility for making 
recommendations on the appointment, reappointment 
and removal of the external auditor.
The Committee took the following into account in assessing 
the performance of KPMG.
The Committee reviewed and challenged KPMG’s proposed 
audit plan prior to the commencement of the audit, including the 
approach, methodology, materiality, assessment of risk and key 
areas of judgement and fees. KPMG presented their report to  
the Committee at the conclusion of the year end audit. KPMG’s 
independent report to shareholders is on pages 73 and 74.
The Committee reviews the performance of the external auditor 
each year during the planning process and after the conclusion 
of the interim and annual audit reviews. A qualitative assessment 
has been undertaken of the services provided, both audit and 
non-audit, against the agreed audit plan/scope of service taking  
into account feedback from management. This included consideration 
of the timeliness, content and quality of presentations to the 
Committee, competence with respect to issues of risk and 
accounting judgement and their qualifications and experience.  
The Committee is satisfied that the external audit process has 
operated effectively and is fully satisfied with KPMG’s performance.
KPMG Audit Plc has been Betfair’s auditor since 2003.  
The external auditor is required to rotate the lead partner  
every five years and other partners that are responsible for the 
group and subsidiary audits must change at least every seven 
years. Such changes are carefully planned to ensure business 
continuity without undue risk or inefficiency. The partner 
responsible for Betfair’s audit is completing his second year  
within the group audit team and his second year as lead partner 
which is a role he can continue for a further three years.
The transitional rules under the EU legislation will require an 
initial change of audit firm no later than for the 30 April 2023 
year end audit.
The Competition Commission had previously proposed mandatory 
audit tenders at least every ten years with different transitional 
rules, but has now announced a delay in its implementation 
programme. There is therefore uncertainty as to whether Betfair 
will be required to go to tender prior to 2023.
Until this uncertainty is resolved, the Committee will continue to 
consider annually the need to go to tender for audit quality or 
independence reasons.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Committee’s 
choice of external auditor.
The Committee is satisfied that there are no relationships between 
the Company and the auditor, its employees or its affiliates that 
may reasonably be thought to impair the auditor’s objectivity  
and independence. 
Private meetings were held with KPMG to ensure there were no 
restrictions on the scope of their audit and to provide an opportunity 
to discuss any items that the auditor did not wish to raise with the 
Executive Directors present. The Committee reviews and agrees 
the engagement letter from KPMG and verifies its independence 
and objectivity. It also reviewed the scope of non-audit services 
provided by KPMG to ensure that its objectivity was not impaired.
Non-audit services
The Committee has adopted a policy on the use of the external 
auditor for non-audit work which is in compliance with the Code. 
The external auditor may carry out certain specified non-audit 
work, in areas that have been pre-approved by the Committee. 
Any other work for which management wishes to utilise the 
external auditor must be approved. The pre-approved services 
include the following:
• audit related services, including work related to the annual 
Group financial statements audit, subsidiary audits and local 
statutory accounts; and 
• for certain specified tax services, including tax compliance, tax 
planning and tax advice.
The external auditor is precluded from engaging in non-audit 
services that would compromise its independence, would violate 
any laws or regulations affecting its appointment as auditor or 
would lead a reasonable third party to regard the objectives of the 
proposed non-audit service as being inconsistent with the external 
audit. The policy defines the types of permitted and not permitted 
services. Except in exceptional circumstances relating to urgent 
transactions or services deemed not to be of a material nature, the 
engagement of the auditor for non-audit work must be approved 
in advance by the Committee Chairman where the fee is in excess 
of £50,000. Fees up to £50,000 must be approved by the  
Chief Financial Officer.
The Committee is satisfied that the level of fees payable in 
respect of audit services is appropriate for a group of its size 
and that an effective audit was conducted during the year. 
The fees for audit and non-audit services are disclosed in note 3 
to the financial statements.
The Committee through ongoing oversight of the external  
auditor as noted in the above factors recommends that KPMG’s 
re-election as external auditor be proposed at the Annual  
General Meeting.

UNDERSTANDING  
OUR MATERIAL RISKS
Internal controls and risk management process
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. In order 
to discharge that responsibility, the Board has established the 
procedures necessary to apply the Corporate Governance Code, 
including clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and 
delegated authority. These procedures, which are in accordance 
with revised Turnbull Guidance, have been in place since before 
the Group was listed and are regularly reviewed. The Board has 
delegated the detailed design of the systems of internal control 
and risk management to the Executive Directors and management.
The Group has in place internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and for the 
preparation of consolidated accounts. These systems include 
policies and procedures to:
• facilitate the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly 
reflect transactions;
• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  
as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) or UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,  
as appropriate; and
• require reported data to be reviewed and reconciled, with 
appropriate monitoring internally and by the Audit Committee.
Business performance is managed closely and the Board and  
the Executive Committee have established processes, as part  
of the normal good management of the business, to monitor:
• strategic plan achievement;
• financial performance within a comprehensive financial planning, 
accounting and reporting framework;
• capital investment and asset management performance, with 
detailed appraisal, authorisation and post-investment reviews;
• consumer insight data and actions to evolve brands and formats 
to ensure that they continue to be appealing and relevant; and
• risk management, through an ongoing process, including reports 
from the Group Internal Audit & Risk Management Team, to 
ensure that the significant risks faced by the Group are being 
identified, evaluated and appropriately managed, having regard 
to the balance of risk, cost and opportunity.
In addition, the Audit Committee receives:
• reports from the Corporate Risk Committee;
• reports from the Group Internal Audit & Risk Management 
Team on the work carried out under the annual internal audit 
plan; and
• reports from KPMG, the external auditor.
Through the monitoring processes set out above, the Board has 
conducted a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control during the year ended 30 April 2014. The system of internal 
control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk  
of failure to achieve business objectives and, as such, it can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. In that context, the review, in the opinion  
of the Board, did not indicate that the system was ineffective or 
unsatisfactory and the Board is not aware of any change to this 
status up to the approval of this Annual Report.
The Group has a long established process for analysing its key  
risks and adopts a proactive approach in this area, with ultimate 
ownership resting with respective Board and Executive Board 
members who manage the specific risks associated with their areas 
of responsibility supported by a dedicated Group Internal Audit & 
Risk Management Team.
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties may be found  
on pages 25 to 27.
Group Risk Management Framework
The Group Risk Management Framework is a well-established process

46 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Betfair has a comprehensive Group Risk Management Framework 
across the whole of the organisation, based on sound principles of 
good governance, to actively identify risks and mitigate them to 
the extent considered appropriate, balancing risk and opportunity 
to safeguard the business and its reputation. The framework 
provides the Directors and senior management with a consolidated 
view of the key risks faced by the business which is evaluated and 
updated regularly. The Directors believe the Group’s approach and 
capabilities will, over the long term, contribute to the achievement 
of the Group’s strategic objectives.
The Group Risk Management Framework comprises a number of 
sub-committees made up of senior Executives and relevant senior 
managers from across the Betfair Group, which deal with matters 
of policy and control and exercise oversight of the operational 
implementation of risk management, together with several 
operational functions. There are also established processes and 
procedures in place between Corporate Risk Committee meetings 
to deal with more urgent decisions and actions. This framework is 
overseen by the Corporate Risk Committee, which reports to the 
Audit Committee. 
The Group Internal Audit & Risk Management Team co-ordinates, 
structures and promotes the embedding of appropriate risk 
management practices across the business on an ongoing basis. 
A risk register is used by the business to document the risks 
across the whole organisation and how they are being managed. 
How we manage risk
Corporate Risk Committee
The Corporate Risk Committee comprises the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Legal Officer and  
the Director of Group Internal Audit & Risk Management.  
The Corporate Risk Committee is responsible for the review of 
significant business risk issues for Betfair, including but not limited 
to money laundering, fraud, integrity, operational and legal and 
regulatory issues. The Corporate Risk Committee makes 
recommendations to the Audit Committee and, as appropriate, 
to the Board as to the Betfair Group’s overall appetite for risk 
and its approach to managing and mitigating risk. It also reviews 
Betfair’s risk management and internal control frameworks to 
ensure consistent performance and recommends improvements 
as necessary. To ensure that the risk process drives improvement 
across the business, action plans for the principal risks and 
uncertainties are reviewed at each Committee meeting together 
with any recommendations to add emerging risks to/remove 
mitigated risks from these principal risks. The Committee 
continues to drive a better understanding of risk appetite, 
tolerance and management across the business to focus on 
achievement of the strategic objectives and sustainable long-term 
growth of the business. The Corporate Risk Committee meets 
quarterly and otherwise as required and reports matters of 
significance at the subsequent Audit Committee meeting.
Code of Conduct, Anti-Bribery and Whistle-blowing policies
All employees, including contractors, are required to comply with 
these policies. The Code of Conduct Policy sets the ethical and 
professional standards that are expected of all individuals, the 
Anti-Bribery Policy specifies how we comply with the UK Bribery 
Act 2010 and other relevant legislation and the Whistle-blowing 
Policy details how matters can be raised and dealt with in strict 
confidence. Any matters raised in accordance with these policies 
are investigated thoroughly and reports are provided at each 
meeting of the Corporate Risk Committee and Audit Committee, 
which monitors the effectiveness of these policies.
Group Internal Audit & Risk Management Team

UNDERSTANDING OUR MATERIAL RISKS CONTINUED
Business continuity planning
Through its comprehensive business continuity strategy, Betfair 
aims to be able to continue to service its customers irrespective  
of any incident or failure which may impact on any of Betfair’s key 
operating and technology locations. The key components of this 
strategy are physical site security, departmental continuity plans 
for all functions and an information technology disaster recovery 
plan. Betfair’s state of business continuity readiness is demonstrated 
by a Business Continuity Management System that is not only 
consistent with current industry standards and best practice, but is 
also aligned with the Business Continuity Institute’s (BCI’s) Good 
Practice Guidelines. Betfair recognises that the business continuity 
discipline is key for maintaining competitive advantage and is  
a significant contributor to effective corporate governance. 
Governance oversight is provided by the Business Continuity 
Steering Committee which meets quarterly. 
Information technology disaster recovery (DR) capability is a key  
part of the wider business continuity plan. The objective of the  
DR strategy is to ensure that response and recovery of Betfair’s 
technology infrastructure is in line with prioritised business needs 
and compliant with regulatory requirements. Betfair has pre-placed 
equipment in dedicated DR sites in Ireland to which key products, 
technology operations and back-end functionality can be moved over 
and remotely operated. While not in DR use, this equipment is used 
to performance and capacity test new software code before 
deployment to Betfair’s live environment.
Compliance Team
The Compliance Team provides advice and administrative assistance 
across the Betfair business in the development, licensing and 
launch of new products, and day to day product and process 
compliance with existing licences and Betfair regulatory policies. 
Together, Betfair’s compliance managers and compliance analysts 
maintain an ongoing dialogue with gambling regulators, technical 
testing bodies and relevant staff within the business to ensure that 
Betfair operates in accordance with the terms of its licences and 
relevant legislation.
This team is responsible for applying for, and obtaining, relevant 
gambling licences in jurisdictions which the business has identified 
as a suitable market to offer its products. The team co-ordinates 
and organises the collation and submission of the application and 
supporting documents and acts as adviser to the product and 
technology teams to ensure the new jurisdictional requirements 
are met.
Additional risk management policies and practices relating  
to customers
Betfair has a number of important policies which are embedded  
in its operations to protect both its customers and Betfair from 
certain risks often associated with remote gambling. In part,  
these policies also help Betfair to meet licensing and regulatory 
requirements and comply with applicable legislation. They also 
underpin some important capabilities of Betfair, in particular by 
facilitating the close and consistent co-operation of several of 
the risk management functions described in this section.
• KYC/customer due diligence: Betfair operates a sophisticated 
four-level customer due diligence process (referred to as Know 
Your Customer or KYC), which uses both automated and 
manual methods to verify a customer’s age, identity and source 
of funds. The KYC process also assesses the extent and quality 
of the customer’s verification information in determining 
whether to allow the customer to operate a Betfair betting 
account, either at all, or above certain levels of activity. Betfair’s 
KYC processes are integral to the anti-money laundering (AML), 
fraud and integrity policies and practices described below.
• Anti-customer fraud measures: Betfair has a 24/7 fraud team 
looking for suspicious activity. The team use a number of 
in-house and external applications, including the use of 
adaptive behavioural analytics tools, to protect Betfair and 
our customers. The team liaise with regulators, local law 
enforcement agencies and other operators to ensure we 
maintain a good understanding of current fraud trends. 
• Underage betting and gaming: All customers are required to 
confirm upon registration that they are over the legal age for 
gambling within each particular jurisdiction. As an essential and 
specific component of the customer due diligence policy referred 
to above, Betfair also carries out age verification checks on  
all customers who use payment mechanisms which may be 
available to under-18s, and performs age verification checks 
on selected customers. Betfair suspends all UK customers who 
fail to verify their age within 72 hours. Betfair advises and 
encourages its customers to prevent minors from accessing 
betting and gaming websites.
• Ring-fenced customer funds: Betfair holds all Core Betfair 
customer monies in separately managed bank accounts, which are 
safeguarded independently of Betfair’s corporate funds under the 
terms of a Trust Deed or, where required under the terms of any 
licence, such funds are held in a separate non set-off bank account 
in the name of the licence holder.
48 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Anti-Money Laundering Team
Betfair’s AML compliance policy encompasses a collection of 
procedures, technologies and techniques to:
• make a risk-based assessment of all financial transactions using 
Betfair payment, betting and gaming systems;
• establish and implement relevant record-keeping requirements 
across the business;
• report on an ongoing basis to the relevant statutory authorities 
any suspicious circumstances concerning financial transactions; and
• ensure regular staff training in Betfair’s AML procedures. 
A dedicated AML Team is responsible for assessing and 
implementing Betfair’s AML policy in accordance with the 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, European 
Directives and national legislation. The AML Team is also 
responsible for managing Betfair’s anti-bribery strategy in 
accordance with the requirements of the UK Bribery Act 2010.
Integrity Team and Rules and Regulations Committee
The Integrity Team is responsible for monitoring betting activity  
on Betfair’s sports betting products, investigating any potentially 
suspicious betting activity, and is the main point of liaison for 
sports regulatory bodies. Betfair has Memoranda of Understanding 
(MoUs) in place with 58 sports regulators, under which, in certain 
circumstances, Betfair shares relevant information about its 
customers with MoU partners to help in policing the betting 
integrity related rules which govern the participants of the relevant 
sport and/or the prevention and detection of crime. The sports 
governing body may then use the personal information shared 
by Betfair under the MoU to investigate and act on any such 
breaches in accordance with its own procedures. Betfair also offers 
its sporting MoU partners access to Betfair’s ‘BetMonitor’ tool, 
a proprietary technology portal which enables regulators to 
monitor betting activity by Betfair customers in real time. 
The Directors consider Betfair’s MoU framework and information 
sharing policy to be market leading and a key contributor to the 
trust with which Betfair is regarded by customers, sports and 
gambling regulators and governments.
Maintaining the integrity of Betfair’s betting markets is important 
to Betfair’s reputation for fairness amongst customers and sports 
bodies. To this end the MoU framework is complemented by  
a comprehensive and detailed set of betting rules which Betfair 
applies in the operation of its betting markets. Those rules, 
together with decisions about the operation and settlement of 
betting markets and practices relating to customers, are overseen 
by Betfair’s Rules and Regulations Committee, which reports as 
necessary to the Corporate Risk Committee.
Regulatory overview
Betfair operates in a heavily regulated sector where changes in 
regulation can have a significant impact on its operations. The 
regulation and legality of online betting and gaming varies from 
jurisdiction to jurisdiction (from open licensing regimes to sanctions 
or prohibitions) and in certain jurisdictions there is no directly 
applicable legislation. Besides the regulatory changes, online 
betting and gaming is subject to other uncertainties in many 
jurisdictions and approaches to enforcement of local laws vary. 
Bearing all these factors in mind, Betfair’s commercial and 
marketing strategy is designed to achieve sustainable revenue 
from regulated jurisdictions. The Group holds gambling licences 
in Malta, Gibraltar, USA, Australia, Italy, Spain, Denmark 
and Bulgaria. 
Betfair’s determination, as to whether or not to permit customers 
in a given jurisdiction to access any one or more of its products 
and whether to engage with customers, is made on the basis of its 
measured and prudent approach to legal and regulatory compliance, 
and is based on a number of factors which include:
• the terms of Betfair’s betting and gaming licences in 
individual jurisdictions;
• the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction including state, 
federal or supranational law including EU law if applicable, and 
in particular the way in which such laws and regulations apply  
to the specific betting and gaming products and specific types 
of related activity, including marketing; and
• the approach to the application or enforcement of such laws and 
regulations by regulatory and other authorities in the jurisdiction.
Insurance
With regard to insurance against risk, it is not practicable to insure 
against every risk to the fullest extent. The Group regularly 
reviews both the type and amount of external insurance that it 
buys with guidance from an external broker, bearing in mind the 
availability of such cover, its cost and the likelihood and magnitude 
of the risks involved.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT: 
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Leo Quinn, 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I welcome the opportunity to present 
the Remuneration Committee’s report on Directors’ remuneration 
for FY14, my first report following my appointment to chair the 
Remuneration Committee in April 2014. 
The new regulations governing the disclosure and approval 
of Directors’ remuneration require the Remuneration Report 
to be split into three parts: (i) this Annual Statement; (ii) the 
Remuneration Policy Report which will be subject to a binding 
shareholder resolution at the forthcoming AGM; and (iii) the 
Annual Report on Remuneration which will be put to an 
advisory shareholder resolution at the same AGM.
Remuneration principles
Betfair’s remuneration policy as detailed on pages 53 to 58 is 
based on the following principles, which are reviewed periodically 
to ensure they continue to remain appropriate and support the 
Company’s evolving strategy. The principles of our remuneration 
policy remain unchanged from previous years.
Betfair’s remuneration principles and primary objectives
MARKET COMPETITIVE 
LEVELS
• Designed to attract, retain and motivate Executives of the highest calibre by targeting fixed pay around 
market levels and providing the opportunity to earn above market remuneration through the performance-
related elements.
PAY FOR 
PERFORMANCE AND 
STRATEGIC LINK
• The remuneration package should be weighted heavily towards variable pay.
• The variable pay elements will be based on metrics which are consistent with delivering the Board’s  
strategic objectives. A clear link between reward and individual and corporate performance delivered  
should be established.
SHAREHOLDER 
ALIGNMENT
• The performance targets applying to the short and long-term incentives will be set so as to align the interests 
of Executives with those of shareholders.
• A significant proportion of reward should be share based with shareholding guidelines encouraging 
Executives to build and maintain significant shareholdings.
• The Committee will seek to reward sustained long-term performance.
HIGH LEVELS  
OF CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE 
AND ENGAGEMENT
• The Committee is regularly updated on corporate governance and institutional investor best practice 
developments, and takes account of this when setting remuneration policy.
• The Committee maintains an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders throughout the year.
50 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The Committee’s responsibilities
During the year, the Committee refreshed its terms of  
reference (which can be found on the Company’s website –  
corporate.betfair.com/about-us/governance/committees.aspx). 
The Committee’s principle responsibilities include:
• Determining the framework or broad policy for the 
remuneration of the Chairman, the Executive Directors, 
the CEO’s direct reports and the Company Secretary. 
• Setting, approving and reviewing the approach to the 
remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors and other 
senior executives, covering salary, bonus, pension, benefits and 
long-term incentive share awards. In determining the 
remuneration of senior executives the Committee takes into 
account remuneration trends across the Company.
• Setting appropriate and challenging performance-related criteria 
attached to the variable elements of remuneration and 
considering the long-term business strategy.
• Reviewing, recommending and approving the rules of any 
share-based incentive operated by the Company.
Performance outcome for FY14
For Executive Directors, the FY14 Annual Bonus was based on 
financial metrics (160% of salary in total) and personal objectives 
(20% of salary). The financial metrics were Group Revenue and 
EBITDA, weighted 60% in favour of Revenue and 40% towards 
EBITDA. The Company performed well against its financial targets 
and a description of the Company’s performance is included in the 
Financial Review on pages 21 to 24. 
Against the target set at the start of the year, both Revenue and 
EBITDA outcomes were above Target but below the Maximum. 
This performance resulted in 114.27% salary being payable in 
respect of the financial objectives. Including the personal element, 
bonuses of 132.26% of salary were awarded to Executive 
Directors. The Committee is satisfied that this level of bonus 
reflects the financial and personal performance delivered during 
the year. In line with the Company’s policy, a significant proportion 
of the bonus is deferred in shares.
The CEO and CFO had no performance-based long-term incentive 
awards due to vest in the financial year being reported on 
(or shortly after) the year end reflecting the relatively short tenure 
of the current Executive Team. The Executive Directors’ first 
long-term performance-based awards will vest based on 
performance to 30 April 2015.
Remuneration policy for FY15
In line with the remuneration philosophy outlined earlier, the 
Committee is committed to ensuring that rewards for Executives 
are closely aligned to the interests of shareholders through having 
all incentive arrangements linked to challenging performance 
targets, focused on growing earnings and generating high levels 
of shareholder return. 
The Committee is not proposing any significant changes to 
remuneration at this time and believes the current remuneration 
structure and variable pay quantum remain appropriate for Betfair. 
The Committee took into account the following factors in 
determining the approach for FY15:
• As a Committee we are aware of calls for continued pay 
restraint and the salary increase for the CEO will be 3%, 
in line with those awarded to the workforce more generally. 
No increase will be applied to the CFO’s salary. 
• Annual incentive and Long Term Incentive Plan opportunities 
remain unchanged from the year under review. The Committee 
continues to believe that the current arrangements do not 
inadvertently encourage undue risk taking given the clear 
long-term focus in our policy. 
• In light of the significant challenge facing the industry to 
mitigate the impact of new gaming taxes on profitability, the 
Committee is proposing that a slight amendment is made to  
the Annual Bonus plan with an equal 50/50 emphasis placed  
on Group Revenue and Group EBITDA for the FY15 bonus.  
A 60/40 Group Revenue/Group EBITDA weighting was  
applied in FY14.
• The operation of a Long Term Incentive Plan and deferral into 
shares for part of the annual incentive ensures that Executives 
are clearly aligned with the long-term objectives of the 
Company and its shareholders. Given the increasing strength 
of view on long-term alignment of Executives with shareholders 
and developments in the market, we have introduced formal 
guidelines on the building up of shareholdings by Executive 
Directors over a period of five years. 
We have provided a summary of FY14 remuneration following 
this statement and before the Remuneration Policy Report. The 
summary sets out performance and remuneration outcomes for 
the year ended 30 April 2014. More detail can be found in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration which starts on page 59.
Shareholder feedback
The Remuneration Committee encourages dialogue with the 
Company’s shareholders and will consult with major shareholders 
ahead of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy. 
We were delighted that the 2013 Remuneration Report received 
a 95.38% vote in favour at the last AGM. 
We look forward to your continued support of our remuneration 
policy at the 2014 AGM.

Approach for FY15
BASE SALARY
The CEO’s salary will be increased by 3% from 1 July 2014, which is in line with the general increase across the 
workforce. The CFO’s salary will remain unchanged. 
Salaries for FY15 are:
• CEO – £530,450
• CFO – £400,000
BENEFITS AND 
PENSION
No change proposed. Pension contribution of 15% of salary for the CEO and 10% of salary for the CFO.
ANNUAL BONUS  
(UNDER THE ANNUAL 
CASH INCENTIVE PLAN/
DEFERRED SHARE 
INCENTIVE PLAN)
No change to potential quantum – 180% of salary.
A slight rebalancing of the financial performance metrics is proposed: 
•  80% of salary will be based on Group EBITDA; 
•  80% of salary on Group Revenue; and 
•  20% on personal objectives.
The rebalancing to an equal weighting on EBITDA and Revenue reflects the focus on mitigating the impact on 
profitability of significant cost increases arising from the introduction of new gaming taxes.
LONG TERM 
INCENTIVES (UNDER 
THE LTIP)
No change to quantum or metrics – 300% of salary for the CEO and 200% of salary for the CFO, with 50% 
based on EPS growth, 25% on relative TSR against the FTSE 250, excluding Investment Trusts, and 25% on 
Group Revenue (based on FY17).

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT:
2014 REMUNERATION SUMMARY
52 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Introduction
The contents of this Policy Report set out the Group’s policy 
and disclosures in relation to Directors’ remuneration for the year 
ended 30 April 2014. The report has been presented on behalf 
of the Board and complies fully with the Listing Rules, the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2010 and 2012 (the ‘Code’) as applicable for the financial year.
The Policy Report will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the 
2014 AGM and, subject to the Policy Report receiving majority 
shareholder support, will operate from an effective date of the 
date of the AGM, 4 September 2014. In practice, the Committee 
intends to apply the policy detailed in the Policy Report to the 
current financial year and throughout the three year policy 
period from the effective date. The remainder of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report which includes the Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at 
the 2014 AGM. 
Remuneration Policy Report
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for the 
Executive Directors, the Chairman, Company Secretary and 
other designated members of Executive Management. The 
overall policy aim is to provide a remuneration package which 
will attract, retain and motivate high calibre Executives with 
the appropriate expertise. 
The Committee believes that the opportunity to earn superior 
rewards should be directly aligned to the successful delivery of 
short and long-term performance through a simple and transparent 
framework. The remuneration package for Executive Directors is 
weighted towards performance-related pay, with the aim to pay 
around mid-market levels of total fixed pay but with the opportunity 
to earn upper quartile levels of reward for delivering superior 
performance. The Committee regularly reviews the variable 
incentive elements of the policy to ensure they do not encourage 
excessive risk taking and that they operate within an overall 
acceptable risk profile. 
When setting the policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration, the 
Committee takes into account total remuneration levels operating 
in companies of a similar size and complexity, the responsibilities 
of each individual role, individual performance and an individual’s 
experience. The Committee also considers developments in best 
practice and the pay and employment conditions within the 
wider Group. 
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The policy table below sets out the key elements of Betfair’s Executive Director Remuneration, how they are linked to the Company’s 
strategy, how they operate, the framework for setting performance measures (if applicable) and maximum opportunity levels. 
SALARY
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance measures Maximum opportunity
•  To attract and retain high 
calibre individuals

level of basic fixed income 
whilst avoiding excessive risk 
arising from over-reliance on 
variable income

but exceptionally at other times of the year
•  Set with reference to individual skills, experience,

Annual Report on Remuneration
•  No maximum applies. However, 
increases, as a percentage of salary, 
will generally be consistent with 
those offered to the wider workforce 
from time to time 
•  Higher increases may be appropriate 
where an individual changes role, 
there is a material change in the 
responsibilities of the role, where an 
individual is appointed on a below 
market salary with the expectation 
that this salary will increase with 
experience and performance, or 
where salaries, in the opinion of the 
Committee, have fallen materially 
below the relevant market rates
PENSION

Committee discretions relating to variable pay schemes
The Committee will operate the ACIP, DSIP and LTIP according 
to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules 
where relevant. The Committee retains discretion, consistent 
with market practice, in a number of regards to the operation 
and administration of these plans. 
These include, but are not limited to, the following:
• who participates in the plan;
• the timing of grant of an award and/or payment;
• the size of an award (subject to the maxima set out in the 
policy table above);
• the determination of vesting; 
• discretion required when dealing with a change of control or 
restructuring of the Group;
• determination of a good/bad leaver for incentive plan purposes 
based on the rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment 
chosen;
• confirming that the calculation of performance (including any 
adjustments that were required to be made) is made in an 
appropriate manner, with due consideration of whether, 
and if so, how, adjustments should be made for any changes 
to accounting policy over the performance period. Any 
adjustments to the performance targets should result in the 
revised target not being any less challenging than the original 
target set;
• adjustments required in special circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring, events and special dividends); and
• the choice of performance measures and targets for a new 
award under each incentive plan in accordance with the policy 
set out above.
In relation to both the Annual Bonus and LTIP, the Committee 
retains the ability to adjust the targets set if events occur – for 
example, material changes to the Board’s assessment of the 
regulatory environment within which the Group operates, or a 
material acquisition and/or divestment of a Group business – 
which cause the Committee to determine that the conditions 
are no longer appropriate and the amendment is required so that 
the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially 
less difficult to satisfy. Any use of discretion, beyond the normal 
operation of the plan, would be justified in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration and, as appropriate, the subject of consultation with 
the Company’s major shareholders.
The use of discretion in relation to the Company’s BETsave Plan 
will be as permitted under HMRC rules and the Listing Rules.
Past awards
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the remuneration policy, 
authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments 
entered into with current or former Directors that have been 
disclosed previously to shareholders, including any joining awards 
made on recruitment. The joining awards granted to the current 
Executive Team are disclosed in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 60. 
Any incentive awards which have been granted to employees who 
may be subsequently promoted to the Board will vest according 
to their original terms.
Choice of performance measures
The performance metrics that are used for both the Annual Bonus 
and LTIP have been selected to reflect the Group’s overall business 
strategy and its key performance indicators.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 55 Annual Bonus
The majority of annual performance measures are focused on the achievement of challenging financial metrics. These may include, but 
are not limited to, revenue and profit generation. Each metric will reflect how well the Group is growing the business. 
Measure Link to strategy
REVENUE • The use of revenue aligns with our strategic objectives of widening the range of products and services that 
we offer, attracting new customers, increasing the activity of existing customers, and building our market 
share in all regions in which we operate.
PROFIT • The use of a profit based measure, such as EBITDA, alongside revenue helps ensure a balance between 
growth and profitability. 
• EBITDA measures the underlying profits generated by the business and whether management is converting 
growth into profits effectively. 
PERSONAL • Individual objectives measure whether management is delivering against stated key business and personal 
targets which are linked to the corporate strategy.
In setting financial parameters, the Committee takes into account the Company’s internal budgets and, where applicable, investors’ 
expectations. The targets applying to financial measures are based on a sliding scale.
LTIP
For the Company’s long-term plans, awards vest subject to delivering against measures which are aligned with the long-term levels 
of return targeted by the Company which may include relative TSR, EPS and Group Revenue. 
Measure Link to strategy
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER 
RETURN
• TSR provides a clear alignment between the value created for shareholders and the reward earned  
by Executives.
EARNINGS PER SHARE • EPS captures the long-term growth in earnings, which is most closely aligned to the overall financial 
performance expected by shareholders.
GROUP REVENUE • Revenue targets ensure top line growth is being generated from new markets and through the widening  
of our product offering. 
Additional measures which are linked to the business strategy at the time may also be used. Targets are set based on a sliding scale that 
takes account of internal planning and external market expectations for the Company. 
How Executive pay compares to other employees
The Committee receives an overview of the reward structure and quantum applying to the whole employee population on a periodic 
basis from the HR Director. The information presented is taken into consideration when setting the pay levels of Executive Directors 
and other senior executives.
At other levels of the Group, employees will receive a remuneration package that is reflective of their role and responsibilities, set by 
reference to internal relativities and external market data where applicable. Employees at the Executive level will typically have a greater 
emphasis on performance-related and long-term pay compared to those below this level. Annual incentives may be payable based on 
performance measures which are suitable to the nature and responsibility of the role.

The Company’s remuneration policy results in a significant 
proportion of the remuneration received by Executive Directors 
being dependent on Company performance. The chart above 
illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the current Executive 
Directors vary under three performance scenarios – Minimum, 
Target and Maximum – in the first year to which the policy 
applies, i.e. FY15. 
Assumptions underlying the scenarios:
• Minimum – comprises fixed pay only which includes base salary 
as at 1 July 2014, pension allowances in line with the Company’s 
policy and the value of benefits (using historic values for FY14 
as a proxy).
• Target – comprises fixed pay plus two-thirds of the maximum 
payout under the Annual Bonus plan (120% of salary), and 25% 
of the LTIP vesting (75% and 50% of salary for the CEO and 
CFO respectively).
• Maximum – comprises fixed pay plus 100% of the maximum 
payout under the Annual Bonus plan (180% of salary) and 
100% of the LTIP vesting (300% and 200% of salary for the 
CEO and CFO respectively).
• No share price appreciation has been used and all-employee 
share plan awards have been excluded.
In respect of Target performance, the chart reflects the position 
for the first financial year for which this policy applies for the 
current Executive Directors. The Committee retains the flexibility 
to adjust the calibration of performance with incentive plan 
payouts at Threshold, Target and Maximum levels subject to any 
constraints set out in the Policy Table. 
Service agreements and loss of office
The Executive Directors have service contracts that can be 
terminated by either party on the giving of 12 months’ notice. 
There is no entitlement to the payment of a predetermined 
amount on termination of employment in any circumstances.
The Executive Directors’ service agreements contain provisions for 
payment in lieu of notice of 12 months’ salary at the Company’s 
discretion. The Company may choose to make any payment in 
monthly instalments. If an Executive finds alternative relevant 
employment subject to a minimum level of salary being earned, 
the amount of any monthly payments in lieu of notice will be 
reduced accordingly.
There are no enhanced provisions on a change of control. If the 
Executive’s employment is terminated for reasons of misconduct 
or breach of contract no payments will be made, other than any 
amounts due at the date of termination. Any statutory entitlements 
or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with the 
termination would be paid as necessary.
The service contract of any new appointment would be based  
on similar terms. 
No annual incentive is payable if a Director ceases employment 
or is under notice of termination of employment prior to the date 
that the bonus is due to be paid. However, in certain good leaver 
situations such as death, ill-health, redundancy, retirement with 
the agreement of the employer or for any other reason at the 
Committee’s discretion, a pro-rata bonus may be payable (unless 
the Committee determines that no deduction should apply), and 
subject to the achievement of the performance conditions. 
The conditions covering loss of office payments are as set out 
in the individual plan rules of the DSIP and the LTIP. 
In summary, under the DSIP rules, unvested deferred bonus 
awards vest in full for death, redundancy, ill-health and retirement 
(with the agreement of the employer). For any other 
circumstances, any outstanding awards will lapse on the date  
of cessation. 
Under the LTIP rules, if an Executive ceases employment due to 
death, retirement at contractual retirement age (or earlier with the 
consent of the Remuneration Committee), redundancy, ill-health  
or permanent disability, or any other reason at the Committee’s 
discretion, the awards may vest at the normal vesting date or 
upon cessation subject to the performance conditions being 
achieved at either date, on a pro-rata basis to reflect the unexpired 
proportion of the performance or vesting period. The Committee 
may decide not to pro-rate if it decides it is appropriate to do so.
The restricted shares granted to Breon Corcoran on his 
appointment will normally lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, if the Executive ceases employment for reasons of 
death, retirement, injury or disability or any other reason at the 
Committee’s discretion, the awards shall vest on the date of 
cessation and a pro-rata reduction shall be applied to reflect the 
early vesting. The Committee may, if it feels it is inappropriate  
to apply a pro-rata reduction, decide not to do so.

Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors 
All Non-Executive Directors’ services are provided for under the 
terms of a letter of appointment with the Group, and are subject 
to annual re-election with one month’s notice by either party 
(except for the Chairman with three months’ notice by either 
party). The appointment letters for the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on 
termination, other than accrued fees and expenses. Details of the 
terms of the appointment of the current Non-Executive Directors

Peter Rigby 1 April 2014 31 March 2017
* Please see Non-Executive Directors’ profiles for total service on page 37.
Recruitment remuneration
The base salary for a new appointment will be set taking into 
account the skills and experience of the individual, internal 
relativities and the market rate for the role as identified by any 
relevant benchmarking of companies of a comparable size and 
complexity. If it is considered appropriate to set the salary for  
a new Executive Director at a level which is below market (for 
example, to allow them to gain experience in the role) their salary 
may be increased to achieve the desired market positioning by way 
of a series of phased above inflation increases. Any increases will 
be subject to the individual’s continued development in the role. 
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be 
set in accordance with the limits contained in the Company’s 
approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment. The 
annual incentive plan will be operated, as set out above for current 
Executives, albeit with any payment pro-rata for the period of 
employment and with the flexibility to use different performance 
measures and targets, depending on the timing and nature of 
the appointment. 
Additionally in the case of any Executive Director being recruited 
overseas, or being recruited by the Company to relocate overseas 
to perform his duties, the Committee may offer expatriate benefits 
on an ongoing basis. 
The Committee may also approve the payment of one-off 
relocation-related expenses and legal fees incurred by the individual. 
In addition, the Committee may offer cash and/or share-based 
elements to compensate an individual for remuneration which 
would be forfeited on leaving a former employer, when it considers 
these to be in the best interests of the Company (and therefore 
shareholders). Such payments would take account of remuneration 
relinquished and would mirror (as far as possible) the delivery 
mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement attached 
to that remuneration. Where possible this will be facilitated 
through the Company’s existing share plans, but if not the 
Committee may use the provisions of 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. 
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay out 
according to its original terms stipulated on grant or adjusted 
as considered desirable to reflect the new role.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance 
with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time.
External directorships
After the first anniversary of appointment, an Executive Director 
may take up an external Non-Executive Director position with the 
agreement of the Board. Fees paid for external appointments may 
be retained by the individual concerned. 
Consideration of employee views
Whilst the Committee has not formally consulted directly with 
employees on matters of Executive pay, it does receive periodic 
updates from the HR Director on the overall remuneration 
structures and policies for all employees, and uses these as broad 
context when setting the policy for Executive Directors. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee maintains an open and transparent dialogue 
with shareholders and takes an active interest in voting outcomes. 
Feedback received from shareholders, at the AGM and any other 
meetings during the year, is considered by the Committee on a 
timely basis. Any material changes to the remuneration policy will 
be the subject of prior consultation with our major shareholders 
and institutional investor bodies as required.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT: REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT CONTINUED
58 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the Listing Rules.  
The Annual Remuneration Report (together with the Chairman’s 
Annual Statement) will be put to an advisory shareholder vote  
at the 2014 AGM. The information on pages 59 to 67 has been 
audited where stated.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises four 
independent Non-Executive Directors, in compliance with the 
Code. The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Leo Quinn, and 
its other members are Ian Dyson, Peter Jackson and Peter Rigby. 
Mike McTighe chaired the Committee until 31 March 2014 and 
Fru Hazlitt was a member of the Committee until 31 March 2014. 
Biographies of the Committee members can be found on page 37. 
The Committee meets at least twice each year, and during the year 
under review met on six occasions. Each member’s attendance 
at these meetings is set out in the Corporate Governance report 
on page 40. 
Advice provided to the Committee
The Committee received material assistance and advice from the 
Chairman, CEO and the Group HR Director, although no individual 
is present for decisions relating to their personal remuneration.
The Committee appointed and has been advised during the year 
by New Bridge Street (NBS). NBS is a separate subsidiary of the 
Group’s insurance broker Aon plc (and it does not provide any 
other services to the Company). NBS is a founder signatory to the 
Remuneration Consulting Group’s Code of Conduct and its total 
fees in relation to Remuneration Committee advice during the year 
were £66,491. The Committee considers that NBS is independent.

under review. 
Long Term Incentive Plan awards vesting in the year (audited)
The current Executive Directors have no LTIP awards with performance periods ending in the year to 30 April 2014. The performance 
period for the 2011 LTIP scheme ended on 30 April 2014. There are 21 participants with interests in the 2011 LTIP, of whom one, 
Stephen Morana, was a former Executive Director (until 3 December 2012) but remained an employee until 31 March 2013. As disclosed 
in last year’s report, Stephen Morana was treated as a good leaver and his interests in the 2011 LTIP are disclosed below.
The 2011 awards were subject to performance measures, with 50% based on EPS and 50% on Revenue targets for FY14. In line with 
the plan documentation, the Committee, at its discretion, has the ability to adjust the targets that were originally set to reflect any 
material changes in, for example, regulatory outcomes relative to the scenario envisaged when setting the targets and reporting 
definitions or accounting policies. 
In respect of the targets applying to the 2011 awards, the Committee has used its discretion to adjust the EPS and Revenue targets that 
were originally set to reflect:
• the decision to exit from Greece due to unacceptable levels of legal risk and to withdraw the Exchange from Germany due to the 
introduction of a turnover tax;
• the withdrawal of Betfair’s Exchange from Spain following new regulations introduced in June 2012;
• changes to the regulatory timetable regarding the introduction of exchanges in Italy; and
• in respect of EPS only, a change to accounting definitions which now deducts IFRS 2 (Share-Based Payment) charges from profit.
The Committee is satisfied that the adjustments are a result of external factors that were unforeseen, outside the control of management 
and result in targets that are no less or more challenging than the targets that were originally set. The revised targets and performance 
against them are set out below:
FY14 Revenue FY14 EPS

Stephen Morana, the former interim CEO, stepped down from the Board on 3 December 2012 and left employment on 31 March 2013. 
As set out in last year’s report, Stephen Morana was treated as a good leaver under the Company’s share schemes, and his awards will 
vest subject to performance and a time pro-rata reduction.
Payment for loss of office (audited) 
No Executive Directors left during the year. Three Non-Executive Directors, Josh Hannah, Mike McTighe and Fru Hazlitt, left during the 
year and did not receive any payment for loss of office.

 The value of benefits fell from £3,990 in FY13 (pro-rated up for a full year) to £2,888 in FY14. The fall reflects a fall in the cost of renewing the insurance benefits.

 The UK and Ireland employee population covers the majority of the workforce and, in the view of the Committee, is the most appropriate comparator group. 
The calculation covers employees who were continuously employed for FY14 (1 May 2013 to 30 April 2014).

 Bonuses for the workforce for FY14 have not been concluded at the time of signing this report and therefore this is an indicative figure.

Annual Bonus – Annual Cash Incentive Plan and Deferred Share Incentive Plan
The Annual Bonus will operate in a broadly similar manner to the year ended 30 April 2014. The maximum bonus will remain as 180% 
of salary, with two-thirds of any bonus payable in cash (ACIP) and the remaining one-third deferred into Group shares (DSIP). Any 
deferred shares will vest 50% after one year and 50% after two years from the date of grant, subject to continued employment. 
Dividends may be paid on any vested DSIP shares. 
Clawback provisions will apply on DSIP awards for reasons of misstatement, miscalculation or misconduct within two years of the date 
of grant. 
The Committee reviews the performance measures and targets on an annual basis to ensure they remain appropriately aligned to the 
overall business strategy but do not encourage excessive risk taking.
The performance measures for the FY15 Annual Bonus are as follows: 
Element Weighting % of salary
Revenue 44.5% 80%
EBITDA 44.5% 80%
Personal 11% 20%
Total 100% 180%
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year, as these include items which 
the Committee considers commercially sensitive. The Committee intends to provide retrospective disclosure of certain performance 
measures in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, to the extent that the Committee determines that the measures are no longer 
commercially sensitive.
GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
66 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan
The Committee intends to make an annual award of nil-cost options under the LTIP at 300% of salary for the CEO and 200% of salary 
for the CFO during FY14. Vested awards will be eligible to receive dividend equivalents and awards will be subject to clawback provisions 
for reasons of misstatement, miscalculation or misconduct within two years of vesting. 
The Committee has reviewed the performance measures and targets for the prospective award and determined that no changes 
are required to the balance of metrics used for the 2013 award. Therefore, the performance conditions for the 2014 award will be 
as follows:
EPS condition (50% of award)
EPS for FY17
1
Shares vesting  
(as % of number relating to 
EPS performance condition)
Less than 50.2p Nil

 New gaming taxes are expected to be introduced in the UK, Ireland and Italy 
during the Plan period. If these taxes were applicable in FY14, Betfair would 
have incurred additional costs of c.£36m, significantly reducing EPS for FY14. 
The EPS target for FY17 reflects a full year of these changes in taxation.
TSR condition (25% of award)
Relative TSR performance comparing Betfair’s ranking against the 
FTSE 250 constituents excluding Investment Trusts:

In addition to the three performance targets detailed above,  
an underpin will also apply which will enable the Remuneration 
Committee to change the vesting result based on the above 
performance targets if it does not consider the Company’s 
underlying financial performance to reflect the proposed level  
of vesting. These performance targets will be reviewed by the 
Committee at the end of the three year performance period.
SAYE
Executives will be eligible to participate on the same terms as all 
other UK employees if an invitation to enter a savings contract is 
offered during the year.

is contained in a circular sent out to shareholders with this Report. 
The Notice of Meeting contains full details of the resolutions that 
will be put to shareholders.
Political donations
At the 2013 AGM, shareholders passed a resolution to authorise 
the Group to make political donations and/or incur political 
expenditure (as such terms are defined in sections 362 to 379 of 
the Companies Act 2006), in each case in amounts not exceeding 
£50,000 in aggregate. As the authority granted will expire on  
4 September 2014, renewal of this authority will be sought at this 
year’s AGM. Further details are available in the Notice of AGM. 
The definitions of political donations and political expenditure used 
in the Companies Act 2006 are broad in nature and this authority 
is sought to ensure that any activities undertaken by the entities 
within the Group, which could otherwise be construed to fall 
within these provisions, can be undertaken without inadvertently 
infringing them. 
During the year and the previous year, the Group made no EU 
political donations.
In accordance with applicable US state and federal laws, the Group 
has made £28,165 (2013: £76,190) of contributions to support 
candidates for nomination and/or election to public office. The 
Group has fully complied with jurisdictional reporting of these 
contributions and such contributions in the US are accepted 
normal business practice. Betfair is committed to working with 
governments in the EU, US and other jurisdictions in which  
it operates.
Contractual arrangements
The Group has contractual arrangements with numerous third 
parties in support of its business activities. In that context, 
disclosure in this Report of information about any of those third 
parties is not considered necessary for an understanding of the 
development, performance or position of the Group’s businesses.
Significant agreements – change of control provisions
There are no significant agreements which contain provisions 
entitling other parties to exercise termination or other rights 
in the event of a change in control of the Company. 
The rules of certain of the Company’s share plans include 
provisions which apply in the event of a takeover or 
reconstruction. 
Going concern, responsibilities and disclosure
The current activities of the Group and those factors likely to 
affect its future development, together with a description of its 
financial position, are described in the Strategic Report. Principal 
risks and uncertainties affecting the Group, and the steps taken 
to mitigate these risks are described in the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties section of the Strategic Report. Critical accounting 
estimates affecting the carrying values of assets and liabilities of 
the Group are discussed in note 1 to the financial statements.
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Directors 
considered the going concern status for a period in excess of 
12 months from the date of signing this report. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 69 Funding and liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet 
its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always 
have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both 
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable 
losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group 
also spreads its cash reserves across several highly rated banks and 
investments to mitigate counterparty risks. The Group performs 
regular cash flow projections to ensure that it has sufficient cash 
on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period  
of at least 90 days. The Group has no committed lines of credit.
Auditors
KPMG has instigated an orderly wind-down of KPMG Audit Plc  
as a result of an internal reorganisation and requested that going 
forward the audit is instead undertaken by KPMG LLP (an 
intermediate parent of KPMG Audit Plc). KPMG Audit Plc will not 
therefore be seeking reappointment as auditor of the Company 
and, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, a resolution 
proposing the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company’s 
auditors and to authorise the Directors to determine their 
remuneration will be proposed at the 2014 AGM.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval of 
the Directors’ Report confirms that so far as they are aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware, and that they have taken all steps that they ought to 
have taken as a Director to make them aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
70 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the Group and Parent financial statements in accordance  
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and  
Parent financial statements for each financial year. Under that  
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and applicable 
law, and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK accounting standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company  
and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of  
the Group and Parent financial statements, the Directors are  
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy  
at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard  
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities. Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that comply with that law and  
those regulations.

Report and the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of  
the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and

1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Betfair Group plc  
for the year ended 30 April 2014 set out on pages 75 to 119.  
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
30 April 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements 
the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on 
our audit were as follows:
Revenue recognition (£393.6m)
Refer to page 44 (Report of the Audit Committee), page 86 
(Accounting policies) and pages 89 to 91 (financial disclosures).
• The risk – The recognition of commission revenues or revenues 
from winning and losing bets may be misstated. The appropriate 
recognition of revenue is dependent on IT systems correctly 
calculating commission revenues and appropriate wins and 
losses and client funds and core finance processes and controls 
accurately reporting on and reconciling these transactions. 
Revenue streams for the vast majority of the Group’s products 
are computed on highly complex IT systems, with a number  
of different bases for calculating revenue. There are in excess  
of 1 billion transactions each year, all requiring a correct IT 
outcome. There is a risk that each system is not configured 
correctly from the outset such that commissions or winning  
and losing bets are calculated incorrectly, that the systems  
do not interface correctly from the customer facing systems 
through to the financial information systems and that 
unauthorised changes are made to any of these systems,  
which may result in the misstatement of revenue.
The calculation of revenue from the IT systems links directly  
to the reconciliation of funds between client and corporate 
accounts and as such client funds must be appropriately 
managed and safeguarded. There is a risk that commissions  
or winning and losing bets are not calculated correctly and 
therefore a risk that the revenue to be transferred from the 
customer accounts in the ring fenced trust to Betfair corporate 
accounts could be misstated.
• Our response – Our audit procedures included, among  
others, the use of IT audit experts throughout the audit  
process. We critically assessed the design and operating 
effectiveness of IT controls and tested that the systems are 
configured appropriately. We traced bets placed on live betting 
environments from the customer facing systems to the data 
centre and then from the data centre to the financial information 
systems to ensure that information is passed appropriately from 
one system to another. We tested controls over the capture of 
initial bets, their allocation between different products and their 
processing through the system to recognition in revenue or  
in the appropriate customer account. We also tested the 
configuration of the system which monitors the information 
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF BETFAIR GROUP PLC ONLY
transfer between each IT system and evaluated whether it was 
operating effectively. 
Data on a sample of different types of bets placed by  
customers in different markets was extracted from the systems. 
Commission rate calculations were re-performed to assess the 
completeness and accuracy of commissions and revenues from 
winning bets.
We tested controls related to access to programs and  
data, program change and development and computer 
operations by evaluating account set-up and termination  
for users, password restrictions, access reviews, users with 
super-user access, program change and development process 
controls and integration monitoring, and tested whether any 
unauthorised changes had been made to the system. The overall 
IT environment was critically assessed, including security policies 
and procedures, IT organisational structure, strategy and 
reporting, disaster recovery and back-up testing. 
We tested processes and controls over customer account set-up 
and cash deposits and withdrawals from client accounts. We 
verify client bank balances to third party information and test 
the reconciliation of these bank balances to Betfair customers’ 
betting accounts. We have also considered the adequacy of  
the Group’s disclosures in respect of revenue recognition.
Valuation of tax provisions 
Refer to page 44 (Report of the Audit Committee) and page 87 
(Accounting policies).
• The risk – The online gaming regulatory environment is  
complex and constantly changing. Some markets are highly 
regulated, while in other markets, online gaming regulation is 
not yet formed or is unclear. Betfair organises its operations in 
different jurisdictions in a way which requires the Directors to 
exercise a level of judgement surrounding the interpretation  
of international tax laws and the way in which they interact 
within each jurisdiction. This may result in significant provisions 
or contingent liabilities for gaming and other indirect taxes 
in countries where the tax and/or other regulations are not  
yet formed or are unclear, the volatility of which could have  
a significant impact on the financial statements, particularly if 
there is a retrospective element applied to taxes. Where tax 
regulations are formalised in certain jurisdictions, Betfair must 
adhere to the operating guidelines within these jurisdictions, 
such that taxes do not become payable elsewhere, which  
would result in current tax provisions being understated.
In addition to gaming taxes, the Directors must make judgements 
in relation to international income tax laws including transfer 
pricing and controlled foreign companies.
• Our response – Our audit procedures included, among  
others, challenging the Directors and the Group’s in-house 
lawyers in order to understand and critically assess the 
procedures that the Group has in place to comply with 
regulations in different jurisdictions. We used KPMG’s wider 
understanding of the regulatory markets to challenge the 
Directors and critically assessed the exposure to taxation. We 
examined correspondence with regulators during the year and 
evaluated the Group’s taxation position, working with KPMG tax 
specialists to test gaming taxes, indirect taxes and income taxes. 
We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures detailing legal 
proceedings adequately disclose the potential liabilities of the 
Group and considered the adequacy of the disclosures in respect 
of tax and uncertain tax positions. 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 73 3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope 
of our audit
In establishing the overall audit strategy, and performing the audit, 
materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set 
at £3.5m. This has been calculated with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before tax, which we consider to be one of the 
principal considerations for members of the Company in assessing 
the financial performance of the Group. Materiality represents 6% 
of Group profit before tax.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all uncorrected 
misstatements we identified through our audit with a value in 
excess of £175,000, for income statement items, in addition to 
other audit misstatements we believed warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. In addition we considered whether any 
misstatements corrected by management identified during the 
course of the audit should be communicated to the Audit 
Committee to assist it in fulfilling its governance responsibilities.
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed by 
component auditors in Malta and Australia. The Group audit team 
performed the audit over Betfair Group, including consolidation 
type adjustments in the UK, and the Group audit team also 
performed reviews over Betfair US (TVG) and Betfair Italy.  
These Group procedures covered 88% of Group revenue,  
92% of Group profit before tax and 82% of Group assets.
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes at the  
key reporting components of the Group were all performed to 
materiality levels set by, or agreed with, the Group audit team. 
These materiality levels were set individually for each component 
at £3.0m.
Detailed instructions were sent to component auditors, which 
covered the significant areas that should be covered by the audit 
engagements (which included the relevant risks of material 
misstatement detailed above) and set out the information  
required to be reported back to the Group audit team.
The Group audit team visited the following locations: Malta and 
Ireland. Telephone meetings were also held with the auditors at 
these locations and the majority of the other locations that were 
not physically visited.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement 
set out on pages  38 to 68 of the Annual Report and Accounts 
with respect to internal control and risk management systems in 
relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital 
structures is consistent with the financial statements. 
5 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which 
we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the Annual Report that contains  
a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the  
financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or  
that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business  
model and strategy; or
• the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 43 to 45 does  
not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or 
• a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by 
the Company. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 69, in relation to 
going concern; and  
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 38 
in the Annual Report and Accounts relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities. 
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities  
Statement set out on page 71, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an 
audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members as  
a body and is subject to important explanations and disclaimers 
regarding our responsibilities, published on our website at  
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2013a, which are incorporated 
into this report as if set out in full and should be read to provide  
an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we  
have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

(FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) 
80 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 
1 Accounting policies 
Reporting entity 
Betfair Group plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 30 April 201 4 comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘ Group’) and the Group’s interest in jointly controlled entities. The Group is involved in the 
provision of betting services and online gaming products. The Parent Company financial st atements present information about the 
Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 April 201 4 were authorised for issue in accordance with  
a resolution of the Directors on 11 June 2014. 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted for use in the European Union. The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements  
in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 116 to 118. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following: 
• derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value; and 
• financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. 
Going concern 
The Group has considerable financial resources. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage  
its business risks successfully. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continu e in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future, and therefore they continue to adopt the going concern bas is in the consolidated 
financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report on page 69. 
Functional currency and presentation currency 
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds S terling, which is the Company’s fun ctional currency. All financial 
information presented in Pounds Sterling has been rounded to the nearest million, except where otherwise stated. 
Changes in accounting policy 
The Group has adopted the following accounting policies, standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards during the 
year ended 30 April 2014:  
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’  
IFRS 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures about fair value measurements, when su ch 
measurements are required or permitted by other IFRSs. In particular, it unifies the definition of fair value as the price at which an orderly 
transaction to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date. It also 
replaces and expands the disclosure requirements about fair value measurements in other IFRSs, including IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures’. IFRS 13 applies prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’  
As a result of the amendments to IAS 1, the Group has modified the presentation of items of other comprehensive income in its 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, to present separately items that may be reclassified to profit or loss in the future 
from those that would never be so reclassified. Comparative information has been re -presented accordingly. The adoption of the 
Amendments to IAS 1 has no impact on the recognised assets, liabilities and comprehensive income of the Group.  
The new standards and interpretations did not have a material impact on the results or the financial position of the Group as at  
30 April 2014 or on any disclosures. 
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed by the 
European Union and require adoption by the Group in future accounting periods.

Basis of consolidation 
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control  
is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from  
its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable as well as 
assessing whether the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities. The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: 
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non- controlling interest in the acquired entity; plus 
• if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre- existing equity interest in the acquired entity; less 
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the goodwill is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connecti on with  
a business combination are expensed as incurred. 
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value as at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified  
as equity, then it is not re -measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. 
(i) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries h ave been 
changed to align them with the policies adop ted by the Group when necessary. 
(ii) Associates and jointly controlled entities (‘equity accounted investments’ ) 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. Jointly 
controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreemen t and requiring 
unanimous consent for strategic, financial and operating decisions. Associates and jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the 
equity method (equity accounted investments) and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment i ncludes goodwill identified  
on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the comprehensive income and equity movements of equity 
accounted investments, from the date that sign ificant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint 
control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investment, the Group’s carrying amount is 
reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee. 
(iii) Acquisition of non-controlling interests 
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners , therefore no goodwill  
is recognised as a result. 
Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated  
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investments are 
eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the i nvestments. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the  
same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary 
items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effect ive interest 
and payments during the period, and the amort ised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the period. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rate at the date of the transa ction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are 
retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. Foreign currency 
differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the income statement. 
Foreign operations 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to  
the Group’s presentational currency, Pounds Sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. The income and expenses  
of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange r ates ruling  
at the dates of the transactions. 
  
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 81 1 Accounting policies continued 
Foreign operations continued 
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve. When a foreign 
operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to the income statement. 
When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable 
future, foreign currency gains and losses arising from such item are considered to form part of a net investment in the foreign operat ion  
and are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity. 
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates: 
Discontinued operations 
Results in relation to discontinued operations are disclosed as a single amount on the face of the consolidated income statem ent 
comprising the total post-tax loss of the subsidiary disposed of. The comparative periods in the income statement are stated in the  
same way. 
Restructuring costs 
A restructuring cost is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation to those affected that it will carry out the r estructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features  
to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring cost includes only the direct expenditure arising from the restru cturing,  
which are those amounts that are both necessarily incurred by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of 
the entity.  
Available-for-sale financial assets 
The Group’s investments in certain equity securities are classified as available -for-sale financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition,  
the assets are reviewed annually for changes in value with any impairment loss recognised through the income statement, and o n 
disposal any realised gains and losses are als o recognised through the income statement. 
On an annual basis the available -for-sale financial assets are reviewed and re-measured on a fair value basis if the fair value is significantly 
different to the value previously recorded and where the fair value of the unlisted equity shares can be reliably measured. 
Financial instruments 
(i) Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group 
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two condition s: 
• they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets  
or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
• where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non -derivative that includes  
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments. 
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instr ument so classified 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these consolidated financial statements for called up share 
capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
(ii) Non-derivative financial instruments 
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity securities, trade and other receivables, including cash and c ash 
equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables. 
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition non -derivative financial 
instruments are measured as described below. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and for m an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the p urpose of the statement of 
cash flows. 
Cash and cash equivalents do not include certain client funds deposited in a stakeholder account held by The Sporting Exchange (Clients) 
Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, on the basis that they are held on trust for customers and do not belong to and are 
not at the disposal of the Group.

Non-derivative financial instruments measured at fa ir value through profit or loss 
An instrument is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is held for trading or is designated as such upon init ial recognition. 
Financial instruments are designated at fair value through profit or loss if the G roup manages such investments and makes purchase and 
sale decisions based on their fair value in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy. Upon initial 
recognition, directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement when incurred. Financial instruments at fair 
value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in the income statement.  
(iii) Other 
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any  
impairment losses. 
(iv) Derivative financial instruments 
The Group holds derivative financial instruments in relation to open betting l iability positions arising as a result of open positions at the 
reporting date. 
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement whe n  
incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, der ivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for through  
the income statement. 
Share capital 
(i) Ordinary shares 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares an d share options are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. 
(ii) Repurchase of share capital (treasury shares) 
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid which includes directly attributable costs,  
is net of any tax effects, and is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are 
presented as a deduction from total equity. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the am ount received is recognised 
as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on th e transaction is transferred to or from retained earnings. 
Earnings per share 
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (‘EPS’ ) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit  
or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the 
year. Diluted EPS is determined by the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which include awards under share award schemes and share 
options granted to employees. 
Property, plant and equipment 
(i) Recognition and measurement 
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self -constructed assets includes the costs  
of materials and direct labour and any other directly attributable cost of bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use. 
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from dispos al with  
the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised within the income statement. 
(ii) Depreciation 
Depreciation is recognised in the income statement on a straight -line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. 
The estimated useful lives for the c urrent and comparative periods are as follows: 
Freehold buildings – 50 years 
Leasehold improvements – Over the term of the lease or the useful economi c life of the asset, if shorter 
Plant and machinery – 10 years 
Equipment, fixtures and fittings – 3 to 5 years 
 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.  
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
(i) Goodwill 
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities. 
  
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 83 1 Accounting policies continued 
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued 
Acquisitions on or after 1 May 2007 
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 May 2007, goodwill represents the difference between the fair value  
of consideration for the acquisition and the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Identifiable 
intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable. 
Acquisitions prior to 1 May 2007 
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 and has not elected to restate business combinations that took  
place prior to 1 May 2007. In respect of acquisitions prior t o 1 May 2007, goodwill is included at 1 May 2007 on the basis of its deemed 
cost, which represents the amount recorded under the Group’s previous accounting framework which was broadly comparable save that  
only separable intangibles were recognised and go odwill was amortised. 
Subsequent measurement 
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) and is not 
amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of equity accounted investments, the carrying amount of goodwill is included 
in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee. 
(ii) Internally generated goodwill and brands 
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised as an expense in the income statement, as incurred. 
(iii) Research and development 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the income statement, as incurred. 
Expenditure on development activities is recognised as an internally generated intangible asset only when the necessary crite ria are met; 
including demonstrating the technical feasibility of the product and having sufficient certainty over the future reven ue or cost savings  
that will be generated from the product. 
The qualifying expenditure capitalised represents costs directly attributable to the development of the asset. This expenditu re is 
capitalised from the point at which the above criteria are met up to the point at which the asset is available for use. If the criteria 
are not met the expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
Capitalised development expenditure assets are amortised on a straight- line basis from the date they are available for use ov er their  
useful economic lives. 
(iv) Other intangible assets 
Identifiable intangibles are assets which have finite lives, can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardle ss of whether  
those rights are separable. 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring in to use the spe cific 
software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful economic life or the lif e of the software licence contract. 
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated 
impairment losses. 
(v) Amortisation 
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a str aight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets,  
other than goodwill, from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful economic lives are as follows: 
Computer software – The shorter of the licence period and up to 10 years 
Licences – The shorter of the licence period and up to 10 years 
Wagering technologies – 6 years 
Customer lists – 2 to 4 years 
Development expenditure – 3 years 
Brand – 2 years 
Broadcasting technologies – 2 years 
Impairment 
(i) Financial assets 
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired . An indicator  
of impairment of a financial asset is apparent if objective evidence highlights that one or more events have had a negative effect on the 
estimated future cash flows of that asset. 
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its car rying amount,  
and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment loss in respect  
of an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its fair value and book value. Significant financial assets are tested for 
impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit 
risk characteristics. 
All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
84 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 85 
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related o bjectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.  
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised in the income statement. For available- for-sale financial assets  
that are equity securities, the reversal is recognised directly in equity. 
(ii) Non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non -financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the s ame time. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre -tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of th e cash 
inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the CGU). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment 
testing, is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carry ing amount of an asset when allocated to a CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any good will allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit on a 
pro-rata basis. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there  
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the exten t that  
the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation,  
if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
Employee benefits 
(i) Defined contribution plans 
A defined contribution plan is a post -employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity  
and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contributi on pension  
plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement when they are due. 
(ii) Short-term benefits 
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as t he related service is provided.  
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short -term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has  
a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the emp loyee and the obligation  
can be estimated reliably. 
(iii) Share-based payment transactions 
The following schemes are in place that allow employees to acquire shares in the Group: 
Share option plans and Save-As-You-Earn schemes 
Share option plans and Save-As-You-Earn schemes are accounted for as equity -settled share-based payment schemes on the basis 
that the Group will not be required to settle its obligations under these schemes in cash. The fair value of options granted is recognised  
as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period  
during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the share options and is calculated using an option pricing model,  
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adju sted  
to reflect the actual number of share options that vest. 
Restricted share scheme 
The Group provides a restricted share scheme as part of its bonus plan. Awards made under the terms of the restricted share s cheme  
until 2011 represent a conditional right to receive shares in the Company provided that certain Group and individual performance criteria  
are met. Restricted shares are valued with reference to the market value of the shares on the date of grant. 
The shares vest over a three year period and one-third of the total entitlement vest each year. The first year’s entitlement can be 
taken in cash at the option of the employee, and accordingly this component is accounted for as a cash settled scheme and recorded 
as a liability. If, on the date of settlement, the employee elects to receive shares instead of cash, the liability previously recognised is 
transferred to equity, as the consideration for the equity instruments issued. 
The remaining two-thirds of restricted shares granted cannot be taken in cash and accordingly are accounted for as equity-settled 
schemes. A charge is recognised in employee expenses on a straight- line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase  
in equity. 
In January 2012, the Group modified certain outstanding share options and replaced them with restricted shares on a 3:1 basis.  
 
A number of individuals were granted restricted shares in the current and prior periods .

The Group currently operates the LTIP and DSIP. In previous years, the STIP and MIP were used but these were replaced by DSIP in the 
financial year ended 30 April 2014. 
• The LTIP entitles recipients to share options and restricted share rewards based on meeting the Group and individual performance 
criteria over a three year period.  
• The DSIP provides for one-third of any annual incentive payment (determined under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan) to be paid in 
deferred shares. Any such deferred element granted under the DSIP will vest 50% after 1 year and 50% after 2 years from the date 
of grant. Clawback provisions are included and dividends accrue on vested DSIP awards. 
• The previous STIP and MIP structures had both cash and share elements. The cash element was two -thirds of the award; the 
remaining one-third was paid in deferred shares. 
The fair value of the LTIP, DSIP and the share -based elements of the STIP and MIP are calculated under IFRS 2 share-based payment. 
The cash elements of the STIP and the MIP were fixed in value and paid in the year the award was made, with no option on the part 
of the recipient to choose whether they receive cash or shares. Accordingly, these cash payments were classified as a cash bonus in 
the income statement (rather than a ‘cash settled share -based payment’) and expensed in the year in which the award was made. 
Long-term Senior Executives’ Incentive Plan (‘SEIP’) 
The long-term SEIP was approved by the Board on 16 October 2007. The plan provides for certain senior management and Directors to 
be granted one-off awards consisting of a cash and restricted shares element. The scheme came into effect upon the admission of the 
Group’s shares on the London Stock Exch ange. 
The cash was paid on the date of admission to the participants in the scheme. The restricted shares were granted on the date of 
admission and half of the restricted shares vested on the first anniversary of the listing and the next half on the sec ond anniversary  
of the listing. 
The restricted shares in the SEIP are measured consistently with the treatme nt of normal restricted shares. 
Stakeholder award scheme 
During 2011, the Group issued 309,280 restricted shares and 26,829 phantom shares to the empl oyees of the Group as part of the new 
Stakeholder award scheme. The scheme relates to the individual employees’ performance during the financial year ended 30 Apri l 2010 
for which a cash bonus accrual had been recognised. Subsequent to the year ended 30 Ap ril 2010 the reward was settled by the issue  
of equity instruments. 
The restricted shares and phantom shares had a vesting period spanning from the first day of the financial year to which they relate  
to the vest date of 1 August 2011. The restricted shares in the scheme were convertible into shares upon vest date and they were 
measured consistently with the treatment of normal restricted shares. The phantom shares in the scheme were only convertible to cash 
upon the vest date and they are measured based on the market value at the date of grant. 
Revenue 
Revenue is measured as the consideration received from customers and represents amounts received for services provided by the Group, 
as set out below. 
Exchange revenue arises from the Group’s betting exc hange activities. A commission is earned on each transaction and is recognised on 
the date the market for an event is settled. 
Sportsbook revenue represents the margin derived from betting activity on the Group’s fixed odds bookmaking product. Open bet ting 
liability positions are recognised based on the best estimate of the outflow that will be required to settle the position at the balance sheet 
date, and losses arising from these positions are recognised in revenue. This gives rise to a derivative financial instrument and is 
accounted for at fair value through profit and loss, as described in the Financial Instruments section on page 109. 
Gaming revenue can either represent the margin derived from betting activity between customers and the Group or, in rel ation to Poker 
and Exchange Games, the commission earned from customers. 
TVG revenue is derived from US pari -mutuel betting products (Advanced Deposit Wagering and Tote products) and represents a 
percentage of the stake recognised on settlement of the even t. 
Revenue also includes amounts received from the management and investment of customer funds. 
 Expenses 
(i) Cost of sales 
Cost of sales principally comprises betting and gaming taxes, customer payment transaction fees, sporting levies and other da ta  
rights charges. 
  
86 Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 87 
(ii) Operating lease payments 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight -line basis over the term of the lease.  
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term  
of the lease. 
Finance income and expense 
Finance income comprises interest earned on corporate funds invested, changes in the fai r value of financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss, and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement. Interest income is recognised as it accrues 
in the income statement, using the effective interest method. 
Finance expenses comprise changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss . 
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis, either in finance income or finance expense as appropriate. 
Tax 
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates  
to items recognised directly in equity (through other reserve), in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future ta xable profits will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time that the liability to pay th e related 
dividend is recognised. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial report ing purposes  
and the amounts used for tax purposes. 
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities  
that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combin ation; and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not rev erse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based o n the laws  
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate  
to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current 
tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities w ill be realised simultaneously. 
In determining the current and deferred tax the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether add itional 
taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years b ased on 
its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies o n estimates and 
assumptions and may involve a series of judgement s about future events. New information may become available that causes the 
Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities w ill impact tax expense 
in the period that such a determination is made. 
Operating segments 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incu r 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. 
Segment information is based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’ )  
in order to assess each segment’s performance and to a llocate resources. The CODM is the Executive Committee who monitors the 
financial and operational performance of the Group and allocates resources within the budgets agreed by the Board. 
Leases 
Under accounting standards there is a requirement for manageme nt to examine the buildings element within each property lease 
to determine if the lease meets the definition of a finance lease and, if so, it should be accounted for as such. This review in volves 
determining the fair value of each property at the inception of the lease and analysing the minimum lease payments between their ‘l and’ 
and ‘buildings’ elements. Based on management’s review of leases for the years ended 30 April 201 4 and 2013, all premises leases 
qualify as operating leases. 
Separately disclosed items 
Separately disclosed items are those items included within operating profit that the Group considers to be non- recurring or material in 
nature that should be brought to the reader’s attention in understanding the Group’s financial performance.  
The separate reporting of these items, which are disclosed within the relevant category in the income statement, helps provide a more 
accurate indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. 
  
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 87 1 Accounting policies continued 
Accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make estimates, judgements and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in th e period  
in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation 
uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts reco gnised 
in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes: 
Estimates 
Note 8 – Income tax 
Tax on profits is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations. Where the effect of these laws and regulations is unclear, 
estimates are used in determining the liability for t he tax to be paid on past profits which are recognised in the financial statements. 
Note 11 – Measurement of the recoverable amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets 
An impairment review has been performed of all goodwill and intangible assets held by the Group. The impai rment review is performed 
on a ‘value in use’ basis, which requires estimation of future net operating cash flows, the time period over which they will occur, an 
appropriate discount rate and an appropriate growth rate. 
Note 14 – Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent management’s best estimate in determining the amounts to be recognised. When assessing 
the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, consideration is given to the timing and level of future taxable income. 
Note 20 – Measurement of share-based payments 
Estimation and judgement is required in determining the fair value of shares at the date of award. The fair value is estimated using 
valuation techniques which take into account the award ’s term, the risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility of the market 
price of shares of the Group. 
Judgements 
Note 1 – Basis of consolidation 
Judgement is applied when determining if an acquired entity is controlled by the Group, and whether the acquired entity meets the 
criteria to be defined as a subsidiary. Control is presumed to exist when the Group owns, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more 
than half of the voting power of an entity. However, if the Group owns half or less of the voting power of an entity, control may still 
exist. In assessing control, the Group considers whether it has the ability to control on a legal or contractual basis rather than whether 
that control is actually exercised.  
Note 5 – Separately disclosed items 
Judgement has been used by management to identify items that are material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature. Separately 
disclosed items are those items included within operating profit that the Group considers to be non-recurring or material in nature that 
should be brought to the reader’s attention in understanding the Group’s financial performance.  
Valuation of tax provisions 
Judgement and estimation is required to interpret international tax laws and the way that they interact within each ju risdiction, in order 
to identify and value provisions in relation to gaming taxes as applicable. In addition to gaming taxes, judgement is required i n relation 
to international tax laws including transfer pricing and controlled foreign companies. 
Business combinations 
Judgement and estimation is required in the identification and valuation of separable assets and liabilities on acquisitions. In particular,  
in the identification and valuation of separable intangible assets and determining appropriate useful economic lives for these assets,  
and also in determining contingent consideration payable in respect of acquisitions where required by the terms of the agreem ent.

Future accounting developments 
The following new standards, interpretations and amendment s were issued by the IASB or the IFRIC but were not effective for  
the financial year (and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU):  
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
• IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ 
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ 
• IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory Deferral Accounts’ 
• revision to IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ 
• revision to IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ 
• amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, ‘Joint Arrangements’ and ‘Disclosure of Interests 
in Other Entities: Transition Guidance’ 
• amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27, ‘Investment Entities’ 
• amendments to IAS 32 ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’ 
• amendments to IAS 36 ‘Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets’ 
• amendments to IAS 39 ‘Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting ’. 
The Directors have decided not to early adopt the above standards and they do no t expect that the adoption of the standards listed 
above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods. 
There are no other IFRSs or IFRICs in issue but not yet effective that are expected to have a si gnificant impact for the Group. 
2 Operating segments  
The Group’s continuing operating businesses are organised and managed as reportable business segments according to the inform ation  
which is used by the Group’s CODM in making decisions about reporting matters. 
Following the disposal of LMAX in the year ended 30 April 2013, the segment previously disclosed as Other Investments now only 
comprises Betfair US. 
As a result, management considers that it is more appropriate to provide segmental disclosures as follows: 
• Betfair excl. US 
− Exchange 
− Sportsbook 
− Gaming 
− Management of customer funds 
• Betfair US. 
Exchange consists of the Exchange sports betting product and includes Timeform. Sports book (previously described as Sports) consists 
of the Sportsbook product and Multiples. Gaming consists of various Casino products and bespoke Exchange games products. Tradefair 
Spreads and Poker are also classified within Gaming. All of these gaming activities are played by customers in a number of ge ographical 
areas.  
Exchange and Gaming meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8 as reportable segments. While Sportsbook and revenue from  
the Management of customer funds do not meet these requirements , these segments are separately disclosed as they are closely  
monitored by the CODM. 
Betfair US (including the TVG Network) meets the quantitative threshold to be disclosed separately.

The results of the Australian joint venture are consolidated in the Group accounts on an equity accounting basis. As such only the net 
assets and the share of profits/(losses) are presented in the operating segment note below. If proportional consolidation was applied the 
Group’s share of the Australian joint venture would have increased revenue by £ 15.4m (30 April 2013: £18.0m) and decreased EBITDA 
by £0.1m (30 April 2013: increase of £2.1m). 
The revenue from Exchange, Sportsbook, Gaming and the Management of customer funds represents the developed and integrated 
parts of the Group’s business and has been grouped together as Betfair excl. US.  
The Group focuses its internal management reporting predominantly on revenue, as the products’ potential to generate revenue is the 
chief driver of the Group’s business and the allocation of resources. The Group’s cost base is to a large extent fixed in nature. Corporate 
expenses, assets and liabilities cannot be allocated to individual operating segments and are not used by the CODM for making operating 
and resource allocation decisions. However, expenses are allocated and reviewed by the CODM between Betfair excl. US and Betfair US 
and the analysis of EBITDA for them is summarised below. 
Management also reviews Group revenue on a geographic basis, determined by the location of the customers. This information is 
analysed below on the following basis: 
• UK 
• Rest of World. 
The majority of the Group’s non -current assets are located in the UK.

In prior years, revenue was recorded and disclosed on a registration basis. The CODM believes it is more reliable to assess t he 
performance of the Group’s operations by analysing revenue on a residency basis following regulatory changes in a number of 
jurisdictions. Comparatives for the year ended 30 April 2013 have therefore been restated accordingly. Revenue derived from  
customers located in Ireland is classified within UK.

The Group’s consolidated effective tax rate for the year was 16.5 % (30 April 2013: 8.5%). 
The tax effect of separately disclosed items and impairment in the year amounted to £nil (30 April 2013: tax credit of £10.4m).  
The 2013 Budget on 25 March 2013 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 20% by 2015. A reduction in the 
rate from 24% to 23% (effective from 1 April 2013) was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012, and further reductions to 21% 
(effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. 
This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax liability at 30 April 2014 has been calculated based

Basic earnings per share 
The calculation of basic earnings per share for the year ended 30 April 201 4 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary 
shareholders of £51.0m (30 April 2013: loss of £66.3m) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding of 
103,975,695 (30 April 2013: 101,854,246). The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted for amounts held 
by the Group’s EBT. 
* The loss per share calculations in the prior year include the results of the discontinued operations.  
Please see page 75 for the disclosure of basic and diluted earnings per share for the con tinuing operations of the Group for the year 
ended 30 April 2013. All earnings in the current year relate to continuing operations.  
Diluted earnings per share 
The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended 30 April 201 4 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary 
shareholders of £51.0m (30 April 2013: loss of £66.3m) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after 
adjustment for the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares of 106,019,686 (30 April 2013: 103,378,698). 
As any potential ordinary shares would have the effect of decreasing the loss per share for the year ended 30 April 2013, the y have not  
been treated as dilutive.  
Profit/(loss) used to determine diluted earnings/(loss) per share 
Weighted average number of shares (diluted) 
The average market value of the Company’s shares of £9.89 (2013: £7.33) was used to calculate the dilutive effect of share options 
based on the market value for the year that the options were outstanding.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 
Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 97 11 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued 
In the year ended 30 April 2013, the Group capitalised development expenditure amounting to £1.5 m, incurred amortisation of £1.9m 
and impaired assets amounting to £6.2m in respect of the discontinued operations.  
Goodwill 
At 30 April 2014, the carrying amount of goodwill, after the impairment review, was £ 18.9m (2013: £20.5m) allocated across one 
(2013: one) CGU as follows: 
All goodwill is recorded in local currency. Additions are converted at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and the goodwill 
at the end of the year is stated at closing exchange rates. 
Impairment testing 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at each reporting date by comparing the carrying amounts of these assets with their 
recoverable amounts. Where the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are considered as 
not impaired. 
No impairment charges were incurred in the year ended 30 April 2014 (2013: £34.6m) . The TVG CGU is the assets and operations 
of the TVG Network, which is included in the Group’s Betfair US operating segment as disclosed in note 2. 
Testing is carried out by allocating the carrying value of these assets to CGUs and determining the recover able amounts of those CGUs 
through value in use calculations. The calculation is based on projecting future pre -tax cash flows over a five year period and uses a 
terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter. The terminal value is calcula ted using a perpetuity model, which reflects 
the expected long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates. 
The budgets for the next financial year, which are subject to Board approval, form the basis of the cash flow projections fo r each CGU. 
Cash flow projections for the next four financial years reflect manageme nt’s expectations of the medium-term operating performance of 
the CGUs and growth prospects in each CGU ’s markets and regions, and have been modelled in line with historic patterns experienced 
by the Group in recent years, where relevant. Growth rates used do not exceed expectations of long-term growth in the local market.  
A discount factor is applied to obtain a ‘value in use’ which is the recoverable amount, unless the fair value less costs to sell the 
respective CGU is an amount in excess of the ‘value in use’. The discount rate is estimated by the Group using a range of equ ity costs 
for similar companies and external market data, with samples chosen where applicable from the same markets or territories as the CGU. 
The calculation of value in use for goodwill is sensitive to the following key assumptions: 
(i) Operating cash flow 
One of the key drivers of operating cash flow is revenue as the calculation of the recoverable amount of TVG goodwill is sensitive to 
future developments in US horseracing. The 2015 revenue figures for the CGU are based on the budget for the next financial year. For 
the years 2016 to 2019, the likely organic growth rates were assessed for each region in the CGU, taking account of past experience, 
growth prospects in regions and historic player patterns. The terminal growth rate used was nil% (2013: 2.0%). The management 
consider the assumed growth rate to be very conservative.  
(ii) Discount rate applied 
The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre- tax rate that reflects the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the 
risks specific to the CGU. 
For the TVG CGU, a pre-tax discount rate of 12.5% (2013: 12.5%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows for that CGU.  
As discussed on page 23, the TVG business performed positively during the financial year. As a result, there are no reasonable changes 
in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of the CGU to exceed the recoverable amount.

Impairment charges in respect of the year ended 30 April 2013 
Goodwill 
Impairment charges of £34.6m were recognised in the year ended 30 April 2013 in relation to goodwill. These charges arose as a result 
of changes to the strategic direction of the business following the appointment of new management.  
In prior periods, goodwill was allocated to the following CGUs in li ne with Group’s previous segmental reporting: 
• Sports 
• Games 
• Poker 
• TVG. 
As a result of the changes in the strategic direction, it was considered necessary to monitor goodwill at a more granular lev el and 
therefore the carrying value of goodwill was assessed with reference to the original business that was acquired. 
The table below sets out each relevant acquisition, the CGU to which the goodwill was previously assigned, the impairment cha rge 
recorded and the new reportable segment following the new organisati onal structure to which the impairment relates: 
The change in strategic direction of the Group meant that zero or negative cash flows were anticipated in respect of Timeform, Betfair 
TV, TSE Development Romania and Poker Champs. No discount rate was applied to these cash flows as the impact of any discount rate 
would be immaterial as the value in use was deemed £n il. 
Following regulatory developments in the US, management also underto ok a strategic review of the US market and TVG’s position 
within that market. As a result of this review, the TVG CGU was impaired by £13.6m. The key changes to assumptions since the 
previous impairment test related to an anticipated reduction in operating margins and future growth rates. A pre-tax discount rate of 
12.5% was used. 
Development expenditure and software 
As part of the strategic review conducted in the year ended 30 April 2013, management also performed a detailed review of the carrying 
value of capitalised development costs. Those projects which were no longer in use as part of the change in the strategic direction were 
impaired resulting in a charge of £47.0m. This charge included the impairment of the development costs incurred in building t he US 
Exchange (£10.4m) and the LMAX Exchange (£6.2m). The charge in respect of LMAX was included within the loss from discontinued 
operations as a result of the LMAX sale (see note 27). The remaining £30.4m impairment charge related to specific projects wh ere the 
anticipated returns no longer supported the carrying value as a result of the change in strategic focus of the business. 
Following a review of the carrying value of the Group’s software assets, an impairment charge of £5.1m was also recorded in t he year 
ended 30 April 2013 as a result of the change in strategic direction .

The Employee Benefit Trust held 1,515,096 ordinary shares in the Company as at 30 April 201 4 (30 April 2013: 2,640,497). 
The total fully diluted shares as at 30 April 2014 was 107,077,765 (30 April 2013: 107,500,314). 
Other reserves 
Other reserves mainly comprise tax directly recognised in equity. 
Translation reserve 
The foreign currency translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences on the revaluation of foreign currency en tities and 
long-term foreign currency balances considered to be quasi-equity in nature. 
20 Share-based payments 
The Group had the following share-based payment schemes in operation during the year: 
(a) Share option plans 
(b) Save-As-You-Earn (‘SAYE’) share option schemes 
(c) Restricted share scheme 
(d) Long Term Incentive Plan, Deferred Share Incentive Plan, Short Term Incentive Plan and Management Incentive Plan 
(e) Senior Executives’ Incentive Plan 
(f) Stakeholder shares scheme. 
As at 30 April 2014, 2,089,435 share options and restricted shares (2013: 3,278,704) in the capital of the Group remain outstanding 
and are exercisable up to 30 April 202 4. 
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised an expense in respect of all share -based awards granted after 7 November 2002  
that had not vested as at 30 April 2006. The total expense recognised in respect of these schemes was £ 6.5m (excluding Employers’ 
National Insurance costs) for the year ended 30 April 201 4 (30 April 2013: £8.5m). Employers’ National Insurance costs amount 
to £0.8m (30 April 2013: £0.8m). 
The fair value of the options (S hare option plans and SAYE share option schemes) is determined using the Black -Scholes  
option pricing model. The expected term used in the model is based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non -
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
The expected dividend yield and volatility was calculated based on the historical yield and historical volatility of the Comp any since initial 
listing on the London Stock Exchange.

(a) Share option plans 
Under the Group’s share option plans, options may be granted to the Directors and employees to purchase ordinary shares. No 
consideration is payable on the grant of an option. Options typically vest over a period of four years and the term of the op tions may 
not exceed ten years. Share options are granted under a service condition. There are no market conditions associated with the share 
option grants. Options vest subject to continued employment although certain employees may be given extended vesting dates af ter 
their employment ceases. 
855,014 options were exercisable under this scheme as at 30 April 201 4 (2013: 1,293,384). 
The weighted average exercise price for share options exercised during the year is £ 4.77 (2013: £4.35) at a weighted average share 
price at the date of exercise of £9.51 (2013: £7.58). 
The fair value of the opt ions is expensed over the period that the options vest. The following assumptions were used in the Black -
Scholes pricing model for these options: 
There were no options granted under the share option plan during the year ended 30 April 2014 (2013: 10,036). The weighted average 
fair value of the awards granted during the year ended 30 April 2013 under the share option plan at the date of grant was £5.05. 
The expense recognised in the income statement (excluding Employers’ National Insuran ce costs) was a charge of £ nil (2013: credit 
of £0.1m). 
The Group provides for National Insurance contributions, where necessary, on options which were granted to certain employees  
on or after 6 April 1999 under its unapproved share option schemes. The charge is based on the expected timing of future exer cises  
of the share options and the market value of the underlying shares expected at those dates in those cases where the liability has not  
been passed onto the employee. 
(b) Save-As-You-Earn  (‘SAYE’) share option schemes 
The Group operates an HMRC approved SAYE share option scheme in which all UK employees and some international employees  
can participate. Participants save a fixed amount of up to £250 per month for three years and are then able to use these savi ngs  
to buy shares in the Group at a price fix ed at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period. There are  
no market conditions associated with the SAYE option grants. 
The SAYE options must ordinarily be exercised within six months of completing the relevant savings period, and are satisfied through  
the issue of new shares. In line with market practice, the exercise of these options is not subject to any performance condit ion.

following assumptions: 
There were 231,173 SAYE options granted during the year ended 30 April 2014 (30 April 2013: nil). The weighted average fair value

introduction of the Long Term Incentive Plan, Deferred Share Incentive Plan, Short Term Incentive Plan and Management Incentive Plan. 
Refer to note 20(d). 
Awards made under the terms of the restricted share s scheme plan prior to 2010 have vested. 
In January 2012, the Group modified certain outstanding share options and replaced them with re stricted shares on a 3:1 basis. 
These were expensed over the remaining vesting period of the originally granted share options. 
A number of individuals were granted restricted shares in the current and prior periods. These have a range of vesting periods of  
up to three years from the first day of the award to which they relate and one-third of the shares will vest each year for three years. 
Restricted shares are valued with reference to the market value of the shares on the date of grant. 
The weighted average exercise price for share options exercised during t he year was £0.001 (2013: £0.001) at a weighted average 
share price at the date of exercise of £ 9.94 (2013: £7.87). 
The total expense recognised in the income statement related to the restricted shares (excluding Employers’ National Insurance cos ts)  
was £1.4m (2013: £2.8m). 
The Employers’ National Insurance costs amounted to £ 0.2m (2013: £0.3m).

(d) Long Term Incentive Plan, Deferred Share Incentive Plan, Short Term Incentive Plan and Management Incentive Plan 
The following shares were introduced t o incentivise and reward for the successful delivery of the short- term and long-term 
business strategy: 
• Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) which consists of share options and restricted share awards; 
• Short Term Incentive Plan (‘STIP’) which consists of cash and restricted share awards ;  
• Management Incentive Plan (‘MIP’) which consists of cash and restricted share awards; and 
• Deferred Share Incentive Plan (‘DSIP’) which consists of cash an d restricted share awards. 
The schemes have awards in the form of cash, share options and restricted shares. Determining the fair value of each element is 
consistent with the measurement outlined above in each share -based payment category. The level of awa rd granted in each of the 
schemes is based on a mixture of the individual performance of the employee and the Group wide performance over the term of t he 
award which is between one and three years. 
The weighted average exercise price for share options exercised during t he year was £0.001 (2013: £0.001) at a weighted average 
share price at the date of exercise of £9.71 (2013: £7.38). 
The fair value of the share options in the LTIP scheme is expensed over the three year period that the options vest. No grants were  
awarded in the current year which included option elements. The following assumptions were used in the B lack-Scholes pricing model  
for options conditionally granted in the year ended 30 April 2012 : 
The STIP and the MIP have cash elements which are fixed in value and are paid and expensed in the first year that the awards are 
issued. The cash award represents two -thirds of the total award. There is no option given to elect to have these issued in shares. 
The cash element issued is classified as a cash bonus in the income statement and not a ‘ cash settled share-based payment’ on the 
basis that the employee does not have the option to choose whether they receive cash or shares. 
The restricted shares in the LTIP, DSIP, STIP and MIP are measured consistently with the treatment of normal restricted shares. 
The restricted shares in the LTIP scheme vest at the end of the third year. Th e vesting period of the STIP, MIP and DSIP restricted 
shares vest over the second and third year of the scheme. 
An expense of £4.7m for the options and restricted shares has been re cognised (excluding Employers’ National Insurance costs) which  
is management’s best estimate of the charge in respect of these awards for the current year (201 3: £4.3m). The cash element of the 
scheme has been included in the bonus cash pool for the performance year ended 30 April 201 4. 
The Employers’ National Insurance costs amounted to £0.6m (2013: £0.5m). 
(e) Senior Executives’ Incentive Plan 
The long-term Senior Executives’ Incentive Plan (‘SEIP’) was approved by the Board on 16 October 2007. The plan entailed certain 
senior management and Directors being granted one-off awards consisting of a cash and restricted shares element. The scheme came 
into effect upon the admission of the Group’s shares on the London Stock Exchange , and the cash was paid on the date of admission 
to the participants in the scheme. Th e restricted shares were granted on the date of admission and half will vest on the first anniversary 
of the listing and the next half on the second anniversary of the listing subject to continued employment. 
The restricted shares in the SEIP are measured consistently with the treatment of normal restricted shares. 
The expense recognised (excluding Employers’ National Insurance costs) was £ nil (2013: £0.6m). The Employers’ National Insurance 
costs amounted to £nil (2013: £0.1m).

to the vest date of 1 August 2011. The restricted shares in the scheme are convertible into shares upon vest date and they ar e measured 
consistently with the treatment of normal restricted shares. The phantom shares in the scheme are only convertible to cash up on the

(a) Fair values of financial instruments 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than 
quoted prices included within level 1. 
Trade and other receivables 
The fair value of trade and other receivables is valued at fair value less any provision for bad debts. The fa ir value is estimated using the 
present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date if the effect is material. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates to book value d ue to its short-term maturity. 
Trade and other payables and amounts owed to joint ventures 
The fair value of trade and other payables and amounts owed to joint ventures is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, 
discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments comprise sports betting open positions. The fair value of open sports bets at the year end has been 
calculated using the latest available prices on the Group’s own markets on relevant sporting events. The fair value calculation also 
includes the impact of any exchange hedging activities in relation to these open positions.  
The table below sets out fair value measurements using the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy: 
 
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fai r value 
measurement of the relevant asset as follows: 
Level 1 – valued using quoted prices in acti ve markets for identical assets 
Level 2 – valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 
Level 3 – valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not b ased on observable market data. 
There have been no transfers during t he year between levels 1 and 2. 
The fair value of open bet liabilities are classified as level 2 in the hierarchy using observable inputs other than quoted p rices. The 
principal assumptions relate to anticipated gross win margins on unsettled bets with the fair value determined by future sporting results. 
(b) Financial risk management 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framewor k.  
Risk management policies and procedures are reviewed regularly and monitored to reflect changes in market conditions and the  
Group’s activities. 
The Group aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their r oles and 
obligations surrounding risk management. 
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: 
• Liquidity risk 
• Market risk including currency risk and interest risk 
• Credit risk. 
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to the above risks as well as outlining the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing financial risk and the measurement of capital.

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities wh en due, under both 
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group also 
spreads its cash reserves across several highly rated banks and investments to mitigate counterparty risks. 
The Group performs regular cash flow projections to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses  
for a period of at least 90 days. The Group has no committed lines of credit. 
The Group’s financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the effect of netting agreements summarised in the 
table below, all have contractual maturities of one year or less as at 30 April 2014. 
The maturity analysis of the financial liabilities is as follows: 
30 April 2014 
30 April 2013 
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates , will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings in financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market 
risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. 
The management of market risk is performed by the Group under the supervision of the Corporate Risk Committee and according t o the 
guidelines approved by them. The Group will utilise hedges where there is an identified requirement to manage profit or loss volatility. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than Pounds Sterling (GBP).  
The currencies in which these transacti ons primarily are denominated are US Dollars (USD), Euros (EUR) and Australian Dollars (AUD).

The Group does not normally hedge against these sales and purchases. However, the Group monitors all foreign currency exposures 
and where appropriate may undertake currency hedging to mitigate the risk of unfavourable foreign exchange movements on specific 
commitments the Group enters into. 
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows. This is based on the carrying amount for monetary financial inst ruments 
except derivatives when it is based on notional amounts:

Sensitivity analysis 
A 15.0% weakening of Pounds Sterling against the following currencies at 30 April would have increased/(decreased) equity and income 
statement by the amounts shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had b een 
applied to risk exposures existing at that date. 
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates, remain constant. 
A 15.0% strengthening of Pounds Sterling against the following currencies at 30 April 2014 would have had the equal but opposite 
effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group has no bank loans and therefore is not exposed to interest rate risk on its liabilities . At the balance sheet date the Group’s 
interest-bearing financial assets were as follows:  
Sensitivity analysis 
An increase of 200 and a decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would have increased/(decre ased) 
equity and profit by the amounts shown below. The rationale behind the 2.0% sensitivity analysis is that interest rates in th e UK have 
been low due to the economic climate and any increase or decrease greater than 2.0% is unlikely to occur. This calculation as sumes 
that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers the effec t of financial 
instruments with variable interest rates. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 201 3. 
Credit risk 
Credit/counterparty risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument f ails to meet  
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investments. 
Group treasury policy and objectives in relation to credit risk is to minimise the likelihood that the Group will experience financial loss due  
to counterparty failure and to ensure that in the event of a single loss, the failure of any single counterparty would not materially impact  
the financial wellbeing of the Group. 
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only depositing surplus funds on a short- term basis. The ring-fenced customer funds held  
by the Group in trust are spread across leading banki ng groups with the main aim of reducing risk as opposed to maximising income. 
As of 30 April 2014, the trade receivables balance was £2.2m (2013: £2.2m) of which £1.3m is current and £0.9m is past due. 
An amount of £0.3m (2013: £0.7m) of the gross trade receivable balance has been provided for.  
Exposure to credit risk 
The carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Therefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk  
at the balance sheet date was £ 217.4m (2013: £174.2m) being the total of the carrying amount of the financial assets excluding equity 
investments, shown in note 22(a). 
Capital management 
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of th e parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 1 9. 
The Group regularly monitors capital on the basis of gross cash (defined as cash and cash equivalents) which was £209.8m at 30 April 
2014 (30 April 2013: £168.1m). The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor and creditor confidence 
and to sustain future development of the business. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital 
structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Group finances its operations through retained earnings and the management of working 
capital and has sufficient capital for its needs. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. As discussed in the Chairman’s Statement on page 4, the Board targets 
a progressive and sustainable dividend and continues to consider the appropriate payout ratio to be approximately 40% of profit after 
tax in the medium term. 
23 Operating leases  
The Group had total future minimum payments under non-cancellable operating leases as follows: 
Operating lease payments represent rents payable by the Group for office properties. These leases have varying terms, escalation 
charges and renewal rights. 
During the year £5.7m was recognised as an expense in the income statement in r espect of operating leases (2013: £8.7m).

Returns to shareholders in respect of the financial years ended 30 April 2011, 2012 and 2013 
The Company has paid a final dividend for the year ended 30 April 2011 and interim and final dividends for the years ended 30 April 
2012 and 2013 (the ‘Dividends’). The Company has recently been advised that, as a result of certain changes to the technical guidance 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accounts in England and Wales (the ‘ICAEW’) in October 2010, the Company did not have sufficient 
distributable reserves to make those distributions and so they should not have been paid by the Company to its shareholders. 
In addition, certain purchases of ordinary shares made by the Company in the year ended 30 April 2012 (the ‘Purchases of Ordinary 
Shares’) were not effectively carried out because, although the purchases had been approved by shareholders, the Company did not 
have sufficient distributable reserves for the reasons stated above. These purchases of 6,506,009 ordinary shares of £0.001 each were 
made at prices of between £5.76 and £9.00 per share. 
At all relevant times, sufficient distributable reserves would have been available in the Company had its subsidiary undertakings passed up 
distributable profits to the Company through distributions from those subsidiary undertakings’ own distributable reserves. 
The Directors consider that it is in the best interests of the Company to take the necessary steps to regularise this positio n, since 
shareholders received the dividends they were intended to receive, the Company purchased the shares it intended to purchase and the 
Company clearly would not wish to take any action it could technically take against the relevant shareholders to recover any amounts in 
connection with the Dividends and Purchases of Ordinary Shares. 
The Company has therefore entered into deed polls to discharge any current or former shareholder of the Company that received a 
Dividend or tendered shares under the Company ’s programme of market purchases from any obligation to repay any amount to the 
Company in connection with the Dividends and Purchases of Ordinary Shares.  
Furthermore, a special resolution is proposed, numbered 18 and set out in the notice of the Annual General Meeting, to cancel and 
extinguish the ordinary shares concerned. Subject to obtaining the requisite consent at the Annual General Meeting, the Company 
intends to seek the confirmation of the Court for the cancellation and reduction described above, as required by the Companie s Act 
2006. Shareholders will not need to take any further action in this respect. 
An appropriation has already been made from the distributable reserve position of the Company for the total purchase cost in respect of 
the ordinary shares concerned. This is similar to th e accounting treatment had the purported purchases been made on the appropriate 
basis and such a transfer has been reflected in the Company ’s financial statements with no recognition of the sums recoverable. The 
Directors believe the legal position will be rectified promptly following the Annual General Meeting. 
27 Disposals and discontinued operations  
On 18 December 2012 the Group entered into a sale and purchase agreement for the sale of 67% of the shares of LMAX Limited  
for £2.4m. The transaction was finalised in January 2013, on which date control of LMAX Limited passed to the acquirer .  
The net assets of LMAX Limited at the date of disposal were:

were as follows: 
The Group incurred no profit or loss from discontinued operations in the year ended 30 April 2014. 
During the year ended 30 April 2013, LMAX Limited contributed £5.2m to the Group’s net operating cash flows and paid £2.8m in 
respect of investing activities. 
28 Contingent liabilities  
In obtaining a licence to operate in New Jersey, the Group has paid and committed to pre pay a revenue share to a third party which 
is contingent on that third party meeting specific requirements. As at 30 April 2014, the Group deems the fulfilment of these criteria 
as uncertain. In the event that the payment was to crystallise, there would be no significant impact on the profitability of the Group.

1 Company accounting policies 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relat ion  
to the Company’s financial statements. 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost accounting rules and in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards in the United Kingdom (UK). 
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and 
loss account. 
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds 
that a parent undertaking includes the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements. The Company reported a profit 
for the financial year ended 30 April 201 4 of £264.8m (2013: £0.9m loss).  
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary as sets and  
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains  
or losses on translation are included in the consolidated profit and loss account. 
Share-based payments 
The Group’s share option plans and restricted shares scheme allows employees to acquire shares in the Betfair Group. The fair value 
of these schemes is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity, with the exception of cash settle d 
transactions which result in a corresponding increase in other creditors. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the 
period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to participate in the scheme and is calculated using an opt ion 
pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest. 
Restricted shares are valued with reference to the market value of the shares on the date of grant. They have a vesting period  
of three years from the first day of the financial year to which they relate and one-third of the shares will vest each year for three years. 
All cash settled share-based payments are recorded as a liability and revalued at the market value at the balance sheet date with the 
difference taken to the profit and loss account, except where the cash component is fixed. 
The Company has recognised an increase in investments corresponding to the FRS 20 Share -based payment charge in respect  
of awards to employees of subsidiary companies. 
Cash and liquid resources 
Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any prov ision for impairment. 
Treasury share transactions 
The Company has recognised an increase in in vestments corresponding to the FRS 20 Share-based payment charge. 
Director and employee remuneration 
The Company had no employees other than the Directors during the current or prior year. 
The remuneration paid to Directors for services to the Company during the year was paid and accounted for by another entity  
within the Group. Details of the Directors’ remuneration is discussed in the Directors’ Remuneration Rep ort on pages 50 to 67.

Chairman’s statement
Dear shareholder ,
Smith & Nephew made good progress in 2012, both 
financially and strategically, as we delivered on our 
commitments to reshape the Company. 
Our underlying revenues were up 2% to $4,137m, with 
reported revenue reflecting the successful transaction 
to create Bioventus. Trading profit was up 6% underlying 
at $965m, giving an 80 basis points increase in trading 
profit margin, which was up at 23.3%. Free cash flow, at 
$637m, was again healthy, demonstrating the vitality of 
our business.
This performance shows the effects of the major strategic 
programme announced last year to make Smith & 
Nephew fit and effective for the future. Throughout the 
year we made great progress driving efficiencies and 
liberating resources. This has allowed us to invest to 
realise the opportunities we see in our higher growth 
markets and sectors. 
We have achieved all this and maintained our commitment 
to health and safety, ethics and the environment. 
Enhanced returns for shareholders
Our financial strength – and confidence in continued 
strategic progress – enabled the Board to review the 
dividend policy during the year. 
As a result, we increased the level of the Interim Dividend 
payment by 50% to 9.9¢ per share. The Board is pleased 
to propose a Final Dividend for the year of 16.2¢ per share, 
also up 50% on 2011. We intend to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy going forward.
Board changes
We were very pleased that Julie Brown joined us as Chief 
Financial Officer in February 2013. She brings top-level 
financial expertise, commercial experience and a deep 
knowledge of the healthcare sector. Julie replaces Adrian 
Hennah who left with our very best wishes and thanks for 
his significant contribution to Smith & Nephew. 
We have also welcomed two new Non-Executive Directors 
during 2012. Ajay Piramal is one of India’s most impressive 
businessmen and Baroness Bottomley brings a wealth of 
experience from her successful career across both private 
and public sectors. We said farewell to Rolf Stomberg and 
Geneviève Berger, who we also thank for their valuable 
input.
In April, we shall welcome Michael Friedman to our 
Board who is renowned for his US healthcare expertise, 
in particular gained leading the prestigious City of Hope 
cancer institution in California. 
Thank you
My Board colleagues and I visited a number of our global 
sites during the year. We welcome these opportunities to 
meet our employees, and would like to thank everyone at 
Smith & Nephew for their continued dedication to serving 
our customers.
We are also fortunate to meet and hear from shareholders 
regularly, both institutional and private. Your support and 
feedback are both appreciated, and continue to inform 
our thinking. 
Smith & Nephew is evolving. We are already seeing the 
material benefits of our choices and actions. There is 
much more to come and we look forward to continuing 
to build ever more value for you into the future.
Sir John Buchanan
Chairman
“ Our financial strength – and confidence in continued  
strategic progress – enabled the Board to review the  
dividend policy during the year.”

Chief Executive Officer’s review of strategy
Our strategy
Smith & Nephew’s strategic priorities are about making 
choices for the long term benefit of the Group, delivering 
higher returns to shareholders than its peer group.
1
Established markets
In Established markets (US, Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand 
and Canada), Smith & Nephew sees opportunities to build upon 
existing strong positions, to win market share through greater 
innovation and drive efficiencies to liberate resources. Through 
these actions the Group seeks to meet the challenges of subdued 
markets and maximise both revenue growth and profit margins.
2
Emerging and 
International markets
Smith & Nephew believes it can secure market leadership 
in the Emerging markets, building upon its initial success in 
China and expanding to create sustainable businesses in 
India, Brazil and Russia. In particular, the Group sees significant 
opportunities to build value through augmenting its existing portfolio 
with new products specifically designed for, and manufactured in, 
these markets.
3
Innovate for value
The Group’s future success depends upon continuing to offer 
new technologies and innovative business models to customers 
around the world. Smith & Nephew is accelerating its rate of 
innovation by increasing the research & development budget 
and identifying and investing in the projects that will deliver 
maximum value.
4
Simplify and improve 
our operating model
Smith & Nephew will work to ensure the business structure and 
processes support our innovation agenda, and the Group seeks  
to maximise efficiency in everything it does. There are opportunities 
to streamline the Group’s operations and manufacturing processes 
and to remove duplication. Smith & Nephew is building strong 
global functions – human capital, regulatory, quality, compliance, 
sustainability, finance and legal affairs – to support its 
management teams in their quest to serve the Group’s markets 
and customers better.
5
Supplement organic 
growth through 
acquisitions
The Group aims to augment its organic growth through acquisitions. 
Smith & Nephew will continue with its successful strategy of 
acquiring complementary technologies, seek to support our 
Emerging markets ambitions by acquiring local manufacturing  
and distribution businesses and remain alert to larger opportunities 
to support expansion in attractive sectors, such as advanced 
woundcare, extremities or minimally invasive surgery.

9 Section 2 Strategy and performance
Dear Shareholder ,
In August 2011, we announced an ambitious set of 
Strategic Priorities to make Smith & Nephew stronger, 
faster growing, better balanced and fit and effective for 
the future. Across the Group we are implementing this 
programme. We are investing in higher-growth products, 
franchises and geographies and adapting our commercial 
models and cost structure.
Emerging markets
In the Emerging markets we are delivering strong revenue 
growth, benefitting from our investments to strengthen the 
management team and sales force, and the successful 
registration of more of our existing products for sale. 
Our strategy is to build upon this platform by expanding 
our distribution capability and delivering portfolios for the 
mid-tier segments. We will develop these through our own 
R&D, and by acquisition, and we expect to bring our first 
products to market in 2013. 
We are also investing to ensure that all employees and 
third party representatives follow our Code of Conduct and 
local requirements. We have, what I believe to be, a world-
class compliance programme. Sharing this expertise is 
integral to building a sustainable business everywhere we 
operate. 
Investing for growth
In the Established markets we continue to successfully 
deliver a high rate of innovation. In 2012 we launched 
new hip, knee and trauma systems and more than 30 
advanced wound management products.  We increased 
our R&D budget, and expect to do so again in 2013. 
We are also putting more resources into our higher-growth 
franchises and geographies. In trauma and extremities 
our actions to refine the commercial model and build the 
sales force is delivering good results. In Japan we are 
strengthening our leadership position in advanced wound 
management following the launch of Negative Pressure 
Wound Therapy.  
These, and other investments like them, are possible 
because we are making Smith & Nephew more efficient. 
We generated annualised savings of around $100 million 
by the end of 2012 and are continuing to implement 
further improvements.  
Healthpoint Biotherapeutics
The acquisition of Healthpoint Biotherapeutics 
expands our platform by giving us a strong position in 
bioactives, the fastest growing area of advanced wound 
management. This perfectly complements our exudate 
and infection management and negative pressure 
expertise. The integration is proceeding to plan. 
Corporate social responsibility
Whilst working to transform Smith & Nephew, we have 
not lost sight of the importance of our social, ethical and 
environmental obligations. Our commitment to customers, 
patients, employees, shareholders and communities 
remains strong. In 2012 we again earned the distinction of 
being featured in both the FTSE4Good Index and the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Index. 
Delivering value 
In 2013 we are continuing to build, delivering efficiency 
improvements and accelerating investment – in our 
higher-growth portfolios, in geographic expansion, in 
more R&D and in further acquisitions. I am pleased at the 
progress we have made, excited about the opportunities 
that we see, and confident we will continue to deliver 
greater value for our company and stakeholders.

Established  
markets
Focused on success
Within the Established markets we have dedicated 
management teams in Advanced Surgical Devices and 
Advanced Wound Management who are focused on 
meeting the needs of our customers. 
The formation of the Advanced Surgical Devices division 
– created through the combination of our endoscopy 
and orthopaedics businesses – delivered benefits at a 
slightly faster rate than expected. This new structure has 
allowed us to better share the benefits of our experience 
and scale, whilst supporting the sales force in utilising 
their local market knowledge and relationships to secure 
and service customers in each and every market.

Emerging  
markets
New markets, new products
We have recruited experienced leadership to drive 
us into the Emerging markets and invested in new 
headquarters and infrastructure. 
Throughout 2012 we made progress registering and 
selling more of our existing products in our Emerging 
markets – with many new introductions across our 
franchises. 
We are also developing specific products for the 
middle tier in these countries, investing in determining

innovate  
for value
c entre of innovation
in April, we opened a new innovation c entre in 
Memphis, which we are using to deliver best-in-class 
surgeon training programmes. 
This is a world-class, multi-disciplinary facility (joint 
reconstruction, sports medicine and trauma) that 
allows surgeons from different specialties and 
locations to share learning and innovation. its 140-seat 
auditorium, five conference rooms, two classrooms 
and 17 labs have already hosted multiple groups of 
surgeons from around the world keen to experience 
the latest products and surgical techniques. 
Designed for r eal l ife
in June, we launched All Evy N l ife, a unique new 
foam dressing that extends our All Evy N family of 
foam products. This product innovation addresses the 
findings of new Smith & Nephew research into the real 
life concerns of patients living with wounds. 
ALLEVYN Life offers multiple benefits for the patient and 
clinician. These innovative features include: a change 
indicator to avoid unnecessary dressing changes; a 
hyper-absorbent core to prevent leakage of exudate; 
and masking to prevent patient embarrassment caused 
by visible exudate through the dressing. This is all 
combined with unique shapes to ensure better 
dressing retention and our ‘Gentle Border’ silicone 
adhesive to minimise pain at dressing change.

Efficient manufacturing
We have been successful in reducing our cost of goods 
to combat the effects of continued price pressure. in 
manufacturing, we have refined our footprint, especially 
in c hina. During 2012, the Group closed the old l inhe 
orthopaedic plant, moving it to our new facility in beijing 
ahead of schedule. We completed the extension to our 
Wound factory in Suzhou – on time and on budget – 
and have started equipping the plant.
The European process o ptimisation programme 
will rationalise and upgrade our commercial and 
IT platforms allowing us to drive efficiencies while 
better serving our customers.

Growth through 
acquisitions
Augment organic growth  
through acquisitions 
In December 2012 Smith & Nephew completed 
the acquisition of Healthpoint Biotherapeutics, 
a leader in bioactive debridement, dermal repair and 
regeneration wound care treatments, for $782m 
in cash. 
This acquisition had compelling strategic and financial 
rationale for Smith & Nephew. 
it gives us a strong position in bioactives, the fastest 
growing area of advanced wound management. it 
brought a complementary range of bioactive 
debridement, dermal repair and regeneration products 
led by c ollagenase SANTyl Ointment (‘SANTYL’), an 
enzymatic debrider for dermal ulcers and burns. it 
added an established R&D capability in next-generation 
bioactive therapies for the treatment of chronic wounds 
and will double our uS AWM sales and strengthen our 
commercial scale and capabilities. 
The combination creates a wound business which is 
unique – having leadership positions across exudate 
and infection management, negative pressure and 
bioactive wound care.

17 Section 2 Strategy and performance
Performance Why we measure Global outlook
Smith & Nephew businesses in the Established markets grew 
by 2% in the US and 1% in the Other Established markets, 
where a weak macro environment in Europe partially offset 
strong results in Japan and Australia.
 – By franchise, our performance relative to estimated global 
market growth was below in hip reconstruction, at market in 
knee reconstruction, sports medicine and trauma and above 
in advanced wound management
 – For more detail on the market and competition (see pages 19 
to 33)
Established markets for Smith 
& Nephew are the US, Europe, 
Japan, Australia, New Zealand 
and Canada. In these markets we 
expect the challenging economic 
conditions to continue, requiring 
realigned business models and 
focused investment.
 – Track the relative strength  
of our market positions
Emerging/International markets grew at 11%, exceeding 
Established markets rates and contributing over 40% of 
annual revenue growth for the Group. These geographies 
now represent 12% of the Group’s overall revenue.
During 2012:
 – China, successful model, revenues above $120m
 – Significant infrastructure, operational and talent investment
 – Refined new R&D model to develop mid-tier product portfolio
Emerging/International markets 
represent those outside of the 
Established markets including 
Brazil, China, India and Russia. 
The healthcare environment in 
these markets is rapidly expanding 
and with the right investments 
offers significant opportunities for 
the Group.
 – Track underlying growth  
of Emerging markets to global 
growth
 – Monitor progress in key 
market segments
R&D investment now represents 4.1% of revenue, an increase 
in spending of 2%. We have maintained our momentum of 
introducing new products:
 – Over 30 new AWM products launched
 – In ASD, extensions to our established LEGION knee and 
PERI-LOC plate ranges, a new Hip revision system and 
further innovation in sports medicine
 – Over 230 existing products now available for Emerging/
International markets
 – Innovation Centre opened in Memphis
Innovation offers the key to 
meeting the realities of healthcare 
and economic paradigm in both 
Established and Emerging markets. 
New products, technologies and 
surgical techniques hold the 
promise and potential of reducing 
the overall cost of healthcare.
 – Monitor the impact from 
innovation
 – Monitor the underlying 
investment in R&D
Trading profit grew by 6%, aided by targeted efficiency and 
cost initiatives, which offset market pressures and enabled 
continued targeted organic investments. Trading profit margin 
was 23.3%, an 80bps improvement. Key initiatives included:
 – On track to deliver $150m efficiency savings by end of 2014
 – Reorganisation of ASD and realignment of AWM
 – Refining our manufacturing footprint (expansion of the 
Suzhou facility; move and closure of Linhe plant, both in 
China)
 – Reduction in cost of goods
 – Reduction in energy use and increased waste recycling
By simplifying and improving our 
operating model we can liberate 
resources to invest in growth 
opportunities and meet the 
persistent price pressure. A simpler 
and more efficient organisation 
allows us to make faster and better 
decisions.
 – Track our underlying trading 
profit growth and trading 
profitability
 – Reduce the amount of energy 
and waste for the Group, our 
customers and the environment
2012 has been an active year from a business development 
perspective. We have invested in talent and capability, which 
has delivered several exciting opportunities including:
 – Acquisition of Healthpoint Biotherapeutics
 – Acquisition of complementary technology businesses 
(LifeModeler Inc, Kalypto Medical Inc, Aderma range of 
Dermal Pads)
 – Bioventus venture formed and divestment of Biologics 
and Clinical Therapies business
Acquisition and partnerships 
are important elements which 
supplement the organic investment 
and provide increased opportunity 
for high growth and value.
 – Monitor value created 
for shareholders

Smith & Nephew operates in a complex marketplace. 
Spending is heavily influenced by governments, who are 
seeking to balance the demands placed upon healthcare 
systems from long-term trends, such as ageing populations 
and obesity, with requirements to restrain budgets. Patients 
are becoming more discerning and demanding, and 
healthcare providers are increasingly making choices based 
on both clinical outcomes and cost. 
Smith & Nephew’s sales and marketing models reflect 
these factors. The Group invests in developing innovative 
products and services and in marketing these through 
the most appropriate direct or in-direct channels. Sales 
trends reveal a number of longer-term forces at work within 
our markets. The importance of government funding to 
our business remains and there is a need to meet ever 
more stringent regulation. Global manufacturing, supply 
and distribution operations seek to maximise their efficiency 
whilst supporting the sales and marketing process. 
Innovative new products are brought to market through 
highly focused research and development, and there is a 
robust policy of protecting intellectual property. The Group 
seeks to minimise the impact of currency on its business.
Sales and marketing
Smith & Nephew’s customers are the providers of medical and 
surgical services worldwide.
Competition exists among healthcare providers to gain patients on 
the basis of quality, service and price. Providers are under pressure 
to reduce the total cost of healthcare delivery. There has been some 
consolidation in the Group’s customer base, as well as amongst the 
Group’s competitors, and these trends are expected to continue in 
the long term. Smith & Nephew competes against both local and 
multinational corporations, including some with greater financial, 
marketing and other resources.
The Group’s business reflects a wide range of distribution channels, 
purchasing agents and buying entities in over 90 countries 
worldwide. The largest single customer worldwide is a purchasing 
group based in the UK that represented 6% of the Group’s worldwide 
revenue in 2012.
In certain parts of the world, including the UK, much of Continental 
Europe, Canada and Japan, the healthcare providers are largely 
government organisations funded by tax revenues. In the US, the 
Group’s major customers are public and private hospitals, which 
receive revenue from private health insurance and government 
reimbursement programmes. Medicare is the major source 
of reimbursement in the US, for knee and hip reconstruction 
procedures and for wound healing treatment regimes.
In the US, the Group’s products are marketed directly to healthcare 
providers, hospitals and other healthcare facilities with each 
business segment operating dedicated sales forces. The US 
sales forces consist of a mixture of independent contract workers 
and employees. Sales agents are contractually prohibited from 
selling products that compete with Smith & Nephew products. Our 
Advanced Surgical devices are principally shipped and invoiced 
to healthcare providers, hospitals and other healthcare facilities. 
Certain Advanced Wound Management products are shipped 
and invoiced to wholesale distributors and others are consigned 
to distributors that lease the devices to healthcare providers, 
hospitals and other healthcare facilities and end-users. In most 
other Established markets, each division typically manages 
employee sales forces directly, and also ships and invoices products 
both directly to healthcare providers, hospitals and other healthcare 
facilities and to wholesale distributors.
In Emerging markets and International markets the Group operates 
through direct selling and marketing operations, and through 
distributors. In these markets, Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine 
frequently share sales resources. The Advanced Wound Management 
sales force may be separate where it calls on different customers.
Sales trends
Smith & Nephew’s divisions participate in the global medical devices 
market and share a common focus on the repair of the human body. 
Smith & Nephew’s principal geographic markets are in our Established 
markets healthcare economies of the US, Europe, Japan, Canada, 
Australia and New Zealand. In addition, we are building our business 
in the Emerging markets (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and our 
International markets such as South Africa, Mexico and Turkey.

Our marketplace continued
Smith & Nephew’s markets are characterised by increased longevity, 
more active lifestyles, obesity, increased affluence and an increase 
in the average age of the population caused by the immediate post-
World War II ‘baby boomer’ generation approaching retirement.
Together these factors have created significant demand for more 
effective healthcare products which deliver improved outcomes 
through technology advances. Furthermore, pressure to resist 
increases in overall healthcare spending has led healthcare 
providers to demand products which minimise the length of hospital 
stays and use of surgeon and nursing resources.
Increasing patient awareness of available healthcare treatments 
through the internet and direct-to-customer advertising has led 
to some increased patient influence over product purchasing 
decisions.
For a description of the impact on each division refer to the ‘Business 
Segment reviews’ on pages 22 to 33.
Dependence on government  
and other funding
In most markets throughout the world, expenditure on medical 
devices is ultimately controlled to a large extent by governments. 
Funds may be made available or withdrawn from healthcare 
budgets depending on government policy. The Group is therefore 
largely dependent on future governments providing increased 
funds commensurate with the increased demand arising from 
demographic trends.
Pricing of the Group’s products is largely governed in most 
Established markets by governmental reimbursement authorities. 
Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies 
and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, 
including price regulation, excise taxes and competitive pricing, are 
ongoing in markets where the Group has operations. This control 
may be exercised by determining prices for an individual product 
or for an entire procedure. The Group is exposed to changes in 
reimbursement policy, tax policy and pricing which may have an 
adverse impact on sales and operating profit. In particular, changes 
to the healthcare legislation in the US are due to impose significant 
taxes on medical device manufacturers from 2013. There may be an 
increased risk of adverse changes to government funding policies 
arising from the deterioration in macro-economic conditions in some 
of the Group’s markets.
Regulatory standards and compliance in the 
healthcare industry
The international medical device industry is highly regulated. 
Regulatory requirements are a major factor in determining whether 
substances and materials can be developed into marketable 
products and the amount of time and expense that should be 
allotted to such development.
The trend is towards more stringent regulation and higher standards 
of technical appraisal. Such controls have become increasingly 
demanding to comply with and management believes that this trend 
will continue.
National regulatory authorities administer and enforce a complex 
series of laws and regulations that govern the design, development, 
approval, manufacture, labelling, marketing and sale of healthcare 
products. They also review data supporting the safety and efficacy 
of such products. Of particular importance is the requirement in 
many countries that products be authorised or registered prior 
to manufacture, marketing or sale and that such authorisation or 
registration be subsequently maintained. The major regulatory 
agencies for Smith & Nephew’s products include the Food and 
Drug Administration (‘FDA’) in the US, the Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency in the UK, the Ministry of Health, Labour 
and Welfare in Japan and the State Food and Drug Administration in 
China.
Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to 
regulation and review by various government authorities. In general, 
the trend in many countries in which the Group does business is 
towards higher expectations and increased enforcement activity by 
governmental authorities.
While the Group is committed to doing business with integrity and 
welcomes the trend to higher standards in the healthcare industry, 
the Group and other companies in the industry have been subject to 
investigations and other enforcement activity that have incurred and 
may continue to incur significant expense. See ‘Legal proceedings’ 
on page 52.
Manufacturing, supply & distribution
The Group’s manufacturing production is concentrated at 12 main 
facilities in Memphis, Mansfield and Oklahoma City in the US, Hull, 
Warwick and Gilberdyke in the UK, Aarau in Switzerland, Tuttlingen 
in Germany, Fort Saskatchewan and Calgary in Canada and Suzhou 
and Beijing in China.
The Group operates a number of central distribution facilities in the 
key geographical areas in which it operates. Products are shipped to 
Group companies which hold small amounts of inventory locally for 
immediate or urgent customer requirements. 
The Advanced Surgical Devices division operates a distribution 
facility in Baar, Switzerland which acts as the main holding and 
consolidation point for markets in Europe. In the US, the Advanced 
Surgical Devices distribution hub is located in Memphis.
Advanced Wound Management distribution hubs are located in 
Neunkirchen, Germany; Derby, UK; and Atlanta, US.
The Group has a central Operations function which continues to 
implement Lean Manufacturing throughout the factories and the 
supply chain which is designed to improve and sustain higher levels 
of service, quality, productivity and efficiency.
Core competencies include: materials technology; high precision 
machining in Advanced Surgical Devices; and high-volume, 
automated manufacturing in Advanced Wound Management.
Each business segment purchases raw materials, components, 
finished products and packaging materials from certain key 
suppliers. These principally include metal forgings and stampings 
for orthopaedic products, optical and electronic sub-components 
and finished goods for Sports Medicine products, active ingredients 
and finished goods for Advanced Wound Management and 
packaging materials across all businesses. Suppliers are selected, 
and contracts negotiated, by a centralised Group procurement team 
wherever possible, with a view to ensure value for money based on 
the total spending across the Group.

The Group outsources manufacturing where necessary to obtain 
specialised expertise or where it is possible to gain lower cost 
without undue risk to intellectual property. Suppliers of outsourced 
products and services are selected based on their ability to deliver 
products and services to specification, and establish and maintain 
a quality system. Suppliers are trained and are monitored through 
on-site assessments and performance audits that include quality, 
service and delivery. Finished goods purchased for resale include 
screen displays, optical and electrical devices in the Advanced 
Surgical Devices division and skincare products in the Advanced 
Wound Management division.
Research and development
Smith & Nephew manages a portfolio of short and long-term 
product development projects designed to meet the future needs 
of customers and continue to provide growth opportunities for 
the business. The Group’s research and development is directed 
towards each business segment. Expenditure on research and 
development amounted to $171m in 2012 (2011 – $167m, 2010 – 
$151m), representing approximately 4.1% of Group revenue (2011 – 
3.9%, 2010 – 3.8%).
The Group continues to invest in future technology opportunities 
for clinical needs identified from across the Smith & Nephew 
businesses.

The medical devices industry has a rapid rate of new product 
introduction. In order to remain competitive, each of the Group’s 
business segments must continue to develop innovative products 
that satisfy customer needs and preferences or provide cost or 
other advantages. Developing new products is a costly, lengthy and 
uncertain process. A potential product may not be brought to market 
or not succeed in the market for any number of reasons, including 
failure to work optimally, failure to receive regulatory approval, failure 
to be cost-competitive, infringement of patents or other intellectual 
property rights and changes in consumer demand. The Group’s 
products and technologies are also subject to marketing attack by 
competitors. Furthermore, new products that are developed and 
marketed by the Group’s competitors may affect price levels in the 
various markets in which the Group’s business segments operate. 
If the Group’s new products do not remain competitive with those of 
competitors, the Group’s revenue could decline.
Research and development is primarily carried out at the Group’s 
principal locations, notably in Memphis, US (Orthopaedics), 
Mansfield, US (Endoscopy) and Hull, UK (Advanced Wound 
Management). There are a number of other smaller research and 
development units situated at other locations around the Group. 
In-house research is supplemented by work performed by academic 
institutions and other external research organisations in Europe, 
America and Asia.
Following the acquisition of Healthpoint Biotherapeutics the Group 
has a research and development capability in next-generation 
bioactive therapies for the treatment of chronic wounds.  The 
principal pipeline product is HP802-247 for the treatment of venous 
leg ulcers which has entered Phase 3 trials.
Intellectual property
Smith & Nephew has a policy of protecting the results of research 
and development carried out by the Group. Patents have 
been obtained in a wide range of fields, including orthopaedic 
reconstruction and trauma, sports medicine and advanced wound 
management. Patent protection for Group products is sought 
routinely in the Group’s principal markets. Currently, the Group’s 
patent portfolio stands at approximately 4,700 patents in force and 
patent applications pending.
Smith & Nephew also has a policy of protecting the Group’s products 
by registering trademarks under local laws of markets in which such 
products are sold. The Group vigorously protects its trademarks 
against infringement.
In addition to protecting its market position by filing and enforcing 
patents and trademarks, Smith & Nephew may oppose third-party 
patents and trademark filings where appropriate in those areas that 
might conflict with the Group’s business interests.
In the ordinary course of its business, the Group enters into a 
number of licensing arrangements with respect to its products. None 
of these arrangements individually is considered material to the 
current operations and the financial results of the Group.
Currency fluctuations
Smith & Nephew operates across many jurisdictions and therefore 
the Group’s operations are affected by transactional exchange 
rate movements in that they are subject to exposures arising from 
revenue in a currency different from the related costs and expenses. 
The Group’s manufacturing cost base is situated principally in the 
US, the UK, China and Switzerland, from which finished products 
are exported to the Group’s selling operations worldwide. Thus, 
the Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between 
the US Dollar, Sterling and Swiss Franc and the currency of the 
Group’s selling operations, particularly the Euro, Australian Dollar 
and Japanese Yen. If the US Dollar, Sterling or Swiss Franc should 
strengthen against the Euro, Australian Dollar and the Japanese Yen, 
the Group’s trading margin could be adversely affected.
The Group manages the impact of exchange rate movements on 
intra-group sales and cost of goods sold by a policy of transacting 
forward foreign currency commitments when firm purchase orders 
are placed. In addition, the Group’s policy is for forecast transactions 
to be covered between 50% and 90% for up to one year.
The Group uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency and the US 
Dollar is the functional currency of Smith & Nephew plc. The Group’s 
revenues, profits and earnings are also affected by exchange rate 
movements on the translation of results of operations in foreign 
subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes. See ‘Financial position, 
liquidity and capital resources’ on page 50.

manufactured in Aarau, Switzerland, Tuttlingen, Germany, 
Leamington Spa (Warwick), UK, Beijing, China and Calgary, 
Canada, as well as by third-party manufacturers. Major 
service centres are located in the US, UK, Germany, Japan 
and Australia.
Strategy
ASD was created in 2011 with the merger of the orthopaedic 
and endoscopy business units. The momentum gained 
from this merger continued in 2012. The division continues 
to take a disciplined and objective approach to resource 
allocation among its core (Hip Implant, Knee Implant and 
Arthroscopic Enabling Technologies) and growth (Sports 
Medicine Joint Repair, Trauma and Other, including 
Gynaecology) franchises. In the core franchise areas, 
ASD will continue to position itself through innovation 
and process improvement to grow with the market and 
deliver earnings. In the growth franchises, the division 
is investing increasing amounts in innovation, rapid 
iterations and market development to take both share 
and leadership positions.
The Emerging and International markets have become an 
increasingly important opportunity for Advanced Surgical 
Device products. Significant progress was made in these 
markets in 2012 with investment in division management, 
local management, sales teams and products.
In April, ASD, along with the Advanced Wound 
Management division, announced the start of a major 
initiative to align and optimise the infrastructure and 
operational activities across Smith & Nephew in Europe. 
Known as the European Process Optimisation, this multi-
year commitment will deliver a standard and simplified 
set of processes underpinned by a common enterprise 
resource planning platform and business intelligence 
system.
ASD also began phasing out slow and non-moving 
product components in 2012. The division has plans to 
address the number of product components further by 
reducing the number of platforms.
ASD provides medical education through a variety of 
training and education services tailored to individual 
surgeon needs. The Group also focuses on knowledge 
sharing, utilising the world’s top specialists and key 
opinion leaders. The ASD business supports its medical 
education strategy with investment in surgeon education 
programmes, global fellowship support initiatives, 
partnerships with professional associations and surgeon 
advisory boards.
In January 2012, the Group announced its intention to 
sell its Biologics and Clinical Therapies business (CT) to 
Bioventus LLC (‘Bioventus’). The creation of Bioventus gave 
CT the resources to address longer term development 
projects. Smith & Nephew has a 49% shareholding 
in the new venture, maintaining access to the area of 
orthobiologics, whilst realising value for reinvestment in 
nearer term opportunities. This transaction was completed 
on 4 May 2012 for a total consideration of $367m and 
resulted in a profit before taxation of $251m. CT’s revenue 
in the four month period to disposal was $69m and profit 
before taxation was $12m. CT was reported within the 
Other franchise.
Acquisitions
In 2012, the Group acquired LifeModeler, Inc. (LMI). 
LMI is the leading provider of biomechanical human body 
simulation tools and services and the developer of the 
groundbreaking software used in creating the JOURNEY 
BCS knee system. With this new software, orthopaedic 
innovations can be tested and validated faster and more 
cost effectively prior to the production of a physical 
prototype, potentially shortening the time it takes to 
develop new products and take to market.
Market and competition
In 2012, weaker economic conditions worldwide continued 
to create several challenges for the overall surgical devices 
market, including continued deferrals of joint replacement 
procedures and heightened pricing pressures.
These factors contributed to the lower overall growth of 
the worldwide surgical devices market versus historic 
comparables. However, over the medium term, several 
catalysts are expected to continue to drive sustainable 
growth in surgical device procedures, including the 
growing and ageing population with active lifestyles, 
rising rates of co-morbidities such as obesity and 
diabetes, patient desire for minimally invasive procedures, 
technology improvements allowing surgeons to treat 
younger, more active patients, and the increasing strength 
of the demand for healthcare in Emerging markets.
Global orthopaedic reconstruction segment
Smith & Nephew estimates that the global orthopaedic 
reconstruction segment is worth approximately 
$13.6bn and the segment served by Smith & Nephew 
grew by approximately 3% in 2012. Competitors in the 
orthopaedics reconstruction segment include Zimmer, 
Stryker, Johnson & Johnson and Biomet.
Global orthopaedic trauma segment
Smith & Nephew estimates that the global orthopaedic 
trauma segment is worth approximately $4.5bn 
and the segment served by Smith & Nephew grew 
by approximately 3% in 2012. Competitors in the 
orthopaedics trauma segment include Zimmer, Stryker 
and Johnson & Johnson.

In the US, revenue decreased by $118m to $1,449m (-8%). 
This movement is attributable to underlying growth of 1% 
and -9% due to the effect of the disposal of the Clinical 
Therapies business. In the Established markets outside 
of the US revenue decreased by $45m to $1,298m (-3%). 
Underlying growth was 1% with -4% due to unfavourable 
currency movements.
In Emerging and International markets, revenue increased 
by $20m to $361m (6%). Underlying growth was 10% with 
-4% due to unfavourable currency.
2011
ASD revenue increased by 7% to $3,251m from $3,050m 
in 2010. Of this increase, 3% was attributable to 
underlying growth and 4% was due to favourable currency 
movements.
In the Established markets, revenue was $2,910m. This 
represented an underlying increase of 2% from 2010.
In the US, revenue was $1,567m, which represents an 
underlying growth of 2% from 2010. In the Established 
markets outside of the US, revenue was $1,343m which

2012
Trading profit increased by $14m (2%) to $728m from 
$714m in 2011. Trading profit margin increased from 
21.9% to 23.4%. These increases reflect the early benefits 
of implementing the Strategic Priorities, in particular, 
restructuring the Group to provide the right commercial 
models and cost structure.
2011
Trading profit decreased by $22m (8%) to $714m from 
$736m in 2010. Trading profit margin decreased from 
24.1% to 21.9%. This decrease was due to continuing

Regulatory approvals
In 2012, the Advanced Surgical Devices division obtained 
regulatory clearances/approvals for several key products 
and instrumentations.
In the US, 510(k) clearance was obtained for Hip, Knee and 
Trauma franchise products including POLARCUP with Ti/
HA Coating, REDAPT Revision Femoral System, JOURNEY 
II CR Knee System and JOURNEY II Deep Dished Articular 
Inserts. In addition, 510(k) clearance was obtained 
for Twinfix Ultra PK, TI, HA gluteal tendon indications; 
Footprint Ultra PK gluteal tendon indications; BIORAPTOR, 
OSTEORAPTOR labral reconstruction indications; and 
allograft transplant indications.
Several products were approved in Japan including 
ANTHOLOGY Hip Stems, LEGION VERILAST CR, PS and 
Revision Knee Systems, BIOLOX Delta Ceramic Femoral 
Heads, GENESIS II Constrained Articular Inserts and 
TRIGEN Low Profile Bone Screws.
In Europe, the division renewed approval for JOURNEY 
BCS Knee System and obtained approval for JOURNEY 
II BCS Knee System. In Canada, POLARCUP XLPE 
Acetabular Liners were approved.

Orthopaedic and sports medicine procedures tend to be 
higher in the winter months (quarter one and quarter four) 
when accidents and sports related injuries are highest. 
Conversely, elective procedures tend to slow down in 
the summer months due to holidays.
Orthopaedic reconstruction
The division offers a range of specialist products for 
orthopaedic reconstruction through its Hip implant and 
Knee implant franchises. 
Both the knee and hip implant markets continue to 
experience economic pressure. Knee implant franchise 
revenue increased by 1% to $874m in 2012 which 
represented an underlying revenue growth of 3% and 
unfavourable foreign currency translation of -2%. This 
compared to a market growth rate of 3%. Growth slowed 
in the second half of 2012 as a result of a weakening of 
the overall knee market in Europe and the division’s knee 
product cycle. Between 2009 and 2011, when the division 
materially outperformed the knee market, it benefited 
from the launch of VERILAST Technology and VISIONAIRE 
Patient Matched Instrumentation. This benefit has now 
been annualised. 
In the global Hip implant franchise revenue decreased 
by $39m to $666m (-6%) in 2012, representing a -3% 
underlying revenue decline in the face of the continuing 
metal-on-metal headwinds and -2% due to unfavourable 
foreign currency translation. The Hip implant franchise, led 
by the ANTHOLOGY Hip with VERILAST Technology, has 
also continued to perform well in its focus product areas. 
Sales of our BIRMINGHAM Hip Resurfacing system 
continued to decline during the year. The BIRMINGHAM 
HIP Resurfacing System is a clinically proven system for 
hip resurfacing which preserves bone and is particularly 
suited for younger, more active male patients.
ASD launched several new products across its 
Orthopaedic Reconstruction portfolio in 2012.

In the Hip implant franchise, the REDAPT Revision 
Femoral Hip System was launched, offering surgeons one 
reproducible system for any type of hip revision. Also, the 
POLARCUP Dual Mobility Hip System, widely available 
in Europe, was introduced in the US. In Knee implants, 
the launch of the LEGION HK Hinge Knee System and 
the LEGION Narrow Femoral Components continue to 
expand the versatility of the LEGION Total Knee System. 
In Japan, the LEGION Revision knee system and VERILAST 
Technology for primary knee replacements were approved 
to market. 
Implant bearing surfaces such as the proprietary 
OXINIUM Oxidized Zirconium continue to be a point of 
differentiation for Smith & Nephew. OXINIUM Technology 
combines the enhanced wear resistance of a ceramic 
bearing with the superior toughness of a metallic bearing. 
When combined with highly cross-linked polyethylene 
(XLPE) it results in ASD’s proprietary VERILAST Technology. 
In hip implants, the combination of a ceramicised 
metal head and a polyethylene lined cup have been 
shown in joint registry data to have superior five-year 
survivorship (97.9%) compared to implants made from 
any other material. In knees, the LEGION Primary Knee 
with VERILAST Technology is the only knee implant with 
a 30-year wear performance claim – more than double 
the length of wear performance testing of conventional 
technologies.
Another driver of Knee implant growth has been 
VISIONAIRE Patient Matched Instrumentation. With 
VISIONAIRE Instrumentation, a patient’s MRI and X-rays 
are used to create customised cutting blocks that allow the 
surgeon to achieve optimal mechanical axis alignment of 
the new implant. In addition, VISIONAIRE also helps save 
time by reducing the number of steps and instruments 
needed in the operating room.
The LEGION/GENESIS II Total Knee System is a 
comprehensive system designed to allow surgeons to 
address a wide range of knee procedures from primary 
to revision. The JOURNEY Active Knee Solutions is a family 
of advanced, customised products designed to treat 
early to mid-stage osteoarthritis patients, and provide 
more normal feeling and motion through bone ligament 
preservation and anatomic replication. In 2012, the second 
iteration of the JOURNEY Knee System, the JOURNEY II 
BCS, commenced a limited commercial release. 
For Hip implants, core systems include the ANTHOLOGY 
Hip System, SYNERGY Hip System, the SMF Short Modular 
Femoral Hip System, the R3 Acetabular System, the 
POLARCUP Dual Mobility Hip System and the SL-PLUS Hip 
Family System.  
Trauma
The division’s Trauma franchise offers both internal and 
external devices, as well as other products such as 
orthobiological materials used in the stabilisation of severe 
fractures and deformity correction procedures.
In the US the division is implementing a refined 
commercial model that increases the focus and resources 
needed to address the opportunities in the high-growth 
trauma and extremities markets. 
Global Trauma revenue increased by $5m to $462m (1%), 
representing underlying revenue growth of 3% and -2% 
unfavourable foreign currency translation. 
In 2012, both the VLP FOOT Percutaneous Calcaneus 
Plating System and the PERI-LOC Ankle Fusion Plating 
System were launched as part of the Group’s ALL 28 
Foot and Ankle Portfolio. Both systems are available 
to surgeons in North America, Europe and Australia 
and offer solutions for increasingly popular surgical 
approaches. The VLP FOOT Percutaneous Calcaneus 
System is designed for the percutaneous approach and 
is the only plating system to offer variable-angle locking 
technology. The PERI-LOC Ankle Fusion Plating System 
is the only system to offer surgeons options for the 
posterior approach which minimises soft tissue irritation 
and preserves the fibula.
For trauma, the principal internal fixation products are 
the TRIGEN family of IM nails (TRIGEN META-NAIL System, 
TRIGEN Humeral Nail System, TRIGEN SURESHOT, and 
TRIGEN INTERTAN). For extremities and limb restoration, 
the franchise offers the TAYLOR SPATIAL FRAME Circular 
Fixation System as well as a range of plates, screws, 
arthroscopes, instrumentation, resection, and suture 
anchor products for foot & ankle surgeons and hand & 
wrist surgeons. 
Giving advantages to both 
the patient and the surgeon.  
REDAPT Revision Hip System
The REDAPT Revision Hip System 
gives advantages to both the patient 
– through more anatomic function – 
and the surgeon who benefits from 
a versatile product and a shorter 
learning curve.

A major advance for  
non-invasive surgeons  
HEALICOIL PK Suture Anchor
The HEALICOIL PK Suture Anchor 
is a major advance for non-invasive 
surgeons as its unique open 
architecture provides significantly 
more thread engagement and greater 
pullout strength. 
Sports Medicine Joint Repair
The division’s Sports Medicine Joint Repair franchise 
offers surgeons a broad array of instruments, technologies 
and implants necessary to perform minimally invasive 
surgery of the joints, including knee, hip and shoulder 
repair.
Global revenue from Sports Medicine Joint Repair 
increased by $30m to $521m (6%), of which 8% was 
underlying growth and -2% unfavourable foreign currency 
translation. 
The franchise benefited from the launch of several class-
leading products during the year. These included The 
HEALICOIL PK Suture Anchor for both shoulder and hip 
repair, ENDOBUTTON CL Ultra 10mm Fixation Device, 
CLANCY Flexible Drill System and ACUFEX PINPOINT 
Anatomic ACL Guide System. The Group also obtained 
US FDA clearance for expanding the indications of the 
HEALICOIL PK Suture Anchor and the OSTEORAPTOR 
Suture Anchor for use in hip arthroscopy.
The HEALICOIL PK Suture Anchor features a revolutionary 
open-architecture design that uses less material than 
traditional, solid-core anchors while still providing 
significantly more thread engagement and greater pullout 
strength than its competitors. The ENDOBUTTON CL 
Ultra 10mm Fixation Device is the franchise’s shortest 
continuous loop. It is designed for the growing number 
of surgeons who want to maximise the interface between 
the graft and the femoral tunnel, a feature especially 
important when using the anatomic technique to repair 
the ACL.
Joining other offerings such as the ACUFEX PINPOINT 
Anatomic ACL Guide System, CLANCY Anatomic 
Cruciate Guide, and BIOSURE Interference Screws, the 
ENDOBUTTON CL Ultra 10mm Fixation Device is part of a 
complete portfolio of options for surgeons performing a 
wide variety of anatomic ACL reconstructions. 
Arthroscopic Enabling Technologies (AET)
The division’s Arthroscopic Enabling Technologies 
franchise offers healthcare providers a variety of 
technologies such as fluid management equipment for 
surgical access; high definition cameras, digital image 
capture, scopes, light sources and monitors to assist with 
visualisation inside the joints; radiofrequency (RF) probes, 
electromechanical and mechanical blades, and hand 
instruments for removing damaged tissue. 
AET revenue decreased by $16m to $409m (-4%) in 2012, 
which represented an underlying revenue decline of -2% 
and -2% of unfavourable foreign currency translation. 
Key AET products include the wide range of DYONICS 
shaver blades, ACUFEX handheld instruments, and a 
wide range of radiofrequency probes. Launched in 2011, 
the DYONICS Platinum Series Shaver Blades are single-
use blades that provide superior resection due to their 
unequalled sharpness and virtually eliminate clogging 
due to their improved debris evacuation capabilities. 
In 2012, the AET business obtained regulatory clearance 
in the United States and Europe for the DYONICS Platinum 
Blades 4.5/5.5mm.
Other
The division’s Other franchise includes smaller 
businesses such as Gynaecology, and the Clinical 
Therapies business, the latter of which was transferred to 
Bioventus in May 2012. 
The revenue in this Other franchise (excluding Clinical 
Therapies) increased by $2m to $69m (5%), which 
represented an underlying revenue growth of 7% and -2% 
of unfavourable foreign currency translation.
The franchise’s key gynaecology product is the TRUCLEAR 
System, a first-of-its-kind hysteroscopic morcellator that 
pairs continuous visualisation capabilities with minimally 
invasive tissue removal providing safe and efficient 
removal of endometrial polyps and submucousal fibroids. 
The Group also sells a hysteroscopic fluid management 
system, which provides uterine distension and clear 
visualisation during hysteroscopic procedures.
In 2012, the franchise introduced two additions to 
the TRUCLEAR System, the smaller-sized TRUCLEAR 
5.0 System and the TRUCLEAR ULTRA Reciprocating 
Morcellator 4.0.

Overview
Smith & Nephew’s Advanced Wound Management 
division (AWM) offers a range of products from initial 
wound bed preparation through to full wound closure. 
These products are targeted at chronic wounds 
associated with the older population, such as pressure 
sores and venous leg ulcers. There are also products 
for the treatment of wounds such as burns and invasive 
surgery that impact the wider population. 
The main products within the AWM business are for 
Exudate management (predominantly the ALLEVYN brand 
and the recently added DURAFIBER products), Infection 
management (including the ACTICOAT brand) and 
Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT). 
At the end of 2012, Smith & Nephew announced the 
completion of the acquisition of substantially all the 
assets of Healthpoint Biotherapeutics (‘Healthpoint’). The 
acquisition gives Smith & Nephew a leading position in 
bioactives, the fastest growing area of advanced wound 
management. The purchase price of $782m in cash has 
been financed from Smith & Nephew’s existing cash 
resources and bank facilities.
The AWM business has its global headquarters in Hull, 
UK and its North American headquarters in St Petersburg, 
Florida. The products are manufactured at facilities in Hull 
and Gilberdyke, UK, Suzhou in China, Fort Saskatchewan 
in Canada and also by third-party manufacturers around 
the world.
Strategy
AWM’s strategy is to be customer-led and invest for 
growth by focusing on high growth, high value segments, 
in particular exudate and infection management, through 
improved wound bed preparation, moist and active 
healing; further penetration of the NPWT market; and 
building its bioactives platform. 
There has been a continued focus on operational 
efficiency and excellence. Since 2007, efficiency 
improvements have been delivered through various 
projects including support function consolidation, 
outsourcing of manufacturing to low cost suppliers, 
distribution rationalisation projects and the start of 
manufacturing in Suzhou, China. 
Our strategic focus builds from an understanding of 
the increasing tensions between clinical and financial 
imperatives – and looks for the optimistic ground that 
resolves them. Our commitment is to improve wound 
outcomes for patients, and at the same time conserve 
resources for healthcare systems.
An aligned approach across AWM is designed to ensure 
that our employees are developed and work on common 
objectives to deliver consistent execution of the Group’s 
plan. 
Acquisitions
Healthpoint
In December 2012, Smith & Nephew completed the 
acquisition of substantially all the assets of Healthpoint 
for $782m in cash. Healthpoint is a leader in bioactive 
debridement, dermal repair and regeneration wound 
care treatments. Its headquarters are in Fort Worth, Texas 
and it has approximately 460 employees, including an 
established sales force of 215. 
This acquisition had compelling strategic and financial 
rationale for Smith & Nephew. 
It gives the Group a strong position in bioactives, the 
fastest growing area of advanced wound management. 
Bioactives offer novel treatments for a range of hard- 
to-heal wounds, including the large and increasing 
prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers.
It brought a complementary range of bioactive 
debridement, dermal repair and regeneration products. 
Its principal marketed product is Collagenase SANTYL 
Ointment (‘SANTYL’), an enzymatic debrider for dermal 
ulcers and burns. Healthpoint’s offering also includes 
the OASIS family of leading acellular skin substitutes 
for venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers and 
REGRANEX, a growth factor for treating diabetic foot 
ulcers. These products generated revenues of around 
$190m in 2012 (not included in Smith & Nephew revenues 
for 2012). Its revenues are growing at a double digit 
percentage rate, driven by SANTYL ointment.
It added an established R&D capability in next-generation 
bioactive therapies for the treatment of chronic wounds. 
The principal pipeline product is HP802-247 for the 
treatment of venous leg ulcers, using cell-based therapy 
containing keratinocytes and fibroblasts. In August 2011, 
Healthpoint reported positive data from a Phase 2b clinical 
trial for HP802-247 in the treatment of venous leg ulcers, 
demonstrating that the compound met both its primary 
and secondary endpoints. The compound has recently 
entered Phase 3 trials for this indication and commercial 
launch could occur as early as 2017.
The Healthpoint acquisition will double our US AWM sales 
and strengthen our commercial scale and capabilities. 
The combination creates a wound business which is 
unique – having leadership positions across exudate and

ADERMA
The purchase of the ADERMA Dermal Pads range in 
January 2012 gave us a leading position in the market to 
treat pressure ulcers. Up to one in 10 patients admitted to 
hospitals in the UK will suffer this debilitative condition, 
costing approximately £2.1bn per year. Developing skin 
damage causes great discomfort to the patient and 
depending on the grade of the ulcer can take many 
weeks to heal whilst the majority of pressure ulcers can 
be prevented. ADERMA Dermal Pads are made from a 
unique polymer gel that redistributes pressure, allowing 
clinicians to protect bony prominences to help prevent 
skin damage. 
Kalypto
In 2012, the Company acquired Kalypto Medical, securing 
innovative complementary technology to expand our 
NPWT platform. 
Mark e t and compe tition
In 2012, weaker economic conditions worldwide continued 
to create several challenges for the overall advanced 
wound management market including significant price 
pressures and increased austerity measures in Europe.
The AWM market is focused on the treatment of chronic 
wounds of the older population and other hard-to-heal 
wounds such as burns and certain surgical wounds and 
is therefore also expected to benefit from demographic 
trends. Growth is driven by an ageing population and by a 
steady advance in technology and products that are more 
clinically efficient and cost effective than their conventional 
counterparts. The market for advanced wound treatments 
is relatively unpenetrated and it is estimated that the 
potential market is significantly larger than the current 
market. Management believes that the market will 
continue the trend towards advanced wound products 
with its ability to accelerate healing rates, reduce hospital 
stay times and cut the cost of clinician and nursing time as 
well as aftercare in the home.
Smith & Nephew estimates that the global wound 
management segment is worth approximately $6.0bn and 
the segment served by Smith & Nephew grew by 1% in 
2012. Global competitors vary across the various product 
areas and include Kinetic Concepts, Molnlycke, Convatec 
and Coloplast.
Financial performance
Revenue
2012
AWM continues to outperform the market, with revenue 
growing at 4% in 2012 on an underlying basis (excluding 
a -3% unfavourable currency impact) to $1,029m. 
Management estimates that the overall market grew at 1%. 
Underlying growth in Advanced Wound Management 
revenue reconciles to reported growth, the most directly 
comparable financial measure calculated in accordance 
with IFRS, as follows:
2012 
%
2011 
%
Reported growth 1 12
Constant currency exchange effect 3 (5)
Underlying growth 4 7
In the Established markets, revenue increased from 
$906m to $907m in 2012. This represents an underlying 
growth of 3% which was offset by unfavourable currency 
movements of -3%.
In the US, revenue increased by 7% from $189m to $202m. 
In the Established markets outside of the US, revenues 
decreased -2% from $717m in 2011 to $705m in 2012. This 
represents an underlying growth of 2% after adjusting for 
-4% of unfavourable currency movements. 
Revenue in the Emerging and International markets 
increased from $113m in 2011 to $122m in 2012 (8%). 
The underlying movement was 11% offset by -3% of 
unfavourable currency movements. Exudate management 
grew at 1% and Infection management was down -2%, 
impacted by a distributor consolidation project in Canada.
2011
Revenue increased by $107m, or 12%, to $1,019m from 
$912m in 2010, comprising 5% favourable currency 
translation and 7% underlying growth. Exudate 
management grew in underlying terms by 2% and 
infection management by 4%, as targeted marketing 
investments in Europe delivered good returns. The Group’s 
NPWT portfolio has had another good year with excellent 
feedback since the launch of PICO during 2011. This was 
launched in the US during January 2012.
In the US, revenue increased by $11m to $189m (6%), all of 
which is attributable to underlying revenue growth.
Outside the US, revenue increased by $96m to $830m 
(13%). This is represented by an underlying growth of 
7% and 6% of favourable foreign currency translation. 
European revenue increased by $39m to $493m (9%) 
of which 4% was underlying growth coupled with 5% of 
favourable currency translation.

ADERMA Dermal Pads
The purchase of the ADERMA Dermal 
Pads range gave us a leading position 
in the market to treat pressure ulcers, 
which cost the NHS approximately

Trading profit
2012
Trading profit reduced by $10m to $237m from $247m 
and trading profit margin decreased from 24.3% to 23.1%. 
The decrease in the year is primarily attributable to the 
additional costs arising from investment in new products 
throughout the year.
2011
Trading profit increased by $14m (6%) to $247m from 
$233m in 2010 and trading profit margin decreased from 
25.6% to 24.3%. The comparative was assisted by a $25m 
settlement in respect of BlueSky. Ignoring the impact of 
this in the comparatives, the equivalent margin for 2010 
was 22.8%. The increase in margin in 2011 was driven by 
the increase in underlying revenues. 
Operating profit
2012
Operating profit decreased by $18m to $214m in 2012. This 
comprises a decrease in trading profit of $10m discussed 
above and an increase of $11m in connection with the 
acquisition related costs on the purchase of Healthpoint. 
These costs were partially offset by a reduction of $3m in 
the amortisation of acquisition intangibles.
Operating profit, the most directly comparable financial 
measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, reconciles to

a reduction of $1m in the amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles. These were offset by an increase of $3m in 
restructuring and rationalisation costs.
Regulatory approvals
In 2012 regulatory clearance for sale was obtained for 
ALLEVYN Life in the EU, US, Canada and Australia and for 
the introduction of a range of German specific ALLEVYN 
variants.
DURAFIBER Ag was approved as a Class III medical device 
in the EU.
VERSAJET and the RENASYS product range were both 
approved in Japan enabling Smith & Nephew to extend 
its operations into this important space. The RENASYS Go 
pump also received regulatory approval in China. In 2012 
sterile pump versions of the PICO product launched in 
2011 obtained regulatory approval in the US, EU, Canada & 
Australia.
PICO and VERSAJET II were both certified as compliant 
with the 3rd Edition of IEC 60601 an important new 
standard for the safety of electro-medical devices which is 
now required to comply with regulations in the EU.
Additional AWM products approved in the Emerging 
markets in 2012 include OPSITE Flexifix and LEUKOSTRIP 
in China and eight new products in India (ALLEVYN and 
ALLEVYN Ag variants, DURAFIBER and ACTICOAT Flex).

business.
Advanced Wound Care 
Exudate management
Exudate management revenues decreased by -2% from 
$275m in 2011 to $269m in 2012. This represents an 
underlying growth of 1% offset by -3% in unfavourable 
currency exchange.
Exudate management products focus on efficient fluid 
management and creating the optimal moist wound 
environment that helps promote faster healing of the 
wound and reduces the risk of maceration. The principal 
technologies in this franchise are foam (ALLEVYN family) 
and gelling fibre dressings (DURAFIBER).
The ALLEVYN Gentle Border success story has continued 
with above market growth in 2012, becoming the 
largest variant of the ALLEVYN family this year. This 
was possible through focus on market share gains and 
further expansion of the range through new product 
development. In particular, the lite and shaped versions 
have further enhanced our ability to offer customers 
unique products that meet their clinical and economic 
needs. DURAFIBER commercialisation has also gained 
momentum in 2012. 
ALLEVYN Life was launched in 2012. This is the latest 
generation of ALLEVYN products offering unique benefits 
and a significant advancement in managing wounds that 
diminish the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of 
patients every year. The product was born out of extensive 
international ethnographic research to understand how 
product design and performance can improve patient 
wellbeing, leading to improvements in concordance, 
clinical outcomes and, as a result, improved economic 
outcomes. Both clinician and patient feedback have been 
overwhelmingly positive.
Infection management
Infection management revenues have fallen from $133m 
in 2011 to $127m in 2012 (-5%). This also represents an 
underlying decline of -2% along with -3% of unfavourable 
currency exchange.
AWM has two significant technologies in its infection 
management portfolio, silver (ACTICOAT and ALLEVYN 
Ag) and iodine (IODOSORB). Market conditions for silver 
containing products have continued to be difficult in 
Europe but our focus on appropriate use, evidence based 
outcomes and cost effectiveness have demonstrated 
the differentiation within our products and stabilised our 
business in 2012. The iodine-based IODOSORB product 
has benefited from new evidence, claims and geography 
expansion, adding growth to our infection management 
portfolio.
ACTICOAT Flex continues to perform well following its 
introduction in 2009 by offering the customer benefits of 
ease of use, class leading efficacy and patient comfort. 
The ACTICOAT brand was further expanded in 2012 
with ACTICOAT Surgical, delivering the antimicrobial 
performance of ACTICOAT in a specialist format designed 
for incision management – for use as part of strategies to 
reduce surgical site infections – a significant and costly 
post-surgical complication.
Other
Advanced Wound Management also offers a wide range 
of other wound care products, which means we offer 
one of the most comprehensive ranges of wound care 
solutions in the industry. These other products include 
our film and post-operative dressing offerings, skincare 
products and gels.
IV3000, AWM’s specialist IV dressing, utilises REACTIC 
film technology and a unique patterned adhesive to 
create a highly breathable product which by keeping the 
IV site dry helps to reduce the risk of bacterial growth 
and infection. IV3000 has continued to grow, especially 
through expansion into our Emerging markets and a 
continued focus on product training and education in 
2012.
OPSITE Post Op visible is an incision management 
dressing innovation that combines the attributes of the 
ideal dressing with the ability to see the incision without 
having to remove the dressing. This unique product has 
gone from strength to strength since its introduction, 
bringing it to new customers and countries, significantly 
contributing to the Advanced Wound Care brands growth 
in 2012.

Advanced Wound Devices 
Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) delivers 
vacuum-assisted pressure to help promote healing. 
It consists of a wound dressing, a drainage tube, and 
a transparent film that is connected to a suction device. 
Smith & Nephew offers the RENASYS EZ and RENASYS 
GO pump systems together with a range of foam and 
gauze dressing kits. The NPWT range was enhanced 
with the introduction of PICO, the first of its kind – a fully 
disposable NPWT system.
The NPWT strategy is to be customer-led and invest for 
growth by offering the flexibility and simplicity within the 
product range to help address both the clinical and cost 
considerations of the customer. Within the traditional 
NPWT segment the Group is focusing on gaining share 
through offering a flexible RENASYS portfolio range of 
NPWT product offerings including foam, gauze, speciality 
kits, and portable and institutional pump systems. Within 
the disposable NPWT segment, the Group offers the 
simplified PICO portfolio range and is investing in creating 
this new market segment.
Smith & Nephew’s NPWT business continued strong 
growth in 2012, reflecting share gains continuing 
across North America and Europe, and new product 
introductions in Japan and Emerging markets. In 
addition, the recently launched PICO system (disposable 
NPWT) accelerated sales growth as the product gained 
awareness and adoption across a range of therapeutic 
areas (incision sites, chronic indications) and care settings 
(OR, discharge environment and community care).
The global NPWT market growth for 2012 showed modest 
decline compared to 2011. The increase in patient therapy 
and volumes was offset by price declines in most markets.
Within North America, market price declines are a 
reflection of business model changes to a single purchase 
transaction and away from the rental revenue model. 
In addition, unit price pressure continues in various care 
settings in response to pay or pressure and changing 
healthcare delivery dynamics. Therapy days increased 
slightly as a result of new technology offerings to provide 
greater therapy availability in transition care and discharge 
environment – offset by general trends in reduced hospital 
stay. For Europe, price pressure is a reflection of increased 
competition in key markets and the general economic 
environment across most markets. NPWT therapy was 
introduced in Japan in 2010 and the market continues to 
reflect strong growth as the therapy adoption increases 
across the market.
The Group continues to invest in medical education 
across the therapy category. Investment in clinical trials, 
consensus papers and general customer education 
and training remains a component to the overall value 
the Group brings to the advanced wound device 
market space.
During 2012, Smith & Nephew entered into a global 
settlement agreement with Wake Forest University that 
resolved all existing NPWT patent litigation between the 
two parties. 
VERSAJET (hydro-surgery debridement) system 
sales were slightly down for 2012 over 2011. Revenue 
performance is a reflection of business model changes 
transitioning customers from a loaner to purchase 
equipment which positions the product line for better 
future growth. The transition phasing is effected by capital 
budget cycles, but allows for improved therapy adoption 
within facilities and thus providing a better platform for 
future growth. In addition, the economic conditions within 
health systems to pay for higher price capital equipment 
limits the ability to effect the change in business models.
New in 2012, was the introduction of RENASYS and 
VERSAJET systems to the Japan market. Japan is one 
of the world’s largest healthcare markets, where the 
NPWT and hydrosurgery segments are relatively new 
and growing. The early presence of the Group product 
offerings in these growing market segments provide a 
platform from which to sustain future growth.
Throughout 2012, the Group continued to invest and 
introduce a range of product improvements across the 
portfolio designed to improve adoption and customer 
satisfaction. The PICO range was extended to include new 
incision site shapes and RENASYS system adaptions were 
introduced, to make the pumps easier to operate in the 
hospital environment.

Sustainability strategy 
Smith & Nephew has been measuring, reporting and 
improving on its sustainability performance since 2001. 
During this time, the Group has made good progress and 
has been looking for ways to align sustainability more 
closely with our overall strategic priorities. 
With this objective in mind, and under the leadership of 
Chief Executive Officer, Oliver Bohuon, Smith & Nephew 
developed a new sustainability strategy in 2011 as 
described below. The strategy aims to reinforce a healthy 
brand and strengthen corporate reputation by focusing on 
three distinct priorities:
 – Healthy economic performance
 – Healthy social performance
 – Healthy environmental performance
Objectives
Smith & Nephew developed a comprehensive set of 2015 
targets across each of these areas. These are outlined 
below:
Smith & Nephew continues to make progress 
in achieving the objectives in our sustainability strategy, 
which seeks to meet stakeholder expectations of a 
sustainable business. 
Sustainability vision
Smith & Nephew will continue to build a sustainable 
business based on a global commitment to healthy 
environmental, social and economic performance. 
By working with stakeholders and inspiring employees, 
the vision will create shared value for all people that 
come into contact with the business by:
 – Reducing risk and cost
 – Building a better place to work
 – Innovating differentiated products and services, 
and increasing engagement with customers
 – Increasing shareholder value

Healthy economic performance 
Our sustainability targets
Achieving Healthy Economic Performance will also yield cost 
savings and increased revenue
Deliver a higher return to our shareholders than our peer group

Smith & Nephew makes a major contribution to the health 
and well-being of individuals and communities across 
the world. Our pioneering technologies enable nurses, 
surgeons and other medical practitioners to provide 
effective treatment quickly and affordably. More than this, 
they help increase accessibility and save and improve the 
quality of people’s lives – all while helping the business 
thrive.
Product design
Revenue growth through innovation
In order to grow, thrive and combat some of the world’s 
most widespread health issues Smith & Nephew place 
a strong emphasis on new product development and 
innovation.
By designing products, instruments and techniques that 
provide both clinical and cost benefits, the Group’s work in 
this area has a major impact on improving the efficiency of 
health services. From reducing the frequency of dressing 
changes and shortening operating room time, to reducing 
infection rates and length of time spent in hospital – the 
Group’s efforts in this area have a significant impact on the 
lives of people across more than 90 countries.
In 2012, Smith & Nephew launched an entirely new 
concept in advanced wound care management with 
ALLEVYN Life, which focuses on the patient’s overall 
quality of life. Patient-centric in design, and considering 
the entire healthcare chain from provider to patient, 
ALLEVYN Life allows more healthcare providers the 
opportunity to help patients with hard to heal or hard to 
manage wounds. Research has shown that improving 
patient well-being is fundamental to reducing the 
economic cost of wound care. ALLEVYN Life offers 
unique benefits that help deliver this and is a significant 
advancement in preventing wounds that diminish the 
quality of life of many patients every year.
Smith & Nephew also introduced the REDAPT Femoral 
Revision System which was specifically designed to bring 
the concept of personalised patient treatments to the 
revision hip market. The REDAPT system allows surgeons 
to recreate a patient’s specific functionality effectively 
while quickly and easily addressing issues such as poor 
bone quality and proximal/distal mismatch. The REDAPT 
instruments maximise surgical efficiency and improve 
accuracy and reproducibility of implant position.
Business continuity
By creating a more sustainable business, Smith & 
Nephew is building resilience and flexibility to adapt to 
change. With the demand for medical technology set 
to increase well into the future, we are applying more 
sustainable ways of behaving to ensure long-term 
business continuity.
Product Development is driven by three specific 
considerations on healthcare systems and patients: 
Cost, Outcomes and Access. Design teams look at the 
overall cost of a product and how it impacts healthcare 
stakeholders, consider the benefits or outcome of new 
products and question how to enable new patients access 
to our new products and capabilities.
Supply chain
Our major supply chain partners have clearly spelled out 
sustainability targets, mostly around reducing carbon 
footprint. In addition we are working on initiatives that will 
deliver further improvements by switching distribution 
freight services where possible to lower carbon emissions 
such as from air to road and deep sea container service.
We now require sustainability reports to be provided for 
new suppliers and for each contract renewal and these 
are weighted in our assessments. There are challenges 
with small local suppliers in some countries but we are 
making progress.

Smith & Nephew touches the lives of millions of customers, 
communities and people across 90 countries. To deliver 
our technological innovations, we rely on the commitment 
and hard work of a network of more than 10,000 
employees. 
A safe and healthy working environment
Smith & Nephew has a longstanding commitment 
to the safety and health of employees, visitors and 
contractors. By reinforcing the responsibility of employees 
and contractors to work safely and follow our policies, 
standards and procedures, we are building a safe and 
healthy place to work.
In 2012 we achieved a 9% improvement in the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration Total 
Recordable Incident Rate (TIR) and a 17% improvement 
in the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR). In addition 
the severity of lost time injuries, as measured by number 
of days lost reduced by 10%. These improvements were 
achieved through determined management leadership 
and engagement of our employees.
Wellness programmes
By the end of 2012 structured wellness programmes were 
in place at eight out of 18 of our major facilities covering 46% 
of our employees. Smith & Nephew defines major facilities 
as those in which more than 100 people report to work. 
Wellness programmes typically include lifestyle screenings 
and health assessments and preventative programmes 
based on nutrition and fitness advice. In some locations 
there are on site fitness facilities and classes.
Diversity at Smith & Nephew
Smith & Nephew believes that diversity fuels innovation. 
We focus on creating an inclusive, engaging environment 
where employees are valued and drive achievement of 
our goals. Such an environment fosters strength in our 
business because the variety of perspectives, experiences 
and work styles enhance creativity and innovation. We are 
committed to employment practices based on equality 
of opportunity, regardless of colour, creed, race, national 
origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation or mental 
or physical disability unrelated to the ability of the person to 
perform the essential functions of the job. 
The Board and Executive continue to recognise the 
importance of diversity and over the last two years have 
expanded their own diversity profile. 
An ethical work environment
We earn trust
Trust is the foundation on which Smith & Nephew is built 
and it is the hallmark of its interactions with stakeholders 
both inside and outside the Group. A Code of Conduct 
and Business Principles defines the standards of 
behaviour for the Group’s employees as well as suppliers, 
contractors and distributors authorised to do business on 
the Group’s behalf.
Smith & Nephew fosters trust through open 
communication and a collaborative environment where 
ideas are encouraged, recognised and rewarded. 
Communication channels include group-wide newsletters 
and intranet platforms as well as a variety of forums for 
open dialogue including quarterly reports from the CEO 
and quarterly employee meetings on the state of the 
Group and important initiatives.

Employees help raise community 
awareness for Child Survival Programme
Our employees participated in many volunteer 
programmes during 2012 including the Manly-Manado 
Walk to raise funds for Compassion’s Child Survival 
Programme in Manado, Indonesia. Employees from our 
offices in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia joined 
others in the community to help raise awareness 
of why water, sanitation and hygiene matter in a 
developing community.
Code of Conduct and Business Principles
Smith & Nephew aims to be honest and fair in all aspects 
of its operations and expects the same from those 
with whom it does business. Our Code of Conduct and 
Business Principles governs the way we operate so that 
we respect stakeholders and seek to build open, honest 
and constructive relationships.
Smith & Nephew takes account of ethical, social, 
environmental, legal and financial considerations as part of 
its operating methods. We have a robust whistle-blowing 
system in all jurisdictions in which Smith & Nephew operates 
and where we have the necessary regulatory approvals. 
Our Code also states that we have a non-retaliation policy 
against anyone who makes a report in good faith.
New employees receive training on our Code of Conduct 
and Business Principles. We also assign annual 
compliance training to employees. In 2012, we created 
two courses: ‘I earn trust’ and ‘Data privacy’ to use for our 
annual training. The ‘I earn trust’ module focused on the 
key elements that make up trust – goodwill, ability and 
integrity – and gave employees an opportunity to practice 
earning trust in different scenarios.
Global Compliance Programme
Smith & Nephew aims to have a world-class, Global 
Compliance Programme that helps our business mitigate 
risk and comply with global laws. In 2012, Smith & 
Nephew continued to strengthen its comprehensive 
compliance programme which includes global policies 
and procedures, on-boarding and annual training for its 
employees and managers around the world, monitoring 
and auditing processes, and reporting channels. We 
provide resources and tools to guide employees through 
a global intranet web site. We require approvals for any 
significant interactions with healthcare professionals or 
government officials. New distributors are subject to due 
diligence, required to commit to compliance with our Code 
and take training.
In 2012, under the terms of the Company’s FCPA 
settlement (see Legal Proceedings), we retained an 
independent monitor to review the effectiveness of our 
compliance programme and make recommendations, as 
appropriate, for further enhancements to the programme. 
The monitor completed his initial review in August, 
and we are now in the process of implementing the 
recommended enhancements.
A responsible leader in the community
For Smith & Nephew, corporate citizenship and 
philanthropy play an integral role in the achievement of 
the Group’s strategic objectives of creating commercial 
value, building a strong reputation and creating deeper 
engagement for employees.
Smith & Nephew adopts a shared value approach to 
philanthropy and citizenship which focuses on leveraging 
the Group’s resources to be a force for good. The principal 
focus is on support for research, prevention, treatment 
and recovery of joint and bone health and wound care. 
In 2012, a new philanthropy policy was agreed and will 
be deployed in 2013. Details of this will be given in the full 
Sustainability Report to be published later this year.
In 2012, Smith & Nephew’s support for community 
charitable causes, grants, sponsorships and medical 
education was approximately $14m including $2m in 
product donations. As a matter of policy, Smith & Nephew 
makes no political contributions.
Smith & Nephew has developed relationships through 
healthcare professionals around the globe to support 
medical missions and medical education. In 2012 this 
charitable outreach included mission work in Vietnam 
through the Prosthetics Outreach Foundation, in Ecuador 
and Guatemala and the US through Operation Walk and 
Canvasback Missions in Majuro, Republic of the Marshall 
Islands. 
Our initiatives into medical education included being the 
first sole sponsor of an Orthopaedic facility when the 
KwaZulu-Natal Orthopaedic Training Centre at the Inkosi 
Albert Luthuli Central Hospital, South Africa opened 
its doors in June 2012. This Centre provides training 
and education opportunities for surgeons from across 
Africa looking to learn minimally-invasive arthroscopic 
techniques.

Our people and communities
Our people strategy, which outlines our approach to 
leading our workforce and supports the delivery of our 
business strategy, is built on three key pillars: attract, 
recruit and retain talent; develop leaders; and engage 
employees through value driven strategies.
Smith & Nephew’s vision is to be the best at improving 
people’s lives and this vision extends to our employees. 
Our employees are dedicated to our core values of 
Performance, Innovation and Trust which represent the 
foundation of our culture. 
Investing in our people and communities will help us 
ensure the long-term sustainability of our business. 
In 2012, our workforce included more than 10,000 
employees, based in 32 countries. Our employment 
practices are designed to help us create the right 
workplace culture in which all employees feel valued, 
respected, empowered and inspired.
We strive to have the communities in which we work 
prosper as our business grows. Our community 
investment strengthens our business by supporting the 
local economies where we operate, helping us build 
strong relationships and capitalising on the philanthropic 
spirit of our workforce. 
Attracting the best talent and developing and engaging 
our employees is critical to achieving and sustaining 
our business objectives and overall performance. Our 
appointments are made on merit and in alignment with a 
core set of competencies and values of which ethics and 
integrity are central. Our priority lies in the development 
and promotion of our employees whenever possible. 
Each year, Smith & Nephew conducts a comprehensive 
global development and capability review process 
to identify high potential employees and ensure they 
have solid development plans. We continue to work on 
succession plans for critical positions across our business 
and have taken proactive steps to recruit specialist and 
leadership talent to augment our current team. We pride 
ourselves in maintaining a robust leadership strategy to 
identify and develop our leaders and offer a wide range 
of learning opportunities to our employees. Current 
programmes include the CEO forum designed to develop 
talent and provide exposure to the broader business and 
the General Managers Meeting held annually to align 
these key leaders with the Group’s strategy and goals. 
In addition the Board reviews succession plans for key 
executive roles.
Our performance management process means 
employees are set business aligned objectives and 
behavioural goals that are rewarded on high performance. 
Reward systems are focused on promoting high 
performance and helping to attract and retain the 
best people.
Smith & Nephew strives to create a more engaged and 
productive workforce and focuses on four measures 
to drive employee engagement. These include an 
understanding of the Group’s mission and direction, 
sense of employee involvement, focus and adaptability to 
customers and market place. We continue to listen to our 
employees and value their opinions. In 2012, more than 
90% of our workforce responded to our Global Survey.

Reduction in CO
2
 emissions of 100  
metric tonnes: by re-routing vehicles  
for improved efficiency
Our Advanced Surgical Devices facility in Alberta, 
Canada has reduced the number of miles that 
materials and products are transported by re-routing 
some vehicles for improved efficiency. This initiative 
has reduced the number of journeys and therefore 
the overall distances driven by 120,000 miles per 
year. This equates to an approximate reduction in CO
2
 
emissions of 100 metric tonnes.
Healthy environmental performance

 Reduce non-renewable energy use by 15% by 2015
 R e d u c e CO

Increase the percentage of total waste recycled by 15%  
by 2015 (all normalised for growth)
Smith & Nephew is committed to reducing the impact 
of its activities on the environment to create a healthier 
planet. By focusing on energy and waste reduction, the 
Group is also reducing costs and becoming more efficient. 
Energy and carbon reduction
Smith & Nephew recognises that emissions resulting 
from its global operations represent one of the key 
environmental impacts arising from the business. In 
2012, initiatives to reduce our energy consumption and 
associated carbon emissions have resulted in a reduction 
in energy usage of -1.5% and -1.8% reduction in carbon 
emissions.
There has been tracking of energy savings initiatives at all 
of the major facilities. These range from lighting to heating 
and air handling to water cooling.
Lighting upgrades in warehousing and manufacturing 
centres have contributed to significant energy savings. 
Improvements to equipment and processes have resulted 
in reduced power consumption across a number of 
production facilities.
Water
Water consumption has risen by 2.6% in 2012. Achieving a 
reduction in water usage is particularly challenging as the 
majority of the water used wthin the Group is consumed 
at one individual facility where water is used for many key 
processes. This will be reviewed in 2013.
Packaging, waste and recycling
Waste reduction, including that related to product 
packaging, is a priority for Smith & Nephew. Given that 
a large amount of medical products are shipped and 
transported it is vital to ensure that these are protected 
from the point of manufacture through to the point of 
delivery. Product packaging plays a critical role in ensuring 
this safe delivery. 
Establishing an effective strategy to meet our target 
for reduction in packaging materials is challenging 
due to the highly regulated environment and long lead 
times for change approvals. However by considering 
design, exploring ways to reduce and using new, more 
sustainable materials we are making progress in this area. 
In 2012, one of our supply chain teams developed a 
specific process to optimise how our products are 
shipped and reduce shipping ‘air around the world’. 
By implementing this process for outbound packaging 
operations, corrugated cardboard usage was reduced by 
over 6 tonnes and CO
2
 emissions reduced by 6,148kg in 
2012. These reductions will have a further positive impact 
in 2013 when the process is fully implemented.

* Smith & Nephew uses a normalisation process based on cost of 
production which is deﬁned as the cost of goods sold adjusted for opening 
and closing inventory levels. As production efﬁciencies are realised the 
cost of goods sold reduces and this can distort the effects of real 
environmental beneﬁts making them appear less than actually achieved. 
Smith & Nephew will include a longer commentary on the normalisation 
process in its full Sustainability Report published later this year.

In 2012, our overall waste rose by 5.1% largely due to 
equipment and layout changes, inventory adjustments 
arising from relocations and some building and demolition 
work. We are not satisfied with this and in 2013 we will 
increase our focus on the waste hierarchy, in particular 
prevention at source.
Significant improvements have been made in recycling 
waste which rose in 2012 by 21.3% and now stands 
at 58%.
Sustainability progress
Smith & Nephew retained its membership of the 
FTSE4Good. The FTSE4Good Index and Ratings have 
been designed to measure the performance of companies 
that meet or exceed globally recognised standards.
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI World) was 
established to track the performance of the world’s 
largest companies that lead the field in terms of corporate 
sustainability. Smith & Nephew’s score improved this year 
and our inclusion in the Index was maintained.
Smith & Nephew has been commended by the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which represents 655 
institutional investors with $78 trillion in assets, for its 
approach to the disclosure of climate change information. 
For the first time in 2012 Smith & Nephew is featured in 
CDP’s ‘Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index.’ This index, 
a key component of CDP’s annual FTSE 350 report, 
highlights the constituent companies within the FTSE 
350 Index which have displayed a strong approach 
to information disclosure regarding climate change. 
Companies are scored on their climate change disclosure 
and high scores indicate good internal data management 
and understanding of climate change related issues 
affecting the Company.
Our Goodlett Farms Innovation Centre in Memphis, 
TN, USA, achieved the internationally recognised LEED 
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold 
Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. This 
is the first LEED certified building in the global Smith & 
Nephew portfolio.

Suzhou: 55% energy saving for 
facility lighting
The lighting in the warehouse at the Advanced Wound 
Management facility in Suzhou, China has been 
upgraded by fitting electrodeless lamps resulting in 
a 55% energy saving. This equates to a reduction in 
use of over 85,000 kWh per annum and associated 
annual cost savings. The advantages also include 
extended lamp life and therefore lower maintenance 
and replacement costs.

Measuring performance
Revenue
‘Underlying growth in revenue’ is used to compare the revenue 
in a given year to the previous year on a like-for-like basis. This is 
achieved by adjusting for the impact of sales of products acquired 
in material business combinations and for movements in exchange 
rates. Underlying growth in revenue is not presented in the accounts 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) and is therefore a measure not in accordance with 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (a ‘non-GAAP’ measure).
The Group believes that the tabular presentation and reconciliation 
of reported revenue growth to underlying revenue growth assists 
investors in their assessment of the Group’s performance in each 
business segment and for the Group as a whole.
Underlying growth in revenue is considered by the Group to be 
an important measure of performance in terms of local functional 
currency since it excludes those items considered to be outside the 
influence of local management. The Group’s management uses this 
non-GAAP measure in its internal financial reporting, budgeting and 
planning to assess performance on both a business segment and 
a consolidated Group basis. Revenue growth at constant currency 
is important in measuring business performance compared to 
competitors and compared to the growth of the market itself.
The Group considers that revenue from sales of products acquired 
in material business combinations results in a step-up in growth in 
revenue in the year of acquisition that cannot be wholly attributed 
to local management’s efforts with respect to the business in the 
year of acquisition. Depending on the timing of the acquisition, 
there will usually be a further step change in the following year. 
A measure of growth excluding the effects of business combinations 
also allows senior management to evaluate the performance and 
relative impact of growth from the existing business and growth 
from acquisitions. The process of making business acquisitions 
is directed, approved and funded from the Group corporate centre 
in line with strategic objectives.
The material limitation of the underlying growth in revenue measure 
is that it excludes certain factors, described above, which ultimately 
have a significant impact on total revenues. The Group compensates 
for this limitation by taking into account relative movements in 
exchange rates in its investment, strategic planning and resource 
allocation. In addition, as the evaluation and assessment of 
business acquisitions is not within the control of local management, 
performance of acquisitions is monitored centrally until the business 
is integrated.
The Group’s management considers that the non-GAAP measure 
of underlying growth in revenue and the GAAP measure of 
growth in revenue are complementary measures, neither of which 
management uses exclusively.
‘Underlying growth in revenue’ reconciles to growth in revenue 
reported, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated 
in accordance with IFRS by making two adjustments, the ‘constant 
currency exchange effect’ and the ‘acquisitions effect’, described 
below.
The ‘constant currency exchange effect’ is a measure of the 
increase/decrease in revenue resulting from currency movements 
on non-US Dollar sales. This is measured as the difference between 
the increase in revenue translated into US Dollars on a GAAP basis 
(ie current year revenue translated at the current year average rate, 
prior year revenue translated at the prior year average rate) and the 
increase measured by translating current and prior year revenue into 
US Dollars using the prior year closing rate.
The ‘acquisitions effect’ is the measure of the impact on revenue 
from newly acquired business combinations. This is calculated by 
excluding the revenue from sales of products acquired as a result of 
a business combination consummated in the current year, with non-
US Dollar sales translated at the prior year average rate. Additionally, 
prior year revenue is adjusted to include a full year of revenue from 
the sales of products acquired in those business combinations 
consummated in the previous year, calculated by adding back 
revenue from sales of products in the period prior to the Group’s 
ownership. These sales are separately tracked in the Group’s internal 
reporting systems and are readily identifiable.
The ‘disposals effect’ is the measure of the impact on revenue 
from the disposal of business operations during the year. This is 
calculated by excluding the revenue from sales of products the 
Group no longer sells as a result of the disposal in the current year, 
with non-US Dollar sales translated at the prior year average rate. 
Additionally, prior year revenue is adjusted to remove a full year 
of revenue from the sales of products disposed. These sales are 
separately tracked in the Group’s internal reporting systems and are 
readily identifiable.
Reported revenue growth, the most directly comparable financial 
measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, reconciles to underlying 
growth in revenue as follows:

Trading profit
Trading profit is a trend measure which presents the long-term 
profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions 
that management considers affects the Group’s short-term 
profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in 
their understanding of trends. The Group has identified the following 
items, where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit 
when arriving at trading profit: acquisition and disposal related 
items including amortisation of acquisition intangible assets and 
impairments; significant restructuring events; acquisition costs; and 
gains and losses resulting from legal disputes and uninsured losses.
A reconciliation of operating profit to trading profit, by business 
segment, can be found on pages 22 to 33.
Adjusted earnings per Ordinary Share
Growth in ‘adjusted earnings per Ordinary Share (‘EPSA’)’ is another 
measure which presents the trend in the long-term profitability 
of the Group. EPSA is not a recognised measure under IFRS and 
is therefore a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly 
comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS is 
earnings per Ordinary Share.
EPSA excludes the same impact of specific transactions or 
events that management considers affect the Group’s short-term 
profitability, is used by the Group for similar purposes, and is subject 
to the same material limitations, as set out and discussed in the 
above section on trading profit.
Adjusted attributable profit represents the numerator used in 
the EPSA calculation. Adjusted attributable profit is reconciled to 
attributable profit, the most directly comparable financial measure in 
accordance with IFRS, as follows:
Growth in ‘trading profit’ and ‘trading profit margin’ (trading profit 
expressed as a percentage of revenue) are measures which present 
the growth trend in the long-term profitability of the Group excluding 
the impact of specific transactions or events that management 
considers affect the Group’s short-term profitability. The Group 
presents these measures to assist investors in their understanding 
of the trends. The Group’s international financial reporting (budgets, 
monthly reporting, forecasts, long-term planning and incentive plans) 
focuses primarily on profit and earnings before these items. Trading 
profit and trading profit margin are not recognised measures under 
IFRS and are therefore non-GAAP financial measures.

The material limitation of these measures is that they exclude 
significant income and costs that have a direct impact on current and 
prior years’ profit attributable to shareholders. They do not, therefore, 
measure the overall performance of the Group presented by the 
GAAP financial measure of operating profit. The Group considers 
that no single measure enables it to assess overall performance 
and therefore it compensates for the limitation of the trading profit 
measure by considering it in conjunction with its GAAP equivalent. 
The gains or losses which are identified separately arise from 
irregular events or transactions. Such events or transactions are 
authorised centrally and require a strategic assessment which 
includes consideration of financial returns and generation of 
shareholder value. Amortisation of acquisition intangibles will occur 
each year, whilst other excluded items arise irregularly depending on 
the events that give rise to such items.

Adjusted: Diluted 75.4¢ 74.2¢ 73.6¢
Trading cash flow and trading profit to cash 
conversion ratio
Growth in trading cash flow and improvement in the trading profit to 
cash conversion ratio are measures which present the trend growth 
in the long-term cash generation of the Group excluding the impact 
of specific transactions or events that management considers affect 
the Group’s short-term performance.
Trading cash flow is defined as cash generated from operations less 
net capital expenditure but before acquisition related cash flows, 
restructuring and rationalisation cash flows and cash flows arising 
from legal disputes and uninsured losses. Trading profit to cash 
conversion ratio is trading cash flow expressed as a percentage of 
trading profit. The nature and material limitations of these adjusted 
items are discussed above.
The Group presents those measures to assist investors in their 
understanding of trends. The Group’s internal financial reporting 
(budgets, monthly reporting, forecasts, long-term planning and 
incentive plans) focuses on cash generation before these items. 
Trading cash flow and trading profit to cash conversion ratio are not 
recognised measures under IFRS and are therefore considered non-
GAAP financial measures.
The material limitation of this measure is that it could exclude 
significant cash flows that have had a direct impact on the current 
and prior years’ financial performance of the Group. It does 
not, therefore, measure the financial performance of the Group 
presented by the GAAP measure of cash generated from operations. 
The Group considers that no single measure enables it to assess 
financial performance and therefore it compensates for the limitation 
of the trading cash flow measure by considering it in conjunction with 
the GAAP equivalents. Cash flows excluded relate to irregular events 
or transactions including acquisition related costs, restructuring and 
rationalisation costs and cash flows arising from legal disputes and 
uninsured losses.

(i)  Group revenue and operating profit are derived wholly from continuing operations 
and discussed on a segment basis on pages 22 to 33.
(ii)  In 2012, $3m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses were charged to cost of 
goods sold (2011 – $7m).
(iii)  2012 includes $51m of amortisation of other intangible assets (2011 – $42m).
(iv) 2012 includes $nil relating to legal provision (2011 – $23m).
(v)  2012 includes $62m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses, $43m relating 
to amortisation of acquisition intangibles and $11m acquisition related costs 
(2011 – $33m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses and $36m relating to 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles).
Revenue
Group revenue decreased by $133m (-3%) from $4,270m in 2011 to 
$4,137m in 2012. Underlying revenue growth was 2% of which -2% 
growth was attributable to unfavourable currency translation and -3% 
was attributable to the effect of disposing of the Clinical Therapies 
business. Advanced Surgical Devices revenues decreased by 
$143m (-4%), underlying growth was 2% of which -2% was due to 
unfavourable currency translation and -4% due to the disposal of 
the Clinical Therapies business. Advanced Wound Management 
revenues increased by $10m (1%), underlying growth was 4% with 
-3% due to unfavourable currency translation.
A more detailed analysis is included within the ‘Revenue’ sections of 
the individual business segments that follow on pages 22 and 33.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold decreased by $70m to $1,070m from $1,140m 
in 2011 which represents a 6% decrease. Of this movement, 1% is 
due to favourable currency translation movements. The remaining 
movement is largely attributable to the continued focus on costs, and 
partly attributable to the sale of the Clinical Therapies business in 
May 2012 which impacted both sales and cost of sales.
Further margin analysis is included within the ‘Trading profit’ sections 
of the individual business segments that follow on pages 22 to 33.
Marketing, selling and distribution expenses
Marketing, selling and distribution expenses decreased by $86m 
(-6%) to $1,440m from $1,526m in 2011. The underlying movement 
of -4% is after adjusting for favourable currency movement of -2%. 
Increased cost savings in Established markets were partly offset by 
investment in Emerging and International markets and promotion of 
new products particularly in Advanced Wound Management.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses increased by $35m (6%) to $610m from 
$575m in 2011. Favourable currency movements offset 2% of this 
increase. The main factors contributing to the underlying movement 
of 8% were an increase of $16m in amortisation on acquisition and 
other intangibles and an increase of $11m in acquisition costs.
Research and development expenses
Expenditure as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.2% to 4.1% in 
2012 (2011 – 3.9%). Actual expenditure was $171m in 2012 compared 
to $167m in 2011. The Group continues to invest in innovative 
technologies and products to differentiate it from competitors.
Operating profit
Operating profit decreased by $16m to $846m from $862m in 
2011. This comprised an increase of $2m in Advanced Surgical 
Devices and a decrease of $18m in Advanced Wound Management. 
Advanced Surgical Devices started to see the benefits of its focus 
on costs (more than offsetting the additional restructuring expense) 
whilst Advanced Wound Management has continued to invest in 
new products throughout the year and also acquired Healthpoint 
Biotherapeutics in December 2012, both increasing costs.
Net interest receivable/(payable)
Net interest payable reduced by $10m from $8m payable in 2011 to 
a receivable of $2m in 2012. This is a consequence of the overall 
reduction of borrowings within the Group, a reduction in the 
applicable interest rates and the $7m interest receivable on the 
Bioventus loan note issued following the disposal of the Clinical 
Therapies business.

Other finance cost
Other finance costs in 2012 were $3m compared to $6m in 2011. This 
decrease is attributable to an increase in the expected return on 
pension plan assets.
Taxation
The taxation charge increased by $105m to $371m from $266m in 
2011. The rate of tax was 33.7%, compared with 31.4% in 2011.
The tax charge increased by $82m in 2012 (2011 – $17m reduction) 
as result of the profit on disposal of the Clinical Therapies business 
partially offset by an increase in restructuring and rationalisation 
expenses, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and acquisition 
related costs. The tax rate was 29.9% (2011 – 29.9%) after adjusting 
for these items and the tax thereon.

Non-current assets
Non-current assets increased by $956m to $3,498m in 2012 from 
$2,542m in 2011. This is principally attributable to the following:
 – Goodwill increased by $90m from $1,096m in 2011 to $1,186m in 
2012. Of this movement $73m arose on the acquisition of 
Healthpoint. The balance relates to favourable currency movements 
totalling $17m.
 – Intangible assets increased by $641m from $423m in 2011 to 
$1,064m in 2012. Intangible assets totalling $662m arose on the 
Healthpoint acquisition. Amortisation of $94m was charged during 
the year and assets with a net book value of $3m were written-off. A 
total of $68m relates to the cost of intellectual property and software 
acquired. The balance relates to favourable currency movements 
totalling $8m.
 – Property, plant and equipment increased by $10m from $783m in 
2011 to $793m in 2012. Depreciation of $212m was charged during 
2012 and assets with a net book value of $9m were written-off. 
These movements were largely offset by $197m of additions relating 
primarily to instruments and other plant & machinery and $27m of 
additions arising on the Healthpoint acquisition. The balance relates 
to favourable currency movements totalling $7m. 
 – Deferred tax assets decreased by $59m in the year.
 – The total investment in associates has increased from $13m in 2011 
to $283m in 2012. This movement predominately relates to the 
acquisition of Bioventus during the year totalling $114m plus $160m 
in the form of a loan note to Bioventus.
Current assets
Current assets increased by $64m to $2,144m from $2,080m in 2011. 
The movement relates to the following:
 – Inventories rose by $42m to $901m in 2012 from $859m in 2011. Of 
this movement, $46m arose on the Healthpoint acquisition and it 
includes $9m relating to favourable currency movements. 
 – The level of trade and other receivables increased by $28m to 
$1,065m in 2012 from $1,037m in 2011. This movement includes 
$31m arising on the Healthpoint acquisition and $8m related to 
favourable currency movements. 
 – Cash and cash equivalents have fallen by $6m to $178m from $184m 
in 2011.
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities increased by $406m from $422m in 2011 to 
$828m in 2012. This movement relates to the following items:
 – Long-term borrowings have risen from $16m in 2011 to $430m in 
2012. This increase of $414m is attributable to the acqusition of 
Healthpoint for $782m cash in December 2012.
 – The net retirement benefit obligation decreased by $21m to $266m 
in 2012 from $287m in 2011. This was largely due to the Group’s 
additional pension contributions which were partialy offset by net 
actuarial losses for the year.
 – Deferred acquisition consideration remains at $8m at the end of 
2012. This relates to the acquisition of Tenet Medical Engineering 
during 2011.
 – Provisions increased from $45m in 2011 to $63m in 2012. The 
pricipal component of this movement is $13m arising on the 
Healthpoint acquisition.
 – Deferred tax liabilities decreased by $5m in the year.
Current liabilities
Current liabilities decreased by $189m from $1,119m in 2011 to $930m 
in 2012. This movement is attributable to:
 – Bank overdrafts and current borrowings have decreased by $268m 
from $306m in 2011 to $38m in 2012.
 – Trade and other payables have increased by $92m to $656m in 2012 
from $564m in 2011. The primary cause of this increase is the 
acqusition of Healthpoint which increased trade and other payables 
by $49m.
 – Provisions have decreased by $19m from $78m in 2011 to $59m in 
2012. The most significant item contributing to this decrease is the 
payment of $22m to settle the legal provision (see Note 3). 
 – Current tax payable is $177m at the end of 2012 compared to $171m 
in 2011.

(iv)  2011 includes $42m of amortisation of other intangible assets (2010 – $34m).
(v)  2011 includes $23m relating to legal provision (2010 – $nil).
(vi)  2011 includes $33m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses and $36m 
relating to amortisation of acquisition intangibles (2010 – $12m of restructuring 
and rationalisation expenses and $34m relating to amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles).
Revenue
Group revenue increased by $308m (8%) from $3,962m in 2010 to 
$4,270m in 2011. Underlying revenue growth was 4% and 4% growth 
was attributable to favourable currency translation.
Advanced Surgical Devices revenue increased by $201m (7%) 
to $3,251m in 2011 from $3,050m in 2010. The underlying 
revenue growth was 3% with favourable currency movements 
also contributing 4% to the growth in the year. Advanced Wound 
Management revenues increased by $107m (12%), of which 7% was 
attributable to underlying growth and 5% due to favourable currency 
translation.
A more detailed analysis is included within the ‘Revenue’ sections of 
the individual business segments that follow on pages 22 and 33.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold increased by $109m to $1,140m from $1,031m in 
2010 which represents an 11% increase. Of this movement, 4% is due 
to adverse translation movements leaving an underlying movement 
of 7% compared to an increase in underlying revenue of 4%. The 
residual movement is largely attributable to continued pricing 
pressure across all of the Group’s markets which Smith & Nephew 
was not able to pass on to suppliers and an adverse movement in 
the mix of products sold, towards lower gross margin product.
Further margin analysis is included within the ‘Trading profit’ sections 
of the individual business segments on pages 22 to 33.
Marketing, selling and distribution expenses
Marketing, selling and distribution expenses increased by $112m 
(8%) to $1,526m from $1,414m in 2010. After adjusting for an 
unfavourable currency movement of 3% the underlying movement of 
5% is broadly in line with increased Group revenues.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses increased by $129m (29%) to $575m from 
$446m in 2010. Unfavourable currency movements contributed 
towards 5% of this increase. The factors contributing to the 
underlying movement of 24% were; the non-recurrence of the one-
off benefit of $25m arising from the BlueSky settlement in 2010, a 
charge of $23m relating to legal provision, an increase of $21m in 
restructuring and rationalisation expenses, an increase of $12m 
in the bad debt expense and an $8m increase in the amortisation 
charge on intangible assets. Other factors contributing to this 
increase included the additional investment in China and Emerging 
markets during 2011.
Research and development expenses
Expenditure as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.1% to 3.9% in 
2011 (2010 – 3.8%). Actual expenditure was $167m in 2011 compared 
to $151m in 2010. The Group continues to invest in innovative 
technologies and products to differentiate it from competitors.
Operating profit
Operating profit decreased by $58m to $862m from $920m in 2010 
comprising a decrease of $70m in Advanced Surgical Devices, offset 
by an increase of $12m in Advanced Wound Management.
Net interest payable
Net interest payable reduced by $7m from $15m in 2010 to $8m in 
2011. This is a consequence of the overall reduction of borrowings 
within the Group and a reduction in the applicable interest rates.
Other finance cost
Other finance costs in 2011 were $6m compared to $10m in 2010. 
This decrease is attributable to an increase in the expected return on 
pension plan assets.

a consequence of restructuring and rationalisation expenses, 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles and legal provision. The 
effective tax rate was 29.9% (2010 – 30.8%) after adjusting for these 
items and the tax thereon.

Non-current assets
Non-current assets decreased by $37m to $2,542m in 2011 from 
$2,579m in 2010. This is attributable to the following:
 – Goodwill decreased by $5m from $1,101m in 2010 to $1,096m in 2011. 
Goodwill totalling $37m was transferred to assets held for sale. 
Following the acquisition of Tenet Medical Engineering during 2011, 
an amount of $44m was capitalised as goodwill. The balance relates 
to unfavourable currency movements totalling $12m.
 – Intangible assets decreased by $3m from $426m in 2010 to $423m 
in 2011. Intangible assets totalling $14m were transferred to assets 
held for sale. Amortisation of $78m was charged during the year and 
assets with a net book value of $2m were written-off. A total of $92m 
relates to the addition of intellectual property and software. The 
balance relates to unfavourable currency movements totalling $1m.
 – Property, plant and equipment decreased by $4m from $787m in 
2010 to $783m in 2011. Property, plant and equipment totalling $3m 
were transferred to assets held for sale. Depreciation of $217m was 
charged during 2011 and assets with a net book value of $7m were 
written-off. These movements were largely offset by $229m of 
additions relating primarily to instruments and other plant and 
machinery. The balance relates to unfavourable currency 
movements totalling $6m.
 – Trade and other receivables decreased by $22m to $nil in 2011 from 
$22m in 2010 due to non-current receivables switching to current 
receivables during the year.
 – Deferred tax assets and other non-current assets decreased by 
$3m in the year.
Current assets
Current assets decreased by $74m to $2,080m from $2,154m 
in 2010.
The movement relates to the following:
 – Inventories fell by $64m to $859m in 2011 from $923m in 2010. 
Inventories totalling $15m were transferred to assets held for sale. 
Of the remaining movement, $10m related to unfavourable currency 
movements.
 – The level of trade and other receivables increased by $13m to 
$1,037m in 2011 from $1,024m in 2010. Trade and other receivables 
totalling $49m were transferred to assets held for sale. Of the 
movement in the year, $18m related to unfavourable currency 
movements.
 – Cash and bank has fallen by $23m to $184m from $207m in 2010. 
Of the movement, $2m related to unfavourable currency movements.
Assets held for sale
Assets held for sale totalling $125m relate to the underlying assets 
of the Clinical Therapies business, the proposed sale of which was 
announced on 4 January 2012 and completed on 4 May 2012.
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities decreased by $624m from $1,046m in 2010 to 
$422m in 2011. This movement relates to the following items:
 – Long-term borrowings have fallen from $642m in 2010 to $16m in 
2011. This decrease of $626m is mainly attributable to the long-term 
loan repayable in May 2012 switching to a current liability.
 – The net retirement benefit obligation increased by $25m to $287m 
in 2011 from $262m in 2010. This was largely due to actuarial losses 
of $70m which were only partly offset by pension contributions.
 – Deferred acquisition consideration was $8m at the end of 2011, 
an increase of $8m from $nil at the end of 2010 as a result of the 
acquisition of Tenet Medical Engineering during the year.
 – Provisions decreased from $73m in 2010 to $45m in 2011 which 
is largely due to a number of settlements during the year.
 – Deferred tax liabilities decreased by $3m in the year.
Current liabilities
Current liabilities increased by $205m from $914m in 2010 to $1,119m 
in 2011. This movement is attributable to:
 – Bank overdrafts and current borrowings have increased by $249m 
from $57m in 2010 to $306m in 2011 mainly as a result of the 
long-term loan repayable in May 2012 switching to a current liability.
 – Trade and other payables have decreased by $53m to $564m in 
2011 from $617m in 2010. Trade and other payables totalling $19m 
were transferred to liabilities directly associated with assets held for 
sale. An amount of $8m is attributable to favourable currency 
movements.
 – Provisions have increased by $41m from $37m in 2010 to $78m in 
2011. The most significant item contributing to this increase is the 
$23m legal provision (see Note 3).
 – Current tax payable is $171m at the end of 2011 compared to $203m 
in 2010. Of the $32m reduction, $1m is attributable to favourable 
currency movements.

Transactional and translational exchange
The Group’s principal markets outside the US are, in order of 
significance, Continental Europe, UK, Australia and Japan. Revenues 
in these markets fluctuate when translated into US Dollars on 
consolidation. During the year, the average rates of exchange against 
the US Dollar used to translate revenues and profits arising in these 
markets changed compared to the previous year as follows: the Euro 
strengthened from $1.39 to $1.28 (+8%), Sterling weakened from 
$1.60 to $1.58 (-1%), the Swiss Franc weakened from $1.13 to $1.07 
(-5%), the Australian Dollar strengthened from $1.03 to $1.04 (1%) and 
the Japanese Yen stayed flat at ¥80.
The Group’s principal manufacturing locations are in the US 
(Advanced Surgical Devices), Switzerland (Advanced Surgical 
Devices), UK (Advanced Wound Management and Advanced 
Surgical Devices) and China (Advanced Surgical Devices and 
Advanced Wound Management). The majority of the Group’s selling 
and distribution subsidiaries around the world purchase finished 
products from these locations. As a result of currency movements 
compared with the previous year, sales from the US became 
relatively less profitable to all of these countries. The Group’s policy 
of purchasing forward a proportion of its currency requirements and 
the existence of an inventory pipeline reduce the short-term impact 
of currency movements.

Net cash inflow from operating activities
Cash generated from operations in 2012 of $1,184m (2011 – $1,135m, 
2010 – $1,111m) is after paying out $nil (2011 – $3m, 2010 – $5m) 
of macrotextured claim settlements unreimbursed by insurers, 
$3m (2011 – $1m, 2010 – $nil) of acquisition related costs, $55m 
(2011 – $20m, 2010 – $16m) of restructuring and rationalisation 
expenses and $22m (2011 – $nil, 2010 – $nil) relating to a legal 
settlement.
Capital expenditure
The Group’s ongoing capital expenditure and working capital 
requirements were financed through cash flow generated by 
business operations and, where necessary, through short-term 
committed and uncommitted bank facilities. In recent years, capital 
expenditure on tangible and intangible fixed assets represented 
approximately 6% of continuing Group revenue.
In 2012, gross capital expenditure amounted to $265m (2011 – 
$321m, 2010 – $315m). The principal areas of investment were the 
placement of orthopaedic instruments with customers, patents and 
licences, plant and equipment and information technology.
At 31 December 2012, $4m (2011 – $9m, 2010 – $15m) of capital 
expenditure had been contracted but not provided for which will be 
funded from cash inflows.
Acquisitions and disposals
In the three-year period ended 31 December 2012, $815m was 
spent on acquisitions, funded from net debt and cash inflows. This 
comprised, $33m for Tenet Medical Engineering during 2011 and 
$782m for Healthpoint acquired in December 2012. There were no 
acquisitions in 2010.
During 2012 the Group completed the transfer of its Biologics and 
Clinical Therapies business (CT) to Bioventus LCC (‘Bioventus’) for 
total consideration of $367m. As part of this transaction the Group 
paid $104m for 49% of Bioventus and subsequently invested a 
further $10m.

Liquidity
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient funding and 
facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements. In 
December 2010, the Group entered into a five-year $1bn multi-
currency revolving facility with an initial interest of 70 basis points 
over LIBOR.
At 31 December 2012, the Group held $178m (2011 – $184m, 2010 
– $207m) in cash and balances at bank. The Group has committed 
and uncommitted facilities of $1.0bn and $0.3bn respectively. 
The undrawn committed facilities totalling $0.6bn expires after two 
but within five years (2011 – $1.0bn expires after two but within five 
years). Smith & Nephew intends to repay the amounts due within 
one year by using available cash and drawing down on the longer-
term facilities. In addition, Smith & Nephew has finance lease 
commitments of $16m (of which $6m extends beyond five years).
The principal variations in the Group’s borrowing requirements result 
from the timing of dividend payments, acquisitions and disposals 
of businesses, timing of capital expenditure and working capital 
fluctuations. Smith & Nephew believes that its capital expenditure 
needs and its working capital funding for 2013, as well as its other 
known or expected commitments or liabilities, can be met from its 
existing resources and facilities. The Group’s net debt decreased 
from $943m at the beginning of 2010 to $288m at the end of 2012, 
representing an overall decrease of $655m. 
The Group’s planned future contributions are considered adequate 
to cover the current underfunded position in the Group’s defined 
benefit plans.
Further disclosure regarding borrowings, related covenants and the 
liquidity risk exposures is set out in Note 15 of the Notes to the Group 
accounts. The Group believes that its borrowing facilities do not 
contain restrictions that would have significant impact on its funding 
or investment policy for the foreseeable future.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the ‘Financial review and principal risks’ section on pages 54 
to 55. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are described under ‘Financial 
position, liquidity and capital resources’ within the ‘Financial review’ 
section set out on page 50. In addition, the notes to the financial 
statements include the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its 
exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and its customers 
and suppliers are diversified across different geographic areas. 
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risk successfully despite the ongoing 
uncertain economic outlook.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis for accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Management also believes that the Group has sufficient working 
capital for its present requirements.
Payment policies
It is the Group’s and Company’s policy to ensure that suppliers are 
paid within agreed terms. At the year-end the Company had no trade 
creditors.
Factors affecting Smith & Nephew’s 
results of operations 
Government economic, fiscal, monetary and political policies are all 
factors that materially affect the Group’s operation or investments 
of shareholders. Other factors include sales trends, currency 
fluctuations and innovation. Each of these factors is discussed 
further in the ‘Marketplace and Business Segment review’ on pages 
19 to 33 and ‘Taxation information for shareholders’ on pages 154  
to 155.
Critical accounting policies
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out in Notes 1 to 
24 of the Notes to the Group accounts. Of those, the policies which 
require the most use of management’s judgment are as follows:
Inventories
A feature of the Advanced Surgical Devices division (whose finished 
goods inventory makes up approximately 83% of the Group total 
finished goods inventory) is the high level of product inventory 
required, some of which is located at customer premises and is 
available for customers’ immediate use. Complete sets of product, 
including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this 
way. These sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and 
towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of 
requirements. Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required 
to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation. 
These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula 
based on levels of inventory compared with historical usage. This 
formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first 
applied when a product group has been on the market for two years. 
This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on 
experience, but it does involve management judgments on customer 
demand, effectiveness of inventory deployment, length of product 
lives, phase-out of old products and efficiency of manufacturing 
planning systems.
Impairment
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill, intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, a number of significant assumptions 
have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. These 
include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market 
demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired 
businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success 
in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ or 
changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required 
which would adversely impact operating results.
015914_Smith&Nephew_AR12_p42-p53 (Working Copy).indd   51 26/02/2013   09:33 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2012 52
Retirement benefits
A number of key judgments have to be made in calculating the 
fair value of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans. These 
assumptions impact the Balance Sheet liability, operating profit 
and other finance income/costs. The most critical assumptions 
are the discount rate and mortality assumptions to be applied 
to future pension plan liabilities. For example as of 31 December 
2012, a 0.5% increase in discount rate would have reduced the 
combined UK and US pension plan deficit by $28m whilst a 0.5% 
decrease would have increased the combined deficit by $33m. A 
0.5% increase in discount rate would have decreased profit before 
taxation by $1m whilst a 0.5% decrease would have increased it 
by $1m. A one-year increase in the assumed life expectancy of the 
average 60 year old male pension plan member in both the UK and 
US would have increased the combined deficit by $23m. In making 
these judgments, management takes into account the advice of 
professional external actuaries and benchmarks its assumptions 
against external data.
The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on 
high quality corporate bonds, with currency and term consistent with 
those of the liabilities. In particular for the UK and US, the discount 
rate is derived by reference to an AA yield curve derived by the 
Group’s actuarial advisers.
See Note 19 of the Notes to the Group accounts for a summary of 
how the assumptions selected in the last five years have compared 
with actual results.
Contingencies and provisions
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to 
a significant degree of estimation. Provision is made for loss 
contingencies when it is considered probable that an adverse 
outcome will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably 
estimated. In making its estimates, management takes into account 
the advice of internal and external legal counsel. Provisions are 
reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to 
reflect developments in the disputes. The ultimate liability may 
differ from the amount provided depending on the outcome 
of court proceedings or settlement negotiations or if new facts come 
to light.
The group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the 
world. Although it is group policy to submit its tax returns to the 
relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, at any given time 
the group has unagreed years outstanding and is involved in 
disputes and tax audits. Significant issues may take several years to 
resolve. In estimating the probability and amount of any tax charge, 
management takes into account the views of internal and external 
advisers and updates the amount of provision whenever necessary. 
The ultimate tax liability may differ from the amount provided 
depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations 
or changes in legislation.
Legal proceedings
The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal 
proceedings, some of which include claims for substantial damages. 
The outcome of these proceedings cannot readily be foreseen, but 
management believes none of them are likely to result in a material 
adverse effect on the financial position of the Group. The Group 
provides for outcomes that are deemed to be probable and can be 
reliably estimated. There is no assurance that losses will not exceed 
the provision or will not have a significant impact on the Group’s 
results of operations or financial condition in the period in which 
they are realised.
Product liability claims
In August 2003, the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the 
macrotextured versions of its Oxinium femoral knee components. 
A number of related claims have been filed, most of which have 
been settled. The aggregate cost at 31 December 2012 related to 
this matter is approximately $214m. The Group has sought recovery 
from its primary and excess insurers for costs of resolving the claims. 
The primary insurance carrier has paid $60m in full settlement of its 
policy liability. However, the excess carriers have denied coverage, 
citing defences relating to the wording of the insurance policies and 
other matters. In December 2004, the Group brought suit against 
them in the US district court for the Western District of Tennessee, 
and trial is expected to commence in 2014. An additional $22m was 
received in 2007 from a successful settlement with a third party.
A charge of $154m was recorded in 2004 for anticipated expenses in 
connection with macrotexture claims. Most of that amount has since 
been applied to settlements of such claims. Management believes 
that the $17m provision remaining is adequate to cover remaining 
claims. Given the uncertainty inherent in such matters, there can be 
no assurance on this point.
The Group faces other claims from time to time for alleged defects 
in its products and has on occasion recalled or withdrawn products 
to minimise risk of harm or claims. Such claims are endemic to the 
orthopaedic device industry. The group maintains product liability 
insurance subject to limits and deductibles that management 
believes are reasonable.
Currently, there is heightened concern about possible adverse 
effects of hip implant products with metal-on-metal bearing surfaces 
and the Group expects to incur expenses to defend claims in this 
area. The Group takes care to monitor the clinical evidence relating 
to its metal hip implant products and ensure that its product offerings 
and training are designed to serve patients’ interests.
Business practice investigations
In March 2005 the US attorney’s office in Newark, New Jersey 
issued subpoenas to the five largest sellers of hip and knee implants 
to US orthopaedic surgeons, including the Group’s orthopaedic 
business, asking for information regarding arrangements with 
orthopaedic reconstructive surgeons. In September 2007, the Group 
(and the other four companies involved) settled the charges that 
could have resulted from this investigation, without admitting any 
wrongdoing as part of the settlement. At the same time, the Group 
entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (‘CIA’) with the Office 
of the Inspector General (‘OIG’) of the US Department of Health 
and Human Services which requires certain compliance efforts. 
This agreement was for a five-year term.
On 11 December 2012 the OIG notified the group that it had 
met its CIA requirements and that the five-year term of the CIA 
had concluded.
In September 2007, the SEC notified the Group that it was 
conducting an informal investigation of companies in the medical 
devices industry, including the Group, regarding possible violations 
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (‘FCPA’) in connection with 
the sale of products in certain countries outside of the US. The US 
Department of Justice (‘DOJ’) subsequently joined the SEC’s request.

On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had 
reached settlement with the SEC and DOJ in connection with this 
matter. Smith & Nephew has paid slightly less than $23m in fines 
and profit disgorgement and committed to maintain an enhanced 
compliance programme and appoint an independent monitor for at 
least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme to 
both the SEC and DOJ. The settlement agreements impose detailed 
reporting, compliance and other requirements on Smith & Nephew 
for a three-year term. Failure to comply with these requirements, 
or any other violation of law, could have severe consequences 
for the Group.
Intellectual property disputes
The Group is engaged, as both plaintiff and defendant, in litigation 
with various competitors and others over claims of patent 
infringement and other intellectual property matters. These disputes 
are being heard in courts in the United States and other jurisdictions 
and also before agencies that examine patents. Outcomes are rarely 
certain and costs are often significant.
From the Group’s entry into the negative pressure wound therapy 
business in 2007, Kinetic Concepts, Inc. (‘KCI’) pursued claims of 
patent infringement against the Group in the US, UK, Germany 
and other jurisdictions, asserting both its own patents and others 
exclusively licensed to KCI by Wake Forest University. During the 
course of 2012, the Group reached agreements with KCI and Wake 
Forest to resolve all pending claims. 
The Group has twice won jury verdicts in the US district court for 
Oregon against Arthrex Inc. for infringement of the Group’s patents 
relating to suture anchors. Judgement was entered in favour of the 
Group after the first verdict but reversed on appeal and remanded 
for a new trial. The verdict in the new trial was overturned by the 
district court but then (in January 2013) reinstated on appeal.
Other matters
In April 2009, the Group was served with a subpoena by the US 
Department of Justice in Massachusetts requiring the production 
of documents from 1995 to 2009 associated with the marketing 
and sale of the Group’s EXOGEN bone growth stimulator. Similar 
subpoenas have been served on a number of competitors in 
the bone growth stimulator market. Around the same time a qui 
tam or ‘whistleblower’ complaint concerning the industry’s sales 
and marketing of those products, originally filed in 2005 against 
the primary manufacturers of bone growth stimulation products 
(including Smith & Nephew), was unsealed in federal court in 
Boston, Massachusetts. A motion to dismiss that complaint was 
denied in December 2010.
The Group is subject to country of origin requirements under the 
US Buy American and Trade Agreements Acts with regard to sales 
to certain US government customers. The Group has voluntarily 
disclosed to the US Veterans Administration and the US Department 
of Defense that a small percentage of the products sold to the US 
government in the past, primarily from the orthopaedics business, 
may have originated from countries that are not eligible for such 
sales except with government consent. Government auditors 
subsequently conducted an on-site visit at the Group’s orthopaedics 
business. In December 2008, three months after Smith & Nephew’s 
initial voluntary disclosure, a whistleblower suit was filed in the US 
district court for the Western district of Tennessee alleging these 
violations. Smith & Nephew’s motion to dismiss the suit was denied 
in November 2010.
Outlook and trend information
The discussion below contains certain forward-looking statements 
that may or may not prove accurate. For example, statements 
regarding expected revenue growth and trading margins, market 
trends and our product pipeline are forward-looking statements. 
Phrases such as ‘aim’, ‘plan’, ‘intend’, ‘anticipate’, ‘well placed’, 
‘believe’, ‘estimate’, ‘target’, ‘consider’, and similar expressions 
are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and 
uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking 
statements. For Smith & Nephew, these factors include: economic 
and financial conditions in the markets we serve, especially those 
affecting healthcare providers, payors and customers; price levels 
for established and innovative medical devices; developments in 
medical technology; regulatory approvals; reimbursement decisions 
or other government actions; products defects or recalls; litigation 
relating to patent or other claims; legal compliance risks and 
related investigative, remedial or enforcement actions; strategic 
actions, including acquisitions and depositions and our success in 
integrating acquired businesses; and numerous other matters which 
affect us or our markets, including those of a political, economic 
business or competitive nature.
Additional information on factors that could cause the Group’s 
actual results to differ from estimates reflected in these forward-
looking statements, can be found under ‘Principal risks and risk 
management’ section on pages 54 to 55.
Information regarding the recent and longer term market growth 
trends is given for each of the Group’s divisions in the relevant 
‘Market and competition’ sections under ‘Business segment reviews’ 
on pages 22 to 33.
Smith & Nephew expects the market conditions seen in 2012 
broadly to continue in 2013. 
During 2013, the Group expects to maintain its excellent record in 
Advanced Wound Management and again grow at above the market 
rate. 
Trauma and Extremities are expected to continue to build upon 
recent investments and grow slightly ahead of the market rate.
In Sports Medicine, the Group anticipates growing at around the 
market rate, with a stronger finish to the year, as new products are 
introduced in the second half of 2013.
Orthopaedic Reconstruction is likely to grow more slowly than the 
market, reflecting the Group’s position in the product cycle and 
the metal-on-metal headwinds, albeit with performance improving 
throughout the year as we realise the benefits of recent and planned 
product launches.
The Group exceeded its trading profit margin expectation for 2012 
and remains focused on creating a business capable of delivering a 
sustainable 24% margin. 
During 2013, the Group expects further benefits will be gained from 
our efficiency programme and will continue investing for growth. The 
first effects of the US Medical Device excise tax and the Healthpoint 
acquisition, which is initially dilutive to the Group margin, will be seen 
in 2013. Taking all these factors together, our trading profit margin in 
2013 is expected to be below the 23.3% achieved in 2012.
Smith & Nephew exited 2012 with a much stronger platform than we 
entered the year. In 2013 we will continue to focus on our Strategic 
Priorities to deliver greater value for our Company and stakeholders.

Principal risks and risk management
Risk Context Specific risks we face
Disruptive 
technologies
The medical devices industry has a rapid rate of new product 
introduction. The Group must be adept at monitoring the landscape for 
technological advances, make good investment/acquisition choices, 
have an efficient and valuable product development pipeline and secure 
protection for its intellectual property.
 – Competitors may introduce a disruptive technology, 
or obtain patents or other intellectual property rights, 
that affect the Group’s competitive position
 – Claims by third parties regarding infringement of their 
intellectual property rights
 – Lack of innovation due to low R&D investment, R&D 
skills gap or poor product development execution for 
established and emerging markets
 – Failure to successfully commercialise a pipeline 
product, or failure to receive regulatory approval
Government 
action, 
pricing and 
reimbursement  
pressure
In most markets throughout the world, expenditure on medical devices 
is controlled to a large extent by governments, many of which are facing 
increasingly intense budgetary constraints. The Group is therefore largely 
dependent on governments providing increased funds commensurate 
with the increased demand arising from demographic trends. 
Reimbursement rates may be set in response to perceived economic 
value of the devices, based on clinical and other data relating to cost, 
patient outcomes and comparative effectiveness. Political upheaval in 
the countries where the Group operates or surrounding regions could 
adversely affect Group operations or turnover.
Group operations are affected by transactional exchange rate 
movements. The Group’s manufacturing cost base is situated in the 
US, UK, China and Switzerland and finished products are exported 
worldwide.
 – Reduced reimbursement levels and increasing 
pricing pressures
 – Reduced demand for elective surgery
 – Increased focus on health economics
 – Government policies favouring lower priced products
 – Political upheavals prevent selling of products, 
receiving remittances of profit from a member of the 
Group or future investments in that country
 – The Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange 
rates. If the manufacturing country currencies 
strengthen against the selling currencies, the trading 
margin may be affected
 – Economic downturn impacts demand and collections
Supply,  
system and site 
disruption
Unexpected events could disrupt the business by affecting either a key 
facility or system or a large number of employees. The business is also 
reliant on certain key suppliers of raw materials, components, finished 
products and packaging materials.
 – Catastrophe could render one of the Group’s 
production facilities out of action
 – A significant event could impact key leadership or a 
large number of employees
 – Issues with a single source supplier of a key 
component and failure to secure critical supply
 – A severe IT fault could disable critical systems
Product safety ,  
regulation, and 
litigation
National regulatory authorities enforce a complex series of laws and 
regulations that govern the design, development, approval, manufacture, 
labelling, marketing and sale of healthcare products. They also review 
data supporting the safety and efficacy of such products and may also 
inspect for compliance with appropriate standards, including those 
relating to Quality Management Systems (‘QMS’) or Good Manufacturing 
Practice (‘GMP’) regulations.
 – Non-compliance with product regulations and 
standards could result in fines, penalties, and 
prosecutions
 – Product defect could result in lost sales and inventory 
write-offs
 – Third party liability claims
 – Damage to reputation
Compliance  
with laws  
and regulations
Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to increasing 
scrutiny by government authorities. The trend in many countries is 
towards increased enforcement activity. The Group is also subject to 
increased regulation of personal information. Acquisitions and expansion 
into Emerging markets could also pose additional compliance risks.
 – Violation of healthcare, data privacy or anti-corruption 
laws could result in fines, loss of reimbursement and 
impact reputation
 – Serious breaches could potentially prevent the Group 
from doing business in a certain market
 – Failure to conduct adequate due diligence or to 
integrate appropriate internal controls into acquired 
businesses could result in fines and impact return 
on investment
As an integral part of planning and review, Group and business 
area management seek to identify the significant risks involved 
in the business, and to review the risk management action plans 
for those risks. The Group Risk Committee, which is comprised of 
the CEO and senior executives, meets twice a year to review the 
risks identified by the businesses and corporate functions and any 
risk management actions being taken. As appropriate, the Risk 
Committee may re-categorise risks or require further information on 
the risk management action plans. The Risk Committee reports to the 
Board on an annual basis detailing all principal risks. In addition, the 
Board considers risk as part of the development of strategy. Internal 
audit reviews and reports on the effectiveness of the operation of the 
risk management process.

There are known and unknown risks and uncertainties relating to 
Smith & Nephew’s business. The table below provides an overview 
of what the Board considers the most significant risks that could 
cause the Group’s business, financial position and results of 
operations to differ materially and adversely from expected and 
historical levels, and how these risks relate to the Group’s strategic 
priorities. In addition, other factors not listed here that Smith & Nephew 
cannot presently identify or does not believe to be equally significant, 
could also materially adversely affect Smith & Nephew’s business, 
financial position or results of operations.

Governance introduction
Dear Shareholder ,
I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Statement for 2012. 
Before we get into the technical detail of specific corporate goverance 
requirements, I wanted to highlight the governance areas we have focused 
on in 2012.
Board changes
We have continued to make changes to our Board throughout the year. As 
you will have read elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are delighted that 
Julie Brown has joined us as Chief Financial Officer on 4 February 2013. She 
will continue to build on the strong foundations laid by Adrian Hennah who 
left the Board on 31 December 2012. Adrian has contributed enormously to 
the success of the Company over the past six years and we are sorry to see 
him leave but wish him well in his future career.
We have also made a number of changes to our Non-Executive team. On 
12 April 2012, Rolf Stomberg left the Board following 14 years’ service as a 
Non-Executive Director, during which time he served periods as Senior 
Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. On 
1 November 2012, Geneviève Berger left the Board owing to other time 
commitments. During the year, we were pleased to welcome Ajay Piramal 
to the Board on 1 January 2012 and Baroness Bottomley on 12 April 2012. 
Finally, we shall be appointing Michael Friedman to the Board in April. These 
three new appointments reflect the changing focus of the Group, as we build 
a Board that will take us into the future. Ajay brings experience of Emerging 
markets and Baroness Bottomley brings her knowledge and experience 
of European public healthcare systems whilst Michael Friedman brings 
exceptional experience of the US Healthcare market. These are all areas vital 
to our future growth and prospects.
Ethics and compliance
Ethics and compliance remain at the very heart of our business and 
everything that we do. The independent monitor appointed to review our 
efforts recognised and supported the enhancements we have made over 
the past five years to our ethics and compliance programme, whilst making 
some very valuable suggestions about further improvements in what is a 
constantly evolving aspect of our business. We continue to remain vigilant in 
these areas and the Ethics & Compliance Committee of the Board sets the 
tone at the top in overseeing our ethics and compliance programme, which 
pervades the entire organisation.
Nomination & Governance Committee
In recognition of all the external developments in corporate governance, we 
have expanded the remit of the Nominations Committee to cover governance 
matters and to rename the committee, the Nomination & Governance 
Committee. For some time the Committee has considered certain 
governance matters such as the independence of Non-Executive Directors, 
diversity and the Board Evaluation process. This change of remit formalises 
the role of the Committee, which now includes Board succession planning, 
independence of Non-Executive Directors, diversity, conflicts of interest, 
oversight of the effective governance of the Board and its committees, the 
Board Evaluation process, the induction of new directors and directors 
training in general, as well as keeping abreast of external governance 
activities.
Review of the Board’s Effectiveness
Having conducted our own internal evaluation of the Board’s effectiveness in 
2010 and 2011, we asked Independent Audit to facilitate the review process 
in 2012. This took the form of a series of interviews with each member 
of the Board, the Company Secretary and other members of the senior 
management team who interact with our Board. Independent Audit also 
reviewed the Board and Committee papers over the past year and observed 
our December Board meeting. Their comments and observations gave us a 
useful perspective into the way we operate as a Board. You can read more 
about this review in the statement that follows. A key takeaway for us was the 
need to give even greater focus to succession at Board level. 
As ever, whilst we recognise the importance of sound governance, we are 
continually focused on the Board’s responsibility to promote the long-term 
success of the Company for the benefit of customers, employees and 
shareholders.

Compliance statement
We are committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and 
comply with all the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’). The Company’s American Depositary Shares are listed on the 
NYSE and we are therefore subject to the rules of the NYSE as well as to 
the US securities laws and the rules of the SEC applicable to foreign private 
issuers. We comply with the requirements of the SEC and NYSE except 
that the Nomination & Governance Committee is not comprised wholly of 
independent Directors, as required by the NYSE, but consists of a majority of 
independent Directors in accordance with the Code. We shall explain in this 
Corporate Governance Statement and in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
how we have applied the provisions and principles of the FSA’s Listing Rules, 
Disclosure & Transparency Rules (‘DTR’) and the Code throughout the year.
Board
The Board is responsible for determining the strategy of the Chief Executive 
Officer and his Executive team implement that strategy. More detail about 
the structure of the Board, the matters we deal with and the key activities we 
undertook in 2012 is on page 63.
Roles of Directors
Whilst we all share collective responsibility for the activities of the Board, 
some of our roles have been defined in greater detail. In particular, the roles 
and responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are clearly 
defined.
Chairman
 – Building a well balanced Board
 – Chairing Board meetings and setting Board agenda
 – Ensuring effectiveness of the Board and ensuring annual review 
undertaken
 – Encouraging constructive challenge and facilitating effective communication 
in the Board
 – Promoting effective Board relationships
 – Ensuring appropriate induction and development programmes
 – Ensuring effective two way communication and debate with shareholders
 – Setting the tone at the top with regard to compliance and sustainability 
matters
 – Promoting high standards of corporate governance
 – Maintaining appropriate balance between stakeholders
Chief Executive Officer
 – Developing and implementing Group strategy
 – Recommending the annual budget and five-year strategic and financial plan
 – Ensuring coherent leadership of the Group
 – Managing the Group’s risk profile and establishing effective internal controls
 – Regularly reviewing organisational structure, developing executive team 
and planning for succession
 – Ensuring the Chairman and Board are kept advised and up to date 
regarding key matters
 – Maintaining relationships with shareholders and advising the Board 
accordingly
 – Setting the tone at the top with regard to compliance and sustainability 
matters
The Non-Executive Directors meet regularly prior to each Board meeting 
without management in attendance. The roles of Non-Executive Directors 
and, in particular, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director are 
defined as follows:
Non-Executive Directors
 – Providing effective challenge to management
 – Assisting in development of strategy
 – Serving on the Board Committees
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
 – Chairing meetings in the absence of the Chairman
 – Acting as sounding board for the Chairman on Board-related matters
 – Acting as an intermediary for the other Directors where necessary
 – Available to shareholders on matters which cannot otherwise be resolved
 – Leading annual evaluation into the Board’s effectiveness
 – Leading search for a new Chairman, as necessary
Independence of Non-Executive Directors
We are sensitive to the need for our Non-Executive Directors to remain 
independent from management in order to exercise our independent 
oversight and effectively challenge management as necessary. We are 
mindful that some of our Non-Executive Directors have served on our Board 
for periods that some might regard as likely to impact their independence. 
We therefore continually assess the independence of each of our Non-
Executive Directors and have determined that all our Non-Executive 
Directors are independent in accordance with both UK and US requirements. 
None of our Non-Executive Directors or their immediate families has ever 
had a material relationship with the Group. None of them receive additional 
remuneration apart from Directors’ fees, nor do they participate in the 
Group’s share plans or pension schemes. None of them serve as directors of 
any companies or affiliates in which any other Director is a director.
However, more importantly, each of our Non-Executive Directors is prepared 
to question and challenge management, to request more information and 
to ask the difficult question. They insist on robust responses both within the 
Board room and sometimes between Board meetings. The Chief Executive 
Officer is open to challenge from the Non-Executive Directors and uses this 
positively to provide more detail and to reflect further on issues.
We value the input we receive from our long-serving Directors given their 
deep understanding of the Group. We are however focused on planning 
for the future to build a balanced board with the skills and experience fit 
to face the challenges that lie ahead. We have identified the key skills and 
experiences we need and have welcomed the specific experience that 
Ajay Piramal and Baroness Bottomley have brought to the Board since their 
appointment in 2012. Ajay brings his skills as a successful businessman 
within the Emerging markets, where growth in Emerging markets is 
one of our Strategic Priorities. Baroness Bottomley brings her in-depth 
knowledge of UK governmental healthcare policies and processes, which 
is also of key importance for us given the pricing pressure we face from 
European governmental authorities purchasing our products. Following 
his appointment in April 2013, Michael Friedman will bring his exceptional 
experience of the US Healthcare market and the challenges we face in 
Established markets. We continue to search for other suitable Non-Executive 
Directors, whose experience will align with our strategic objectives and, in 
due course, our longer serving directors will step down.

Board Development Programme
We continue to focus our Board development programme around the specific 
needs and interests of our directors. This means that there is a greater focus 
on facilitating a deeper understanding of our business rather than on formal 
director training. We value our visits to different Smith & Nephew sites across 
the world, as we are able to see the daily operation of the business and to 
meet and talk to the people leading and working in our business about the 
challenges they face and how they are planning to meet those challenges. 
We are able to handle our products and hear how our people are innovating 
and developing the products of the future. This direct contact with our 
businesses helps us when making investment and strategic decisions and 
when considering succession planning below Board level.
We receive updates at the Board and Committee meetings on external 
corporate governance changes likely to affect the Company in the future. In 
2012, we reviewed the proposed changes to narrative reporting, as well as 
changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Audit Committee 
Guidelines. The Remuneration Committee has been monitoring changes 
to the way we will report on executive remuneration in the future and the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee met with the holders of 25% of the 
Company to discuss remuneration issues.
Ajay Piramal and Baroness Bottomley, who joined the Company during the 
year, took part in tailored induction programmes which included visits to 
our businesses in Hull in the UK, Andover and Mansfield in the US and to 
Mumbai in India as well as one-to-one meetings with senior head office 
executives and briefings on UK company law and corporate governance 
practices.

Board Effectiveness Review
Having conducted internal reviews into the effectiveness of the Board in 
2010 and 2011, we carried out an externally facilitated review in 2012. During 
the year, we evaluated the varying service provided by the different firms 
of advisers who practise in this area and selected Belinda Hudson and 
Richard Sheath of Independent Audit Limited to help facilitate our review 
given their experience conducting similar reviews for other companies of 
a similar size and complexity. Independent Audit has no other business 
relationship with the Company or any member of the Board. Following an 
initial planning meeting with the Chairman, they reviewed the minutes and 
papers of the Board and Committee meetings held in the past year and then 
interviewed each member of the Board and the Company Secretary. They 
also interviewed Helen Maye, Chief Human Resources Officer and Gary 
Luck of Towers Watson, who support the Remuneration Committee and 
James Goodwin, Head of Internal Audit and Les Clifford of Ernst & Young 
who work with the Audit Committee. Finally, they attended and observed our 
December 2012 Board meeting.
They concluded that the Board was very effective with a strong and 
professional Chairman, a strong cadre of Non-Executive Directors with a 
broad range of expertise and experience, and a Chief Executive Officer 
who takes a very positive and open approach to support the Board. 
Independent Audit made some suggestions for further improvement, which 
we discussed at our February 2013 Board meeting. We have agreed that 
in 2013, we shall focus on the following areas to improve our effectiveness 
further:
Succession Planning at Board level will be discussed regularly at full Board 
Meetings as well as by the Nomination & Governance Committee to 
ensure that there is a common understanding around the future structure 
of the Board. 
The activities and strategies of our competitiors will be discussed in greater 
detail to ensure that the Board better understands our position in the 
market place and the competitive pressures we face. 
Further opportunities will be explored for ensuring that Non-Executive 
Directors meet more frequently with senior executives below Board level 
to aid succession planning and to gain a greater understanding of the 
business and its challenges. 
Company Secretary and Independent Advice
The Company Secretary, Susan Swabey, is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring that we comply with all corporate governance requirements and are 
kept updated on our responsibilities. We all have access to her, individually 
and collectively.
We may also, from time to time, obtain independent professional advice, 
at the Company’s expense, if we judge it necessary in order to fulfil our 
responsibilities as Directors. If we are unable to attend a Board meeting or 
Board Committee meeting, we ensure that we are familiar with the matters to 
be discussed and make our views known to the Chairman or the Chairman 
of the relevant Committee prior to the meeting.
Management of Conflicts of Interest
None of us, nor our connected persons, has any family relationship with any 
other Director or officer, nor has a material interest in any contract to which 
the Company or any of its subsidiaries are, or were, a party during the year or 
up to 19 February 2013.
Each of us has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation 
in which we have or may have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts 
or possibly may conflict with the interests of the Company. This duty is in 
addition to the existing duty that we owe to the Company to disclose to the 
Board any transaction or arrangement under consideration by the Company. 
If we become aware of any situation which may give rise to a conflict of 
interest, we inform the rest of the Board immediately and the Board is then 
permitted under the Articles of Association to authorise such conflict. The 
information is recorded in the Company’s Register of Conflicts together with 
the date on which authorisation was given. In addition, we certify, on an 
annual basis, that the information contained in the Register is correct.
When the Board decides whether or not to authorise a conflict, only the 
Directors who have no interest in the matter are able to participate in the 
discussion and a conflict is only authorised if we believe that it would not 
have an impact on our ability to promote the Company’s success in the 
long term. Additionally, we may, as a Board, determine that certain limits or 
conditions must be imposed when giving authorisation. We have identified 
no actual conflicts which have required approval by the Board. We have, 
however, identified 10 situations which could potentially give rise to a conflict 
and these have been duly approved by the Board and are reviewed on an 
annual basis.
Re-appointment of Directors
In accordance with the Code, with effect from the Annual General Meeting 
held in 2011, all Directors, including Baroness Bottomley who was appointed 
on 12 April 2012, Julie Brown who was appointed on 4 February 2013 and 
Michael Friedman who will be appointed on 11 April 2013, offer ourselves to 
shareholders for re-election annually. Each Director may be removed at any 
time by the Board or the shareholders.
015914_Smith&Nephew_AR12_p56-p73 (Working Copy).indd   65 26/02/2013   09:36 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2012 66
Corporate Governance Statement continued
Directors’ Indemnity Arrangements
Each Director is covered by appropriate directors and officers liability 
insurance and there are also Deeds of Indemnity in place between the 
Company and each Director. These Deeds of Indemnity mean that the 
Company indemnifies Directors in respect of any proceedings brought by 
third parties against them personally in their capacity as Directors of the 
Company. The Company would also fund ongoing costs in defending a legal 
action as they are incurred rather than after judgement has been given. In 
the event of an unsuccessful defence in an action against them, individual 
Directors would be liable to repay the Company for any damages and to 
repay defence costs to the extent funded by the Company.
Liaison with Shareholders
The Executive Directors meet regularly with investors to discuss the 
Company’s business and financial performance both at the time of the 
announcement of results and at industry investor events. During 2012, the 
Executive Directors held meetings with institutional investors, including 
investors representing approximately 46% of the share capital as at 
December 2012.
As part of this programme of investor meetings, during 2012, as Chairman 
of the Company, I met with investors representing 14% of the share capital. 
Over the last three years, I have met investors representing in aggregate 20% 
of the share capital. Also during 2012, Joseph Papa met with shareholders 
holding 25% of the share capital to discuss remuneration policies and plans.
We receive a short report at every Board meeting reviewing our major 
shareholders and any significant changes in their holdings since the 
previous meeting. Olivier Bohuon and Adrian Hennah and his successor 
Julie Brown routinely advise us of any concerns or issues that shareholders 
have raised with them in their meetings. We also receive copies of analysts’ 
reports on the Company and our peers between Board meetings.
The Company’s website (www.smith-nephew.com) contains information of 
interest to both institutional investors and private shareholders, including 
financial information and webcasts of the results presentations to analysts for 
each quarter, as well as specific information for private shareholders relating 
to the management of their shareholding.
Share Capital
As at 19 February 2013, the Company’s total issued share capital with voting 
rights consisted of 904,988,045 Ordinary Shares of 20 US cents each. 
59,503,197 Ordinary Shares are held in treasury and are not included in the 
above figure.
As at 19 February 2013, notification had been received from the undernoted 
investors under the DTR in respect of interests in 3% or more of the issued 
Ordinary Shares with voting rights of the Company.
Number of 
Shares %
Invesco 105,165,112 11.6
BlackRock, Inc. 44,811,205 5.0
Legal and General Group plc 28,331,119 3.1
In addition to the above the Company is aware that Walter Scott & Partners 
Limited hold approximately 39m Ordinary Shares (4.3%). Otherwise, the 
Company is not aware of any person who has a significant direct or indirect 
holding of securities in the Company and is not aware of any persons holding 
securities which may control the Company. There are no securities in issue 
which have special rights as to the control of the Company.
Dividend
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 16.20 US cents per share which, 
together with the interim dividend of 9.90 US cents, makes a total for 2012 
of 26.10 US cents. The final dividend is expected to be paid, subject to 
shareholder approval, on 8 May 2013 to shareholders on the Register of 
Members at the close of business on 19 April 2013.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General Meeting is to be held on 11 April 2013 at 
2:00 pm at IET London: Savoy Place, 2 Savoy Place, Westminster, London, 
WC2R 0BL. Registered shareholders have been sent either a Notice of 
Annual General Meeting or notification of availability of the Notice of Annual 
General Meeting, as appropriate.
Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers
We have adopted a Code of Ethics for senior financial officers, which is 
available on the Group’s website (www.smith-nephew.com) and on request. 
This applies to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Group 
Financial Controller and the Group’s senior financial officers. There have 
been no waivers to any of the Code’s provisions nor any amendments made 
to the Code during 2012 or up until 19 February 2013.
Evaluation of Internal Controls Procedures
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 
15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
We, as a Board, are responsible overall for reviewing and approving 
the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls operated by the 
Group, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management. We have delegated responsibility for the review of financial, 
ethical compliance and quality management systems controls to the Audit 
Committee, which reviews the internal control process on an annual basis 
and evaluates its effectiveness to ensure that it remains robust and to 
identify any control weaknesses. The latest review covered the financial 
year to 31 December 2012 and included the period up to the approval of this 
Annual Report. The main elements of this annual review are as follows:
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated 
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Group’s disclosure 
controls and procedures as at 31 December 2012. Based upon this 
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
concluded on 19 February 2013 that the disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective as at 31 December 2012.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting. Management assessed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control over financial reporting as at 
31 December 2012 in accordance with the requirements in the US under 
s404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In making this assessment, they used 
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the 
Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based 
on their assessment, management concluded and reported that, as at 
31 December 2012, the Group’s internal control over financial reporting is 
effective based on those criteria.
Having received the report from management, the Audit Committee reports 
to the Board on the effectiveness of controls.
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm 
issued an audit report on the Group’s internal control over financial 
reporting as at 31 December 2012. This report appears on page 91.

accounts and

section 6 c orporate g overnance 67
There is an established system of internal control throughout the Group and 
our Divisions. The main elements of the internal control framework are as 
follows: 
 – The management of each Division is responsible for the establishment and 
review of effective internal financial controls within their Division.
 – The Group Finance Manual sets out, amongst other things, financial and 
accounting policies and minimum internal financial control standards.
 – The Internal Audit function agrees an annual work plan and scope of work 
with the Audit Committee.
 – The Audit Committee reviewed reports from the internal auditors on their 
findings on internal financial controls.
 – The Audit Committee reviews the Group Whistleblower procedures.
 – The Audit Committee reviews regular reports from the Group Financial 
Controller and the Heads of the Taxation and Treasury functions.
This system of internal control has been designed to manage rather 
than eliminate material risks to the achievement of our strategic and 
business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. Because of inherent 
limitations, our internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent 
or detect all mis-statements. In addition, our projections of any evaluation 
of effectiveness in future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. This process 
complies with the Turnbull working party guidance, revised October 2005 
and additionally contributes to our compliance with the obligations under 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and other internal assurance activities. There 
has been no change in the Group’s internal control over financial reporting 
during the period covered by this Annual Report that has materially affected, 
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Group’s internal control over 
financial reporting.
Principal accountant fees and services
Fees for professional services provided by Ernst & Young LLP , the Group’s 
independent auditors in each of the last two fiscal years, in each of the 
following categories were:
2012

Disclosure of information to the auditors
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors 
serving at the time of approving the Directors’ Report confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge and belief, there is no relevant audit information of which 
the auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, are unaware and the Directors also confirm 
that they have taken reasonable steps to be aware of any relevant audit 
information and, accordingly, to establish that the auditors are aware of such 
information.
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue as auditors 
and resolutions proposing their reappointment and to authorise the Directors 
to determine their remuneration will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting as approved by the Audit Committee.

Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder
The Audit Committee had a busy year with five main meetings supplemented 
by three telephone meetings to approve quarterly financial reports. The 
topics covered the membership and the principal duties of the Committee 
are set out in the table on page 68 of this report. Its terms of reference can be 
found on our website www.smith-nephew.com. I comment in this report by 
exception on our main responsibilities and in more detail on one off work.
The members of the Committee, who are all independent Directors, bring 
a variety of relevant expertise from their current or prior roles as Chief 
Executives of substantial businesses both in the UK and US and from their 
roles as Non-Executive Directors at other corporations. I am the designated 
finance expert, being a Chartered Accountant and former senior partner at 
KPMG UK, retiring in 2008.
Main Responsibilities
Financial reporting
Our review of the appropriateness of the Group’s principal accounting 
policies, practices and accounting judgments concentrated on the valuation 
of inventory and receivables, on the carrying value of goodwill, intangible and 
tangible assets, on the valuation of retirement benefits, contingencies and 
provisions. In light of current market conditions we paid particular attention 
to the review of the management of receivables derived from trading in 
Southern European countries.
We continued to review the style and format of the Annual Report during 
2012, building on the improvements we made in 2011. In particular, this 
year we have concentrated on the disclosure of metrics around our key 
performance indicators and have changed the ordering of sections to 
provide a better flow through the document.
Internal controls and risk management
We ensured compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
On behalf of the Board, we reviewed the system of internal financial control 
and satisfied ourselves that we are meeting required standards both for 
the year ended 31 December 2012 and up to the date of approval of this 
Annual Report.
No concerns were raised with us in 2012 about possible improprieties in 
matters of financial reporting or other matters.
We continued to work with the full Board to improve the clarity of evaluation 
of risk by the executive and Board and the systems for reporting and 
managing risk and for how it is dealt with in this Annual Report. The 
underlying purpose is to enable the Board to focus on the key strategic risks, 
both on the upside – not doing things – and on the downside. Aside from 
routine reporting the Board conducted a strategic discussion on risk during 
the year.
Internal Audit
Our Internal Audit function carries out work in three areas: our financial 
systems and processes; our systems that ensure compliance with regulation 
and laws; and our quality management systems in our manufacturing 
activities. In all three areas they act as a third line of defence behind 
operational management’s front line and own assurance activities. During 
the year they completed 67 reviews, the results of which were seen by the 
Committee which also oversees the effective and timely remediation of any 
recommendations.
We also considered an external review of the effectiveness of the Internal 
Audit function undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . The report was 
positive about the team and made recommendations principally related 
to further strengthening the Internal Audit team, improving methods of 
managing its workload and communicating its work to external stakeholders 
and the scope to extend the reach of its work.
In this context from 2013 the scope of the Internal Audit function has been 
widened to include auditing clinical and regulatory assurance. 
Receipt of functional reports
During the year, we received reports from the Group Financial Controller 
on Shared Services, from the heads of Tax and Treasury in relation to their 
functions, from the Chief Information Officer in relation to IT security and 
from the SVP of Quality and Regulatory Affairs on quality assurance. In all 
cases we concentrated on the risk environment, the risk parameters within 
which the Board wishes to operate and the effectiveness of the systems and 
processes to manage those risks.
Review of the work of the external auditors
We monitored the work of Ernst & Young, our external auditors throughout 
the year. Their work provided essential assurance over the financial systems 
and reporting that valuably supplements the work of Internal Audit. They 
continue to evidence their independence in the challenge they provide to 
management and the insight they bring to the Committee from their work 
with us and comparative observations of other companies.
We formally reviewed their effectiveness through review of their regular 
reports on accounting matters, governance and control and accounting 
developments. In addition we utilised formal year end feedback from all 
our operating units as a result of which we asked for improvements to be 
made in two operating locations and conducted a formal questionnaire of 
Committee members. We reviewed the inspection reports from the Auditor 
Oversight Boards in the UK and the US. Finally we reviewed the fees of 
the auditors using benchmarking against groups of comparable size and 
complexity.
Our conclusions were that the external audit was carried out effectively 
and with necessary objectivity and independence. This is the basis for 
our recommendation to the Board and shareholders that Ernst & Young be 
reappointed for 2013.
We also considered the Financial Reporting Council’s proposals on auditor 
rotation and, in light of the recent change in Chief Financial Officer, agreed 
that the implications for the company should be reviewed during 2013.
Auditor Independence Policy
We have determined a schedule of approved non-audit services for the 
Group external auditors to undertake. Our Auditor Independence Policy 
prohibits the external auditors from performing services which would 
result in the auditing of their own work, participating in activities normally 
undertaken by management, acting as advocates for the Group and creating 
a mutuality of interest between the auditors and the Group by, for example, 
being remunerated through a success fee structure. On an annual basis, 
we pre-approve the budget for fees relating to audit and non-audit work, 
including taxation compliance services, in accordance with a listing of 
particular services. In the event that limits for these services are expected to 
be exceeded or the Group wants the external auditors to perform services 
that have not been pre-approved, my approval is required. The Committee is 
subsequently advised of any such services and fees. In this way all services 
provided by the external auditors during the year were pre-approved by the 
Audit Committee. 
The Auditor Independence Policy also governs the policy regarding the audit 
partner rotation in accordance with the Auditing Practices Board Ethical 
Standards in the UK and the SEC rules in the US. Partners and senior audit 
staff may not be recruited by the Group unless two years have expired 
since their previous involvement with the Group. No such recruitment has 
occurred. We consider that the implementation of this policy helps ensure 
that auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded. 
2013
In addition to our main responsibilities we will be looking at the systems of 
control and risk management over the Group’s recent acquisitions.

Nomination & Governance Committee
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present my report on the activities of the Nomination & 
Governance Committee in 2012. The membership and the principal duties of 
the Committee are set out in the table on page 68 of this report.
In 2012, we dealt with the following matters:
Appointment of Julie Brown
We recommended the appointment of Julie Brown as Chief Financial Officer 
to replace Adrian Hennah who left the Company at the end of 2012 to take up 
a position elsewhere.
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
In 2011, we recommended the appointment of Ajay Piramal, who joined the 
Board in 2012, bringing a wealth of experience as a succesful businessman 
in India. We also conducted and completed the search for Baroness 
Bottomley, who joined the Board in April 2012. She too brings a great deal of 
experience in the area of governmental healthcare policy.
We have throughout the year continued our search for additional 
Non-Executive Directors, in particular focusing on the skills, experience, 
independence and diversity each candidate can bring to the Board. All 
Non-Executive Director appointments are linked to the strategic priorities 
identified by the Board: 
 – Emerging Market experience
 – US healthcare experience
 – European healthcare experience
Since the year end, we have recommended the appointment of Michael 
Friedman who will join the Board on 11 April. He brings exceptional 
experience of the US Healthcare market.
As and when we find further appropriate candidates willing to join our Board,  
we will replace some of our longer-serving Directors.
Where appropriate we use the services of external search agents, 
recognising however, that suitable candidates may sometimes come to our 
attention by other means. 
Expanded the Remit of the Committee
We reviewed the remit of the Committee during 2012 and agreed to expand 
its role to cover governance matters. As part of our role in recommending 
appointments to the Board, we were already considering matters of 
governance such as the independence of Non-Executive Directors, 
succession planning, diversity and conflicts of interest. The Committee also 
oversees the process around the review into the Board’s Effectiveness. It 
therefore made logical sense to recognise this formally by changing the 
name of the committee to the Nomination & Governance Committee and 
expanding its role to consider wider areas of governance. 
The expanded role includes oversight of the effective governance of the 
Board and its committees, the review of terms of reference of the Board and 
its Committees, supervision of the induction process for new directors and 
the ongoing Board Development programme. We will also monitor external 
governance activities to ensure that the Board is kept up to date on changes 
that might affect us.
The whole Board remains responsible for ensuring that the Company is 
governed appropriately, but the more detailed work to support this will now 
be carried out by this Committee.

Dear Shareholder ,
I am pleased to present my report on the activities of the Ethics & 
Compliance Committee in 2012. The membership and the principal duties of 
the Committee are set out in the table on page 69 of this report.
In 2012 we dealt with the following matters:
Settlement with US Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) 
and US Department of Justice (‘DOJ’)
In January 2012, we reviewed and approved the final terms of the settlement 
between the Company and the SEC and DOJ in connection with their Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act (‘FCPA’) investigation of the medical devices industry. 
This has been a matter that we as a Committee have monitored closely 
since the formation of the Committee in 2008. The settlement included the 
appointment of an independent monitor who worked with the Company over 
most of 2012 to evaluate the effectiveness of our compliance programme and 
make recommendations, as appropriate, for further enhancements to the 
programme. We have been working collaboratively with the monitor for this 
purpose. The Committee reviewed his initial report and continues to review 
the Company’s progress towards implementation of his recommended 
enhancements. 
Compliance Programme for Distributors
We continued to review and improve our compliance programme with 
third party sellers (such as distributors and sales agents), particularly in 
the Emerging and International markets. We have initiated a semi-annual 
communication to our sellers to reinforce our commitment to ethical and 
legal behaviour and making it clear that we will not tolerate any improper 
inducements in the sale of products. We also developed a set of resources to 
help sellers build or enhance their own compliance programme. Our sellers 
can customise and brand these materials, which have been translated. 
Compliance Programme for other Third Parties
We have continued to strengthen our controls over vendors, service 
providers and other third parties engaged by us but that do not sell our 
products, based on the supplier type and risk profile. We have created 
Guidance on the Smith & Nephew Code of Conduct and Business Principles 
for Third Parties to highlight the areas of our Code that apply directly to third 
parties and that we expect them to follow when working on our behalf.
Employee Compliance Programme
New employees are trained on our Code of Conduct which sets out the basic 
legal and ethical principles for carrying out business and applies both to 
employees and others who act on the Group’s behalf. It sets out in detail how 
persons covered by the Code of Conduct are expected to interact ethically 
with healthcare professionals and government officials. A copy of the Code 
of Conduct can be found on the Group’s website (www.smith-nephew.com).
The Code of Conduct includes our whistle-blowing policy, which (subject 
to local law) requires covered persons to report any breach either directly 
or anonymously through an independent provider. Members of the public 
are also encouraged to report concerns. All reports are reviewed and the 
appropriate action taken, including referral to senior management or the 
Board, where warranted. The Code also states that we have a non-retaliation 
policy against anyone who makes a report in good faith. The Ethics & 
Compliance Committee is advised of any potentially significant improprieties 
which are reported. 
We have also monitored the development and enhancement of the 
employee compliance training programme. Employees are required to 
undertake compliance training and managers are encouraged to discuss 
ethical matters with their teams. Some training is tailored for employees in 
specific job situations. Further support is provided through a comprehensive 
set of tools and resources located on our global intranet platform.
Compliance Infrastructure
We are mindful that an effective compliance programme requires both a 
culture of integrity and investment in the necessary infrastructure to give 
effect to that culture. 
With that in mind, the Committee reviewed the level and trend of investments 
in the Company’s compliance programme, as well as the costs of compliance 
defects. As the Company grows in new markets, we continue to expand our 
global network of Regional Compliance Officers and use them to reinforce 
the importance of compliance with our employees and third parties around 
the world. 
Compliance Implications around Acquisitions
Finally, as members of the Board discussing acquisition opportunities, we 
ensure that the compliance implications of each acquisition are considered 
as part of both the due diligence process and plans for integration of the 
acquired business.

Executive Risk Committee
Olivier Bohuon chairs our Executive Risk Committee which includes the 
Executive Directors and Executive Officers of the Group. As an integral part of 
our planning and review process, the management of each of our divisions 
identifies the risks applicable to their business, the probability of those risks 
occurring, the impact if they do occur and the actions required and being 
taken to manage and mitigate those risks. The Executive Risk Committee 
meets twice a year to review the major risks they identify across the Group 
and the mitigation processes and plans. As appropriate, the Executive 
Risk Committee may re-categorise risks or require further information or 
mitigating action to be undertaken. We receive an annual report from the 
Executive Risk Committee, which details the significant risks categorised 
by potential financial impact on profit and share price and by likelihood 
of occurrence. Details of new, key or significantly increased risks, along 
with actions put in place to mitigate such risks, are also reported to us as 
appropriate. We have provided further information on the principal risks 
identified through this process in ‘Principal risks and risk management’ on 
pages 54 to 55 of this Annual Report.
Disclosures Committee
Olivier Bohuon chairs the Disclosures Committee which includes the Chief 
Financial Officer and various additional senior executives. The Committee 
meets as required and approves the release of all major communications to 
investors, to the UK Listing Authority and to the London and New York Stock 
Exchanges.

Dear Shareholder ,
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 which has been prepared by the Remuneration 
Committee and approved by the Board. 
2012 has been a strong year for the Company despite a challenging external 
environment. As the executive team led by Olivier Bohuon continues to drive 
the new strategy from a strong and stable financial base, the Committee 
has been working to ensure that our executive remuneration arrangements 
continue to reinforce and support the delivery of that strategy.
The current remuneration framework was introduced last year with the aim 
to simplify the overall remuneration structure, drive the delivery of the new 
strategy, and strengthen the link between pay and performance. Our key 
financial goal remains to deliver a higher return to shareholders relative to 
our peer group over the long term, as measured by Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) and free cashflow. These Key Performance Indicators are reinforced 
by our executive incentive arrangements; the annual incentive is based 
primarily on revenue, profit and cash generation, and the Performance Share 
Programme rewards superior TSR relative to our peer group and longer-term, 
sustainable free cashflow.
The Company’s remuneration policy is set out on the following page. The 
Committee believes the policy continues to be appropriate for the 2013 
financial year as it is closely aligned with our strategic goals (and hence our 
shareholders’ interests), is highly results-oriented and rewards sustained 
superior performance.
As a Board, we take seriously the views and feedback of our shareholders 
on remuneration matters. Although the shareholders we consulted were 
broadly supportive of our moves towards simplification and alignment with 
our changing corporate strategy, we received some feedback in connection 
with the 2012 AGM that the explanation of the new Annual Incentive Plan 
could be improved. We have undertaken to address this in the following 
report and I hope you find this new layout helpful in understanding our 
approach to remuneration.
I also took the opportunity in December 2012 to meet with some of our 
largest shareholders to discuss any concerns relating to remuneration. The 
Shareholders I met acknowledged the changes we have made to align the 
remuneration of our executive population more closely with the Strategic 
Priorities detailed on page 8. They also appreciated our clearer explanation 
of how we operated the Annual Incentive Plan and understood how we 
determined an appropriate remuneration package for Julie Brown, our new 
Chief Financial Officer. We also spent time talking to them about the new 
remuneration reporting requirements that will apply from 2014 and how we 
operated our shareholding guidelines.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Compliance statement
We have prepared this Directors’ Remuneration Report (the ‘Report’) in 
accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the ‘Regulations’). It also 
meets the relevant requirements of the Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’) 
Listing Rules. In addition, we have been mindful of the BIS proposals on 
remuneration, with a view to improving the transparency of our reporting. 
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the Report will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 11 April 2013.
Smith & Nephew’s remuneration policy
Smith & Nephew’s remuneration policy is designed to attract and motivate 
talent to drive the strategy over the short, medium and long term, which in turn 
will lead to higher returns for our shareholders. The Committee believes it is 
important for remuneration arrangements to be consistent across our senior 
executive team. In setting the policy and making remuneration decisions, the 
Committee takes into account pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group and 
our policy for the remuneration of our executive management group is broadly 
consistent with that for the Executive Directors.
This section of our report describes the key components of the remuneration 
arrangements for Executive Directors that were in place for 2012 and remain 
largely unchanged for 2013.
Component Objective Operation
Base salary and benefits
Base salary
To attract and retain high performing 
talent by setting base salaries at rates 
comparable to what would be paid in 
an equivalent position elsewhere
Salaries are reviewed annually, with any increase applying from 1 April.
Salary levels/increases take account of:
 – scope and responsibility of the position; 
 –  performance potential of the individual by reference to the median salary 
for the relevant geographical market; and
 – average increase awarded across the Company.
Pension
To provide market-competitive 
retirement benefits
Executive Directors receive an allowance (fixed as 30% of salary) in lieu of 
membership of a company run pension scheme. Base salary is the only 
element of remuneration that is pensionable.
Benefits
To attract and retain high performing 
talent by providing benefits 
comparable to those that would be 
provided for an equivalent position 
elsewhere
Includes healthcare and death-in-service provision and company car/
allowance.
Relocation costs if required.
Annual incentives 
Annual Incentive Plan
To motivate and reward the 
achievement of specific annual 
financial and business objectives
To encourage sustained high 
standards through the application of a 
‘malus’ provision over three years on 
the equity element of the Plan 
The Annual Incentive Plan comprises a cash and equity element, both 
based on the achievement of financial and business objectives set at the 
start of the year (see right).
At the end of the year, the Committee determines the extent to which these 
have been achieved and sets the award level.
This award has a cash element (paid in full at the end of the performance year) 
and an equity element comprising conditional share awards (made at the time 
of the cash award), with vesting phased over the following three years. 
The equity element vests at the end of each of the next three years (
1
⁄3, 
1
⁄3, 
1
⁄3), 
only if performance remains satisfactory over each of these three years; 
otherwise, awards will lapse.
Participants will receive an additional number of shares equivalent to 
the amount of dividend payable per vested share during the relevant 
performance period.
Longer-term incentives
Performance Share 
Programme
To motivate and reward longer-term 
performance
The Group operates one long-term incentive plan.
Conditional share awards vest after three years subject to the achievement 
of stretching performance targets. 
Awards may be subject to clawback in the event of material financial 
mis-statement or misconduct.
Participants will receive an additional number of shares equivalent to 
the amount of dividend payable per vested share during the relevant 
perfomance period.
Executive shareholding
Executive shareholding
To support alignment with shareholder 
interests by requiring our senior 
executives to act like shareholders
Executive Directors must retain 50% of all shares vesting under annual 
and long-term incentive plans (after tax) until their holding requirement has 
been met.

Service contracts
We employ Executive Directors on rolling service contracts with notice 
periods of 12 months from the Company and six months from the Executive 
Director. On termination of the contract, we may require the Executive 
Director not to work their notice period and as such pay them an amount 
equivalent to the salary, pension and benefits they would have received if 
they had been required to work their notice period. In addition, we may also, 
in exceptional circumstances, exercise our discretion to pay the Executive 
Director a proportion of the annual incentive that they would have received 
had they been required to work their notice period. Any entitlement or 
discretionary payment may be reduced in line with Executive Directors’ duty 
to mitigate losses, subject to applying our non-compete clause. 
In the case of a change in control which results in the termination of an 
Executive Director or a material alteration to their responsibilities or duties 
within 12 months of the event, the Executive Director would be entitled to 
receive 12 months base salary and 12 months target annual incentive, plus 
pension and benefits.
In 2012, we received comments from some of our shareholders about the 
provisions contained in our Executive Directors’ service contracts relating 
to the entitlement to an at-target annual incentive payout on a change of 
control, as well as eligibility to earn an annual incentive whilst serving notice. 
In the course of the year, we have reviewed these provisions, and going 
forward, the payment of any annual incentive following a change of control 
will be entirely discretionary and reflect the individual’s performance and 
contributions. This new policy applies to any Executive Director appointed 
after 1 November 2012 including Julie Brown, our new Chief Financial Officer. 
In the first year of employment Julie Brown’s notice period will be six months 
from the Company and three months from her.

Date
Notice period  
from company
Olivier Bohuon 9 February 2011 1 April 2011 12 months
Julie Brown 7 November 2012 4 February 2013 6 months
We encourage our Executive Directors to serve as a Non-Executive Director 
of a maximum of one external company. Such appointments are subject 
to the approval of the Nomination & Governance Committee and any fees 
earned are retained by the Executive Director. Olivier Bohuon is a Member of 
the Supervisory Board at Virbac SA, and Adrian Hennah is a Non-Executive 
Director of Reed Elsevier plc. During 2012 Olivier Bohuon received €19,000, 
and Adrian Hennah received £65,000 in respect of these appointments.
T ermination policy
Our policy regarding termination payments is to limit severance payments on 
termination to pre-established contractual arrangements. In the event that 
the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation 
payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service 
contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any 
incentive plans.
Under normal circumstances (excluding termination for gross misconduct), all 
leavers are entitled to receive termination payments in lieu of notice equal to 
base salary, pension and benefits. In the event an Executive Director leaves 
for reasons of ill-health, death, redundancy, or retirement in agreement with 
the Company, then the vesting of any outstanding Annual Cash Incentive 
and Equity Incentive Awards will generally depend on the Committee’s 
assessment of performance to date. Performance Share Awards will be 
pro-rated for time worked during the relevant performance period, and will 
remain subject to performance over the full performance period. For all other 
leavers, Annual Cash Incentive will generally be forfeited and outstanding 
Equity Incentive Awards and Performance Share Awards will lapse. The 
Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions on a case-by-case 
basis following a review of circumstances and to ensure fairness for both 
shareholders and participants.
T ermination arrangements for Mr Hennah
Adrian Hennah voluntarily resigned as Chief Financial Officer with effect 
from 31 December 2012 to take up employment elsewhere. He was therefore 
not entitled to receive any termination payment. He worked up until 31 
December 2012 and was paid and received benefits up to that date in 
accordance with his service contract. As he was employed throughout the 
year, the Remuneration Committee has decided that it is appropriate for 
Adrian Hennah to receive an annual cash incentive of £585,800 in respect 
of the work he undertook during 2012. Further details are given on pages 80 
and 81. All unvested Performance Share Awards, Deferred Bonus Awards, 
options and Equity Incentive Awards lapsed on cessation of employment.
Policy on recruitment arrangements
We have clarified our position on the appointment of Executive Directors who 
are recruited externally. In many cases, someone appointed externally will 
forfeit sizeable cash bonuses and share awards if they choose to leave their 
former employer and join us. The Committee therefore believes that we need 
to retain the ability to compensate new hires for any bonus or share awards 
they give up in choosing to leave another employer to join Smith & Nephew. 
We will use our discretion in setting any such compensation, which will be 
decided on a case-by-case basis. As a point of policy, we will not provide 
compensation of greater value than the new appointee is giving up, and 
we will seek evidence from the previous employer to confirm the full details 
of bonus or share awards being forfeited. As far as possible, we will seek 
to replicate forfeited share awards using Smith & Nephew incentive plans, 
whilst at the same time, aiming for simplicity.
We have followed this policy when determining compensation for Julie 
Brown, our new Chief Financial Officer, who was appointed on 4 February 
2013.

Remuneration arrangements for Julie Brown
Julie Brown’s remuneration package has been set in line with the Company’s 
existing remuneration policy, and for 2013 will be as follows:
Element of remuneration
Base salary £500,000
Pension 30% of salary
Annual Incentive Plan (cash)
Target
Maximum
100% of salary 
150% of salary
Annual Incentive Plan (equity)
Target
Maximum
50% of salary 
65% of salary
Performance Share Awards
Target
Maximum
95% of salary 
190% of salary
In addition to the above, Julie Brown will receive partial compensation for 
unvested incentive awards forfeited on joining Smith & Nephew. She will 
be granted an award over 75,000 shares, vesting in three equal tranches in 
February 2014, February 2015 and February 2016, subject to her continued 
employment. This award partially reflects the value of unvested share 
awards from her previous employer that she forfeited when leaving their 
employment. On joining Smith & Nephew, Julie Brown has forfeited shares 
to the value of £1,434,000, which were due to vest from March 2013-2015 as 
follows:
Performance 
Shares
£1,099,000 Vesting between March 2013 and March 
2015 subject to performance conditions 
relating to TSR and cash flow being 
satisfactorily met.
Restricted Shares £335,000 Vesting in March 2014 and subject to no 
further performance conditions other than 
continued employment. 
The Committee therefore believes that this award of 75,000 shares which 
is valued at £526,500 as at 19 February 2013 is appropriate and will help 
align Mrs Brown’s interests with those of our shareholders from the outset 
of her appointment. Given that the total value of the shares to be awarded is 
significantly less than the face value of shares forfeited and that not all the 
shares forfeited were subject to performance conditions, the Committee did 
not believe that it was appropriate for performance conditions to be applied 
to these shares over and above her continued employment.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are engaged by the Company on the basis of 
letters of appointment. They are normally appointed for terms of three years, 
terminable at will, without notice by either the Group or the Director and 
without compensation. The Chairman is engaged on a letter of appointment 
and has a six-month notice period.

(i) Subject to the annual re-election of Directors at the Company’s AGM.
The Board reviews the pay of the Non-Executive Directors and aims to 
set fees that are competitive with other companies of equivalent size and 
complexity. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to receive awards under 
the Company’s long-term incentive plans. We do, however, require our Non-
Executive Directors to hold a personal stake in the Company equivalent to 
their basic annual fee. These shares may be held as Ordinary Shares or as 
ADSs held either by themselves or their immediate family. Details of the Non-
Executive Directors’ current shareholdings can be found on page 83.
Non-Executive Directors are paid a fixed basic annual fee. The Chairmen 
of the Audit, Remuneration and Ethics & Compliance Committees and the 
Senior Independent Director also receive an additional fee in recognition 
of their added responsibilities. An additional fee is also payable to Non-
Executive Directors in cases where intercontinental travel is necessary to 
attend Board and Committee meetings.
Remuneration in 2012
Main activities of the Remuneration  
Committee in 2012
The main work of the Remuneration Committee this year is described on 
page 69. Key activities have been:
 – Continued development of the new remuneration policy introduced last 
year and implementing new remuneration arrangements for the top 70 
senior executives to align remuneration with the updated Group strategy. 
 – Determination of remuneration package for Julie Brown, new Chief Financial 
Officer, and certain other Executive Officers on recruitment.
 – Consideration and updating of remuneration policies on compensation for 
amounts forfeited by executives recruited externally, termination payments 
in the event of a change of control and policy on shareholding guidelines.
 – Continued engagement with our largest shareholders and certain 
shareholder advisory bodies.
 – Consideration of new remuneration reporting requirements being 
introduced in 2014.
Remuneration Committee membership in 2012
As set out on page 69 of this Annual Report, my fellow members of the 
Remuneration Committee are Baroness Bottomley (joined the Committee on 
19 September 2012), Pamela Kirby, Brian Larcombe and Richard De Schutter. 
Details concerning the number of meetings held and the scope and role of 
our duties may be found on this page.
From time to time in 2012 attendees included Olivier Bohuon, Chief 
Executive Officer, Susan Swabey, Company Secretary, Helen Maye, Chief 
Human Resources Officer, Adrian Hennah, Chief Financial Officer and 
Bob Newcomb, SVP Global Rewards. The Chairman attended some of the 
meetings by invitation. 
Independent advice
During the year, the Committee received information and advice from 
Towers Watson, an independent executive remuneration consultancy firm 
appointed by the Committee in 2011. They provided advice on market trends, 
remuneration benchmarking and remuneration issues in general. Towers 
Watson also provided other human resources and compensation advice to 
the Company for levels below the Board. 
Throughout 2012, we were also advised by Aon Hewitt and Mercer Limited in 
relation to salary data, and by Kepler Associates in relation to the structure 
and content of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. All these consultants 
comply with the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants and we are 
satisfied that their advice is objective and independent.
Base salary and benefits
With effect from 1 April 2012, we approved the following base salaries for the 
Executive Directors:
Olivier Bohuon €1,050,000
Adrian Hennah
£ 585,800 (left company on  
31 December 2012)
015914_Smith&Nephew_AR12_p74-88 (Working Copy).indd   79 26/02/2013   09:36 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2012 80
Directors’ remuneration report continued
In February 2013, we reviewed the base salaries of the Executive Directors 
having considered general economic conditions and average salary 
increases across the rest of the Group of around 3%. The Committee has 
agreed that Chief Executive Officer, Olivier Bohuon, will receive an increase 
in his salary in line with the Group average. This is the first increase in Chief 
Executive Officer pay since he joined the Company in April 2011. Mrs Brown’s 
salary for 2013 (set on her appointment) is £500,000. As a result, the base 
salaries for the Executive Directors with effect from 1 April 2013 are as follows:
Olivier Bohuon €1,081,500
Julie Brown £500,000
Pensions
During the period, Olivier Bohuon and Adrian Hennah both received a 
salary supplement of 30% of basic salary to apply towards their retirement 
savings in lieu of membership of a Company run pension scheme. They also 
received death in service cover of seven times basic salary, of which four 
times salary is payable as a lump sum with the balance used to provide any 
spouse and dependant pensions.
The same arrangements will apply in 2013 for Olivier Bohuon and Julie Brown.
2012 Annual Incentive Plan award
During 2012, the Annual Incentive Plan for Executive Directors was based on 
the achievement of specific financial and business objectives. 
For 2012, the financial and business objectives were as follows:
Financial objectives Revenue (30%) 70%
Trading profit (30%)
Trading cash (10%)
Business objectives R&D investment 30%
Succession planning
Employee engagement
Compliance
Development of product portfolio 
(Olivier Bohuon only)
Shared services (Adrian Hennah only)
In 2013, the financial and business objectives will remain the same. 
At the period end the Committee conducted an assessment of each 
Executive Director against their financial and business objectives.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to apply a multiplier – positively 
or negatively – to the annual incentive assessment of an Executive Director, 
adjusting the total up or down by up to 10%. This rewards or penalises an 
Executive Director for ‘how’ they conduct themself in terms of leadership, 
corporate reputation, ethics and organisational behaviours and represent the 
Company both internally and externally. 
Over the period, underlying revenue growth was 2% (between target and 
maximum), trading profit was $965m (between target and maximum), and 
the trading profit to cash conversion ratio was 104% (above maximum). 
The business objectives are personal to each Executive Director, and are 
tailored to reflect their role and responsibilities during the year. These are set 
at the start of each year and will reflect some of the most important areas of 
strategic focus for the Group. Where objectives are repeated year-on-year, 
the Committee will set annual measurement criteria that are appropriate to 
motivate and measure an Executive Director’s performance in any one year. 
For instance, Innovation for Value is at the heart of our Strategic Priorities. Our 
success here is measured in terms of how we manage our R&D programmes 
and continue to develop our product portfolio to reflect the need to bring 
forward new technologies appropriate for our markets and customers 
globally. Ultimate responsibility for these vital programmes rests with our 
Executive Directors and we believe it was right to reflect the importance in 
their 2012 personal business objectives. 
Similarly compliance – and all that follows from it relating to ethics and quality 
– is the responsibility of the Executive Directors, who must set the standards 
for the whole Group, and be measured on their execution. This is also true 
on Employee Engagement, where we want to motivate our leaders to exceed 
in providing vision and leadership and living our values of Performance, 
Innovation and Trust. 
The Committee reviewed the performance of Olivier Bohuon and Adrian 
Hennah against their agreed business objectives for 2012 and determined 
that Olivier Bohuon delivered very strongly against his objectives and 
that Adrian Hennah had consistently met his objectives for the year. Their 
achievements during the year include:
Business objective
Commentary on 2012 performance
Olivier Bohuon Adrian Hennah
R&D investment Successfully managed investment levels during the 
year to fully support progress towards longer-term 
revenue targets in emerging markets. 
Succession planning Ensured focus on robust

resulting in minimal 
disruption or turnover of 
key roles. 
Completed succession 
planning for all key 
finance roles. 
Employee engagement Made significant effort 
to ensure employee

in the global employee 
survey. 
Achieved a >90% 
participation rate by the 
finance function in the 
global employee survey.

plans, new products 
and new businesses 
were fully assessed for 
compliance risks. 
Development of product 
portfolio  
(Olivier Bohuon only)
Oversaw the successful 
delivery of a significant 
number (exceeding 
expectations in some 
cases) of planned 
product launches and 
registrations during the 
year. 
Focused on delivering 
a balanced product 
portfolio globally.

(Adrian Hennah only)
n/a Completed 
implementation of 
Shared Services model 
and realised targeted 
cost savings.

The Committee also considered the multiplier to the annual incentive 
assessment of Olivier Bohuon and Adrian Hennah and agreed that no 
multiplier was appropriate in respect of 2012.

The 2012 opportunity under the Annual Incentive Plan comprised two parts:
a) a cash element (100% of salary at target, 150% maximum opportunity) and
b) an equity element (50% of salary at target, 65% maximum opportunity). 
The cash element is paid following the performance year. The equity element 
is a conditional award over ordinary shares made under the Global Share 
Plan 2010 vesting in equal annual tranches over three years, provided that 
individual and Group performance is sustained at an acceptable level each 
year. Share awards are subject to malus and will lapse in the event that 
individual and Group performance is not sustained over the respective 
performance period.
The assessment of the Committee resulted in the following awards for 2012:
Executive  
Director
Cash element Equity element
% of salary Amount % of salary Amount
Olivier Bohuon 126% €1,321,950 65% €682,500
Adrian Hennah 100% £585,800 n/a – left on 31 December 2012
The equity element of the Annual Incentive Plan was introduced in 2012, so 
there were no awards due to vest from outstanding cycles in the year under 
review. It is intended that the Annual Incentive Plan will be operated in a 
similar manner for 2013. There will be no change to the target or maximum 
opportunities for the coming year or in the split between financial and 
business objectives.
2012 Performance Share Programme
The Group operates one long-term incentive plan – the Performance Share 
Programme.
Under the Performance Share Programme, conditional awards of shares 
vest after three years subject to the achievement of stretching performance 
targets relating to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and free cashflow 
generation. Awards may be subject to clawback in the event of material 
financial mis-statement or misconduct.
Performance share awards were made to Executive Directors under the 
Global Share Plan 2010 during the year. The levels of the awards in 2012 
were as follows:
Market value 
of award 
vesting at 
maximum
Market value 
of award 
vesting at 
target
Executive Directors 190% of salary 95% of salary
50% of the award will vest based on the Company’s TSR performance 
relative to a bespoke peer group of companies in the medical devices sector 
over a three-year period commencing 1 January 2012 as follows:
TSR ranking within comparator group
Award vesting 
– % of salary
Below median Nil
Median 23.75%
Upper quartile 95%
Awards will vest on a straight line basis between these points. If the 
Company’s TSR performance is below median, none of this part of the award 
will vest.
The bespoke peer group for the 2012 awards comprises the following 
companies:
– Arthrocare
– Bard
– Baxter
– Becton Dickinson
– Boston Scientific
– Coloplast Group
– Conmed
– Covidien
–  Edwards Life  
Sciences Corp
– Medtronic
– Nobel Biocar
– Nuvasive
– Orthofix
– Stryker
– St. Jude Medical
– Wright Medical
– Zimmer
The Group’s TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator 
group will be independently monitored and reported to the Remuneration 
Committee by Towers Watson.
50% of the award is subject to free cashflow performance. The free cashflow 
target is a cumulative performance target over the three-year performance 
period. The inclusion of a cash measure in both the annual and long-term 
plans reflects its importance over both timescales. The measure for the 
long-term target is free cashflow, which is defined as net cash inflows from 
operating activities, less capital expenditure. Free cashflow is considered 
to be the most appropriate measure of cashflow performance because it 
relates to the cash generated to finance additional investment in business 
opportunities, debt repayments and distributions to shareholders. This 
measure includes significant elements of operational and financial 
performance and helps to align executives’ rewards with shareholder value 
creation.
The 50% of the 2012 award that is subject to free cashflow performance will 
vest as follows:
Cumulative free cashflow Award vesting – % of salary
Below $1.41 billion Nil
$1.41 billion 23.75%
$1.62 billion 47.5%
$1.83 billion or more 95%
Awards will vest on a straight line basis between these points. If the 
Company’s cashflow performance is below $1.41 billion, none of this part of 
the award will vest.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
It is intended that the Committee should have the discretion to adjust, but on 
an exceptional basis only, the free cashflow target during the performance 
period for material factors that would otherwise distort the performance 
measure in either direction. For example, adjustments may be required to 
reflect exchange rate movements, significant acquisitions or divestments, 
or major legal and taxation settlements. Any major adjustments to the 
calculation will be disclosed to shareholders. There is no retesting of 
performance. Executive Directors do not receive share options under the 
Performance Share Programme. 
Performance targets for 2013 Performance Share 
Programme (‘PSP’) awards 
It is proposed that awards made under the PSP in 2013 will vest after three 
years with 50% vesting on three-year relative TSR performance and 50% on 
cumulative free cashflow. No changes are proposed to the operation of the 
TSR element described above for 2012 PSP awards, for awards to be granted 
in 2013. The cumulative free cashflow targets for awards to be granted in 
2013 will be as follows:
Cumulative free cashflow Award vesting – % of salary
Below $1.5 billion Nil
$1.55 billion 23.75%
$1.78 billion 47.5%
$2.01 billion or more 95%
No other changes are proposed to the Performance Share Programme.
Deferred bonus arrangements prior to 2012
Prior to 2012, one-third of any annual bonus earned was compulsorily deferred 
into share awards that vest in equal tranches over three years, subject to 
the participant’s continued employment. Outstanding tranches of awards 
made to Executive Directors previously are shown on Page 86. No further 
performance conditions apply to these deferred share awards. On leaving 
employment voluntarily, Adrian Hennah’s unvested share awards lapsed.
Long-term incentive arrangements prior to 2012
Prior to 2012, conditional share awards were made to Executive Directors 
under the 2004 Performance Share Plan and to other executives under the 
Global Share Plan 2010.
The vesting of awards made to Executive Directors was linked to adjusted 
EPS (‘EPSA’) growth, and the number of shares could then be increased 
subject to TSR performance relative to the major companies in the medical 
devices industry.
Adrian Hennah’s unvested awards (granted in 2010 and 2011) lapsed on 
his leaving Smith & Nephew. Olivier Bohuon was first granted an award 
under the 2004 Performance Share Plan in 2011, which will vest subject to 
performance over the three years ending 31 December 2013. Details of these 
awards can be found in the table on page 85 of this Report, and the vesting 
outcome will be reported in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
ESPA growth over the three years ended 31 December 2012 was 18.7% 
(adjusted for the Bioventus transaction) against the compounded market 
growth rate of 11.7%. Over the same period, the Company was ranked 10th 
out of 19 companies in the medical devices comparator group which meant 
that the multiplier of one was applied to the number of shares vesting under 
the ESPA target. As a result the following award made in 2010 to a former 
Executive Director will vest on 1 March 2013.
Number of ADRs 
under 2010 award
Number of ADRs 
vesting in 2013 % vesting
David Illingworth 16,720 4,347 26%
(i)  The award granted to David Illingworth will be settled prior to 15 March 
2013 in accordance with S409A of the US Internal Revenue Code. 
(ii)  The number of shares under the 2010 award has been pro-rated for 
service during the performance period. 
Prior to 2012, share option awards were also made to Executive Directors 
under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan and to other employees under 
the Global Share Plan 2010. Options granted to Executive Directors are 
subject to TSR performance relative to the major companies in the medical 
devices industry.
Adrian Hennah’s unvested awards (granted in 2010 and 2011) lapsed on his 
leaving Smith & Nephew. Olivier Bohuon was first granted an award under 
the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan in 2011, which will vest subject to 
performance over the three years ending 31 December 2013. Details of these 
awards can be found in the table on page 85 of this Report, and the vesting 
outcome will be reported in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Over the three years ended 31 December 2012 the Company was ranked 
10th out of 19 companies in the medical devices comparator group which 
meant that 33% of the options granted to a former Executive Director in 2010 
will vest on the 9 September 2013 as follows: 
Number of ADRs 
under option 
granted in 2010
Number of ADRs 
under option 
vesting in 2013 % vesting
David Illingworth 11,073 3,654 33%
(i)  The option granted in 2010 has been pro-rated for service during the 
performance period. 
Other share schemes
The Company also operates UK and International ShareSave Plans (and an 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan – ESPP – in the US), which are all-employee 
schemes that enable our employees to save on a regular basis and then buy 
shares in the Company. The Executive Directors are permitted to participate 
in the ShareSave Plan and details of their participation are included in the 
table on page 86.
Single figure
To aid transparency to our shareholders, the table below sets out a single

CEO data assumes an exchange rate of €1.00 = £0.81
Shareholding requirements
We believe that one of the best ways our senior executives can act and feel like shareholders is for them to hold a significant number of shares in the 
Company. We therefore expect our Executive Directors to build up a holding of Smith & Nephew shares of two times their base salary. In order to reinforce 
this expectation, we require them to retain 50% of all shares vesting under Company share plans (after tax) until this holding has been met recognising that 
differing international tax regimes affect the pace at which an Executive Director may fulfil the shareholding holding requirement. When calculating whether or 
not this requirement has been met, we will include Ordinary Shares or ADSs held by the individual and by their immediate family and the intrinsic value of any 
vested but unexercised options. 
We also require our Non-Executive Directors to hold a personal stake in the Company equivalent to their basic annual fee.
The table on page 86 shows the shares/ADRs held by the Directors. 
Dilution headroom
The Committee ensures at all times that the number of new shares which may be issued under any share-based plans, including all employee plans, does not 
exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share capital over any rolling ten-year period (of which up to 5% may be issued to satisfy awards under the Company’s 
discretionary share plans. The Committee monitors headroom closely when granting awards over shares, taking into account the number of options or shares 
that might be expected to lapse or be forfeited before vesting or exercise. In the event that insufficient new shares are available, there are processes in place to 
purchase shares in the market to satisfy vesting awards and to net-settle option exercises.
Over the previous ten years (2003 to 2012), the number of new shares issued under out share plans has been as follows: 
All-employee share plans  8,349,735 (0.92% of issued share capital as at 19 February 2013)
Discretionary share plans  34,234,721 (3.78% of issued share capital as at 19 February 2013)
Non-Executive Director fees
Non-Executive Director and Chairman fees in 2012 were as follows:

Basic annual fee £63,000 $120,000 €84,250
Committee Chairman and Senior Independent Director fee £15,000 $27,000 €20,000

Directors’ responsibilities for the accounts
 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Group and Company accounts 
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and regulations. As a 
consequence of the Company’s Ordinary Shares being traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange (in the form of American Depositary Shares) the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation and filing of an annual report on Form 20-F with 
the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  
The Directors are required to prepare Group accounts for each financial year, in 
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted 
by the European Union which present fairly the financial position of the Group and 
the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. In preparing 
those Group accounts, the Directors are required to:  
– Select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply them 
consistently;  
– Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;  
– Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and 
financial performance; and  
– State that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the accounts.  
Under United Kingdom law the Directors have elected to prepare the Company 
accounts in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), which are 
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing the Company 
accounts, the Directors are required to:  
– Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;  
– Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  
– State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts; 
and  
– Prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Company will continue in business.  
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements 
in preparing the accounts.  
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, in the case of the Group accounts, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the Group’s website. It should be noted that 
information published on the internet is accessible in many countries with different 
legal requirements. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ responsibility statement pursuant 
to disclosure and transparency Rule 4 
The Directors confirm that, to the best of each person’s knowledge:  
– The Group accounts in this report, which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group taken 
as a whole;  
– The Company accounts in this report, which have been prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
and the Companies Act 2006, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Company; and  
– The ‘Financial review and principal risks’ section contained in the accounts 
includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and 
the financial position of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditor’s UK Report  
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of 
Smith & Nephew plc 
We have audited the Group accounts of Smith & Nephew plc for the year ended 
31 December 2012 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash 
Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 
1 to 24. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement set out on 
page 89 the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
Scope of the audit of the accounts 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements:  
– give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 
2012 and of its profit for the year then ended;  
– have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and  
– have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the Group financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
Group financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  
– certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
– we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
– the Directors’ statement, set out on page 51, in relation to going concern; and  
– the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; 
and 
– certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ 
remuneration. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of Smith & 
Nephew plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 and on the information in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.  
Separate Opinion in Relation to IFRSs 
As explained in Note 1 to the Group financial statements, the Group in addition to 
complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union, has also compiled with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board.  
In our opinion the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRS, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 
and of its profit for the year then ended.

Independent auditor’s US Reports 
Report of Independent Registered Public 
Accounting Firm to the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of Smith & Nephew plc 
We have audited the accompanying Group balance sheets of Smith & Nephew 
plc as of 31 December 2012 and 2011, and the related Group income 
statements, Group statements of comprehensive income, Group cash flow 
statements and Group statements of changes in equity for each of the three years 
in the period ended 31 December 2012. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, 
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
account presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.  
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all 
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Smith & Nephew plc at 
31 December 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations 
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 
2012, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union.  
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Smith & Nephew plc’s internal control 
over financial reporting as of 31 December 2012, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organisations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated 20 February 
2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  
Ernst & Young LLP  
London, England  
20 February 2013  
Report of Independent Registered Public 
Accounting Firm to the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of Smith & Nephew plc  
We have audited Smith & Nephew plc’s internal control over financial reporting 
as of 31 December 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations 
of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).  
Smith & Nephew plc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness 
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying 
‘Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting’. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting based on our audit.  
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective 
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial 
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.  
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may 
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
In our opinion, Smith & Nephew plc maintained, in all material respects, effective 
internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2012, based on the 
COSO criteria.  
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Group balance sheets of Smith & 
Nephew plc as of 31 December 2012 and 2011, and the related Group income 
statements, Group statements of comprehensive income, Group cash flow 
statements and Group statements of changes in equity for each of the three years 
in the period ended 31 December 2012 and our report dated 20 February 2013 
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Independent auditor’s UK Report  
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of 
Smith & Nephew plc 
We have audited the Group accounts of Smith & Nephew plc for the year ended 
31 December 2012 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash 
Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 
1 to 24. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement set out on 
page 89 the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
Scope of the audit of the accounts 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements:  
– give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 
2012 and of its profit for the year then ended;  
– have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and  
– have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the Group financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
Group financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  
– certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
– we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
– the Directors’ statement, set out on page 51, in relation to going concern; and  
– the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; 
and 
– certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ 
remuneration. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of Smith & 
Nephew plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 and on the information in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.  
Separate Opinion in Relation to IFRSs 
As explained in Note 1 to the Group financial statements, the Group in addition to 
complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union, has also compiled with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board.  
In our opinion the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRS, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 
and of its profit for the year then ended.

Independent auditor’s US Reports 
Report of Independent Registered Public 
Accounting Firm to the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of Smith & Nephew plc 
We have audited the accompanying Group balance sheets of Smith & Nephew 
plc as of 31 December 2012 and 2011, and the related Group income 
statements, Group statements of comprehensive income, Group cash flow 
statements and Group statements of changes in equity for each of the three years 
in the period ended 31 December 2012. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, 
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
account presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.  
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all 
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Smith & Nephew plc at 
31 December 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations 
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 
2012, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union.  
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Smith & Nephew plc’s internal control 
over financial reporting as of 31 December 2012, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organisations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated 20 February 
2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public 
Accounting Firm to the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of Smith & Nephew plc  
We have audited Smith & Nephew plc’s internal control over financial reporting 
as of 31 December 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations 
of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).  
Smith & Nephew plc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness 
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying 
‘Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting’. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting based on our audit.  
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective 
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial 
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.  
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may 
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
In our opinion, Smith & Nephew plc maintained, in all material respects, effective 
internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2012, based on the 
COSO criteria.  
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Group balance sheets of Smith & 
Nephew plc as of 31 December 2012 and 2011, and the related Group income 
statements, Group statements of comprehensive income, Group cash flow 
statements and Group statements of changes in equity for each of the three years 
in the period ended 31 December 2012 and our report dated 20 February 2013 
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to the Group accounts
1 Basis of preparation 
Smith & Nephew plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company incorporated in 
England and Wales. In these accounts, ‘Group’ means the Company and all its 
subsidiaries. The principal activities of the Group are to develop, manufacture, 
market and sell medical devices in the sectors of Advanced Surgical Devices 
and Advanced Wound Management. 
As required by the European Union’s IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 
2006, the Group has prepared its accounts in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) 
effective as at 31 December 2012. The Group has also prepared its accounts in 
accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(‘IASB’) effective as at 31 December 2012. IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in 
certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, the differences have 
no impact for the periods presented. 
The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires management 
to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. The accounting policies requiring management to use significant 
estimates and assumptions are; inventories, impairment, retirement benefits, 
contingencies and provisions and are discussed under Critical Accounting Policies 
within the ‘Financial review and principal risks’ section on page 51. Although these 
estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and 
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. 
The Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for accounting in 
preparing the annual financial statements. The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
Consolidation 
The Group accounts include the accounts of Smith & Nephew plc (the ‘Company’) 
and its subsidiaries for the periods during which they were members of the Group. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control comprises the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit 
from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting 
rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group accounts from the date that the 
Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such 
control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and 
losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated on 
consolidation. All subsidiaries have year ends which are co-terminus with 
the Group’s. 
Recognition of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on a trade date basis in the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. The Group carries borrowings in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost. 
Foreign currencies 
Functional and presentation currency 
The Group accounts are presented in US Dollars, which is the Company’s 
functional currency. 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. 
Foreign operations 
Balance sheet items of foreign operations are translated into US Dollars on 
consolidation at year-end rates of exchange. Income statement items and the 
cash flows of overseas subsidiary undertakings and associated undertakings are 
translated at average rates as an approximation to actual transaction rates, with 
actual transaction rates used for large one off transactions. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the year-
end rates of exchange. 
The following are recognised in Other comprehensive income and are presented 
in ‘Other reserves’ within equity: exchange differences on the translation at closing 
rates of exchange of non-US Dollar opening net assets; the differences arising 
between the translation of profits into US Dollars at actual (or average, as an 
approximation) and closing exchange rates; to the extent that the hedging 
relationship is effective, the difference on translation of foreign currency 
borrowings or swaps that are used to finance or hedge the Group’s net 
investments in foreign operations; and the movement in the fair value of forward 
foreign exchange contracts used to hedge forecast foreign exchange cash flows. 
All other exchange differences are taken to the income statement. 
The exchange rates used for the translation of currencies into US Dollars that have 
the most significant impact on the Group results were: 
2012 2011 2010
Average rates   
Sterling 1.58 1.60 1.54
Euro 1.28 1.39 1.32
Swiss Franc 1.07 1.13 0.96
Year-end rates  
Sterling 1.63 1.55 1.57
Euro 1.32 1.29 1.34
Swiss Franc 1.09 1.06 1.07
New IFRS accounting standards 
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are 
effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2012 and have not been 
applied in preparing the Group accounts. None of these are expected to have a 
significant effect on the financial statements of the group, except for IFRS 9 
Financial Instruments. The Group does not plan to adopt this standard early and 
the extent of the impact has not been determined. 
 
 
2 Business segment information 
The Orthopaedics and Endoscopy business units, reported separately in the 
Group accounts for the year ended 31 December 2011, have been combined into 
a single operating division named Advanced Surgical Devices. This segmentation 
reflects the revised Group structure announced in August 2011. Revenue, trading 
profit, operating profit, total assets, total liabilities, capital expenditure, depreciation, 
amortisation, impairment, other significant information and average employees 
by business segment comparative figures have been restated to reflect this 
revised segmentation. 
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business segments 
according to the nature of its products and has two business segments – 
Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound Management. The types 
of products and services offered by each business segment are: 
– Smith & Nephew’s Advanced Surgical Devices business offers the following 
products and technologies: 
o Orthopaedic reconstruction implants which include hip, knee and shoulder 
joints as well as ancillary products such as bone cement and mixing systems 
used in cemented reconstruction joint surgery. 
o Orthopaedic trauma fixation products consisting of internal and external 
devices and other products, including shoulder fixation and orthobiological 
materials used in the stabilisation of severe fractures and deformity 
correction procedures. 
o Sports medicine products, which offer surgeons a broad array of instruments, 
technologies and implants necessary to perform minimally invasive surgery 
of the joints, including knee, hip and shoulder repair. 
o Arthroscopy Enabling Technologies which offer healthcare providers a variety 
of technologies such as fluid management equipment for surgical access 
such as high definition cameras, digital image capture, scopes, light sources 
and monitors to assist with visualisation inside the joints; radio frequency 
wands, electromechanical and mechanical blades, and hand instruments 
for removing damaged tissue. 
– Smith & Nephew’s Advanced Wound Management business offers a range 
of products from initial wound bed preparation through to full wound closure. 
These products are targeted at chronic wounds associated with the older 
population, such as pressure sores and venous leg ulcers. There are also 
products for the treatment of wounds such as burns and invasive surgery 
that impact the wider population. 
Management monitors the operating results of its business segments separately 
for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance 
assessment. Group financing (including interest receivable and payable) 
and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated 
to business segments. 
The following tables present revenue, profit, asset and liability information 
regarding the Group’s operating segments. Investments in associates and loans 
to associates is segmentally allocated to Advanced Surgical Devices. 
2.1 Revenue by business segment and geography 
Accounting policy 
Revenue comprises sales of products and services to third parties at amounts 
invoiced net of trade discounts and rebates, excluding taxes on revenue. 
Revenue from the sale of products is recognised upon transfer to the customer 
of the significant risks and rewards of ownership. This is generally when goods 
are delivered to customers. Sales of inventory located at customer premises and 
available for customers’ immediate use are recognised when notification is 
received that the product has been implanted or used. Appropriate provisions 
for returns, trade discounts and rebates are deducted from revenue. Rebates 
comprise retrospective volume discounts granted to certain customers on 
attainment of certain levels of purchases from the Group. These are accrued 
over the course of the arrangement based on estimates of the level of business 
expected and adjusted at the end of the arrangement to reflect actual volumes.

where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit: acquisition and disposal related items including amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles and impairments; significant restructuring events; gains and losses arising from legal disputes; and uninsured losses. Operating profit reconciles to trading 
profit as follows:

2.2 Trading and operating profit by business segment 
Trading profit is a trend measure which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that management considers affects 
the Group’s short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of trends. The Group has identified the following items, 
where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit: acquisition and disposal related items including amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles and impairments; significant restructuring events; gains and losses arising from legal disputes; and uninsured losses. Operating profit reconciles to trading 
profit as follows:

Research and development 
The Group considers that the regulatory, technical and market uncertainties inherent in the development of new products means that development costs should not be 
capitalised as intangible assets until products receive approval from the appropriate regulatory body. Substantially all development expenditure is complete by the time 
the product is submitted for regulatory approval. Consequently the majority of expenditure on research and development is expensed as incurred.

Department of Justice (‘DOJ’) into potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the medical devices industry. 
On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had reached settlement with the SEC and DOJ in connection with this matter and committed to pay slightly less 
than $23m in fines and profit disgorgement which have all been paid. Smith & Nephew also agreed to maintain an enhanced compliance programme and appoint an 
independent monitor for at least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme.

Foreign exchange gains or losses recognised in the income statement arose primarily on the translation of intercompany and third party borrowings and amounted 
to a net $5m loss in 2012 (2011 – net $3m gain, 2010 – net $8m gain). These amounts were fully matched in the income statement by the fair value gains or losses 
on currency swaps (carried at fair value through profit and loss) held to manage this currency risk.

Restructuring and rationalisation costs of $65m (2011 – $40m, 2010 – $15m) were incurred in the twelve month period to 31 December 2012. Charges of $65m (2011 – 
$26m, 2010 - $nil) were incurred, relating mainly to people costs and contract termination costs associated with the structural and process changes announced in August 
2011. During 2012, no charges (2011 – $14m, 2010 – $15m) were incurred in relation to the earnings improvement programme which was completed in 2011.  
3.5 Legal provision 
In 2011, the Group established a provision of $23m in connection with the previously disclosed investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) and 
Department of Justice (‘DOJ’) into potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the medical devices industry. 
On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had reached settlement with the SEC and DOJ in connection with this matter and committed to pay slightly less 
than $23m in fines and profit disgorgement which have all been paid. Smith & Nephew also agreed to maintain an enhanced compliance programme and appoint an 
independent monitor for at least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme.

Foreign exchange gains or losses recognised in the income statement arose primarily on the translation of intercompany and third party borrowings and amounted 
to a net $5m loss in 2012 (2011 – net $3m gain, 2010 – net $8m gain). These amounts were fully matched in the income statement by the fair value gains or losses 
on currency swaps (carried at fair value through profit and loss) held to manage this currency risk.

5 Taxation 
Accounting policy 
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The accounting policy for deferred taxation is set out in Note 17. 
The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world and records provisions for taxation liabilities and tax audits when it is considered probable that a tax 
charge will arise and the amount can be reliably estimated. Although Group policy is to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, 
at any time the Group has unagreed years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits. Significant issues may take many years to resolve. In estimating 
the probability and amount of any tax charge management takes into account the views of internal and external advisers and updates the amount of the provision 
whenever necessary. The ultimate tax liability may differ from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations or changes 
in legislation.

The tax charge was increased by $82m in 2012 as a consequence of the profit on disposal of net assets held for sale after adjusting for acquisition related costs, 
restructuring and rationalisation expenses and amortisation of acquisition intangibles. In 2011 and 2010 (2011 – $17m and 2010 – $10m) the tax charge was reduced 
as a consequence of restructuring and rationalisation expenses, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and legal provision. 
The applicable tax for the year is based on the United Kingdom standard rate of corporation tax of 24.5% (2011 – 26.5%, 2010 – 28%). Overseas taxation is calculated 
at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. The average effective tax rate differs from the applicable rate as follows: 
 
2012

Overseas income taxed at other than UK standard rate 9.3 6.7 4.8
Total effective tax rate 33.7 31.4 31.3
The enacted UK tax rate applicable from 1 April 2013 was reduced to 23% and the UK Government announced policy to reduce the tax rate to 21%. It is expected that 
if the stated policy is enacted deferred tax credits will arise. 
 
 
6 Earnings per Ordinary Share 
Accounting policies 
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year, 
excluding shares held by the Company in the Employees’ Share Trust or as treasury shares. 
Adjusted earnings per share 
Adjusted earnings per share is a trend measure which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that management 
considers affects the Group’s short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of trends. Adjusted attributable profit is 
the numerator used for this measure. The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be excluded when arriving at adjusted attributable profit: 
acquisition and disposal related items including amortisation of acquisition intangible assets and impairments; significant restructuring events; gains and losses arising 
from legal disputes and uninsured losses; and taxation thereon. 
The calculations of the basic, diluted and adjusted earnings per Ordinary Share are based on the following earnings and numbers of shares:

7 Property, plant and equipment 
Accounting policies 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and provision for impairment where appropriate. Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over lives ranging between 20 and 50 years. Leasehold land and buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
shorter of their estimated useful economic lives and the terms of the leases. 
Plant and equipment is depreciated over lives ranging between three and 20 years by equal annual instalments to write down the assets to their estimated residual 
value at the end of their working lives. Assets in course of construction are not depreciated until they are brought into use. 
The useful lives and residual values of all property, plant and equipment are reviewed each financial year-end, and where adjustments are required, these are 
made prospectively. 
Finance costs relating to the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that take longer than one year to complete are capitalised 
based on the Group weighted average borrowing costs. All other finance costs are expensed as incurred. 
Impairment of assets 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be 
impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss. Where it is not possible 
to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, its 
estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset.

Land and buildings includes land with a cost of $15m (2011– $14m) that is not subject to depreciation. Assets held under finance leases with a net book amount of $11m 
(2011 – $12m) are included within land and buildings and $nil (2011 – $8m) are included within plant and equipment. 
Capital expenditure represents the Group’s expected annual investment in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. This varies between 7% and 8% 
(2011 – 8%) of annual revenue. 
Group capital expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment contracted but not provided for amounted to $4m (2011 – $9m). 
8 Goodwill 
Accounting policy 
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) that is expected to benefit from the 
acquisition. The recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually.  
The Orthopaedics and Endoscopy business units, reported separately in the Group accounts for the year ended 31 December 2011, have been combined into a single 
operating division named Advanced Surgical Devices. This segmentation reflects the revised Group structure announced in August 2011. For purposes of impairment 
testing, goodwill is allocated to the related CGUs monitored by management, being the business segment level, Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound 
Management. The comparative goodwill figures previously allocated to the Orthopaedics and Endoscopy business segments have been restated and reported under 
the single business segment Advanced Surgical Devices. 
The provisional goodwill of $73 million arising on the acquisition of Healthpoint, which was completed on 21 December 2012, has been provisionally allocated to the 
Advanced Wound Management business segment and CGU. The recent transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value and supports the provisional carrying 
amount of the goodwill. Therefore, the goodwill arising from the Healthpoint acquisition was excluded from the impairment review below and as a result the future 
expected cash flows relating to this acquisition were not included in calculating the value-in-use for the Advanced Wound Management CGU. 
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. These include the future 
rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement 
and success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would 
adversely impact operating results. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have 
occurred. Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and 
then to the carrying amounts of the other assets.

In September 2012 and 2011 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill. 
These are updated during December, taking into account significant events that occurred between September and December. 
For each CGU, the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data from the Group’s 
budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board. These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows 
or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings. The five-year period is in line with the Group’s strategic planning process.

7 Property, plant and equipment 
Accounting policies 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and provision for impairment where appropriate. Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over lives ranging between 20 and 50 years. Leasehold land and buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
shorter of their estimated useful economic lives and the terms of the leases. 
Plant and equipment is depreciated over lives ranging between three and 20 years by equal annual instalments to write down the assets to their estimated residual 
value at the end of their working lives. Assets in course of construction are not depreciated until they are brought into use. 
The useful lives and residual values of all property, plant and equipment are reviewed each financial year-end, and where adjustments are required, these are 
made prospectively. 
Finance costs relating to the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that take longer than one year to complete are capitalised 
based on the Group weighted average borrowing costs. All other finance costs are expensed as incurred. 
Impairment of assets 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be 
impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss. Where it is not possible 
to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, its 
estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset.

Land and buildings includes land with a cost of $15m (2011– $14m) that is not subject to depreciation. Assets held under finance leases with a net book amount of $11m 
(2011 – $12m) are included within land and buildings and $nil (2011 – $8m) are included within plant and equipment. 
Capital expenditure represents the Group’s expected annual investment in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. This varies between 7% and 8% 
(2011 – 8%) of annual revenue. 
Group capital expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment contracted but not provided for amounted to $4m (2011 – $9m). 
8 Goodwill 
Accounting policy 
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) that is expected to benefit from the 
acquisition. The recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually.  
The Orthopaedics and Endoscopy business units, reported separately in the Group accounts for the year ended 31 December 2011, have been combined into a single 
operating division named Advanced Surgical Devices. This segmentation reflects the revised Group structure announced in August 2011. For purposes of impairment 
testing, goodwill is allocated to the related CGUs monitored by management, being the business segment level, Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound 
Management. The comparative goodwill figures previously allocated to the Orthopaedics and Endoscopy business segments have been restated and reported under 
the single business segment Advanced Surgical Devices. 
The provisional goodwill of $73 million arising on the acquisition of Healthpoint, which was completed on 21 December 2012, has been provisionally allocated to the 
Advanced Wound Management business segment and CGU. The recent transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value and supports the provisional carrying 
amount of the goodwill. Therefore, the goodwill arising from the Healthpoint acquisition was excluded from the impairment review below and as a result the future 
expected cash flows relating to this acquisition were not included in calculating the value-in-use for the Advanced Wound Management CGU. 
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. These include the future 
rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement 
and success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would 
adversely impact operating results. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have 
occurred. Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and 
then to the carrying amounts of the other assets.

In September 2012 and 2011 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill. 
These are updated during December, taking into account significant events that occurred between September and December. 
For each CGU, the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data from the Group’s 
budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board. These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows 
or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings. The five-year period is in line with the Group’s strategic planning process.

Notes to the Group accounts continued 
8 Goodwill continued 
The calculation of value-in-use for the identified CGUs is most sensitive to discount and growth rates as set out below: 
The discount rate reflects management’s assessment of risks specific to the assets of each CGU. The pre-tax discount rate used in the Advanced Surgical Devices 
business is 10% and for the Advanced Wound Management business it is 9% (2011 – 9%). 
In determining the growth rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use, the Group considered the annual sales growth and trading profit margins. Projections are based 
on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements. Each year the projections for the previous 
year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the current year. Growth rates for the five-year period for the Advanced 
Surgical Devices business vary up to 7% and for the Advanced Wound Management business up to 9% (2011 – 8%). 
Specific considerations and strategies taken into account in determining the sales growth and trading profit margin for each CGU are: 
– Advanced Surgical Devices – In the Advanced Surgical Devices CGU management intends to deliver growth through continuing to focus on the customer, high quality 
customer service, innovative product development and through continuing to make efficiency improvements. 
– Advanced Wound Management – Management intends to develop this CGU by focusing on the higher added value sectors of exudate and infection management 
through improved wound bed preparation, moist and active healing and negative pressure wound therapy, and by continuing to improve efficiency. 
A long-term growth rate of 4% (2011 – 4%) in pre-tax cash flows is assumed after five years in calculating a terminal value for the Group’s CGUs. Management considers 
this to be an appropriate estimate based on the growth rates of the markets in which the Group operates. 
Management has considered the following sensitivities: 
– Growth of market and market share – Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and market share. The value-in-use calculation shows 
that if the assumed long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of all of the CGUs independently would still be greater than their carrying values. 
– Discount rate – Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation. The value-in-use calculation shows that for the 
recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than its carrying value, the discount rate would have to be increased to 31% for the Advanced Surgical Devices business 
and 49% (2011 – 51%) for the Advanced Wound Management business. 
9 Intangible assets 
Accounting policies 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination (including purchased patents, know-how, trademarks, licences and distribution rights) are initially 
measured at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a material business combination (referred to as acquisition intangibles) is the fair value as at the date of 
acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. All intangible 
assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. The estimated useful economic life of an intangible asset ranges between three 
and 20 years depending on its nature. Internally generated intangible assets are expensed in the income statement as incurred. 
Purchased computer software and certain costs of information technology projects are capitalised as intangible assets. Software that is integral to computer hardware is 
capitalised as plant and equipment. 
Impairment of assets 
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, its 
estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset. 
In carrying out impairment reviews of intangible assets a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. These include 
the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of 
reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required 
which would adversely impact operating results.

10 Investments 
Accounting policy 
Investments, other than those related to associates, are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs on the trade date. The Group has an investment in an entity 
that holds mainly unquoted equity securities, which by their very nature have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate. The investment is classed as ‘available-for-sale’ and 
carried at fair value. The fair value of the investment is based on the underlying fair value of the equity securities: marketable securities are valued by reference to closing 
prices in the market; non-marketable securities are estimated considering factors including the purchase price, prices of recent significant private placements of 
securities of the same issuer and estimates of liquidation value. The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired. Any objective 
evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive 
income except where management considers that there is objective evidence of an impairment of the underlying equity securities, whereupon an impairment is 
recognised as an expense immediately.

Accounting policy 
Investments in associates, being those entities over which the Group has a significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, are accounted 
for using the equity method, with the Group recording its share of the associate’s net income and equity. The Group’s share in the results of its associates is included 
in one separate income statement line and is calculated after deduction of their respective taxes.  
At 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012, the Group holds 49% of the Austrian entities Plus Orthopedics GmbH and Intraplant GmbH and 20% of the German 
entity Intercus GmbH. In 2012, the profit after taxation recognised in the income statement relating to the Plus entity was $nil (2011 – $nil).  
In January 2012, the Group announced its intention to dispose of its Clinical Therapies business. This was completed on 4 May 2012. As part of the consideration, the 
Group received a 49% holding in a company called Bioventus LLC. The profit after taxation recognised in the income statement relating to Bioventus LLC for the period

12 Inventories 
Accounting policy 
Finished goods and work-in-progress are valued at factory cost, including appropriate overheads, on a first-in first-out basis. Raw materials and bought-in finished 
goods are valued at purchase price. All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where lower than cost. Inventory acquired as part of a business acquisition 
is valued at selling price less costs of disposal and a profit allowance for selling efforts. 
Orthopaedic instruments are generally not sold but provided to customers and distributors for use in surgery. They are recorded as inventory until they are deployed 
at which point they are transferred to plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives of between three and five years. 
A feature of the orthopaedic business is the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is available for customers’ 
immediate use (referred to as consignment inventory). Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way. These outer 
sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of requirements. Adjustments to carrying value 
are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation. These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels 
of inventory compared with historical or forecast usage. This formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been 
on the market for two years. This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience but it involves management judgments on effectiveness of 
inventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old products and efficiency of manufacturing planning systems.

Reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were $332m (2011 – $322m, 2010 – $322m). During 2012, $84m was recognised as an expense within cost of goods 
sold resulting from the write down of excess and obsolete inventory (2011 – $65m, 2010 – $66m). The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included 
in cost of goods sold amounted to $906m (2011 – $991m, 2010 – $909m). 
No inventory is carried at fair value less costs to sell in any year.

on the market for two years. This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience but it involves management judgments on effectiveness of 
inventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old products and efficiency of manufacturing planning systems.

Reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were $332m (2011 – $322m, 2010 – $322m). During 2012, $84m was recognised as an expense within cost of goods 
sold resulting from the write down of excess and obsolete inventory (2011 – $65m, 2010 – $66m). The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included 
in cost of goods sold amounted to $906m (2011 – $991m, 2010 – $909m). 
No inventory is carried at fair value less costs to sell in any year.

13 Trade and other receivables 
Accounting policy 
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost, less any allowances for uncollectible amounts. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater 
than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and other receivables are classified as ‘Trade and other receivables’ 
in the balance sheet. 
The Group manages credit risk through credit limits which require authorisation commensurate with the size of the limit and which are regularly reviewed. Credit limit 
decisions are made based on available financial information and the business case. Significant receivables are regularly reviewed and monitored at Group level. The 
Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers. Furthermore the Group’s principal customers are backed 
by government and public or private medical insurance funding, which historically represent a lower risk of default. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting 
date is the fair value of each class of receivable. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

Management considers that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to the fair value. 
The provision for bad and doubtful debts is based on specific assessments of risk and reference to past default experience. The bad debt expense for the year was 
$16m (2011 – $42m, 2010 – $30m). Amounts due from insurers in respect of the macrotextured claim of $137m (2011 – $136m, 2010 – $133m) are included within

15.4 Liquidity risk exposures 
The Board has established a set of policies to manage funding and currency risks. The Group uses derivative financial instruments only to manage the financial risks 
associated with underlying business activities and their financing. 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is not able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Group’s policy is to ensure that there is sufficient 
funding and facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements. The Group manages and monitors liquidity risk through regular reporting of current cash 
and borrowing balances and periodic preparation and review of short- and medium-term cash forecasts having regard to the maturities of investments and 
borrowing facilities. 
Bank loans and overdrafts represent drawings under total committed facilities of $1,017m (2011 – $1,259m) and total uncommitted facilities of $341m (2011 – $375m). 
The Group has undrawn committed facilities of $597m (2011 – $1,003m). Of the undrawn committed facilities, $586m expires after two but within five years (2011 – 
$1,000m expired after two but within five years). The interest payable on borrowings under committed facilities is at floating rate and is typically based on the LIBOR 
interest rate relevant to the term and currency concerned. Borrowings are shown at book value which approximates to fair value. 
In December 2010, the Company entered into a five-year $1 billion multi-currency revolving facility with an initial interest rate of 70 basis points over LIBOR. The 
commitment fee on the undrawn amount of the revolving facility is 24.5 basis points. The Company is subject to restrictive covenants under the facility agreement 
requiring the Group’s ratio of net debt to EBITDA to not exceed 3.0 to 1 and the ratio of EBITA to net interest to not be less than 3.0 to 1, with net debt, EBITDA, EBITA and 
net interest all being calculated as defined in the agreement. These financial covenants are tested at the end of each half year for the 12 months ending on the last day 
of the testing period. As of 31 December 2012, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. The facility is also subject to customary events of default, none 
of which are currently anticipated to occur.

15.6 Finance leases 
Accounting policy 
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly. The capital element of future lease payments is included 
in borrowings and interest is charged to profit before taxation on a reducing balance basis over the term of the lease. 
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows: 
 
 
2012  
$ million 
2011 
$ million
Within one year 3 4
After one and within two years 3 3
After two and within three years 3 3

After four and within five years  3 3
After five years 6 9
Total minimum lease payments 21 25
Discounted by imputed interest (5) (7)
Present value of minimum lease payments 16 18
Present value of minimum lease payments can be split out as: $2m (2011 – $3m) due within one year, $8m (2011 – $7m) due between one to five years and 
$6m (2011 – $8m) due after five years.

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value 
at subsequent balance sheet dates. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with 
similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments and includes counterparty 
credit risk. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast third party and intercompany transactions 
are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the 
income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other 
comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying value of the asset. 
Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at year-end. Changes in the fair values of currency swaps that are 
designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in value of the related net assets. 
Interest rate swaps transacted to fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from 
changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income 
statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss. 
Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised 
in the income statement within other finance income/(costs) as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point 
in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs. If a 
hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement 
for the period.  
  
 
 
16.1 Foreign exchange exposures 
The Group operates in over 90 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure. The Group’s policy is to limit the impact 
of foreign exchange movements on equity by holding liabilities where practical in the same currencies as the Group’s non-US Dollar assets. These liabilities take the 
form of either borrowings or currency swaps. The Group designates a portion of foreign currency borrowings in non-operating units as net investment hedges. As at 
31 December 2012, CHFnil (2011 – CHF32m) of Group borrowings were designated as net investment hedges; the movement in the fair value of these hedges 
attributable to changes in exchange rates is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The fair value of these hedges at 31 December 2012 was $nil  
(2011 – $34m). It is Group policy for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional currencies. 
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways. Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures 
arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale. The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US 
Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion 
of costs in Euros. 
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group uses forward foreign 
exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows for forecast foreign currency inventory purchases 
for up to one year. When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure. Cash flows 
relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within twelve months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of 
profit (within cost of goods sold) within a further 12-month period. The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and 
Sterling. At 31 December 2012, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $1,250m (2011 – $940m). 
Based on the Group’s borrowings as at 31 December 2012, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Group’s net borrowings would decrease 
by $8m (2011 – increase of $11m). In respect of borrowings held in a different currency to the relevant reporting entity, if the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all 
other currencies, the Group’s borrowings would decrease by $4m (2011 –  increase of $16m). Excluding borrowings designated as net investment hedges, the decrease 
would be $4m (2011 – increase of $13m); this would be fully offset by corresponding movements in group loan values. 
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2012 would have 
been $23m lower (2011 – $17m), which would be recognised through the hedging reserve. Similarly, if the Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, 
then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2012 would have been $30m higher (2011 – $24m). 
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2012 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown 
above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. 
Since it is the Group’s policy to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, 
the net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of forward foreign exchange contracts 
is not significant. In addition, the movements in the fair value of other financial instruments used for hedging such as currency swaps for which hedge accounting is not 
applied, offset movements in the values of assets and liabilities and are recognised through the income statement.  
16.2 Interest rate exposures 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and certain currency swaps which are all at floating rates. The Group uses floating to fixed interest swaps 
to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board. Interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes 
in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income, with the fair value of the interest rate swaps recorded in the 
balance sheet. The cash flows resulting from interest rate swaps match cash flows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash flow from movements in 
market interest rates on the hedged items. At 31 December 2012 the Group had no interest rate swaps (2011 – $nil). 
Based on the Group’s gross borrowings as at 31 December 2012, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest 
charge would increase by $5m (2011 – $4m). Excluding the impact of the Group’s interest rate hedges, the increase in the interest charge would be $5m (2011 – $4m). 
A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above. 
16.3 Credit risk exposures 
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions 
due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum ‘A’ rating from one of the major ratings agencies. The financial exposure of a counterparty 
is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the 
nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument. The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not 
subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates within a policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty. 
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2012 was $14m (2011 – $21m), being the total debit fair values on forward foreign exchange 
contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps. The maximum credit risk exposure on cash and bank at 31 December 2012 was $178m (2011 – $184m). 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries. 
Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 13.

15.6 Finance leases 
Accounting policy 
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly. The capital element of future lease payments is included 
in borrowings and interest is charged to profit before taxation on a reducing balance basis over the term of the lease. 
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows: 
 
 
2012  
$ million 
2011 
$ million
Within one year 3 4
After one and within two years 3 3
After two and within three years 3 3

After four and within five years  3 3
After five years 6 9
Total minimum lease payments 21 25

Present value of minimum lease payments 16 18
Present value of minimum lease payments can be split out as: $2m (2011 – $3m) due within one year, $8m (2011 – $7m) due between one to five years and 
$6m (2011 – $8m) due after five years. 
16 Financial instruments and risk management 
Accounting policy 
Derivative financial instruments  
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value 
at subsequent balance sheet dates. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with 
similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments and includes counterparty 
credit risk. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast third party and intercompany transactions 
are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the 
income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other 
comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying value of the asset. 
Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at year-end. Changes in the fair values of currency swaps that are 
designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in value of the related net assets. 
Interest rate swaps transacted to fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from 
changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income 
statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss. 
Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised 
in the income statement within other finance income/(costs) as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point 
in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs. If a 
hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement 
for the period.

attributable to changes in exchange rates is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The fair value of these hedges at 31 December 2012 was $nil

Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways. Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures 
arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale. The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US 
Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion 
of costs in Euros. 
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group uses forward foreign

relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within twelve months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of 
profit (within cost of goods sold) within a further 12-month period. The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and 
Sterling. At 31 December 2012, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $1,250m (2011 – $940m). 
Based on the Group’s borrowings as at 31 December 2012, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Group’s net borrowings would decrease 
by $8m (2011 – increase of $11m). In respect of borrowings held in a different currency to the relevant reporting entity, if the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all 
other currencies, the Group’s borrowings would decrease by $4m (2011 –  increase of $16m). Excluding borrowings designated as net investment hedges, the decrease 
would be $4m (2011 – increase of $13m); this would be fully offset by corresponding movements in group loan values. 
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2012 would have 
been $23m lower (2011 – $17m), which would be recognised through the hedging reserve. Similarly, if the Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, 
then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2012 would have been $30m higher (2011 – $24m). 
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2012 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown 
above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. 
Since it is the Group’s policy to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, 
the net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of forward foreign exchange contracts 
is not significant. In addition, the movements in the fair value of other financial instruments used for hedging such as currency swaps for which hedge accounting is not 
applied, offset movements in the values of assets and liabilities and are recognised through the income statement.  
16.2 Interest rate exposures 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and certain currency swaps which are all at floating rates. The Group uses floating to fixed interest swaps 
to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board. Interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes 
in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income, with the fair value of the interest rate swaps recorded in the 
balance sheet. The cash flows resulting from interest rate swaps match cash flows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash flow from movements in 
market interest rates on the hedged items. At 31 December 2012 the Group had no interest rate swaps (2011 – $nil). 
Based on the Group’s gross borrowings as at 31 December 2012, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest 
charge would increase by $5m (2011 – $4m). Excluding the impact of the Group’s interest rate hedges, the increase in the interest charge would be $5m (2011 – $4m). 
A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above.

The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions

is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the

The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2012 was $14m (2011 – $21m), being the total debit fair values on forward foreign exchange 
contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps. The maximum credit risk exposure on cash and bank at 31 December 2012 was $178m (2011 – $184m). 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries.

At 31 December 2012, $16m (2011 – $18m) of fixed rate liabilities relate to finance leases. In 2012, the Group also had liabilities due for deferred acquisition 
consideration (denominated in US Dollars, Euro and Yen) totalling $8m (2011 – $11m, 2010 – $nil) on which no interest was payable (see Note 14). There are no other 
significant interest bearing financial liabilities. 
Floating rates on liabilities are typically based on the one or three-month LIBOR interest rate relevant to the currency concerned. The weighted average interest rate on 
floating rate borrowings as at 31 December 2012 was 1% (2011 – 2%).

16.5 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
For cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and receivables, overdrafts and other short-term liabilities which have a maturity of less than three months the book 
values approximate the fair values because of their short-term nature. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are recorded at fair value. These are regarded as Level 2 financial instruments measured at fair value. Level 2 financial instruments 
are defined as: Valuation techniques for which all observable inputs have a significant effect on the recorded fair values, either directly or indirectly. The Group only has 
Level 2 financial instruments measured at fair value. 
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with 
market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward 
pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot 
and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves. 
As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the mark-to-market value of a derivative asset position is net of a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative 
counterparty default risk. The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and 
other financial instruments recognised at fair value. 
Long-term borrowings are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost. As the Group’s long-term borrowings are not quoted publicly and as market prices are not 
available their fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values at the current market interest rates available to the Group for 
similar financial instruments as at the year-end. At 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the fair value of the Group’s long-term borrowing was not materially 
different from amortised cost. 
17 Deferred taxation 
Accounting policy 
Deferred taxation is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of investments in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that this will not reverse in the foreseeable future; on the initial recognition of non-deductible goodwill; and 
on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, does not affect the accounting 
or taxable profit. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. 
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis, and at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to 
other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity respectively. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, when the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

For cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and receivables, overdrafts and other short-term liabilities which have a maturity of less than three months the book 
values approximate the fair values because of their short-term nature. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are recorded at fair value. These are regarded as Level 2 financial instruments measured at fair value. Level 2 financial instruments

As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the mark-to-market value of a derivative asset position is net of a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative 
counterparty default risk. The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and 
other financial instruments recognised at fair value. 
Long-term borrowings are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost. As the Group’s long-term borrowings are not quoted publicly and as market prices are not 
available their fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values at the current market interest rates available to the Group for 
similar financial instruments as at the year-end. At 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the fair value of the Group’s long-term borrowing was not materially 
different from amortised cost. 
17 Deferred taxation 
Accounting policy 
Deferred taxation is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of investments in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that this will not reverse in the foreseeable future; on the initial recognition of non-deductible goodwill; and 
on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, does not affect the accounting 
or taxable profit. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. 
Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis, and at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to 
other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity respectively. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, when the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

18 Provisions and contingencies 
Accounting policy 
In the normal course of business the Group is involved in numerous legal disputes. Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is deemed probable that an 
adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Where the Group is the plaintiff in pursuing claims against third parties legal and 
associated expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred.  
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation. In making its estimates management takes into account the advice of 
internal and external legal counsel. Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes. The ultimate 
liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the outcome of court proceedings or settlement negotiations or as new facts emerge. 
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting 
its obligations under the contract. For the purposes of calculating any onerous lease provision, the Group has taken the discounted future lease payments, net of 
expected rental income. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

The principal provisions within rationalisation provisions relate to the rationalisation of operational sites (mainly severance and legal costs) arising from the legacy earnings 
improvement programme and people costs associated with the structural and process changes announced in August 2011. 
Included within the legal and other provisions are: 
– $17m (2011 – $17m) relating to the declination of insurance coverage for macrotextured knee revisions (see Note 18.2). 
– $nil (2011 – $23m) in connection with the previously disclosed investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) and Department of Justice (‘DOJ’) 
into potential violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the medical devices industry. On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had reached 
settlement with the SEC and DOJ in connection with this matter. Smith & Nephew committed to pay approximately $23m in fines and profit disgorgement, maintain 
an enhanced compliance programme, and appoint an independent monitor for at least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme. 
– A provision of $13m has been established following the acquisition of Healthpoint Biotherapeutics (see Note 22). 
– The remaining balance largely represents provisions for various litigation and patent disputes. 
All provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within three years of 31 December 2012 and none are treated as financial instruments.

Notes to the Group accounts continued 
18 Provisions and contingencies continued 
18.2 Contingencies 
The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, some of which include claims for substantial damages. The outcome of these proceedings 
cannot readily be foreseen, but management believes none of them will result in a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group. The Group provides for 
outcomes that are deemed to be probable and can be reliably estimated. There is no assurance that losses will not exceed provisions or will not have a significant impact 
on the Group’s results of operations in the period in which they are realised. 
In August 2003, the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components. A number of related claims have 
been filed, most of which have been settled. The aggregate cost at 31 December 2012 related to this matter is approximately $214m. The Group has sought recovery 
from its primary and excess insurers for costs of resolving the claims. The primary insurance carrier has paid $60m in full settlement of its policy liability. However, the 
excess carriers have denied coverage, citing defences relating to the wording of the insurance policies and other matters. In December 2004, the Group brought suit 
against them in the US District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, and trial is expected to commence in 2013. An additional $22m was received during 2007 
from a successful settlement with a third party. 
A charge of $154m was recorded in 2004 for anticipated expenses in connection with macrotexture claims. Most of that amount has since been applied to settlements 
of such claims. Management believes that the $17m provision remaining is adequate to cover remaining claims. Given the uncertainty inherent in such matters, there 
can be no assurance on this point. 
The Group is engaged, as both plaintiff and defendant, in litigation with various competitors and others over claims of patent infringement and, in some cases, breach of 
licence agreement. These disputes are being heard in courts in the United States and other jurisdictions and also before agencies that examine patents. Outcomes are 
rarely certain with costs and settlements often significant. 
19 Retirement benefit obligations 
Accounting policy 
The Group’s major pension plans are of the defined benefit type. For these plans, the employer’s portion of past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, 
with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within other finance income/(costs). Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in full directly 
in other comprehensive income such that the balance sheet reflects the plan’s surpluses or deficits as at the balance sheet date. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by external actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation 
is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates that reference high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency 
in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
A number of key assumptions have to be made in calculating the fair value of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans. These assumptions impact the balance sheet 
assets and liabilities, operating profit and finance income/(costs). The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and mortality assumptions to 
be applied to future pension plan liabilities. The most important assumption for the plan assets is the future expected return. In determining these assumptions 
management takes into account the advice of professional external actuaries and benchmarks its assumptions against external data. 
Where defined contribution plans operate, the contributions to these plans are charged to operating profit as they become payable.

(i) The analysis in this note for ‘Other Plans’ combines both the funded and unfunded retirement benefit obligations. 
The Group sponsors pension plans for its employees in most of the countries in which it has major operating companies. Pension plans are established under the laws of 
the relevant country. Funded plans are funded by the payment of contributions to, and the assets held by, separate trust funds or insurance companies. In those countries 
where there is no Company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered adequate. Employees’ retirement benefits are the subject of regular management 
review. The Group’s major defined benefit pension plans in the UK and US were closed to new employees in 2003 and replaced by defined contribution plans. 
Defined benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement benefits varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of retirement age. 
The level of entitlement is dependent on the years of service of the employee. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost are measured using the projected unit method. Under the projected unit method, 
the current service cost will increase as the members of the defined benefit plans approach retirement. The principal actuarial assumptions used by the independent 
qualified actuaries in valuing the major plans in the United Kingdom (‘UK Plan’), the United States (‘US Plan’) and all other plans (‘Other Plans’) and a breakdown of the 
pension costs charged to income are as follows:

expenses. The interest cost and expected return on plan assets are reported as other finance costs. 
The total cost charged to income in respect of the Group’s defined contribution plans represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified 
in the rules of the plans. As at 31 December 2012, there were $nil outstanding payments due to be paid over to the plans (2011 – $nil, 2010 – $nil).

The Group recharges the UK pension plan with the costs of administration and independent advisers. The amount recharged in the year was $2m (2011 – $2m, 2010 – 
$2m). The amount receivable at 31 December 2012 was $nil (2011 – $nil, 2010 – $nil). 
19.8 Retirement healthcare 
The cost of providing healthcare benefits after retirement is determined by independent actuaries. The principal actuarial assumptions in determining the cost of providing 
healthcare benefits are those in the UK and the US and are as follows: 
 
2012 2011 2010 
UK US UK US UK US
% per annum   
Discount rate 4.5 4.0 4.9 4.6 5.5  5.6 
Medical cost inflation 7.0 7.5 7.0 8.0 7.0  8.0 
A 1 percentage point change in the rate of medical cost inflation would not affect the accumulated retirement benefit obligations, or the aggregate of the current service 
and interest costs, of the UK or US plans in 2012 by more than $3m (2011 – more than $2m, 2010 – more than $2m). 
For the US the retirement healthcare cost trend for 2013 is expected to be 3.5% above the discount rate. Thereafter the healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decrease 
each year by 0.5% to an ultimate rate of 5%. For the UK it will remain flat at 7%.

The deferred shares were issued in 2006 in order to comply with English Company law. They are not listed on any stock exchange and have extremely limited rights 
and effectively have no value. These rights are summarised as follows: 
– The holder shall not be entitled to participate in the profits of the Company; 
– The holder shall not have any right to participate in any distribution of the Company’s assets on a winding up or other distribution except that after the return of the 
nominal amount paid up on each share in the capital of the Company of any class other than the Deferred Shares and the distribution of a further $1,000 in respect 
of each such share there shall be distributed to a holder of a Deferred Share (for each Deferred Share held by him) an amount equal to the nominal value of the 
Deferred Share; 
– The holder shall not be entitled to receive notice, attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company; and 
– The Company may create, allot and issue further shares or reduce or repay the whole or any part of its share capital or other capital reserves without obtaining 
the consent of the holders of the Deferred Shares. 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has adequate funds to continue as a going concern and sufficient flexibility within the capital 
structure to fund the ongoing growth of the business and to take advantage of business development opportunities including acquisitions. 
The Group determines the amount of capital taking into account changes in business risks and future cash requirements. The Group reviews its capital structure 
on an ongoing basis and uses share buy-backs, dividends and the issue of new shares to adjust the retained capital. 
The Group considers the capital that it manages to be as follows:

and interest costs, of the UK or US plans in 2012 by more than $3m (2011 – more than $2m, 2010 – more than $2m). 
For the US the retirement healthcare cost trend for 2013 is expected to be 3.5% above the discount rate. Thereafter the healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decrease 
each year by 0.5% to an ultimate rate of 5%. For the UK it will remain flat at 7%.

The deferred shares were issued in 2006 in order to comply with English Company law. They are not listed on any stock exchange and have extremely limited rights 
and effectively have no value. These rights are summarised as follows: 
– The holder shall not be entitled to participate in the profits of the Company; 
– The holder shall not have any right to participate in any distribution of the Company’s assets on a winding up or other distribution except that after the return of the 
nominal amount paid up on each share in the capital of the Company of any class other than the Deferred Shares and the distribution of a further $1,000 in respect 
of each such share there shall be distributed to a holder of a Deferred Share (for each Deferred Share held by him) an amount equal to the nominal value of the 
Deferred Share; 
– The holder shall not be entitled to receive notice, attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company; and 
– The Company may create, allot and issue further shares or reduce or repay the whole or any part of its share capital or other capital reserves without obtaining 
the consent of the holders of the Deferred Shares. 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has adequate funds to continue as a going concern and sufficient flexibility within the capital 
structure to fund the ongoing growth of the business and to take advantage of business development opportunities including acquisitions. 
The Group determines the amount of capital taking into account changes in business risks and future cash requirements. The Group reviews its capital structure 
on an ongoing basis and uses share buy-backs, dividends and the issue of new shares to adjust the retained capital. 
The Group considers the capital that it manages to be as follows:

20.2 Treasury shares 
Treasury shares represents the holding of the Company’s own shares in respect of the Smith & Nephew Employee’s Share Trust and shares bought back as part of the 
share buy-back programme, which was suspended in 2008. 
The Smith & Nephew 2004 Employees’ Share Trust (‘Trust’) was established to hold shares relating to the long-term incentive plans referred to in the ‘Directors’ 
Remuneration Report’. The Trust is administered by an independent professional trust company resident in Jersey and is funded by a loan from the Company. The cost 
of the Trust is charged to the income statement as it accrues. A partial dividend waiver is in place in respect of those shares held under the long-term incentive plans. 
The trust only accepts dividends in respect of nil-cost options and deferred bonus plan shares. The waiver represents less than 1% of the total dividends paid.

22 Acquisitions and assets held for sale 
Accounting policy 
On acquisition, identifiable assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) of subsidiaries and associates are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition 
using the acquisition method. The fair value of assets includes the taxation benefits resulting from amortisation for income taxation purposes from which a third party 
separately acquiring the assets would reasonably be expected to benefit. Goodwill, representing the excess of purchase consideration over the Group’s share of the 
fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised. 
22.1 Acquisitions 
Year ended 31 December 2012 
On 21 December 2012 the Group acquired substantially all the assets of Healthpoint Biotherapeutics (‘Healthpoint’), a leader in bioactive debridement, dermal repair and 
regeneration wound care treatments.  
The acquisition is deemed to be a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3. Consideration was in the form of a single payment of $782m. The fair values shown 
below are provisional. If new information is obtained within the measurement period (no more than one year after the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that 
existed at the acquisition date, the acquisition accounting will be revised. 
The provisional estimate of the goodwill arising on the acquisition is $73m. It is attributable to the additional economic benefits expected from the transaction, including 
revenue synergies and the assembled workforce, which has been transferred as part of the acquisition. The goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax 
purposes. 
The following table summarises the consideration transferred, and the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.

Cost of acquisition  782
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of $11m related to professional and advisor fees. These costs have been recognised in administrative expenses in the 
income statement. No ‘acquisition related costs’ were incurred in 2011 or 2010. 
In 2012, since the date of acquisition the contribution to attributable profit from Healthpoint products was immaterial. The unaudited revenues from Healthpoint products 
during 2012 were $190m. Given the proximity of the acquisition to year-end it is impracticable to determine what the consolidated attributable profit would have been had 
the acquisition taken place at the beginning of the year. 
  
 
Year ended 31 December 2011 
On 23 June 2011, Smith & Nephew acquired 100% of the voting rights of Tenet Medical Engineering, Inc., for an initial payment of $35m, a further payment of $3m, 
deferred for 18 months, and up to $14.5m based on the achievement of future revenue milestones. The cost is assessed as $46m, being the fair value of the 
probable consideration.

In the year ended 31 December 2010 there were no acquisitions.

Year ended 31 December 2012 
In January 2012, the Group announced its intention to sell the Clinical Therapies business to Bioventus LLC (‘Bioventus’). This was completed during May 2012 for a total 
consideration of $367m and resulted in a profit on disposal before taxation of $251m. The revenue of the Clinical Therapies business in the four-month period to disposal 
was $69m and profit before taxation was $12m. The details of the transaction are set out below.

24.1 Share-based payments 
Accounting policy 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled executive and employee share plans. For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value at the grant date is 
calculated using appropriate option pricing models. The grant date fair value is recognised over the vesting period as an expense, with a corresponding increase in 
retained earnings. 
Employee plans

Sharesave Plan (2012) (adopted by shareholders on 12 April 2012) are together termed the “Employee Plans”. 
The SAYE and SAYE 2012 plans are available to all employees in the UK employed by participating Group companies, subject to three months’ service. The schemes 
provide for employees to save up to £250 per month and gives them an option to acquire shares based on the committed amount to be saved. The option price is 
not less than 80% of the average of middle market quotations of the Ordinary Shares on the three dealing days preceding the date of invitation. The Smith & Nephew 
International Sharesave Plan (2002) and Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan (2012) are available to employees in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and 
the United Arab Emirates. Employees in India, Ireland and Italy participated in these plans for the first time in 2012. The Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan (2002) 
and Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan (2012) are available to all employees in France. The International and French plans operate on a substantially similar basis 
to the SAYE plans.  
Employees in the US are able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the opportunity to acquire shares, in the form of ADSs, at a discount 
of 15% (or more if the shares appreciate in value during the plan’s quarterly purchase period) to the market price, through a regular savings plan. 
Executive plans 
The Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan 
(adopted by shareholders on 4 April 2001), the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan (adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2004) and the Smith & Nephew 
Global Share Plan 2010 (adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2010) are together termed the “Executive Plans”. 
Under the terms of the Executive Plans, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may at their discretion approve the grant of options to 
employees of the Group to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company. Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan (the “US Plan”) and the Smith & 
Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan are to acquire ADSs or Ordinary Shares. For Executive Plans adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average 
quoted price of an Ordinary Share for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the average quoted price of an ADS or Ordinary Share, for the three 
business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant if higher. For the Global Share Plan adopted in 2010 the market value is the closing 
price of an Ordinary Share or ADS on the last trading day prior to the grant date. With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 
2010, the vesting of options granted from 2001 are subject to achievement of a performance condition. Options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share 
Plan 2010 are not subject to any performance conditions. Prior to 2008, the 2001 US Plan options became cumulatively exercisable as to 10% after one year, 30% after 
two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years. With effect from 2008, options granted under the 2001 US Plan became cumulatively 
exercisable as to 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year. The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan was open 
to certain employees outside the US and the US Plan is open to certain employees in the US, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Global Share Plan 2010 is open 
to employees globally. The 2004 Plan was open to senior executives only. 
The maximum term of options granted, under all plans, is 10 years from the date of grant. All share option plans are settled in shares.

24.1 Share-based payments 
Accounting policy 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled executive and employee share plans. For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value at the grant date is 
calculated using appropriate option pricing models. The grant date fair value is recognised over the vesting period as an expense, with a corresponding increase in 
retained earnings.

Executive Plans 3,046 148.7 650.0 650.0 10.0
The weighted average fair value of options granted under employee plans during 2011 was 189.2p (2010 – 170.2p) and those under executive plans during 2011 was 
176.1p (2010 – 173.7p). 
Options granted under the executive plans are valued using a binomial model. Options granted under employee plans are valued using the Black-Scholes option model 
as management consider that options granted under these plans are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date. Options granted under each plan are 
valued separately and a weighted average fair value is calculated. 
The binomial model is used for executive plans so that proper allowance is made for the possibility of early exercise. At the 2012 grant, management expected 90% of the 
options granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 to vest (2011 – 90%, 2010 – 90%). Each year an assessment is made of the current vesting estimates and they are 
updated to reflect revised expectations of the number of grants that will vest. 
For all plans the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant. The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted: 
 Employee plans Executive plans
 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010
Dividend yield % 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5
Expected volatility % (i) 25.0 30.0 30.0 25.0 30.0 30.0
Risk free interest rate % (ii) 1.3 2.0 2.5 1.2 2.0 2.5
Expected life in years (iii) 3.8 3.9 3.9 10.0 10.0 9.8
(i) Volatility is assessed on a historic basis primarily based on past share price movements over the expected life of the options. 
(ii) The risk free interest rate reflects the yields available on zero coupon government bonds over the option term and currency. 
(iii) An assessment of an Executive Plan’s option life is based on an exercise model. This is based on a mixture of historic experience and generally accepted behavioural traits. 5% (2011 – 5%, 
2010 – 5%) of Executive Plan option holders are assumed to leave and exercise their options (or forfeit them if under water) each year after vesting. In addition, 50% (2011 – 50%, 2010 – 50%) 
of Executive Plan option holders are assumed to exercise by choice per annum providing the gain available is at least 25% for the options granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 (2011 – 
50% for the options granted to executives and 25% for other recipients under the Global Share Plan 2010, 2010 – 50% for the 2004 Plan and 50% for the options granted to executives and 
25% for other recipients under the Global Share Plan 2010).

(i) Volatility is assessed on a historic basis primarily based on past share price movements over the expected life of the options. 
(ii) The risk free interest rate reflects the yields available on zero coupon government bonds over the option term and currency. 
(iii) An assessment of an Executive Plan’s option life is based on an exercise model. This is based on a mixture of historic experience and generally accepted behavioural traits. 5% (2011 – 5%, 
2010 – 5%) of Executive Plan option holders are assumed to leave and exercise their options (or forfeit them if under water) each year after vesting. In addition, 50% (2011 – 50%, 2010 – 50%) 
of Executive Plan option holders are assumed to exercise by choice per annum providing the gain available is at least 25% for the options granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 (2011 – 
50% for the options granted to executives and 25% for other recipients under the Global Share Plan 2010, 2010 – 50% for the 2004 Plan and 50% for the options granted to executives and 
25% for other recipients under the Global Share Plan 2010).

Share-based payments – long-term incentive plans 
In 2004, a share-based incentive plan was introduced for Executive Directors, executive officers and the next level of senior executives, which replaced the Long-term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP). The plan included a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) and a Bonus Co-Investment Plan (“CIP”). 
Vesting of the PSP awards is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the medical devices 
industry. 
Under the CIP, participants could elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares. If the shares are held for three years and the 
Group’s EPSA growth targets are achieved participants receive an award of matching shares for each share purchased. 
From 2009, the CIP was replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan. This plan was designed to encourage executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in 
the Company. Under the plan, up to one third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an eligible employee was compulsorily deferred into shares which vested, 
subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years (i.e. one third each year). No further performance conditions applied to the deferred shares. 
From 2010, Performance Share awards were granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 for all executives other than Executive Directors. Awards granted under both 
plans are combined to provide the figures below. Vesting of the share awards is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major 
international companies in the medical devices industry. 
From 2012, Deferred Bonus Plan and GSP 2010 options for Executive Directors, executive officers and the next level of senior executives were replaced by Equity 
Incentive Awards (“EIA”). EIA are designed to encourage executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company. EIA will vest, in equal annual 
tranches over three years (i.e. one third each year), subject to continued employment and personal performance. No further performance conditions will apply to the EIA. 
The fair values of awards granted under long-term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model. The exercise price for all awards granted under the long term 
incentive plans is $nil. Performance Share awards under both the PSP and Global Share Plan 2010 contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group 
which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date 
calculations. The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups. A correlation of 35% (2011 – 40%, 2010 – 35%) has also been assumed for the 
companies in the medical devices sector as they are impacted by similar factors. The Performance Target for the Global Share Plan 2010 is a combination of Free Cash 
Flow growth and the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance over the three year performance period. 
The other assumptions used are consistent with the executive scheme assumptions disclosed in Note 24.1. 
At 31 December 2012 the maximum number of shares that could be awarded under the Group’s long-term incentive plans was:

(2011 – 1.7 years, 2010 – 1.9 years) for the Deferred Bonus Plan, 2.2 years for the EIA and 0.9 years for the other awards (2011 – 1.5 years). There were no awards

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual

Notes to the Company accounts 
1 Basis of preparation 
The separate accounts of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments as described below, and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. 
As consolidated financial information has been disclosed under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the Company is exempt from FRS 29 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures. The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and are 
presented on pages 92 to 138. 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures not to present its related party disclosures as the Group accounts contain these 
disclosures. In addition, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements not to present its own cash flow statement as the Group 
accounts contain a consolidated cash flow. 
In applying these policies management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates 
are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences are dealt with in arriving at profit before taxation. 
Deferred taxation 
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have 
occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse. 
These are based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
2 Results for the year 
As permitted by section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. Profit for the year was $167m 
(2011: $166m).

Group information  
Business overview and Group history 
Smith & Nephew’s operations are organised into two primary divisions that operate globally: Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound Management. 
The Group has a history dating back over 150 years to the family enterprise of Thomas James Smith who opened a small pharmacy in Hull, UK in 1856. Following his 
death in 1896, his nephew Horatio Nelson Smith took over the management of the business. 
By the late 1990s, Smith & Nephew had expanded into being a diverse healthcare conglomerate with operations across the globe, producing various medical devices, 
personal care products and traditional and advanced wound care treatments. In 1998, Smith & Nephew announced a major restructuring to focus management attention 
and investment on three global business units – advanced wound management, endoscopy and orthopaedics – which offered high growth and margin opportunities. 
In 2011, the Endoscopy and Orthopaedics businesses were brought together to create an Advanced Surgical Devices division. 
Smith & Nephew was incorporated and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1937 and in 1999 the Group was also listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2001, 
Smith & Nephew became a constituent member of the FTSE-100 index in the UK. This means that Smith & Nephew is included in the top 100 companies traded on the 
London Stock Exchange measured in terms of market capitalisation. 
Today, Smith & Nephew is a public limited company incorporated and headquartered in the UK and carries out business around the world.

are leasehold. The Group has freehold and leasehold interests in real estate in other countries throughout the world, but no other is individually significant to the Group. 
Where required, the appropriate governmental authorities have approved the facilities.

The agreed contributions for 2013 in respect of the Group’s defined benefits plans are: $39m for the UK (including $30m of supplementary payments), $17m for the US 
plan and $6m for other funded defined benefit plans. The table above does not include amounts payable in respect of 2014 and beyond as these are subject to future 
agreement and amounts cannot be reasonably estimated. 
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change in control of the Company or the Group following a takeover, such as bank loan 
agreements and Company share plans. None of these are deemed to be significant in terms of their potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole. In addition, 
there are service contracts between the Company and its Executive Directors which provide for the automatic payment of a bonus following loss of office or employment 
occurring because of a successful takeover bid. Further details are set out on page 78. 
The Company does not have contracts or other arrangements which individually are essential to the business. 
Off-balance sheet arrangements 
Management believes that the Group does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the SEC in item 5E of Form 20-F, that have or are reasonably 
likely to have a current or future effect on the Group’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital 
expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 
Related party transactions 
Except for transactions with associates (see Note 24.2 of Notes to the Group Accounts), no other related party had material transactions or loans with Smith & Nephew 
over the last three financial years.

Risk factors 
There are known and unknown risks and uncertainties relating to Smith & Nephew’s business. The factors listed below could cause the Group’s business, 
financial position and results of operations to differ materially and adversely from expected and historical levels. In addition, other factors not listed here that Smith & 
Nephew cannot presently identify or does not believe to be equally significant could also materially adversely affect Smith & Nephew’s business, financial position 
or results of operations. 
Highly competitive markets 
The Group’s business segments compete across a diverse range of geographic and product markets. Each market in which the business segments operate contains 
a number of different competitors, including specialised and international corporations. Significant product innovations, technical advances or the intensification of price 
competition by competitors could adversely affect the Group’s operating results. 
Some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than Smith & Nephew. These competitors may be able to initiate technological 
advances in the field, deliver products on more attractive terms, more aggressively market their products or invest larger amounts of capital and research and 
development into their businesses. 
There is a possibility of further consolidation of competitors, which could adversely affect the Group’s ability to compete with larger companies due to insufficient financial 
resources. If any of the Group’s businesses were to lose market share or achieve lower than expected sales growth, there could be a disproportionate adverse impact 
on the Group’s share price and its strategic options. 
Competition exists among healthcare providers to gain patients on the basis of quality, service and price. There has been some consolidation in the Group’s customer 
base and this trend is expected to continue. Increased competition and unanticipated actions by competitors or customers could lead to downward pressure on 
prices and/or a decline in market share in any of the Group’s business areas, which could adversely affect Smith & Nephew’s results of operations and hinder its 
growth potential. 
Continual development and introduction of new products  
The medical devices industry has a rapid rate of new product introduction. In order to remain competitive, each of the Group’s business segments must continue to 
develop innovative products that satisfy customer needs and preferences or provide cost or other advantages. Developing new products is a costly, lengthy and uncertain 
process. A potential product may not be brought to market or not succeed in the market for any number of reasons, including failure to work optimally, failure to receive 
regulatory approval, failure to be cost-competitive, infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights and changes in consumer demand. The Group’s products 
and technologies are also subject to marketing attack by competitors. Furthermore, new products that are developed and marketed by the Group’s competitors may affect 
price levels in the various markets in which the Group’s business segments operate. If the Group’s new products do not remain competitive with those of competitors, the 
Group’s revenue could decline. 
The Group maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. 
Marketplace changes resulting from the introduction of new products or surgical procedures may cause some of the Group’s products to become obsolete. The Group 
makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical 
experience, expiration of sterilisation dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less 
favourable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. 
Dependence on government and other funding 
In most established markets throughout the world, expenditure on medical devices is ultimately controlled to a large extent by governments. Funds may be made 
available or withdrawn from healthcare budgets depending on government policy. The Group is therefore largely dependent on future governments providing increased 
funds commensurate with the increased demand arising from demographic trends. 
Pricing of the Group’s products is largely governed in most established markets by governmental reimbursement authorities. Initiatives sponsored by government 
agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, excise taxes and competitive pricing, are ongoing in 
markets where the Group has operations. This control may be exercised by determining prices for an individual product or for an entire procedure. The Group is exposed 
to changes in reimbursement policy, tax policy and pricing which may have an adverse impact on sales and operating profit. In particular, changes to the healthcare 
legislation in the US are due to impose significant taxes on medical device manufacturers from 2013. There may be an increased risk of adverse changes to government 
funding policies arising from the deterioration in macro-economic conditions in some of the Group’s markets. 
The Group must adhere to the rules laid down by government agencies that fund or regulate healthcare, including extensive and complex rules in the US. Failure to do so 
could result in fines or loss of future funding. 
World economic conditions 
Demand for the Group’s products is driven by demographic trends, including the ageing population and the incidence of osteoporosis and obesity. Supply of, use of and 
payment for the Group’s products are also influenced by world economic conditions which could place increased pressure on demand and pricing, adversely impacting 
the Group’s ability to deliver revenue and margin growth. The conditions could favour larger, better capitalised groups, with higher market shares and margins. As a 
consequence, the Group’s prosperity is linked to general economic conditions and there is a risk of deterioration of the Group’s performance and finances during adverse 
macro-economic conditions. 
During 2012, economic conditions worldwide continued to create several challenges for the Group, including deferrals of joint replacement procedures, heightened 
pricing pressure, significant declines in capital equipment expenditures at hospitals and increased uncertainty over the collectability of European government debt, 
particularly those in certain parts of southern Europe. These factors tempered the overall growth of the Group’s global markets and could have an increased impact on 
growth in the future. 
  
 
 
Political uncertainties 
The Group operates on a worldwide basis and has distribution channels, purchasing agents and buying entities in over 90 countries. Political upheaval in some of those 
countries or in surrounding regions may impact the Group’s results of operations. Political changes in a country could prevent the Group from receiving remittances of 
profit from a member of the Group located in that country or from selling its products or investments in that country. Furthermore, changes in government policy regarding 
import quotas, taxation or other matters could adversely affect the Group’s turnover and operating profit. War, terrorist activities or other conflict could also adversely 
impact the Group. 
Currency fluctuations 
Smith & Nephew’s results of operations are affected by transactional exchange rate movements in that they are subject to exposures arising from revenue in a currency 
different from the related costs and expenses. The Group’s manufacturing cost base is situated principally in the US, the UK, China and Switzerland, from which finished 
products are exported to the Group’s selling operations worldwide. Thus, the Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between the US Dollar, Sterling and 
Swiss Franc and the currency of the Group’s selling operations, particularly the Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. If the US Dollar, Sterling or Swiss Franc should 
strengthen against the Euro, Australian Dollar and the Japanese Yen, the Group’s trading margin could be adversely affected. 
The Group manages the impact of exchange rate movements on sales and cost of goods sold by a policy of transacting forward foreign currency commitments when 
firm purchase orders are placed. In addition, the Group’s policy is for forecast transactions to be covered between 50% and 90% for up to one year. 
The Group uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency and the US Dollar is the functional currency of Smith & Nephew plc. The Group’s revenues, profits and earnings 
are also affected by exchange rate movements on the translation of results of operations in foreign subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes. See ‘Financial position, 
liquidity and capital resources’ on page 50. 
Manufacturing and supply 
The Group’s manufacturing production is concentrated at 12 main facilities in Memphis, Mansfield and Oklahoma City in the US, Hull, Warwick and Gilberdyke in the 
UK, Aarau in Switzerland, Tuttlingen in Germany, Fort Saskatchewan and Calgary in Canada and Suzhou and Beijing in China. If major physical disruption took place at 
any of these sites, it could adversely affect the results of operations. Physical loss and consequential loss insurance is carried to cover such risks but is subject to limits 
and deductibles and may not be sufficient to cover catastrophic loss. Management of orthopaedic inventory is complex, particularly forecasting and production planning. 
There is a risk that failures in operational execution could lead to excess inventory or individual product shortages. 
Each of the business segments is reliant on certain key suppliers of raw materials, components, finished products and packaging materials. These suppliers must provide 
the materials and perform the activities to the Group’s standard of quality requirements. If any of these suppliers is unable to meet the Group’s needs, compromises on 
standards of quality or substantially increases its prices, Smith & Nephew would need to seek alternative suppliers. There can be no assurance that alternative suppliers 
would provide the necessary raw materials on favourable or cost-effective terms at the desired quality. Consequently, the Group may be forced to pay higher prices to 
obtain raw materials, which it may not be able to pass on to its customers in the form of increased prices for its finished products. In addition, some of the raw materials 
used may become unavailable, and there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to obtain suitable and cost-effective substitutes. Any interruption of supply 
caused by these or other factors could negatively impact Smith & Nephew’s revenue and operating profit. 
The Group uses a variety of information systems to conduct its manufacturing, supply and selling operations. An unrecoverable fault in one of these systems could disrupt 
trading in certain markets and locations. 
The Group is in the process of outsourcing to third parties or relocating to lower cost countries certain of its manufacturing and other processes. As a result of these 
transfers, there is a risk of disruption to supply. 
Attracting and retaining key personnel 
The Group’s continued development depends on its ability to hire and retain highly-skilled personnel with particular expertise. This is critical, particularly in general 
management, research, new product development and in the sales forces. If Smith & Nephew is unable to retain key personnel in general management, research and 
new product development or if its largest sales forces suffer disruption or upheaval, its sales and operating profit would be adversely affected. Additionally, if the Group 
is unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive workforce, it may not be able to meet its strategic business objectives. 
Proprietary rights and patents 
Due to the technological nature of medical devices and the Group’s emphasis on serving its customers with innovative products, the Group has been subject to patent 
infringement claims and is subject to the potential for additional claims. 
Claims asserted by third parties regarding infringement of their intellectual property rights, if successful, could require the Group to expend time and significant resources 
to pay damages, develop non-infringing products or obtain licences to the products which are the subject of such litigation, thereby affecting the Group’s growth and 
profitability. Smith & Nephew attempts to protect its intellectual property and regularly opposes third party patents and trademarks where appropriate in those areas that 
might conflict with the Group’s business interests. If Smith & Nephew fails to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights successfully, its competitive position could 
suffer, which could harm its results of operations. 
Product liability claims and loss of reputation 
The development, manufacture and sale of medical devices entail risk of product liability claims or recalls. Design and manufacturing defects with respect to products 
sold by the Group or by companies it has acquired could damage, or impair the repair of, body functions. The Group may become subject to liability, which could be 
substantial, because of actual or alleged defects in its products. In addition, product defects could lead to the need to recall from the market existing products, which 
may be costly and harmful to the Group’s reputation. 
There can be no assurance that customers, particularly in the US, the Group’s largest geographical market, will not bring product liability or related claims that would have 
a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position or results of operations in the future, or that the Group will be able to resolve such claims within insurance limits.

Group information continued
Regulatory standards and compliance in the healthcare industry 
Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to regulation and review by various government authorities. In general, the trend in many countries in which the 
Group does business is towards higher expectations and increased enforcement activity by governmental authorities. While the Group is committed to doing business 
with integrity and welcomes the trend to higher standards in the healthcare industry, the Group and other companies in the industry have been subject to investigations 
and other enforcement activity that have incurred and may continue to incur significant expense. See ‘Legal proceedings’ on page 52. Under certain circumstances, if the 
Group were found to have violated the law, its ability to sell its products to certain customers could be restricted. 
Regulatory approval 
The international medical device industry is highly regulated. Regulatory requirements are a major factor in determining whether substances and materials can be 
developed into marketable products and the amount of time and expense that should be allotted to such development. 
National regulatory authorities administer and enforce a complex series of laws and regulations that govern the design, development, approval, manufacture, labelling, 
marketing and sale of healthcare products. They also review data supporting the safety and efficacy of such products. Of particular importance is the requirement in many 
countries that products be authorised or registered prior to manufacture, marketing or sale and that such authorisation or registration be subsequently maintained. The 
major regulatory agencies for Smith & Nephew’s products include the Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) in the US, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency in the UK, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan and the State Food and Drug Administration in China. At any time, the Group is awaiting a number 
of regulatory approvals which, if not received, could adversely affect results of operations. 
The trend is towards more stringent regulation and higher standards of technical appraisal. Such controls have become increasingly demanding to comply with and 
management believes that this trend will continue.  
Regulatory requirements may also entail inspections for compliance with appropriate standards, including those relating to Quality Management Systems or Good 
Manufacturing Practices regulations. All manufacturing and other significant facilities within the Group are subject to regular internal and external audit for compliance 
with national and Group medical device regulation and policies. 
Payment for medical devices may be governed by reimbursement tariff agencies in a number of countries. Reimbursement rates may be set in response to perceived 
economic value of the devices, based on clinical and other data relating to cost, patient outcomes and comparative effectiveness. They may also be affected by overall 
government budgetary considerations. The Group believes that its emphasis on innovative products and services should contribute to success in this environment. 
Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could have a number of adverse consequences, including withdrawal of approval to sell a product in a country, 
temporary closure of a manufacturing facility, fines and potential damage to company reputation. 
Failure to make successful acquisitions 
A key element of the Group’s strategy for continued growth is to make acquisitions or alliances to complement its existing business. Failure to identify appropriate 
acquisition targets or failure to conduct adequate due diligence or to integrate them successfully would have an adverse impact on the Group’s competitive position 
and profitability. This could result from the diversion of management resources towards the acquisition or integration process, challenges of integrating organisations 
of different geographic, cultural and ethical backgrounds, as well as the prospect of taking on unexpected or unknown liabilities. In addition, the availability of global capital 
may make financing less attainable or more expensive and could result in the Group failing in its strategic aim of growth by acquisition or alliance. 
Other risk factors 
Smith & Nephew is subject to a number of other risks, which are common to most global medical technology groups and are reviewed as part of the Group’s risk 
management process. 
  
 
 
Dividends 
Dividend history 
Smith & Nephew has paid dividends on its Ordinary Shares in every year since 1937. Following the capital restructuring and dividend reduction in 2000 the Group 
adopted a policy of increasing its dividend cover (the ratio of EPSA, as set out in the ‘Selected financial data’, to ordinary dividends declared for the year). This was 
intended to increase the financing capability of the Group for acquisitions and other investments. From 2000 to 2004 the dividend increased in line with inflation and, 
in 2004, dividend cover stood at 4.1 times. Having achieved this level of dividend cover the Board changed its policy, from that of increasing dividends in line with inflation, 
to that of increasing dividends for 2005 and after by 10%. Following the redenomination of the Company’s share capital into US Dollars the Board re-affirmed its policy 
of increasing the dividend by 10% a year in US Dollar terms. 
On 2 August 2012, the Board announced its intention to pursue a progressive dividend policy, with the aim of increasing the US Dollar value of Ordinary dividends over 
time broadly based on the Group’s underlying growth in earnings, while taking into account capital requirements and cash flows.  
From 2013, the Board will review at the time of the full year results, the appropriate level of total annual dividend each year. The Board intends that the interim dividend will 
be set by a formula and will be equivalent to 40% of the total dividend for the previous year. Dividends will continue to be declared in US Dollars with an equivalent amount 
in sterling payable to those shareholders whose registered address is in the UK, or who have validly elected to receive sterling dividends. 
An interim dividend in respect of each fiscal year is normally declared in August and paid in November. A final dividend will be recommended by the Board of Directors 
and paid subject to approval by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. 
Future dividends of Smith & Nephew will be dependent upon: future earnings; the future financial condition of the Group; the Board’s dividend policy; and the additional 
factors that might affect the business of the Group set out in ‘Special note regarding forward-looking statements’ and ‘Risk Factors’.

Group information continued
Regulatory standards and compliance in the healthcare industry 
Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to regulation and review by various government authorities. In general, the trend in many countries in which the 
Group does business is towards higher expectations and increased enforcement activity by governmental authorities. While the Group is committed to doing business 
with integrity and welcomes the trend to higher standards in the healthcare industry, the Group and other companies in the industry have been subject to investigations 
and other enforcement activity that have incurred and may continue to incur significant expense. See ‘Legal proceedings’ on page 52. Under certain circumstances, if the 
Group were found to have violated the law, its ability to sell its products to certain customers could be restricted. 
Regulatory approval 
The international medical device industry is highly regulated. Regulatory requirements are a major factor in determining whether substances and materials can be 
developed into marketable products and the amount of time and expense that should be allotted to such development. 
National regulatory authorities administer and enforce a complex series of laws and regulations that govern the design, development, approval, manufacture, labelling, 
marketing and sale of healthcare products. They also review data supporting the safety and efficacy of such products. Of particular importance is the requirement in many 
countries that products be authorised or registered prior to manufacture, marketing or sale and that such authorisation or registration be subsequently maintained. The 
major regulatory agencies for Smith & Nephew’s products include the Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) in the US, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency in the UK, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan and the State Food and Drug Administration in China. At any time, the Group is awaiting a number 
of regulatory approvals which, if not received, could adversely affect results of operations. 
The trend is towards more stringent regulation and higher standards of technical appraisal. Such controls have become increasingly demanding to comply with and 
management believes that this trend will continue.  
Regulatory requirements may also entail inspections for compliance with appropriate standards, including those relating to Quality Management Systems or Good 
Manufacturing Practices regulations. All manufacturing and other significant facilities within the Group are subject to regular internal and external audit for compliance 
with national and Group medical device regulation and policies. 
Payment for medical devices may be governed by reimbursement tariff agencies in a number of countries. Reimbursement rates may be set in response to perceived 
economic value of the devices, based on clinical and other data relating to cost, patient outcomes and comparative effectiveness. They may also be affected by overall 
government budgetary considerations. The Group believes that its emphasis on innovative products and services should contribute to success in this environment. 
Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could have a number of adverse consequences, including withdrawal of approval to sell a product in a country, 
temporary closure of a manufacturing facility, fines and potential damage to company reputation. 
Failure to make successful acquisitions 
A key element of the Group’s strategy for continued growth is to make acquisitions or alliances to complement its existing business. Failure to identify appropriate 
acquisition targets or failure to conduct adequate due diligence or to integrate them successfully would have an adverse impact on the Group’s competitive position 
and profitability. This could result from the diversion of management resources towards the acquisition or integration process, challenges of integrating organisations 
of different geographic, cultural and ethical backgrounds, as well as the prospect of taking on unexpected or unknown liabilities. In addition, the availability of global capital 
may make financing less attainable or more expensive and could result in the Group failing in its strategic aim of growth by acquisition or alliance. 
Other risk factors 
Smith & Nephew is subject to a number of other risks, which are common to most global medical technology groups and are reviewed as part of the Group’s risk 
management process. 
  
 
 
Dividends 
Dividend history 
Smith & Nephew has paid dividends on its Ordinary Shares in every year since 1937. Following the capital restructuring and dividend reduction in 2000 the Group 
adopted a policy of increasing its dividend cover (the ratio of EPSA, as set out in the ‘Selected financial data’, to ordinary dividends declared for the year). This was 
intended to increase the financing capability of the Group for acquisitions and other investments. From 2000 to 2004 the dividend increased in line with inflation and, 
in 2004, dividend cover stood at 4.1 times. Having achieved this level of dividend cover the Board changed its policy, from that of increasing dividends in line with inflation, 
to that of increasing dividends for 2005 and after by 10%. Following the redenomination of the Company’s share capital into US Dollars the Board re-affirmed its policy 
of increasing the dividend by 10% a year in US Dollar terms. 
On 2 August 2012, the Board announced its intention to pursue a progressive dividend policy, with the aim of increasing the US Dollar value of Ordinary dividends over 
time broadly based on the Group’s underlying growth in earnings, while taking into account capital requirements and cash flows.  
From 2013, the Board will review at the time of the full year results, the appropriate level of total annual dividend each year. The Board intends that the interim dividend will 
be set by a formula and will be equivalent to 40% of the total dividend for the previous year. Dividends will continue to be declared in US Dollars with an equivalent amount 
in sterling payable to those shareholders whose registered address is in the UK, or who have validly elected to receive sterling dividends. 
An interim dividend in respect of each fiscal year is normally declared in August and paid in November. A final dividend will be recommended by the Board of Directors 
and paid subject to approval by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. 
Future dividends of Smith & Nephew will be dependent upon: future earnings; the future financial condition of the Group; the Board’s dividend policy; and the additional 
factors that might affect the business of the Group set out in ‘Special note regarding forward-looking statements’ and ‘Risk Factors’.

Share capital 
The principal trading market for the Ordinary Shares is the London Stock 
Exchange. The Ordinary Shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 
16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs. Each ADS 
represents five Ordinary Shares. The ADS facility is sponsored by The Bank of 
New York Mellon acting as depositary. 
All the Ordinary Shares, including those held by Directors and Executive Officers, 
rank pari passu with each other. On 23 January 2006 the Ordinary Shares of 
12 2/9 pence were redenominated as Ordinary Shares of US 20 cents (following 
approval by shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting in December 
2005). The new US Dollar Ordinary Shares carry the same rights as the previous 
Ordinary Shares. The share price continues to be quoted in sterling and the ADSs 
continue to represent five Ordinary Shares. In 2006 the Company issued £50,000 
of shares in sterling in order to comply with English law. These were issued as 
Deferred Shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange. They have 
extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value. These shares 
were allotted to the Chief Executive Officer, although the Board reserves the right 
to transfer them to another member of the Board should it so wish. 
As at 19 February 2013, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 19,122 
registered holders of Ordinary Shares, of whom 86 had registered addresses in 
the US and held a total of 183,774 Ordinary Shares (less than 0.2% of the total 
issued). Because certain Ordinary Shares are registered in the names of 
nominees, the number of shareholders with registered addresses in the US is not 
representative of the number of beneficial owners of Ordinary Shares resident in 
the US. 
Shareholdings 
As at 19 February 2013, 6,478,972 ADSs equivalent to 32,394,860 Ordinary 
Shares or approximately  3.6% of the total Ordinary Shares in issue, were 
outstanding and were held by 84 registered holders. 
Major shareholders 
As far as is known to Smith & Nephew, the Group is not directly or indirectly 
owned or controlled by another corporation or by any government and the Group 
has not entered into arrangements, the operation of which may at a subsequent 
date result in a change in control of the Group. 
As at 19 February 2013, no persons are known to Smith & Nephew to have any 
interest (as defined in the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FSA) in 3% or 
more of the Ordinary Shares, other than as shown below. The following tables

Shares, as notified to the Company under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules:

Share capital continued 
Purchase of Ordinary Shares 
on behalf of the Company 
The share buy-back programme was suspended in November 2008, in light of 
conditions in the financial markets. The programme is kept under review. The 
Company will seek a renewal of its permission from shareholders to purchase up 
to 10% of its own shares at the AGM on 11 April 2013. As at 31 December 2012, 
68,240,200 (2011 – 68,240,200) Ordinary Shares had been purchased under the 
share buy-back programme that commenced in February 2007. No shares were 
purchased in the years between 2009 to 2012. 
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting 
security holders 
There are no UK governmental laws, decrees or regulations that restrict the 
export or import of capital or that affect the payment of dividends, interest or 
other payments to non-resident holders of Smith & Nephew’s securities, except 
for certain restrictions imposed from time to time by Her Majesty’s Treasury of 
the United Kingdom pursuant to legislation, such as the United Nations Act 1946 
and the Emergency Laws Act 1964, against the government or residents of 
certain countries. 
There are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the articles of 
association of Smith & Nephew, restricting the right of non-UK residents to hold 
or to exercise voting rights in respect of Ordinary Shares, except that where any 
overseas shareholder has not provided to the Company a UK address for the 
service of notices, the Company is under no obligation to send any notice or other 
document to an overseas address. It is, however, the current practice of the 
Company to send every notice or other document to all shareholders regardless 
of the country recorded in the register of members, with the exception of details 
of the Company’s dividend re-investment plan, which are not sent to shareholders 
with recorded addresses in the US and Canada.
The comments below are of a general and summary nature and are based on the 
Group’s understanding of certain aspects of current UK and US federal income tax 
law and practice relevant to the ADSs and Ordinary Shares not in ADS form. The 
comments address the material US and UK tax consequences generally 
applicable to a person who is the beneficial owner of ADSs or Ordinary Shares 
and who, for US federal income tax purposes, is a citizen or resident of the United 
States, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organised 
in or under the laws of the United States, or an estate or trust the income of which 
is included in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its 
source (each a ‘US Holder’). The comments set out below do not purport to 
address all tax consequences of the ownership of ADSs or Ordinary Shares which 
may be material to a particular holder and in particular do not deal with the position 
of shareholders who directly or indirectly own 10% or more of the Company’s 
issued Ordinary Shares. This discussion does not apply to (i) persons whose 
holding of ADSs or Ordinary Shares is effectively connected with or pertains to 
either a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom through which a US 
Holder carries on a business in the United Kingdom or a fixed base from which 
a US Holder performs independent personal services in the United Kingdom, or 
(ii) persons whose registered address is inside the UK. This discussion does not 
apply to certain investors subject to special rules, such as certain financial 
institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in 
securities that elect to mark to market, partnerships or other entities treated as 
partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, US Holders holding ADSs or 
Ordinary Shares as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction or 
whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is other than the US 
Dollar and US Holders liable for alternative minimum tax. In addition, the 
comments below do not address US state, local or non-US (other than UK) taxes. 
The summary deals only with US Holders who hold ADSs or Ordinary Shares as 
capital assets. The summary is based on current UK and US law and practice 
which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. US Holders are 
recommended to consult their own tax advisers as to the particular tax 
consequences to them of the ownership of ADSs or Ordinary Shares. 
The Company believes, and this discussion assumes, that the Company 
was not a passive foreign investment company for its taxable year ended 
31 December 2012. 
This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary and 
assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related 
agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. For purposes of US 
federal income tax law, US Holders of ADSs will generally be treated as owners 
of the Ordinary Shares represented by the ADSs. However, the US Treasury has 
expressed concerns that parties to whom depositary shares are released before 
shares are delivered to the depositary (‘pre-released’) may be taking actions that 
are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by owners of depositary 
shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced 
rate of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-
corporate US Holders. Accordingly, the availability of the reduced tax rate for 
dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders of ADSs could be 
affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADSs are pre-released. 
Taxation information for shareholders 
 
Taxation of dividends in the United Kingdom 
and the United States 
The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK 
corporation, such as the Company. 
Distributions paid by the Company will be treated for US federal income tax 
purposes as foreign source ordinary dividend income to a US Holder to the extent 
paid out of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits as 
determined for US federal income tax purposes. Such dividends will not be eligible 
for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate US Holders. 
Dividends paid to certain non-corporate US Holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs 
may be subject to US federal income tax at lower rates than other types of ordinary 
income if certain conditions are met. Non-corporate US Holders should consult 
their own tax advisers to determine whether they are subject to any special rules 
that limit their ability to be taxed at these favourable rates. 
Taxation of capital gains 
US Holders, who are not resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the UK, 
will not generally be liable for UK capital gains tax on any capital gain realised upon 
the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares unless the ADSs or 
Ordinary Shares are held in connection with a trade carried on in the UK through 
a permanent establishment (or in the case of individuals, through a branch 
or agency). Furthermore, UK resident individuals who acquire ADSs or Ordinary 
Shares before becoming temporarily non-UK residents may remain subject 
to UK taxation of capital gains on gains realised while non-resident. 
For US federal income tax purposes, gains or losses realised upon a taxable sale 
or other disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares by US Holders generally will be US 
source capital gains or losses and will be long-term capital gains or losses if the 
ADSs or Ordinary Shares were held for more than one year. The amount of a US 
Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount realised 
on the sale or other disposition and such holder’s tax basis in the ADSs, or 
Ordinary Shares, determined in US Dollars. 
Inheritance and estate taxes 
The HM Revenue & Customs imposes inheritance tax on capital transfers which 
occur on death, and in the seven years preceding death. The HM Revenue & 
Customs considers that the US/UK Double Taxation Convention on Estate and Gift 
Tax applies to inheritance tax. Consequently, a US citizen who is domiciled in the 
United States and is not a UK national or domiciled in the United Kingdom will not 
be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares. A UK 
national who is domiciled in the United States will be subject to both UK 
inheritance tax and US federal estate tax but will be entitled to a credit for US 
federal estate tax charged in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares in computing 
the liability to UK inheritance tax. Conversely, a US citizen who is domiciled or 
deemed domiciled in the United Kingdom will be entitled to a credit for UK 
inheritance tax charged in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares in computing the 
liability for US federal estate tax. Special rules apply where ADSs and Ordinary 
Shares are business property of a permanent establishment of an enterprise 
situated in the United Kingdom. 
US information reporting and backup withholding 
A US Holder may be subject to US information reporting and backup withholding 
on dividends paid on or the proceeds of sales of ADSs or Ordinary Shares made 
within the US or through certain US-related financial intermediaries, unless the US 
Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, provides a 
correct US taxpayer identification number and certain other conditions are met. 
US backup withholding may apply if there has been a notification from the US 
Internal Revenue Service of a failure to report all interest or dividends. 
Any backup withholding deducted may be credited against the US Holder’s US 
federal income tax liability, and, where the backup withholding exceeds the actual 
liability, the US Holder may obtain a refund by timely filing the appropriate refund 
claim with the US Internal Revenue Service. 
Certain US Holders who are individuals (and under proposed Treasury regulations, 
certain entities) may be required to report information relating to securities issued 
by a non-US person (or foreign accounts through which the securities are held), 
subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for securities held in 
accounts maintained by US financial institutions). US Holders should consult their 
tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to the Ordinary 
Shares or ADSs. 
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax 
UK stamp duty is charged on documents and in particular instruments for the 
transfer of registered ownership of Ordinary Shares. Transfers of Ordinary 
Shares in certificated form will generally be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate 
of ½% of the consideration given for the transfer with the duty rounded up to the 
nearest £5. 
UK stamp duty reserve tax (‘SDRT’) arises when there is an agreement to transfer 
shares in UK companies ‘for consideration in money or money’s worth’, and so an 
agreement to transfer Ordinary Shares for money or other consideration may give 
rise to a charge to SDRT at the rate of ½% (rounded up to the nearest penny). 
The charge of SDRT will be cancelled, and any SDRT already paid will be refunded, 
if within six years of the agreement an instrument of transfer is produced 
to HM Revenue & Customs and the appropriate stamp duty paid. 
Transfers of Ordinary Shares into CREST (an electronic transfer system) are exempt 
from stamp duty so long as the transferee is a member of CREST who will hold the 
Ordinary Shares as a nominee for the transferor and the transfer is in a form that 
will ensure that the securities become held in uncertificated form within CREST. 
Paperless transfers of Ordinary Shares within CREST for consideration in money or 
money’s worth are liable to SDRT rather than stamp duty. SDRT on relevant 
transactions will be collected by CREST at ½%, and this will apply whether or not 
the transfer is affected in the United Kingdom and whether or not the parties to it 
are resident or situated in the United Kingdom. 
United Kingdom 
A charge of stamp duty or SDRT at the rates of 1½% of the consideration (or, 
in some circumstances, the value of the shares concerned) will arise on a transfer 
or issue of Ordinary Shares to the Depositary or to certain persons providing a 
clearance service (or their nominees or agents) for the conversion into ADRs and 
will generally be payable by the Depositary or person providing clearance service. 
In accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, any tax or duty payable 
by the Depositary on deposits of Ordinary Shares will be charged by the 
Depositary to the party to whom ADRs are delivered against such deposits. 
No liability for stamp duty or SDRT will arise on any transfer of, or agreement to 
transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS, provided that the ADS and 
any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remains at all times 
outside the United Kingdom, and provided further that any instrument of transfer 
or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the United Kingdom and the 
transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the United 
Kingdom (the location of the custodian as a holder of Ordinary Shares not being 
relevant in this context). In any other case, any transfer of, or agreement to 
transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS could, depending on all the 
circumstances of the transfer, give rise to a charge to stamp duty or SDRT.

Share capital continued 
Purchase of Ordinary Shares 
on behalf of the Company 
The share buy-back programme was suspended in November 2008, in light of 
conditions in the financial markets. The programme is kept under review. The 
Company will seek a renewal of its permission from shareholders to purchase up 
to 10% of its own shares at the AGM on 11 April 2013. As at 31 December 2012, 
68,240,200 (2011 – 68,240,200) Ordinary Shares had been purchased under the 
share buy-back programme that commenced in February 2007. No shares were 
purchased in the years between 2009 to 2012. 
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting 
security holders 
There are no UK governmental laws, decrees or regulations that restrict the 
export or import of capital or that affect the payment of dividends, interest or 
other payments to non-resident holders of Smith & Nephew’s securities, except 
for certain restrictions imposed from time to time by Her Majesty’s Treasury of 
the United Kingdom pursuant to legislation, such as the United Nations Act 1946 
and the Emergency Laws Act 1964, against the government or residents of 
certain countries. 
There are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the articles of 
association of Smith & Nephew, restricting the right of non-UK residents to hold 
or to exercise voting rights in respect of Ordinary Shares, except that where any 
overseas shareholder has not provided to the Company a UK address for the 
service of notices, the Company is under no obligation to send any notice or other 
document to an overseas address. It is, however, the current practice of the 
Company to send every notice or other document to all shareholders regardless 
of the country recorded in the register of members, with the exception of details 
of the Company’s dividend re-investment plan, which are not sent to shareholders 
with recorded addresses in the US and Canada.
The comments below are of a general and summary nature and are based on the 
Group’s understanding of certain aspects of current UK and US federal income tax 
law and practice relevant to the ADSs and Ordinary Shares not in ADS form. The 
comments address the material US and UK tax consequences generally 
applicable to a person who is the beneficial owner of ADSs or Ordinary Shares 
and who, for US federal income tax purposes, is a citizen or resident of the United 
States, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organised 
in or under the laws of the United States, or an estate or trust the income of which 
is included in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its 
source (each a ‘US Holder’). The comments set out below do not purport to 
address all tax consequences of the ownership of ADSs or Ordinary Shares which 
may be material to a particular holder and in particular do not deal with the position 
of shareholders who directly or indirectly own 10% or more of the Company’s 
issued Ordinary Shares. This discussion does not apply to (i) persons whose 
holding of ADSs or Ordinary Shares is effectively connected with or pertains to 
either a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom through which a US 
Holder carries on a business in the United Kingdom or a fixed base from which 
a US Holder performs independent personal services in the United Kingdom, or 
(ii) persons whose registered address is inside the UK. This discussion does not 
apply to certain investors subject to special rules, such as certain financial 
institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in 
securities that elect to mark to market, partnerships or other entities treated as 
partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, US Holders holding ADSs or 
Ordinary Shares as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction or 
whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is other than the US 
Dollar and US Holders liable for alternative minimum tax. In addition, the 
comments below do not address US state, local or non-US (other than UK) taxes. 
The summary deals only with US Holders who hold ADSs or Ordinary Shares as 
capital assets. The summary is based on current UK and US law and practice 
which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. US Holders are 
recommended to consult their own tax advisers as to the particular tax 
consequences to them of the ownership of ADSs or Ordinary Shares. 
The Company believes, and this discussion assumes, that the Company 
was not a passive foreign investment company for its taxable year ended 
31 December 2012. 
This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary and 
assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related 
agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. For purposes of US 
federal income tax law, US Holders of ADSs will generally be treated as owners 
of the Ordinary Shares represented by the ADSs. However, the US Treasury has 
expressed concerns that parties to whom depositary shares are released before 
shares are delivered to the depositary (‘pre-released’) may be taking actions that 
are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by owners of depositary 
shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced 
rate of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-
corporate US Holders. Accordingly, the availability of the reduced tax rate for 
dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders of ADSs could be 
affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADSs are pre-released. 
Taxation information for shareholders 
 
Taxation of dividends in the United Kingdom 
and the United States 
The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK 
corporation, such as the Company. 
Distributions paid by the Company will be treated for US federal income tax 
purposes as foreign source ordinary dividend income to a US Holder to the extent 
paid out of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits as 
determined for US federal income tax purposes. Such dividends will not be eligible 
for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate US Holders. 
Dividends paid to certain non-corporate US Holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs 
may be subject to US federal income tax at lower rates than other types of ordinary 
income if certain conditions are met. Non-corporate US Holders should consult 
their own tax advisers to determine whether they are subject to any special rules 
that limit their ability to be taxed at these favourable rates. 
Taxation of capital gains 
US Holders, who are not resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the UK, 
will not generally be liable for UK capital gains tax on any capital gain realised upon 
the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares unless the ADSs or 
Ordinary Shares are held in connection with a trade carried on in the UK through 
a permanent establishment (or in the case of individuals, through a branch 
or agency). Furthermore, UK resident individuals who acquire ADSs or Ordinary 
Shares before becoming temporarily non-UK residents may remain subject 
to UK taxation of capital gains on gains realised while non-resident. 
For US federal income tax purposes, gains or losses realised upon a taxable sale 
or other disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares by US Holders generally will be US 
source capital gains or losses and will be long-term capital gains or losses if the 
ADSs or Ordinary Shares were held for more than one year. The amount of a US 
Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount realised 
on the sale or other disposition and such holder’s tax basis in the ADSs, or 
Ordinary Shares, determined in US Dollars. 
Inheritance and estate taxes 
The HM Revenue & Customs imposes inheritance tax on capital transfers which 
occur on death, and in the seven years preceding death. The HM Revenue & 
Customs considers that the US/UK Double Taxation Convention on Estate and Gift 
Tax applies to inheritance tax. Consequently, a US citizen who is domiciled in the 
United States and is not a UK national or domiciled in the United Kingdom will not 
be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares. A UK 
national who is domiciled in the United States will be subject to both UK 
inheritance tax and US federal estate tax but will be entitled to a credit for US 
federal estate tax charged in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares in computing 
the liability to UK inheritance tax. Conversely, a US citizen who is domiciled or 
deemed domiciled in the United Kingdom will be entitled to a credit for UK 
inheritance tax charged in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares in computing the 
liability for US federal estate tax. Special rules apply where ADSs and Ordinary 
Shares are business property of a permanent establishment of an enterprise 
situated in the United Kingdom. 
US information reporting and backup withholding 
A US Holder may be subject to US information reporting and backup withholding 
on dividends paid on or the proceeds of sales of ADSs or Ordinary Shares made 
within the US or through certain US-related financial intermediaries, unless the US 
Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, provides a 
correct US taxpayer identification number and certain other conditions are met. 
US backup withholding may apply if there has been a notification from the US 
Internal Revenue Service of a failure to report all interest or dividends. 
Any backup withholding deducted may be credited against the US Holder’s US 
federal income tax liability, and, where the backup withholding exceeds the actual 
liability, the US Holder may obtain a refund by timely filing the appropriate refund 
claim with the US Internal Revenue Service. 
Certain US Holders who are individuals (and under proposed Treasury regulations, 
certain entities) may be required to report information relating to securities issued 
by a non-US person (or foreign accounts through which the securities are held), 
subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for securities held in 
accounts maintained by US financial institutions). US Holders should consult their 
tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to the Ordinary 
Shares or ADSs. 
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax 
UK stamp duty is charged on documents and in particular instruments for the 
transfer of registered ownership of Ordinary Shares. Transfers of Ordinary 
Shares in certificated form will generally be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate 
of ½% of the consideration given for the transfer with the duty rounded up to the 
nearest £5. 
UK stamp duty reserve tax (‘SDRT’) arises when there is an agreement to transfer 
shares in UK companies ‘for consideration in money or money’s worth’, and so an 
agreement to transfer Ordinary Shares for money or other consideration may give 
rise to a charge to SDRT at the rate of ½% (rounded up to the nearest penny). 
The charge of SDRT will be cancelled, and any SDRT already paid will be refunded, 
if within six years of the agreement an instrument of transfer is produced 
to HM Revenue & Customs and the appropriate stamp duty paid. 
Transfers of Ordinary Shares into CREST (an electronic transfer system) are exempt 
from stamp duty so long as the transferee is a member of CREST who will hold the 
Ordinary Shares as a nominee for the transferor and the transfer is in a form that 
will ensure that the securities become held in uncertificated form within CREST. 
Paperless transfers of Ordinary Shares within CREST for consideration in money or 
money’s worth are liable to SDRT rather than stamp duty. SDRT on relevant 
transactions will be collected by CREST at ½%, and this will apply whether or not 
the transfer is affected in the United Kingdom and whether or not the parties to it 
are resident or situated in the United Kingdom. 
United Kingdom 
A charge of stamp duty or SDRT at the rates of 1½% of the consideration (or, 
in some circumstances, the value of the shares concerned) will arise on a transfer 
or issue of Ordinary Shares to the Depositary or to certain persons providing a 
clearance service (or their nominees or agents) for the conversion into ADRs and 
will generally be payable by the Depositary or person providing clearance service. 
In accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, any tax or duty payable 
by the Depositary on deposits of Ordinary Shares will be charged by the 
Depositary to the party to whom ADRs are delivered against such deposits. 
No liability for stamp duty or SDRT will arise on any transfer of, or agreement to 
transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS, provided that the ADS and 
any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remains at all times 
outside the United Kingdom, and provided further that any instrument of transfer 
or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the United Kingdom and the 
transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the United 
Kingdom (the location of the custodian as a holder of Ordinary Shares not being 
relevant in this context). In any other case, any transfer of, or agreement to 
transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS could, depending on all the 
circumstances of the transfer, give rise to a charge to stamp duty or SDRT.

Articles of association  
The following summarises certain material rights of holders of the Company’s 
Ordinary Shares under the material provisions of the Company’s articles of 
association and English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference 
to the Companies Act and the Company’s articles of association. In the following 
description, a ‘shareholder’ is the person registered in the Company’s register 
of members as the holder of an Ordinary Share. 
The Company is incorporated under the name Smith & Nephew plc and is 
registered in England and Wales with registered number 324357. 
The Company’s Ordinary Shares may be held in certificated or uncertificated 
form. No holder of the Company’s shares will be required to make additional 
contributions of capital in respect of the Company’s shares in the future. 
In accordance with English law the Company’s Ordinary Shares rank equally. 
Directors 
Under the Company’s articles of association, a Director may not vote in respect 
of any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal in which he, or any person 
connected with him, has any material interest other than by virtue of his interests 
in securities of, or otherwise in or through, the Company. This is subject to certain 
exceptions relating to proposals (a) indemnifying him in respect of obligations 
incurred on behalf of the Company, (b) indemnifying a third party in respect of 
obligations of the Company for which the Director has assumed responsibility 
under an indemnity or guarantee, (c) relating to an offer of securities in which he 
will be interested as an underwriter, (d) concerning another body corporate in 
which the Director is beneficially interested in less than 1% of the issued shares 
of any class of shares of such a body corporate, (e) relating to an employee benefit 
in which the Director will share equally with other employees and (f) relating to any 
insurance that the Company is empowered to purchase for the benefit of Directors 
of the Company in respect of actions undertaken as Directors (and/or officers) 
of the Company. 
A Director shall not vote or be counted in any quorum present at a meeting 
in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote. 
The Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Company to 
borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all monies 
borrowed after deducting cash and current asset investments by the Company 
and its subsidiaries shall not exceed the sum of $6,500,000,000. 
Any Director who has been appointed by the Directors since the previous Annual 
General Meeting of shareholders, either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional 
Director holds office only until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting 
and then shall be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. The other Directors 
retire and are eligible for re-appointment at the third Annual General Meeting 
after the meeting at which they were last re-appointed. If not re-appointed a 
Director retiring at a meeting shall retain office until the meeting appoints 
someone in his place, or if it does not do so, until the conclusion of the meeting. 
The Directors are subject to removal with or without cause by the Board or the 
shareholders. Directors are not required to hold any shares of the Company by 
way of qualification. 
Under the Company’s articles of association and English law, a Director may be 
indemnified out of the assets of the Company against liabilities he may sustain or 
incur in the execution of his duties. 
Rights attaching to Ordinary Shares 
Under English law, dividends are payable on the Company’s Ordinary Shares 
only out of profits available for distribution, as determined in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and by the 
Companies Act 2006. Holders of the Company’s Ordinary Shares are entitled to 
receive final dividends as may be declared by the Directors and approved by the 
shareholders in general meeting, rateable according to the amounts paid up on 
such shares, provided that the dividend cannot exceed the amount 
recommended by the Directors. 
The Company’s Board of Directors may declare such interim dividends as appear 
to them to be justified by the Company’s financial position. If authorised by an 
ordinary resolution of the shareholders, the Board may also direct payment of a 
dividend in whole or in part by the distribution of specific assets (and in particular 
of paid up shares or debentures of the Company). 
Any dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was declared, 
or became due for payment, will be forfeited and will revert to the Company. 
There were no material modifications to the rights of shareholders under the 
Articles during 2012. 
Voting rights of Ordinary Shares 
Voting at any general meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll, 
which is a written vote, is duly demanded and held. On a show of hands, every 
shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting has one vote 
regardless of the number of shares held. On a poll, every shareholder who is 
present in person or by proxy has one vote for each Ordinary Share held by that 
shareholder. A poll may be demanded by any of the following: 
– the chairman of the meeting; 
– at least five shareholders present or by proxy entitled to vote on the resolution; 
– any shareholder or shareholders representing in the aggregate not less than 
one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the 
resolution; or 
– any shareholder or shareholders holding shares conferring a right to vote on 
the resolution on which there have been paid-up sums in aggregate equal to 
not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring 
that right. 
A form of proxy will be treated as giving the proxy the authority to demand a poll, 
or to join others in demanding one, as above. 
The necessary quorum for a general meeting is two shareholders present in 
person or by proxy carrying the right to vote upon the business to be transacted. 
Matters are transacted at general meetings of the Company by the 
processing and passing of resolutions of which there are two kinds; ordinary 
or special resolutions: 
– Ordinary resolutions include resolutions for the re-election of Directors, the 
approval of financial statements, the declaration of dividends (other than interim 
dividends), the appointment and re-appointment of auditors or the grant of 
authority to allot shares. An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote 
of a majority of the votes of those persons voting at the meetings at which there 
is a quorum. 
– Special resolutions include resolutions amending the Company’s articles 
of association, dis-applying statutory pre-emption rights or changing the 
Company’s name; modifying the rights of any class of the Company’s shares at 
a meeting of the holders of such class or relating to certain matters concerning 
the Company’s winding up. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of 
not less than three-quarters of the votes of the persons voting at the meeting at 
which there is a quorum. 
Annual General Meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of 
21 days. Other general meetings must be convened upon advance written notice 
of at least 14 clear days. The days of delivery or receipt of notice are not included. 
The notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted. Meetings 
are convened by the Board of Directors. Members with 5% of the Ordinary Share 
capital of the Company may requisition the Board to convene a meeting. 
  
 
 
Variation of rights 
If, at any time, the Company’s share capital is divided into different classes of 
shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions 
of the Companies Act, with the consent in writing of holders of three-quarters in 
nominal value of the issued shares of that class or upon the adoption of a special 
resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. 
At every such separate meeting, all the provisions of the articles of association 
relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum is to 
be the number of persons (which must be two or more) who hold or represent by 
proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class 
and at any such meeting a poll may be demanded in writing by any person or 
their proxy who hold shares of that class. Where a person is present by proxy 
or proxies, he is treated as holding only the shares in respect of which the proxies 
are authorised to exercise voting rights. 
Rights in a winding-up 
Except as the Company’s shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, 
upon the Company’s winding up, the balance of assets available for distribution: 
– after the payment of all creditors including certain preferential creditors, whether 
statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors; and 
– subject to any special rights attaching to any other class of shares; 
is to be distributed among the holders of Ordinary Shares according to the 
amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution is generally to be 
made in US Dollars. A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of any 
extraordinary resolution of the shareholders and any other sanction required by 
law, divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the Company’s 
assets in kind. 
Limitations on voting and shareholding 
There are no limitations imposed by English law or the Company’s articles of 
association on the right of non-residents or foreign persons to hold or vote the 
Company’s Ordinary Shares or ADSs, other than the limitations that would 
generally apply to all of the Company’s shareholders. 
Transfers of shares 
The Board may refuse to register the transfer of shares held in certificated 
form which: 
– are not fully paid (provided that it shall not exercise this discretion in such a way 
as to prevent stock market dealings in the shares of that class from taking place 
on an open and proper basis); 
– are not duly stamped or duly certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of 
the Board to be exempt from stamp duty, lodged at the Transfer Office or at 
such other place as the Board may appoint and (save in the case of a transfer 
by a person to whom no certificate was issued in respect of the shares in 
question) accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates, and 
such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of 
the transferor to make the transfer and, if the instrument of transfer is executed 
by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person so to do; 
– are in respect of more than one class of shares; or 
– are in favour of more than four transferees. 
Deferred shares 
Following the redenomination of share capital on 23 January 2006 the Ordinary 
Shares’ nominal value became 20 US cents each. There were no changes to the 
rights or obligations of the Ordinary Shares. In order to comply with the Companies 
Act 2006, a new class of sterling shares was created, Deferred Shares, of which 
£50,000 were issued and allotted in 2006 as fully paid to the Chief Executive 
Officer though the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member 
of the Board should it so wish. These Deferred Shares have no voting or dividend 
rights and on winding up only are entitled to repayment at nominal value only if 
all Ordinary shareholders have received the nominal value of their shares plus an 
additional $1,000 each. 
Amendments 
The Company does not have any special rules about amendments to its articles 
of association beyond those imposed by law.

Articles of association  
The following summarises certain material rights of holders of the Company’s 
Ordinary Shares under the material provisions of the Company’s articles of 
association and English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference 
to the Companies Act and the Company’s articles of association. In the following 
description, a ‘shareholder’ is the person registered in the Company’s register 
of members as the holder of an Ordinary Share. 
The Company is incorporated under the name Smith & Nephew plc and is 
registered in England and Wales with registered number 324357. 
The Company’s Ordinary Shares may be held in certificated or uncertificated 
form. No holder of the Company’s shares will be required to make additional 
contributions of capital in respect of the Company’s shares in the future. 
In accordance with English law the Company’s Ordinary Shares rank equally. 
Directors 
Under the Company’s articles of association, a Director may not vote in respect 
of any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal in which he, or any person 
connected with him, has any material interest other than by virtue of his interests 
in securities of, or otherwise in or through, the Company. This is subject to certain 
exceptions relating to proposals (a) indemnifying him in respect of obligations 
incurred on behalf of the Company, (b) indemnifying a third party in respect of 
obligations of the Company for which the Director has assumed responsibility 
under an indemnity or guarantee, (c) relating to an offer of securities in which he 
will be interested as an underwriter, (d) concerning another body corporate in 
which the Director is beneficially interested in less than 1% of the issued shares 
of any class of shares of such a body corporate, (e) relating to an employee benefit 
in which the Director will share equally with other employees and (f) relating to any 
insurance that the Company is empowered to purchase for the benefit of Directors 
of the Company in respect of actions undertaken as Directors (and/or officers) 
of the Company. 
A Director shall not vote or be counted in any quorum present at a meeting 
in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote.

borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all monies 
borrowed after deducting cash and current asset investments by the Company 
and its subsidiaries shall not exceed the sum of $6,500,000,000. 
Any Director who has been appointed by the Directors since the previous Annual 
General Meeting of shareholders, either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional 
Director holds office only until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting 
and then shall be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. The other Directors 
retire and are eligible for re-appointment at the third Annual General Meeting 
after the meeting at which they were last re-appointed. If not re-appointed a 
Director retiring at a meeting shall retain office until the meeting appoints 
someone in his place, or if it does not do so, until the conclusion of the meeting.

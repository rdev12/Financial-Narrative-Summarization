C HA I R M AN ’ S  S T A TE M E NT
Animalcare has performed well during 
the financial year, particularly during 
the second half, with growth from 
all three product groups: Licensed 
Veterinary Medicines, Companion Animal 
Identification, and Animal Welfare 
Products. The core medicines group 
achieved increased sales of c8.0% during 
the year.
Financial Trading
Group revenue increased by 8.6% 
from £13.5m to £14.7m. This was 
achieved principally by increasing 
sales of Licensed Veterinary Medicines 
both in the UK and Export markets by 
over £650,000 combined. Incremental 
revenue of approximately £300,000 was 
also recognised from the introduction 
of compulsory microchipping in dogs 
during April which benefited the second 
half performance. Basic EPS increased 
from 12.1p to 12.5p. Cash generation 
has remained strong, with year end 
cash increasing from £5.8m to £7.1m. 
This has been achieved during a period 
of significant investment in product 
development to £1.6m together with 
recruiting more colleagues in all areas of 
the business to help drive future growth. 
P e o pl e
These good results are testament to the 
strength of our Senior Management Team 
which continues to flourish under the able 
leadership of our CEO Iain Menneer. We 
have further strengthened our product 
development, marketing, sales and 
distribution teams in order to continue to 
grow your business in the future.
P r od u c tDe v e lo pm e n t
Our European partners have more than 
filled the gap we had in our development 
pipeline during this financial year. This 
allowed your Company to increase sales 
of its generic drugs whilst we continued 
to progress our own development 
programme. The first products from our 
renewed development pipeline have been 
licensed and launched in the year and we 
expect further launches over the following 
two years.
Dividend
Given the strong cash generation during 
the financial year your Board proposes to 
increase the final dividend to 4.7 pence per 
share. With 1.8 pence paid as the interim 
dividend this takes the total for the year to 
6.5 pence per share representing growth of 
c7%. from 6.1 pence last year. This is well 
covered by both increased earnings and 
cash flow and still leaves sufficient cash to 
invest in our future.
P ros pec t s
Given the pipeline from both our in-house 
product development and that of our 
European partners, plus a much improved 
export business, your Board looks forward 
to continuing your Company’s record of 
consistent growth. This is being delivered 
by a stronger, more capable management 
team and committed and hard-working 
colleagues. I would like to personally thank 
them all for their dedication and hard work 
to the success of your business.

strong business and 
invest in product

JAMES LAMBERT Chairman
02 Animalcare Group plc is a sales and marketing  
and product development company.
The UK pet medicines market has grown 
consistently over the last ten years at a 
Compound Annual Growth Rate of 5.2% 
demonstrating remarkable resilience in the 
challenging economic climate of the last  
eight years.
It is a highly regulated and specialist  
market with significant intellectual and 
financial barriers to entry. In addition, 
consolidation of pharmaceutical suppliers 
has made our significant and skilled  
sales and marketing function a rare and 
valuable asset.
As a result we believe there are four 
compelling reasons to invest in Animalcare 
Group plc:
 y Animalcare is a sustainable growing 
business (revenue +6.8% CAGR) in a 
growing market (+5.2% CAGR over ten 
years)
 y Animalcare is cash generative and 
debt-free
 y Animalcare is dividend paying and 
expects to maintain its current dividend 
policy during its investment phase
 y Animalcare is implementing a clear 
strategy to accelerate its growth over 
the next three to five years

Market Overview
Total UK veterinary medicines market is 
worth approximately £625m, of which 
£344m is for companion animals (dogs, 
cats, horses and small mammals), with 
the whole animal medicines market 
growing by a little over 1% and a little 
under 1% for companion animals  
(www.noah.co.uk).
Market Overview
Annual UK sales volume estimated to 
reduce from approximately 1,300,000 
microchips for companion animals 
(excluding equine) to 810,000 in the 
aftermath of compulsory microchipping. 
Two main microchip database providers 
servicing the UK (The Kennel Club’s 
Petlog ~7.7m pets, Animalcare’s Anibase 
~4.8m pets), with several much smaller 
operators.
Market Overview
This grouping covers a wide range of 
products and consequently suppliers. 
Accessing the veterinary market 
through different channels, for example 
established veterinary and human 
healthcare wholesalers, internet providers 
and ad hoc local suppliers. Accordingly, 
this fragmented market is very hard to 
quantify.

S TR A TE G Y
Introduction
The UK veterinary market, whilst still 
relatively fragmented, is consolidating at an 
increasing rate. In the last decade we have 
experienced the inception of the corporate 
consolidator, be it stock market or private 
equity financed. The early players have 
increased significantly in size and now 
there are several smaller players entering 
the market. Over that ten year period 
we have also witnessed the saturation of 
the buying group model, where practices 
maintain their independence but join a 
group to improve their buying power. The 
buying groups offer additional central 
functions to differentiate themselves. As 
this space has become saturated it is now 
commonplace to see practices lured from 
one buying group to another. An example 
of the market maturing further, in the 
last 12 months one leading corporate 
has acquired a buying group and one of 
the main UK veterinary wholesalers has 
acquired two of the largest buying groups.
As in the human pharmaceutical arena, 
there are fewer and fewer original 
medicines being discovered and registered. 
The knock-on effect is that there are 
subsequently fewer products of which to 
make a generic. Also, as seen in human 
pharma, as opportunities become scarcer, 
global players acquire or launch their own 
range of generics.
For example, Animalcare was the first 
company in Europe to launch a generic 
buprenorphine in 2008 into a sub-£2m 
market. There are now five generic 
competitors in that market.
C u r r e n tM a r k e tDe v e lo pm e n t s
Two years ago saw the acquisition of 
Novartis Animal Health by Ely Lilly/Elanco. 
This year we are awaiting the expected 
regulatory clearance for the asset swap 
that will see Sanofi’s animal health 
business, Merial, taken over by Boehringer 
Ingelheim, catapulting the latter from 
number six to the second biggest in the 
world with a combined annual turnover of 
approximately £3.3 billion; and the largest 
animal health business in Europe.
The effect of this M&A activity is mixed for 
Animalcare. Whilst it is clear that the larger 
and larger global companies do not and 
cannot focus on the tail of their expanding 
product ranges, the sheer size of the 
newly combined product range is hard to 
compete against. It has also been hard to 
gain access to the product disposal fall-out 
from the M&A. 
There are many examples in business that 
show the space and fertile environment 
created when consolidation occurs at the 
top end of a market. There is still a place 
and space for Animalcare in this evolving 
market but it was these market dynamics 
that made it clear that we had to invest 
in our product pipeline in order to offer 
our customers extensive product ranges 
and to renew the range as products move 
though their product life cycles. Investing 
in enhanced generics and furthermore in 
innovative, novel products will strengthen 
Animalcare’s position in the market and 
in commercial transactions, moving the 
discussion away from price. The additional 
time to develop such products requires 
Animalcare to invest in these projects now. 
Even before the referendum vote in June, 
it was clear that Animalcare had great 
potential to open up to markets further 
south and east in Europe but importantly 
beyond our continent. 
In conclusion we are making the most of 
what we have and doing what we do, only 
better. 
08 Strategic Objectives
We have developed four strategic themes to maximise 
Animalcare’s growth in these market conditions.
Our strategy for 2016 to 2018 is to:
Progress Against Strategic Themes
              Product Development Pipeline 
The diagram right highlights the number of projects 
at each stage of the development pipeline. Progress is 
evident by the comparison to the number at the same 
time one year ago.
               Identifying Novel  
Pharmaceuticals to License
The investment in the technical and product 
development team has given us the extra capacity to 
actively search out novel, ideally patent protected, 
products to acquire or license. Several such 
opportunities have progressed to co-development 
projects or commercial negotiation during the period.
              Innovating in Companion  
Animal Identification
In preparation for the recent implementation of 
compulsory microchipping of dogs in England, 
Scotland and Wales, and the anticipated disruption 
to the market, we have reviewed our entire business 
model. As a result one project has started detailed 
planning in Q1 of the new financial year and another 
will be executed in Q3.
             Increasing Sales Outside the UK
We have had a very successful first year implementing 
our planned expansion into more territories in Europe 
and the ROW , with revenues increased by 23%. 
Further progress will be made during the next two 
years as we gain the regulatory certification in each 
new territory.

Introduction
I am very pleased with the progress we 
have made this year. Our revenues have 
continued to grow, +8.6% to £14.7m (2015: 
£13.5m). Our export strategy is already 
making early gains from ‘low hanging 
fruit’ with more to follow once product 
registrations have been made in the 
various territories we serve.
We have been in an investment phase for 
almost three years now. As expected the 
products from that investment are now 
starting to flow from the development 
pipeline and, at the same time, our core 
business continues to perform well in a 
tough commercial environment. Projects 
further back in the development pipeline 
are also progressing well in accordance 
with plan.
Our shareholders can be assured that our 
plans are on track and we are confident 
they we will continue to deliver.
Momentum in the period has been 
supported by further work to ensure the 
business has a strong platform for growth.
Bu s in essR e vi e w
Growth has come from all areas of the 
business.
Licensed Veterinary Medicines
The Licensed Veterinary Medicines group 
continued to grow strongly in the financial 
year increasing by 7.7% to over £9.2m 
(2015: £8.6m). In general the new products 
we have launched over the last five years 
continue to gain market share and grow 
revenues, while the older products in the 
final phases of their product life cycles are 
being eroded by commercial pressures 
and by substitution. However, five new 
pharmaceutical products were launched 
on distribution late in the prior year. With 
no new products to launch in this period 
this allowed us to focus on consolidating 
our market position for these products; the 
combined revenues of these five products 
increased by 262% to £0.95m (2015: 
£0.26m).
C o mp a n i o nA n i m a lI d e n t i f i c at i o n
Compulsory microchipping of dogs became 
law in England, Scotland and Wales in April 
2016. Not only is it a legal requirement for 
all dogs over the age of eight weeks to be 
microchipped it is also mandatory for the 
dog’s keeper’s name and contact details 
to be registered on a DEFRA approved 
database. We did not experience any uplift 
in microchip sales or database registrations 
until April when we had an unprecedented 
surge in both. Through careful planning 
and the considerable efforts of our staff 
and suppliers we managed to supply all 
our veterinary customers and ensure all 
registrations were fulfilled in a timely 
manner, unlike several of our competitors. 
It is too soon after the disruption to the 
market caused by this legislative change 
to conclude the long-term impact, but we 
believe there will be a lasting reduction 
in realised prices and microchip volumes. 
This was predicted and so plans are in the 
advanced stage to evolve our business 
models and market offering.

Animal Welfare Products
The Animal Welfare Product group grew 
again in the period with an increase of 
5.1% to £2.8m (2015: £2.6m). Our Infusion 
Accessories range grew by almost 10% as 
a result of sales and marketing focus and 
withdrawal of a modest competitor during 
the year. The Hygiene Products range grew 
too as a result of renewed focus following 
the launch of a new range of hard surface 
cleaners in the period which increased by 
12% to £0.67m. 
E xp o r t
Martin Gore joined Animalcare on 1
st
 
July 2015 in the role of Head of Export 
Development to focus on growing our 
product distribution in existing and 
new territories in Europe as this had 
underperformed in the past due to lack of 
focus. A year on, this has proved to be a 
great success not only growing revenues of 
existing products in existing territories 
but also sales of existing over-the-counter 
veterinary medicines products in new 
territories. This has resulted in export sales 
growth of almost 23% on the prior period. 
Martin has signed distribution agreements 
for some of our veterinary licensed 
products in territories well beyond Europe. 
Being regulated products there will be a 
modest delay until first sales while local 
licences are secured.
P e o pl e
Animalcare, like any organisation, is only 
as good as its employees. Therefore we 
have worked hard over the last three 
years during our investment phase to 
make sure we have the right people in the 
right roles to deliver our plan. We are well 
through this process to ensure we have the 
necessary roles covered and have made 
further important progress during the 
period. Underpinning the changes we have 
made to our team was the introduction 
of a Talent Management Programme 
which is a framework to make sure we 
recruit, develop, reward and engage all our 
employees as best we can.
In addition to recruitment in export 
sales, we have further strengthened our 
product development and registration 
team with appointments in both areas. To 
reflect the evolution of the UK veterinary 
customers towards consolidated corporate 
customers and buying groups we have 
strengthened our sales team yet further 
with experienced key account specialists 
now on the team.
We have conducted a review of our supply 
chain and identified key areas to improve 
supplier performance and demand 
planning. Consequently we have started to 
build a specialist supply chain team late in 
the period.

P r od u c tDe v e lo pm e n t
Three years ago we overhauled our 
product development activities and 
embarked on a large number of new 
projects. These projects were expected to 
take approximately three years to reach 
commercial launch. It is therefore very 
satisfying to see the successful registration 
of three products in the period, right on 
target. 
Two years ago Animalcare took the 
decision to move the contract manufacture 
of its largest product, Aqupharm I.V. Fluids, 
away from a global manufacturer to one 
better suited in terms of flexibility, cost, 
size and culture. This was the largest 
development and regulatory project 
tackled to date. I am pleased to report 
that the project went smoothly and was 
fully implemented in H2 FY16 with no 
product supply disruption or impact on our 
customers.
The impact of the contract manufacturing 
move detailed above meant the loss 
of UK distribution rights for a general 
anaesthetic, Isocare. We embarked on a 
project to register our own product. The 
product was successfully registered in 
H2 and has since been launched to the 
market, again with no disruption, in Q1 
FY17.
Both these products were solely UK 
licensed so we took the opportunity to 
extend the product authorisations to 
several European territories. 
Another product successfully registered 
in H2 was Acecare, a premedicant to 
complement our extensive anaesthetic 
and analgesic range. It is the first generic 
acepromazine on the UK veterinary market.
In all we submitted five licence applications 
during the period, a record number for 
Animalcare. Furthermore, during the 
period we prepared, entirely in-house, 
Animalcare’s first dossier submission to 
the veterinary regulatory authorities. Until 
now we have relied to a varying degree on 
external consultancies. This is a measure 
of the level of experience and quality of 
personnel that now work in the technical 
and regulatory team. 
The further strengthening of our product 
development and registration function 
gives us greater capacity to uncover novel 
and more complex product opportunities 
by expanding our network. We have 
a growing database of such ideas. We 
are also attracting more distribution 
opportunities from a wider pool of animal 
health companies, most from outside the 
UK.
Br e x it
The referendum result in June 2016 
will inevitably have an impact on our 
business, although the extent of this is, 
of course, still unclear. The timing of the 
result allowed us to put plans in place to 
incorporate the initial currency instability 
into our new financial year and we will 
continue to monitor the situation and take 
necessary and available action.
The encouraging early progress of our 
sales in territories outside Europe will go 
some way to diversifying our markets in 
the short-term. The launch of products will 
take one to two years to materialise due 
to the various pharmaceutical regulatory 
requirements in place.
Subsequent changes to the European 
pharmaceutical regulatory framework are 
of course currently unknown but we will 
monitor this closely and put plans in place 
to protect our business. 
Summary and Outlook
I am confident that we have built a strong 
and scalable platform in the business. 
We will continue to focus hard on our 
in-house development pipeline and our 
efforts to source novel products. The 
strong progress made on our distribution 
territory expansion will be cemented 
and we will make further progress with 
regulatory registrations through the year. 
We recognise that it is vital for the future 
of the business that we identify the right 
products and invest in novel products. 
Animalcare will continue to be active on 
this key strategic front. 
Whilst the animal health industry evolves 
with customer consolidations and supplier 
M&A we have shown that we can continue 
to grow organically through launching new 
products and providing a superior service 
to our customers.
With the first products successfully through 
our development pipeline we will start 
to see early revenue growth with more 
significant impact in subsequent periods. 
More product registrations are expected in 
the current period. 
In summary, Animalcare is in good health, 
generating strong cash flows to invest in 
the business and at such a rate that we 
are in a position to step up our investment 
in products and wider opportunities to 
provide the long-term success of the 
business.

Presentation of Results
We present our financial results on 
two bases. Underlying results show the 
performance of the business before 
exceptional and other items since the 
Directors believe this provides a clearer 
understanding of business performance. 
IFRS results include these items to give the 
statutory results.
Overview of Financial Results
The Group has delivered another year of 
strong top line growth whilst we continue 
to invest in our business. Underlying 
operating profit increased by 2.6% 
compared with previous year to £3.2m, 
slightly ahead of recently revised market 
forecasts of £3.1m.
We have maintained sound financial 
discipline and our balance sheet strength 
continues to build, reflecting the cash 
generative nature of our operations. Group 
cash balances increased to £7.1m as at 
30
th
 June 2016, providing the business 
with the funds we need to continue the 
momentum of our product development 
pipeline and support future growth.

The Licensed Veterinary Medicines group, 
which represents 63% of total revenue, 
continued its strong track record of growth, 
with sales up 7.7% to £9.2m, primarily 
reflecting full year sales of new products 
launched during FY15 which increased 
by £0.7m. Like-for-like sales declined by 
0.3% with growth in our export business 
offsetting the prior year UK c£0.2m non-
recurring first half benefit from sales of 
Buprecare in the UK as a result of supply 
issues with a competitor. 
Companion Animal Identification sales 
increased by 16.1%. Legislation has been 
implemented making it compulsory to 
microchip dogs in the UK from April 2016 
resulting in an incremental sales benefit  
of c£0.3m. Price competition amongst

Summary and Outlook
Whilst the decision by the people of the 
UK to leave the EU has not as yet resulted 
in any current legal or regulatory change, 
it is clear there are immediate secondary 
effects of this decision, in particular 
political and economic uncertainty, as 
well as significant exchange rate volatility. 
Nevertheless, as yet we have not observed 
major disruption to our operating activities 
and our strategic objectives remain at this 
present time unchanged – we will continue 
to invest in our business for future 
growth. Sterling weakness has impacted 
on our costs of goods, in particular our 
pharmaceutical products imported from 
mainland Europe. The business is taking 
steps to mitigate certain of this exposure 
and the growth in our export business 
will provide some natural hedge. Our 
strong balance sheet will help absorb 
the uncertainty in the macroeconomic 
environment. 
Overall the Group continues to make 
good progress in executing its strategy 
to drive future growth, which is reflected 
in our financial performance and level of 
investment in the business. 
CHRIS BREWSTER 
Chief Financial Officer
Underlying operating profit increased by 
2.6% to £3.2m and our operating margin 
reduced by 170 basis points to 20.5%, the 
latter reflecting the continuing investment 
in our business, in particular our people for 
which employee costs increased by £0.3m, 
to position the business for future growth. 
Exceptional and other items principally 
incorporate the amortisation of acquired 
intangibles as detailed in note 4.
Our effective tax rate has reduced from 
15.8% to 14.6% as a result of the significant 
increase in product development 
investment on which research and 
development tax credits are claimed for 
qualifying expenditure. 
Reflecting all of the above, reported profit 
after tax was up 4.0% to £2.6m (2015: 
£2.5m).
Basic underlying EPS improved by 3.2% to 
13.0 pence (2015: 12.6 pence). Basic EPS, 
which incorporates non-underlying items, 
rose by approximately the same amount to 
12.5 pence (2015: 12.1 pence). 
Dividends
The Board is proposing a final dividend in 
respect of the year of 4.7 pence per share, 
giving a total dividend of 6.5 pence per 
share for 2016 (2015: 6.1 pence per share). 
This final dividend is subject to shareholder 
approval at the Annual General Meeting 
on 15
th
 November 2016 and will be paid 
on 25
th
 November 2016 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 
21
st
 October 2016.
The ordinary shares will become ex-
dividend on 20
th
 October 2016. 
The Board will continue to monitor 
the Group’s cash position to ensure an 
appropriate balance between investment 
for future growth and dividend flow to 
deliver overall value for our shareholders.

PRINCIPAL RISKS
Risk Management Framework
The Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of our risk management activities, intended to monitor and 
mitigate, rather than eliminate, the significant risks that the Group is exposed to. Animalcare has implemented policies and procedures 
to address risk including with respect to product development, operations and regulatory compliance. 
In accordance with our governance practices, the Audit Committee supports the Board of Directors in monitoring the Group’s risk 
appetite and exposures, and is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems.
Our Risks
A summary of the principal risks together with an explanation of how the Group mitigates each risk their trend and linkage to our 
strategy are set out in the table below.

d e v e lo pm e n tr i s k
Pharmaceutical 
development is 
complex, involving 
technical, regulatory and 
financial risk. Failure to 
successfully deliver new 
product development 
projects could have a 
material impact on the 
Group’s results and 
damage our market 
position and relationship 
with our customers.

2
Complete failure of a 
project or failure to meet 
commercial expectations 
due to for example 
competitor launches 
(generic or novel) would 
result in impairment of 
capitalised development 
costs.
Following careful 
selection of development 
strategy, each new 
product development 
project undergoes 
rigorous review by the 
cross-discipline senior 
management team with 
final sign-off by the 
Board. The pipeline is 
reviewed regularly, with 
corresponding updates 
provided to the Board, 
to ensure each project 
is progressing according 
to plan. 
The Group 
continues and 
plans to commit 
significant 
resources 
to expand 
our product 
portfolio.
Market risk
The veterinary market 
continues to see a 
customer-base that is 
consolidating via the 
emergence of buying 
groups and corporate 
customers who are 
looking for value from the 
products and services we 
provide.

respect of key account 
support and achieve our 
goal to better serve our 
changing customer-base.

Distribution risk
The supply of products to 
our customers in a timely 
manner is vital to the 
success of the Group.
The Group does not 
manufacture any of 
its own products and 
is solely reliant on an 
increasing third party 
supplier and contract 
manufacturer base across 
the UK and Europe.

Any disruption to the

key supply partners or 
interruption to the supply 
chain could result in

reputation with its 
customers.
Given the increasing 
complexity and diversity 
in our supply chain, we 
have identified the need 
for increased specialist 
resource in this area, the 
recruitment for which is 
ongoing. 
Supply chain risk 
mitigation strategies 
include close monitoring 
of supplier performance 
and maintenance of 
adequate inventories, 
including safety 
stock held by our 
suppliers, based on risk 
assessments.

Failure to retain and

Group has the right mix 
of base salary, short-term 
and long-term incentives 
to attract, retain and

to execute our growth

Furthermore, we have

C O R P O R A TE  G O VE R N A N C E
Whilst the Group is listed on AIM, it is not required to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”). 
The Board, however, is committed to a high standard of corporate governance across the Group, recognising that it is important in 
protecting shareholders’ interests and the long-term success of the Group. It has therefore adopted some of the principles of the Code 
so far as the Board consider practicable and appropriate to the size of the Group.

The Board, which is headed by the Chairman, comprises five 
Directors, three of whom are non-executive. Directors’ profiles are 
detailed on pages 18 and 19. The Board meet at least seven times 
throughout the year, with further ad hoc meetings as required. 
Audit Committee
Through the Audit Committee, the Directors ensure the integrity 
of financial information, the effectiveness of the financial controls 
and the internal control and risk management systems. The Audit 
Committee is composed of two Non-Executive Directors including 
Nick Downshire who has been appointed Chairman. The Chief 
Financial Officer and external auditors attend by invitation.
Nomination Committee
The Company has established a Nomination Committee currently 
composed of two Non-Executive Directors including Ray Harding 
as Chair. Meetings are arranged as necessary. The Committee 
is responsible for nominating candidates (both Executive and 
Non-Executive) for the approval of the Board, to fill vacancies or 
appoint additional persons to the Board. 
All Directors are required to seek election by shareholders at 
the first opportunity after their appointment and must stand for 
re-election to the Board every three years under the Company’s 
Articles of Association.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Ray 
Harding (Chairman) and Nick Downshire. Under its Terms of 
Reference, the Remuneration Committee is required to meet 
at least twice a year and at such times as the Chairman of the 
Committee shall think fit.
The Committee’s primary responsibilities are to set key 
performance targets for Executive Directors, assess executive 
remuneration against targets, and ensure that remuneration 
standards at the Company are in line with best practice and 
guidance. During 2016, the Committee sought external guidance 
for the setting of FY17 remuneration. Further, during 2014 the 
advice of KPMG LLP was taken to provide guidance on the Group’s 
Long Term Incentive Plan. The Remuneration Committee reports 
on its activities to the Board meeting immediately following the

The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out 
on page 16.
For the purposes of their assessment of the appropriateness 
of the preparation of the Group’s accounts on a going concern 
basis, the Directors have considered the current cash position 
and forecasts of future trading including working capital and 
investment requirements.
During the year the Group met its day-to-day general corporate 
and working capital requirements through existing cash resources. 
At 30
th
 June 2016 the Group had cash on hand of £7.1m  
(30
th
 June 2015: £5.8m).
Overall, the Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully and continue to be profitable and 
cash generative. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, 
show that the Group should have sufficient cash resources to meet 
its requirements for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly, the 
adoption of the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements remains appropriate.
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of this Annual 
Report confirms that:
 y So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 y The Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
A resolution to reappoint KPMG LLP as auditors and to authorise 
the Directors to determine their remuneration will be put to the 
members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

in respect of the Annual Report and the  
Financial Statements for the year ended 30ᵗʰ June 2016
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, 
the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires 
the Directors to prepare Group and parent Company financial 
statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM Rules 
of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent Company financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 y select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 y make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 y state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
 y prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent Company will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
Year ended 30ᵗʰ June 2016
B a si so fc o n s o li dat i o n
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entity controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiary) made up to 30
th
 June each year. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The results of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiary to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
E x c e p t i o n a lan do t h e ri t e ms
Exceptional items are material items of income or expense which, because of their nature and the expected frequency of the events 
giving rise to them, merit separate disclosure.
Other items relate to the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and fair value movements on foreign exchange hedging instruments.
The separate presentation of exceptional and other items enables the users of the accounts to better understand the elements of 
trading performance during the year and hence to better assess trends in that performance.
G o o d w i ll
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is 
recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in comprehensive income 
and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying 
amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is 
not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of 
the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
The Group recognises intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets arise both as a 
result of applying IFRS 3 which requires the separate recognition of intangible assets from goodwill on all business combinations from 
1
st
 January 2004, and from the purchase of software (that is separable from any associated hardware), and development machinery and 
from research and development (see below).
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives as follows:
Customer relationships 10 years
Brands 15 years
Software Estimated useful life, normally 2–4 years
New product development costs & marketing authorisations Estimated economic life, normally 5–7 years

Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is 
recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s new product development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
 y an asset is created that can be identified (such as a new pharmaceutical product);
 y it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
 y the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Where no internally 
generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred which is generally when goods 
are delivered.
Income received in relation to long-term service contracts is deferred and subsequently recognised over the life of the relevant 
contracts. Further details are contained in note 21.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessee
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
E m p l o y e eb e n e f i t s-P e n s i o n s
The Group operates a stakeholder pension scheme available to all eligible employees. Payments to this scheme are charged as an 
expense as they fall due.

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in Group companies are stated at cost less provisions for impairment losses.
Foreign currencies
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not 
retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in 
comprehensive income for the year.
S e gm e n tr e p o r t i n g
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transaction with any of the Group’s other components. An operating segment’s 
operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its 
performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated 
using the first-in, first-out principle. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Dividends
Dividends paid are recognised within the statement of changes in equity only when an obligation to pay the dividend arises prior to the 
year end.
S h a r e - b a s e dp a y m e n t s
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of 
such equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions (with a corresponding movement in 
equity).
Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The fair value of the shares issued under the new Long Term Incentive Plan were valued on a discounted cash flow basis in conjunction 
with a third party valuation specialist.

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of 
comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
P r o p e r t y ,p l a n tan de qui p m e n t
Land and buildings and other assets held for use in the production or supply of goods and services or for administrative purposes, 
fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Other than for land, which is not depreciated, depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, less their estimated residual 
value, over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Straight-line
Leasehold improvements 10 years
Plant and equipment 4–7 years
Office furniture and equipment 3–5 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation outstanding at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset 
belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income 
immediately.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in comprehensive income when there 
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits repayable on demand, and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate 
method.
Finance income and expense
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains on hedging instruments that are recognised 
in the income statement (see note 9). Finance expenses comprise foreign exchange losses on hedging instruments that are recognised 
in the income statement (see note 9). 
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk. Derivatives are initially recognised at 
fair value and the gain or loss recognised on remeasurement to fair value recognised in profit or loss.

In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, management has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving 
estimations, which are dealt with below).
Capitalised new product development expenditure
It is the Group’s policy, where the relevant criteria of IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” are met, to capitalise new product development 
expenditure and to amortise this expenditure over the estimated economic life of the asset (product). Judgement is required when 
assessing the technical and commercial feasibility of new product development projects including whether regulatory approval will 
ultimately be achieved.
Capitalised software expenditure
The Group has historically capitalised software projects and developments. Expenditure on a bespoke web based system, designed to 
facilitate online ordering of its products and services, is currently capitalised in the Group’s financial statements as the Directors have 
adjudged it to meet the relevant criteria.
The rate of depreciation on capitalised software is set so as to reflect the pattern of usage and the level of pace of change within the 
global information technology market.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of non-current assets
Determining whether a non-current asset is impaired requires an estimation of the “value in use” and/or the “fair value less costs to 
sell” of the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) to which the non-current asset has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The key 
assumptions for these value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices 
and direct costs. The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the individual CGU. In the current year the Directors estimated the applicable rate to be 9.4% (2015: 
13.2%). The Directors’ sensitivity analysis indicates significant headroom to the carrying value of the CGU when taking into account a 
reasonably possible change in any one of the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and projections approved by management for 
the next five years, thereafter assuming an estimated growth rate of 1.8% (2015: 2%). The growth rates for the five year period are based 
on current performance of the existing product portfolio and the estimated contribution from the Group’s new product development 
pipeline. The Directors believe that the long-term growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the UK economy.
Impairment of slow-moving and obsolete inventory
The Group performs regular stock holding reviews, in conjunction with sales and market information, to help determine any slow-moving 
or obsolete lines. Where identified, adequate provision is made in the financial statements for writing down or writing off the value of 
such lines in order to reflect the realisable value of its stock.

The Animalcare Group plc LTIP was introduced in June 2014 to provide an effective mechanism for senior executives to participate in the 
Company’s equity at a meaningful level, aligning their interests with those of shareholders. The Directors’ interests in the LTIP , which was 
implemented via a subscription for growth shares in the capital of Animalcare Ltd, the subsidiary of the Company, are as follows:
 y Iain Menneer – 31,955 A Ordinary Shares of £1.00 each (“A Shares”) for a total cash subscription of £31,955, representing 5.2% of 
Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital; and
 y Chris Brewster – 19,173 A Shares, representing 3% of Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital and 11,800 B Ordinary Shares of £1.00 
each (“B Shares”), representing a further 2% of Animalcare Ltd’s issued share capital, for a total cash subscription of £30,973.
The total cash subscriptions were, based on independent valuation, considered to be equal to fair value at the time of acquisition.
Dr Menneer and Mr Brewster have the right to sell their A Shares to the Company at any time after 27
th
 June 2017 in exchange 
for Ordinary Shares of 20 pence each in the Company (“Ordinary Shares”). Their rights to sell the A Shares are subject to, amongst 
other provisions, the Company having a market capitalisation in excess of £39.0m (“the Hurdle”) at the time of sale. The Hurdle was 
determined by Animalcare’s Remuneration Committee and broadly represented a 20% premium to the Company’s market capitalisation 
on 27
th
 June 2014. Each holder of A Shares would, on a sale of his entire holding to the Company, be entitled to receive Ordinary Shares 
representing a percentage of the increase in the Company’s market capitalisation above the Hurdle; being 5% for Dr Menneer and 3% 
for Mr Brewster. The A Shares do not have a right to receive a dividend, except for any amounts distributed on the winding up of the 
Company or on an asset sale.
The B Shares are not entitled to participate in any increase in the value of the Company above the Hurdle but can be exchanged for 
Ordinary Shares of an equal value at any time after 27
th
 June 2017. The B Shares have a right to an annual dividend (on a non-fixed 
coupon basis), calculated by applying a rate of LIBOR + 2% to the nominal value of the B Shares.
Further details of the Plan, including the Hurdle, anti-dilution and other provisions, are set out in Animalcare Ltd’s articles of association, 
which is available within the Investors section (constitutional documents) of the Company’s website at www.animalcaregroup.co.uk.

The tax credit of £27,000 (2015: £26,000) shown within “exceptional and other items” on the face of the statement of comprehensive 
income, which forms part of the overall tax charge of £452,000 (2015: £476,000) relates to the items analysed in note 4.
The prior year current tax credits in respect of both 2016 and 2015 primarily relate to research and development tax credits. The prior 
year deferred tax charge in 2015 of £117,000 relates to the first time recognition of deferred tax in relation to capitalised development 
costs. 
The Government has announced that it intends to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1
st
 April 2020. This change 
in rates was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore has not been reflected in the tax rates used for deferred 
tax purposes. The Finance Act 2015 (No 2) was substantively enacted on 26
th
 October 2015 which will reduce the rate of corporation tax 
to 19% with effect from 1
st
 April 2017 and 18% from 1
st
 April 2020. This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. 
Deferred tax balances at 30

 June 2016 have been calculated based on these rates.

The carrying amount of Group goodwill is allocated to the Group’s sole cash-generating unit (“CGU”), being the Animalcare segment.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined from value in use calculations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and projections approved by management for 
the next five years and thereafter assuming an estimated long-term annual growth rate of 1.8% (2015: 2.0%).
The financial budgets and projections are based on past experience and actual operating results. The growth rates for the five year 
period are based on current performance of the existing product portfolio and the estimated contribution from the Group’s new product 
development pipeline. The Directors believe that the long-term growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the 
UK economy, the principal geographic area in which Animalcare operates. 
The Directors estimate the discount rates using the post-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit. In the current year the Directors estimated the applicable pre-tax rate to be 
9.4% (2015: 13.2%).
The Directors modelled a range of different scenarios by applying sensitivities to both the cash flow assumptions and the discount rate. 
Based on this sensitivity analysis there is significant headroom between the value in use calculation and the carrying value of the CGU.

Credit risk
The Company’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables. The Company’s credit risk 
is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful 
receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is 
evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The allowance for doubtful debts represents the difference between the 
carrying value of the specific trade receivables and the present value of the expected recoverable amount. The average credit period on 
sales of goods is 33 days (2015: 31 days). No interest has been charged on overdue receivables.

Deferred income arises from certain services sold by the Group’s subsidiary Animalcare Ltd. In return for a single up-front payment, 
Animalcare Ltd commits to a fixed term contract to provide certain database, pet reunification and other support services to customers. 
There is no contractual restriction on the amount of times the customer makes use of the service. At the commencement of the 
contract it is not possible to determine how many times the customer will make use of the services, nor does historical evidence provide 
indications of any future pattern of use. As such, income is recognised evenly over the term of the contract, currently eight years.

During the year the Group operated the Animalcare Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme, the Save As You Earn (SAYE) Share Option 
Scheme and the new Long Term Incentive Plan as described below:
A n i m a l c a r eGr o upp l cE x e c u t i v eS h a r eO p t i o nS c h e m e
Under this scheme, options may be granted to certain executives and senior employees of the Group to subscribe for new shares in 
the Company at a fixed price equal to the market value at the time of grant. The options are exercisable three years after the date of 
grant. Once vested, options must be exercised within six years of the date of grant. The exercise of these options is not subject to any 
performance criteria.
S A Y EO p t i o nS c h e m e
This scheme is open to all UK employees to encourage share ownership. Share options are granted at an option price fixed at a 20% 
discount to the market value at the start of the savings period. The SAYE options vest and are exercisable three years after the date of 
grant and must ordinarily be exercised within six months of the completion of the relevant savings period.

2003 has seen significant progress on our ‘Consolidate-Leverage-
Grow’ strategy. While the emphasis has been on consolidation,
the benefits of our recent investments in R&D are beginning to
come through with continuing volume growth in Photographic
and encouraging projects in Broadcast. 
Despite falling TV audience figures in the US, there are signs of
an upturn in advertising there. In addition, photographic demand
remains strong and we expect this to continue during 2004.
However, we expect currency movements to continue to have 
a negative effect on the Group.

Vitec’s Global Markets 04 The Vitec Group Annual Report 2003 05
Vitec Group products are used by frontline professionals – for
news gathering and documentary making, as well as in outside
broadcast, live entertainment or sophisticated studio operations. Chairman’s statement
2003 saw progress on a number of fronts as we continued to
reshape the business and position it for future growth.
2003 saw progress on a number of fronts as we continued to reshape the
business and position it for future growth. Our Broadcast manufacturing
facilities have been restructured and substantial progress made on
worldwide IT systems. We continued to launch attractive new products
and our recent acquisitions have been integrated. However, the results
were affected by a combination of overall weakness in our broadcast
markets and by adverse currency effects.
Year on year revenues grew for the first time since 2000 (from £182.2
million in 2002 to £192.8 million in 2003) due to new products and 
the effect of several small acquisitions. However, operating profit before
exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment fell (from
£24.7 million to £17.8 million) due to changing product mix, adverse
exchange rates, the costs of increased product development activities
and the inefficiencies associated with the series of plant closures
undertaken in 2003.
Earnings per share, before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and
impairment, were 23.9p (2002: 34.1p) reflecting the factors above and
the continuing high tax rate, which arises because most of the Group’s
profits are earned outside of the UK.
Cash generation remained strong, with net cash inflow from operating
activities at £28.7 million (2002: £35.4 million) being 161% of operating
profit before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment
(2002: 143%).
Market overview The market remained strong for Vitec’s Photographic
brands, particularly in the US. However the demand for our Broadcast
Systems products and for Broadcast Services rental service did not
recover. After an encouraging first three months in 2003, the Gulf War
and a slowdown in Asia depressed sales through most of the rest of 
the year. 
Weakness in broadcast markets was offset by success in other discrete
areas, such as live entertainment and military and government. A pick-
up was noticeable towards the end of the year, particularly in the
robotic camera support area, but I am cautious about drawing any 
06 The Vitec Group
firm conclusions from such limited evidence. The broadcast rental
market in the US stayed subdued for most of the year, and 2003 did
not benefit from the major sports event contracts of 2002.
In contrast, I am delighted to report that our Photographic business
enjoyed strong sales to the keen amateur segment, whilst sales to
professional photographers were relatively stable. Volume was up
significantly on the previous year, driven by new products targeted at
capturing the growth in digital still and video imaging but with much of
the volume going to the US, these volume gains were largely negated
by the impact of the falling dollar.
Acquisitions and Disposals In February 2003, Vitec acquired
OConnor Engineering, a leader in camera control heads for the film
industry, and Radamec Broadcast Systems, a leader in automated
robotic control systems. These businesses have been successfully
integrated, with OConnor products now available worldwide through the
Sachtler sales channel. Radamec Broadcast production was transferred
to Vinten in Bury St Edmunds. Radamec Broadcast enjoyed a particularly
strong end to the year. Aspen, which was integrated into Anton/Bauer
in 2002, generated sales growth of over 80% in 2003. 
In January 2004 we announced the acquisition of Manfrotto’s long-
standing German distributor for b1.9 million. It, together with our
existing trading companies in France, Italy and the US, will be renamed
Bogen Imaging, establishing a better marketing platform to support our
worldwide photographic dealers. 
At the end of the year Vitec broke off discussions with EVS Broadcast
Systems regarding the potential acquisition of that business. Due
diligence and other costs of £0.9 million were written-off as an
exceptional item.
In December we announced the sale of the Retail Display business,
ALU, for £11.9m. Whilst revenue grew to £22.4 million during the 
year, profitability was affected by a charge of b3.0 million (£2.1 million)
for upgrading retail units. ALU initially developed its business by
successfully selling variants of existing Manfrotto products to clothing Whilst the Group’s strategy is to enhance shareholder value by pursuing
growth, whether organically or by acquisition, the Board recognises that
if no suitable opportunities present themselves over the medium-term it
will consider how best to return cash to shareholders.
Outlook 2003 was a year of considerable change for Vitec and we
expect 2004 to benefit from the plant consolidation programme, largely
completed last year, and from the new products launched recently. 
Our photographic market remains strong and continues to benefit 
from the uptake of digital cameras, however the broadcast market
remains difficult. TV advertising in the US is now more buoyant than 
at any time during 2003, which should help our customers’ confidence,
although disappointing audience figures may continue to make
advertisers cautious.
With half of Vitec’s sales coming from the US, the present weakness 
of the dollar will have a negative effect on Vitec during 2004. Based 
on the euro, dollar and yen exchange rates governing at close of
business on 26 February continuing throughout 2004, there would 
be an adverse transaction effect of some £2.4 million and an adverse
translation effect of some £1.7 million, compared to 2003.

Chairman

retailers. That overlap in product ranges is no longer so significant and
the business was identified as non-core. I would like to thank Abramo
Manfrotto, who has left with ALU, for his work at Vitec; sales by the
Manfrotto business doubled in the years of his leadership.
Changes to the Board The Board has been strengthened by the
appointment of Nigel Moore from 1 March 2004. Nigel spent most 
of his career at Ernst & Young and it is intended he will take over the
Chairmanship of the Audit Committee in September. I am delighted 
to welcome him to the Board.
I have now served on the Board for eight years, with five of them as
Chairman. It is therefore time to start planning for a successor. In order to
allow for an appropriate handover period, we are currently undertaking
a search process with a view to making an appointment during 2004.
I would like to thank all our employees worldwide, and my colleagues on
the Board, for the dedication and skill they have shown during the year,
one in which Vitec has made many steps forward in a difficult market.
2003 dividend and dividend policy The Board is recommending an
unchanged final dividend for the year of 16.6p, giving a total dividend
for the year of 22.7p.
The emphasis within the ‘Consolidate-Leverage-Grow’ strategy has so
far been on consolidation and restructuring of the Group’s activities; as
the balance changes towards growth the Board believes it is important
to ensure the company has the flexibility to pursue acquisitions.
Accordingly the Board has decided to adjust its dividend policy to move,
over a period of two to three years, towards an average dividend cover
level of around 2 times.
Subject to there being no material adverse factors that may affect the
Group’s results in 2004, the Board intends to maintain the interim
dividend for the financial year to December 2004 at 6.1p. The final
dividend for that year will be set taking into account the policy outlined
above and the outlook for 2005.

2003 proved to be a challenging year, but one in

‘Consolidate-Leverage-Grow’ strategy.
to concentrate Bury St Edmunds on the more complex Broadcast
products, with Cartago concentrating on higher volume lines. In 
Italy we have re-organised a number of manufacturing facilities and
processes. Further simplification will be possible following the sale
of ALU, allowing us to run the core facilities there more effectively.
In addition, the entire Drake business also relocated from Welwyn
Garden City to a better-suited site on the Research Park outside
Cambridge, UK.
During the year the Photographic business rolled out a new integrated
IT system to most of its main locations and the Broadcast Systems
IT system was extended to the Cartago site and the Radamec
Broadcast and Vinten Inc sales offices. These systems will greatly
improve the information available to managers, and speed up
decision-making and production planning. The integrated IT system
within Broadcast Services is allowing them to better manage their
rental assets, reducing the need for capital and giving better control
over subrentals.
Taken together, the plant reorganisation and the IT implementations
have inevitably been disruptive. These initiatives have been well
managed and provide the cornerstones for Vitec’s future.
Top line growth generated Whilst the emphasis was on ‘Consolidate
-Leverage’ during 2003, considerable progress was also made in
resuming top line growth. Despite a difficult market, revenue from
continuing operations grew 3.6% during 2003: Broadcast Services
was lower due to the non-repeat nature of the 2002 FIFA World
Cup, but this was more than offset by increases in the other Divisions.
08 The Vitec Group
As underscored in our Half Year Results statement, 2003 proved to
be a challenging year, but one in which Vitec made significant steps
forward on its ‘Consolidate-Leverage-Grow’ strategy.
This strategy involves taking out costs by exploiting our scale, improving
our performance through better use of group-wide manufacturing
and IT systems, and looking to generate growth by focusing our
engineering and marketing resources on those areas where growth
can be achieved. Solid progress has been made on all these fronts,
although there is more to do.
Whilst we expect to show organic growth through the new product
platforms and the improved distribution network, there remains an
avenue for growth through acquisition in what is still a fragmented
industry. With significant progress in manufacturing, division-wide 
IT systems and a management team focused on delivering growth,
Vitec is now able to add value to acquired businesses in a way that
it could not in the past.
Manufacturing restructuring delivered With our markets well below
the peak of 2000, and with lower demand for the more complex
studio infrastructure products, the high operational gearing within
our Broadcast businesses was a handicap. The focus in 2003 was,
therefore, on ‘Consolidate-Leverage’. Lower cost manufacturing is
vital to counter the effects of the ongoing trend to smaller cameras
and tripods within the lightweight sector of the broadcast market. 
To drive manufacturing efficiencies we closed four plants and
upgraded the facilities in Bury St Edmunds, UK and Cartago, Costa
Rica (located in a local Zona Franca). We have taken the opportunity Photographic sales were up on the back of some successful product
launches at the end of 2002 and throughout 2003, and Retail
Display benefited from a large US order, albeit at lower margins than
in the past. The lighting truss business, Litec, has seen growth from
the adoption of its new temporary lighting gantry and roofing products.
Bogen, the distribution arm, went from strength to strength in the
US, with a number of exciting new lines, including Kata camera bags.
In Broadcast Systems, while the net growth came from the acquisitions,
there was increased volume in lightweight camera support and useful
sales increases at Anton/Bauer and Clear-Com, both US-based, and
at Sachtler.
It was very pleasing that Vitec companies continued to pick up
awards for innovative new products at the major tradeshows: Drake,
Clear-Com, Vinten, Anton/Bauer and Bogen were all recognised 
for their technical leadership during 2003. These awards are not
ends in themselves, but are encouraging pointers to future revenues
as and when broadcast budgets revive. Drake was also successful 
in securing a number of significant intercoms orders for Air Traffic
Control projects. The first of these was delivered in late 2003, and
will be commissioned in early 2004, and we are learning more about
the market from each one. As we won more orders than expected,
R&D expense was increased to take advantage of these opportunities.

At the end of 2003 we opened a sales office for the Broadcast
companies in Beijing to serve the local Chinese TV stations as they
prepare for the Olympics in 2008.
The growth in high definition programming has been exploited by
Bexel, who have provided equipment and technical support for
several new TV shows.
Executive team The Executive Board has been joined by Joop
Janssen and Francesco Bernardi. Joop, who took over the Broadcast
Systems Division in June 2003, has spent most of his career in
broadcast at Thompson and Philips in product development and
business management roles. Following the sale of ALU, Francesco
Bernardi was promoted to lead Gruppo Manfrotto, having been its
Sales and Marketing Director. His background is in international
marketing. Photographic Products for 
professional photographers
10 The Vitec Group
Photographic continues to make good progress The Photographic
Division’s best performing market in 2003 has been the US where
Bogen achieved record sales. Europe did not match this performance
and declines were registered in the key markets of Italy, France and
Germany while many emerging countries in Asia struggled to recover
from the SARS epidemic.
The new distribution strategy initiated last year led to the acquisition
of the distribution end of Germany’s Multiblitz, which will become part
of Bogen Imaging, and the appointment of Daymen International in
the UK.
2003 was another record year for Litec, which produced the highest
growth in the Photographic Division, and Gitzo, which saw a double
digit volume growth.
The cinema sector grew considerably this year, with Manfrotto and
Avenger Lighting Supports products widely used throughout the film
industry, notably in the production of blockbuster films such as Lord
of the Rings, Peter Pan, Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions.
Marketing activities 2003 was a busy year for Manfrotto in terms of
sponsorships and collaborations such as Land Of Africa, a humanitarian
expedition from Switzerland to the Cape of Good Hope; the Toscana
Photographic Workshop which ran photographic courses across Italy
in which acclaimed photographers (including National Geographic
and Magnum members) taught young and aspiring photographers
how to get the most from their art; an Italian speleology expedition to
Cuba; and "Den Första Svenska Dhaulagiri Expeditionen", the first
Swedish expedition to the 8000m "White Mountain" in the Himalayas
(the same expedition team then set out for the South Pole armed with
Manfrotto photo and video equipment); and sponsorship of French
aerial photographer Yann Arthus Bertrand.
New products In 2003, Manfrotto launched a broad range of new
products in both the video and photographic sectors including the
innovative, easy-to-use and ergonomic grip action ball photographic
head; the extended "DIGI" compact tripod range, which attacks the
amateur end of the market; the spherical panoramic head which
generated a considerable amount of interest with the more specialised
virtual reality end of the market and three new video camera remote
pan bars for all types of user.
Gitzo introduced a selection of new products specifically targeted at
the photographic market’s growing trend for miniaturisation within the
digital camera market, and levelling tripods aimed at flexible outdoor
applications for nature and architecture photographers. 
IFF launched the Line Shaft Hoist in 2003 aimed at the theatrical market.
Litec developed a smaller compact truss that works in combination
with its revolutionary Libera system to create broad span structures
and grid systems guaranteeing high load capacities with minimal
column support. 2003 also saw the introduction of convenient truss
transportation systems and the restyling of important existing products.
Other activities IFF was transferred from Florence to premises in
Feltre, the heart of Gruppo Manfrotto’s manufacturing area, and a
number of the assembly factories were transformed into flow lines.
The year ended with good order intake, resulting in a significant 
order book as the business enters 2004.
The new Divisional IT system, Movex, was fully rolled out in the US
and in the manufacturing sites in Italy, representing a step change 
in the way the business is managed, with one system replacing six
standalone systems.
Retail Display continued to develop in a difficult market, and has
now been sold In 2003 the retail display market continued to be soft,
particularly in the US, where the total fixture industry shrank 6.5%
between 2001 and 2003 and the first half of the year saw ten fixture
companies go bankrupt or close factories. Although big box retailers
took more share away from ALU’s traditional customer base (specialty
retailers and department stores), the Company was able to finally
reverse a four year decline in the US market. 
In Europe, modest improvements in key markets like Germany, the
UK and Scandinavia were negatively offset by the slowdown with a
major custom project, which had reached its peak in 2002 and is
now phasing out. Whilst distribution in the Asia Pacific region is still
weak, ALU won a very prestigious international program with a Hong
Kong based cosmetic company. 
New products launched (a completely new Autocube system and a
renovated version of Box in December of 2002, and a new rail system
called Acrobat in March of 2003) received very strong market response.
Autopole, the traditional product, still performed very well in 2003,
thanks to a particularly large order from Sears.
At the end of the year the disposal of the ALU business for £11.9
million was announced. Manfrotto will continue to provide administration
and IT services to ALU on an arm’s length basis, and a supply
contract, principally for Autopole products, is also in place. I would
like to thank all of the staff at ALU for their work for Vitec, and wish
them well for the future.

Product introductions have maintained revenue in a weak market
The two acquisitions in February broadened the product range; 
cost reduction initiatives continued in a tough broadcast market.
The consolidation of manufacturing started to enhance profitability
in the camera support product lines for Vinten and Sachtler in the
fourth quarter.
Vinten continues to lead the industry in the design and supply of
Studio and Outside broadcast products. 2003 saw a number of
substantial deliveries including Televisa's Chapultepec Newscenter
studios which selected a number of camera support systems for its
studio, including Quartz pedestals complete with Vector 70 pan and
tilt heads. A major station in Austria took delivery of a number of
robotic heads and control systems, as well as manual heads and
pedestals, whilst a television station in Durham North Carolina
purchased a complete robotic camera automation system including
three SP-2000XY full servo pedestals. A number of systems were
also installed in food and shopping channels throughout the US.
Vinten equipment was also hired or purchased for a variety of major
events around the world such as the Golf Masters, Downhill skiing,
and extreme winter sports events in the US.
Vinten and Radamec Broadcast – the two leading Robotic camera
control suppliers - joined forces to develop the broadcast robotics
business, creating synergy between the two operations. The main
focus was on manufacturing and product development to produce
the best products at the highest quality level for the future. New
products include the Series 200 controller and the exciting SE-500
Servo Elevation Unit, a remote controlled height positioning unit.
Both products were designed to meet the diverse requirements of
robotics in today's demanding TV environment. This year also saw
the launch of the Scenario XR – a virtual television production
system in which the virtual and real video world can be mixed
seamlessly in real time.
Manual products continued to satisfy evolving market demands, 
not least the Pro-touch lightweight range now including the Pro-6
and Pro-10 systems. These provide both outstanding rigidity and
exceptional control for the latest range of professional DV camcorders.
Vinten received a number of awards from trade magazines for
exceptional product design at the NAB convention and the yearly
Beijing broadcast show.
In 2003, alongside the cost reduction programme, Sachtler refocused
its sales and innovation resources to satisfy increasing customer
demands, with the OConnor acquisition offering an additional product
range and new product development skills.
The product range was widened by the 75 kg fluid head, with video
and film versions, and the 13 kg ENG head (Video 15) to serve lower
camera weight demands. Furthermore, a low cost version of a fluid
head for mini DV-cameras was introduced, also incorporating the
famous Sachtler fluid system.
Sachtler’s largest sales during 2003 were 100 sets of ENG-systems
for Spanish TV, the complete ENG project for the African games, a
studio lighting system contract in Japan won against local competitors,
and other important studio lighting systems for Swiss and Austrian TV.
Sachtler broadened its customer base, especially in the US, where 
a considerable volume of products were sold in non-broadcast
applications.
Anton/Bauer recorded its second highest sales year in 2003. It is
building its worldwide market share, with significant progress being
made in Europe, supported by the expansion of its regional sales
and service office in the Netherlands.
Anton/Bauer continued its record of product innovation, winning
industry awards and customer praise with the introduction of the
STASIS power support system. This unique patented design combines
both power and stable operation for small handheld mini-DV
camcorder equipment. 
The Aspen product line, acquired in 2002, was improved with the
introduction of the Nexus battery system; this offers an innovative
perpetual power feature for portable cameras. Aspen continues to
be key to addressing the growing market segment of wedding and
event videography.
Anton/Bauer also launched its Custom Power Systems (CPS)
initiative in 2003 to leverage its battery and charging technology in
other markets. The Company designed and manufactured a new
power system for a leading wireless medical cart manufacturer, in
addition to its longstanding business with a leading manufacturer 
of heart assist systems. 
Clear-Com and Drake During 2003 both Clear-Com and Drake
continued their high level of investment in R&D. Despite the sales
growth since 2002, the benefits of the past years investment are 
not expected to be visible until later in 2004. The broadcast market
remained weak, particularly in Europe, where both companies
experienced low levels of market activity. In the US, Clear-Com
benefited from a strong live performance market and the Company
maintained its position as the leading supplier of intercoms to 
this market.
During the year Drake won a significant number of orders from the
air traffic control (ATC) authorities in China, Korea, Vietnam and
Africa for voice communications systems. Delivery of these systems
commenced in late 2003, with commissioning of the first of them 
in early 2004.
Clear-Com received a PLASA award in November for CellCom, a
unique patent pending digital wireless intercom. It also launched 
the ECLIPSE digital matrix, which establishes new standards in
performance and functionality.
Customer support received a substantial boost in 2003 with the
establishment of a ‘24x7’ user support centre. The centre has been
introduced to provide immediate response to customers in every
time zone; it provides technical advice and assistance with trouble-
shooting, web based ordering and tracking of repairs and bespoke
care plans for special cases.
Anton/Bauer’s Stasis provides 
support for lightweight video 
cameras. The balancing 
counterweight, an Anton/Bauer
battery, powers both the camera
and the Anton/Bauer light. Broadcast services Rental services and technical

14 The Vitec Group
Bexel’s expertise at putting together complex equipment packages for high
profile events has made them the leading rental company in the US. Annual Report 2003 15
Bexel editing suites have facilitated the smooth production
of the last 10 Super Bowls.
Focus on control of rental assets has generated cash in a difficult
market Although Broadcast Services benefited from a continued
upturn in market demand for several types of large scale and High
Definition productions in 2003, it was impacted by generally weak
ongoing trading conditions in the US broadcast industry. As a result,
and without the recurrence of 2002’s large Winter Olympic and World
Cup contracts, the Division’s turnover fell by 8%, and operating
profit before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment
charges dropped to break-even. 
Capital expenditures, however, were tightly constrained, bringing 
the Division’s pool of equipment much more in line with demand.
Broadcast Services made increasing use of its integrated asset
management system in 2003, which allowed for improved equipment
utilisation and optimal usage of rentals from third parties. This
discipline, coupled with tighter controls over working capital, enabled
the Division to boost its operating cash flow to US$7.0 million in 2003.
A more proactive sales effort, greater sales force training and a new
customer relationship management system helped produce volume
increases in several areas, despite the weak overall market demand.
The Division built customised High Definition (HD) portable broadcast
equipment modules in ‘road-ready’ travel cases, and designed
innovative audio and video production packages, to enhance its
position in the rapidly growing HD broadcast market. 
The Bexel brand’s fibre-optic-based studio HD systems captured four
prime-time series: Grounded for Life, which aired on the Warner
Brothers Network, Hope and Faith on ABC, and The Tracy Morgan
Show and Whoopi on NBC.
Bexel’s nationwide network of offices allowed it to support long-term
travelling series, such as The Jamie Kennedy Experiment for Tribune
Entertainment. The Division also supported major North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation and World Trade Organisation events with large
custom-built audio/video systems. The nationwide network was also
invaluable support for sporting event producers such as Turner
Broadcasting, which used Bexel equipment packages to broadcast 
a selection of the week’s best National Basketball Association games
in many different cities. 
Bexel’s BBS unit supported the broadcasts of many world-class
sporting events, including: The Super Bowl; the Kentucky Derby,
Preakness and Belmont Stakes "triple crown" of US horse racing;
the FIFA Women’s World Championship; the US Open Tennis and
Golf Championships; and HD broadcasts of premier National
Football League and Major League Baseball games. 
The Division also made significant inroads in the vibrant reality
television sector. By combining its comprehensive inventory of audio
and video equipment with expert product design and technical
advice in both disciplines, the Division won several hit shows from
entrenched competitors. Broadcast Services thus became the 
"one-stop" first choice for the producers of MTV’s The Osbournes
and Newlyweds, CBS’ Survivor, NBC’s The Apprentice (starring
Donald Trump), and Fox’s Paradise Hotel, Casino and Forever Eden.
The Division’s sales units also scored major successes. Audio
Specialties Group (ASG) was awarded a three-year contract to 
be the exclusive US distributor of innovative Radio Frequency
products for HME, a leading broadcast audio manufacturer. ASG
also introduced Drake’s Digital Matrix Intercom System products 
to the US market. Bexel’s Broadcast Video Gear unit increased its
presence in the US used equipment sales arena and outperformed
most of its competitors, especially late in the year, when it set all-
time records for sales volume despite a generally adverse market.
Gareth Rhys Williams 
Chief Executive Continuing operations Turnover increased by £6.0 million (from
£164.4 million to £170.4 million) or 3.6% in the year. Most of the
underlying growth occurred in the Photographic Division. The 
broadcast and media industries remained depressed for most of 
the year, but Broadcast Systems benefited from a contribution of
£5.9 million arising from the acquisition of Radamec Broadcast
Systems and OConnor Engineering. Excluding acquisitions, sales
growth was £4.8 million or 2.9%, but this was negated by the
adverse effects of FX rates on translation, £1.2 million, and
transaction £3.5 million. 
Gross profit margins fell from 46.0% to 43.6% reflecting a poorer
mix in a number of businesses and the adverse effect of FX
transactions, particularly in the Photographic Division. Gross profits
were £3.6 million lower than the prior year before a contribution of
£2.2 million from acquisitions.
Net operating expenses before exceptional items of £1.9 million
and goodwill amortisation and impairment charges of £3.4 million
increased by £4.4 million to £56.6 million (£63.6 million in total,
less £7.0 million for discontinued operations). £2.5 million of the
increase related to acquired businesses. £1.2 million was due to an
18% increase in research, development and engineering costs and
£2.0 million to increased investment in sales and marketing costs,
offset by a £1.3 million benefit from foreign exchange translation. 
Operating profits on continuing business before exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation and impairment charges fell from £23.5
million to £17.8 million and operating profit margins were 10.4%
compared to 14.3% in 2002. The year on year effect of translating
overseas profits was £1.2 million favourable and the effect of
exchange rate changes on transactions, principally the weaker dollar
against the euro, was £2.3 million unfavourable after hedging.
As previously announced, the Group has taken operating 
exceptional charges of £1.9 million, comprising £1.0 million for the
closure of Radamec Broadcast’s manufacturing facility at Chertsey
and £0.9 million costs relating to the unsuccessful acquisition of
EVS Broadcast Equipment.
Discontinued operation and related exceptional item The sale 
of the Retail Display business on 30 December 2003, resulted 
in a loss on disposal, before tax, of £3.0 million after £1.0 million 
of divestment costs. The loss was after charging goodwill of £2.4
million, including £2.1 million previously written off to reserves.
There was an associated tax credit of £4.1 million, which will
significantly reduce the tax payable in Italy in 2004.
In the year to December, Retail Display’s net turnover increased 
by 25.8% to £22.4 million (2002: £17.8 million), due principally, to
a pick up in the US market, including a $7.3 million (£4.5 million)
order from Sears. Operating profit was £nil (2002: £1.2 million) 
as a total of b3.0 million (£2.1 million) had to be provided for the
upgrade of retail units, an increase of b1.5 million (£1.0 million)
over the amount announced and charged at the half year.
Goodwill amortisation and impairment The charge for goodwill
amortisation and impairment was £3.4 million (2002: £0.9 million).
This included £0.3 million attributable to 2003 acquisitions and 
an impairment charge of £2.1 million against the goodwill on the 
US Systems Wireless business.
Taxation The effective taxation rate on operating profit before
exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment has
increased to 39.8% from 39.4% in 2002. The tax charge is 
relatively high because profits have arisen in high tax jurisdictions
but the Group has incurred net losses in the UK on which it has not
benefited from tax relief. In 2003, £0.3 million of the £6.4 million
tax charge on ordinary activities represents deferred tax and is,
therefore, a non-cash charge. 
Cash flow and net debt Cash generation remained good despite the
lower profits. Net debt decreased during the year by £1.5 million to
£10.4 million as the cost of the two acquisitions (£6.4 million) and
the cash costs of restructuring actions were more than offset 
by the sale of the Alu business (net cash effect £8.0 million).
Financial review
Turnover from continuing operations increased by £6.0 million
(from £164.4 million to £170.4 million) or 3.6% in the year.
16 The Vitec Group Net cash inflow from operating activities was £28.7 million (2002:
£35.4 million), equating to 70p per share (2002: 86p per share).
Cash flow from a reduction in working capital was £4.0 million
(2002: £0.6 million). Capital expenditure and financial investments
were £10.2 million (2002: £10.5 million), of which £2.8 million
related to rental assets and £1.1 million to IT projects, partly
financed by the proceeds from asset disposals of £2.4 million
(2002: £3.9 million).
Working capital was increased by the effect of the two acquisitions
but reduced by the divestment of the Retail Display business.
Stocks increased by £2.7 million to £33.2 million, due principally 
to acquisitions and stock build associated with restructuring. Stock
days increased to 126 (2002: 112) partly as a result of the disposal
of the Retail Display business with its higher stock turn. Trade
debtors were £0.3 million lower than last year with debtor days at 
60 days (2002: 57 days). However, trade creditors at £15.0 million
were £2.9 million higher than last year, largely reflecting the
increased level of activity.
Tax paid in 2003 was £10.8 million, £4.2 million more than 2002,
as 2003 included settlement of an historic tax claim of £1.4 million,
whereas 2002 included the benefit of two tax rebates totalling some
£2.4 million.
Treasury Policy Financing, currency hedging and tax planning are
managed centrally. Hedging activities are designed to protect profits,
not to speculate. Substantial changes to the financial structure of
the Group or treasury practice are referred to the Board. During the
year, the Board approved the use of option contracts for hedging
foreign currency receipts.
As in previous years, a portion of the transactions of subsidiaries 
in foreign currencies is hedged 12 months forward. Forward foreign
exchange contracts at 31 December 2003 totalled £16.0 million
(2002: £27.0 million), after some £3.0 million worth were 
transferred with the divestment of Retail Display. In addition, the
Group had simple option contracts, for the sale of dollars for euros
over the period August 2004 to June 2005 totalling £8.4 million.
Translation of foreign currency profits and interest rates are not
normally hedged. Foreign currency net assets are not hedged 
other than by normal Group borrowings. 
The Group operates strict controls over all treasury transactions
involving dual signatures and appropriate authorisation limits. 
Financing Activities The average cost of borrowing for the year 
was 4.8% (2002: 5.2%). Net interest cover (using profit before
exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment) remained
high at 10 times (2002: 15 times) despite the lower profits. 
The Group’s three-year committed facilities expire in October 2005. 
UK pensions The Group contributes to two UK defined-benefit 
pension schemes. At the end of the year the Group closed both
schemes to new members, replacing them for 2004 onwards with 
a Group personal pension plan with Standard Life. As set out last
year, based on an estimated funding deficit of £2.7 million as at
December 2002, the Group increased its contributions to the
schemes by £125,000 per annum in 2003 (some 20%). It is
believed that this action, along with an improvement in financial
conditions, will mitigate the shortfall over a number of years. 
A full triennial actuarial valuation is due as at 5 April 2004.
International Financial Reporting Standards The Group has 
carried out a preliminary review of the implications of the proposed
international accounting standards that will come into force in 2005,
but has not yet evaluated the likely financial effect.

Annual Report 2003 19 Directors’ report
20 The Vitec Group
The directors present their report and the audited accounts of the
Group for the year ended 31 December 2003.
Review of the Group and its activities
The performance and activities of the Group during the year are set
out in the Chairman's statement, the Chief executive's review, the
Financial review and the Group overview.
On 6 February 2003 the Group acquired the business of OConnor
Engineering Laboratories from Autocue Inc for US$2.7 million (£1.6
million) cash.
On 18 February 2003 the Group acquired the shares of Radamec
Broadcast Systems Limited in the UK, and acquired the operating
assets and some of the liabilities of Radamec Inc in the USA, from
Radamec Group PLC for £4.8 million in cash.
On 30 December 2003 the Group disposed of its retail display
business operating under the ALU name for a consideration of
£10.2 million and acquired that part of a property in Bassano del
Grappa, Italy that it did not own for a consideration of £0.55 million
plus any attributable Italian VAT.
Results and dividends
The Group’s profit on ordinary activities before tax, exceptional
items, goodwill amortisation and impairment amounted to £16.1
million (2002: £23.1 million). Profit on ordinary activities before tax
but after exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and impairment
amounted to £7.8 million (2002: £16.6 million).
The directors recommend a final dividend of 16.6p per share (2002:
16.6p). If approved, the dividend per share for the year will total
22.7p (2002: 22.7p). Subject to approval by shareholders, the final
dividend will be paid on 20 May 2004 to shareholders on the
register on 23 April 2004.
Post balance sheet events
On 8 January 2004 the Group acquired the assets of the domestic
distribution arm of Multiblitz for b1.9 million (£1.3 million) cash.
Multiblitz is one of Manfrotto’s longstanding distributors.
Future development
The Group's continuing strategy is to grow its businesses through
organic expansion and carefully planned acquisitions principally in
areas related to its existing businesses, customers, markets and
skills. 
Research, development and engineering
The management of the Group recognises that new products are
essential to its long-term success and considerable emphasis is
placed on active product development programmes in the
manufacturing companies. In 2003 those companies spent £8.8
million (2002: £7.5 million) on research, development and
engineering.

and conditions, subject always to the supplier having complied 
with them. That policy will continue for the financial year ending 
31 December 2004. For the financial year ended 31 December
2003 the Company paid its suppliers on average within 15 days
(2002: 15 days) of date of invoice.

following key areas: risk and fraud, employment (including
employees and employee communication), whistleblowing,
environment, human rights, community impact and involvement,
relationships with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders.
Donations
During 2002, the Company made a contribution of £23,271 to its
account with Charities Aid Foundation. In 2003, the Company made
no contribution to that account because it was considered to be
adequately funded. Charitable donations were made by the Charity
committee from that account during 2003 totalling £7,000 (2002:
£6,998). No donations were made to any political party. For further
information on donations refer to the section on Community impact
and involvement set out in the Corporate social responsibility report
on pages 30 to 32.
Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting for 2004 will be held on Tuesday 
4 May 2004 at the offices of Financial Dynamics, Holborn Gate, 
26 Southampton Buildings, London WC2A 1PB. The notice of
meeting and a proxy card are enclosed. 
The Company will again be making use of the electronic voting
facility provided by its registrars, Capita Registrars. For further
information please refer to the section in Shareholder enquiries and
electronic voting set out on page 72.
The business of the annual general meeting will include the
consideration by shareholders of the report and accounts for the
year ended 31 December 2003, the Remuneration report, the
proposed dividend, election of a director, the re-election of the
auditor and the following further items of business.
The directors’ authority under Section 80 of the Companies Act
1985 to allot unissued shares in the Company will expire on 28 April
2004. Shareholders’ approval will be sought for the renewal of this
power for a further five years.
A resolution renewing the directors' authority to allot shares for cash,
as if the pre-emption provisions of Section 89 of the Companies Act
1985 did not apply, is set out in the notice of meeting. The first part
of the resolution deals with the allotment of shares for cash under a
rights issue, giving power to make adjustments to deal with overseas
shareholders, fractions of shares and similar matters. The second
part renews the power of the directors to allot shares for cash,
limited to 5% of the issued share capital at 1 March 2004. The
authority will expire at the end of the Company's next annual
general meeting or, if earlier, on 4 August 2005. Your directors have
no present intention of issuing or granting rights over the unissued
share capital, except in relation to the Company's adopted employee
share incentive arrangements and no share issue will be made
which will effectively alter the control of the Company without prior
approval of the shareholders in general meeting.
Any shares held in treasury and used by the Company for the
purposes of or pursuant to the employee share schemes operated
by the Company will, so long as required under institutional
guidelines, count towards the limits on the number of new shares
that may be issued under the rules of such employee share
schemes.
A resolution for a general authority for the Company to make market
purchases of its own shares was first passed at the annual general
meeting in 1998 and renewed by shareholders at subsequent
annual general meetings. The directors believe it is desirable to have
the power to make market purchases in the event of suitable
opportunities arising. Accordingly, a resolution to again renew the
authority will be proposed at the annual general meeting. The
authority to purchase shares would only be exercised if there was a
resultant increase in earnings per share, and it would be in the best
interests of the Company. Should the directors exercise such
authority, any shares so purchased may be placed in treasury in
accordance with The Companies (Acquisition of Own
Shares)(Treasury Shares) Regulations 2003, as amended and
subsequently cancelled or transferred to satisfy awards arising
under the Company’s employee share schemes or issued for cash
as provided for by the Regulations.
The Chairmen of the Board and of its committees will be in
attendance at the annual general meeting to answer questions from
shareholders.
Auditor
The auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, is willing to continue in office. A
resolution will be put to the annual general meeting to re-appoint
the auditor and to authorise the Board to agree the auditor’s
remuneration.

proposed at the 2004 annual general meeting. The Chairman of the
Remuneration committee will be available to answer questions about
directors' remuneration at the annual general meeting.
Remuneration committee
At the commencement of 2003, the Remuneration committee
comprised David Bell (Chairman of the Committee), Alison
Carnwath, John Potter and Will Wyatt, being all of the independent
non-executive directors. On 4 March 2003, the membership of the
Committee was reviewed and reconstituted to comply with the
recommendation in the Higgs Report into the role and effectiveness
of non-executive directors that no one director should sit on all
three principal board committees. The result of that review was that,
with effect from 4 March 2003, the Remuneration committee
comprised David Bell (Chairman of the Committee), Alison
Carnwath and John Potter.
On 18 December 2003, the terms of reference of the Committee
were reviewed and updated to comply with the revised Combined
Code. Under its terms of reference, the Committee, on behalf of the
Board, determines the remuneration packages including bonus
arrangements, participation in incentive schemes, pension
contributions and all other benefits received by the executive
directors. In the event of the termination of employment of those
directors, the Committee would also determine any compensation
payments, after taking appropriate legal advice. The Committee also
makes recommendations to the Board, within its terms of reference,
on the framework of senior executive remuneration including terms
of service, pay structure, bonus and share incentive arrangements
and other benefits. 
The Chief Executive, Gareth Rhys Williams, attends meetings by
invitation of the Committee except when his remuneration is being
considered. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is
determined by the Board as a whole with the relevant non-executive
director abstaining when his or her remuneration is considered.
Remuneration policy
The executive directors’ remuneration comprises a basic salary
plus company and/or individual performance-related elements of
up to 100% of salary. Therefore, if they achieve maximum
performance in relation to the performance-related elements
of their remuneration, these elements will account for 50% of their
total remuneration. 
Remuneration packages are formulated to attract, retain and
motivate executive directors and senior executives of the quality
required, without being excessive, by reference to salary and benefit
surveys supplied by external sources. They take into account the
responsibilities involved, remuneration packages in comparable
companies that have similar international operations, relative
performance and both internal and external advice. Remuneration
and benefits reflect responsibility and market comparisons.
The notice period by the Company under the service contracts of
the executive directors is 12 months. The normal retirement age
of executive directors is 60. Basic salary is fully pensioned on a
funded basis. Executive directors' service contracts do not provide
for pre-determined amounts of compensation in the event of early
termination by the Company. The Committee's policy in the event
of early termination of employment is to mitigate compensation to
the fullest extent practicable.
The Committee believes that in certain specific circumstances it is
beneficial for an executive director to be encouraged to take up
external non-executive appointments. Remuneration received by a
director in respect of such external appointments would be retained
by the director.
The Committee currently has no intention of amending the above
stated policy for 2004 and future years, although it will be reviewed
from time to time.
When reviewing and determining executive and non-executive
directors’ remuneration, advice is sought and received from external
remuneration and benefit consultants and their various Remuneration report continued
surveys of remuneration and fees and also internally from the
Chief executive, Gareth Rhys Williams, and the Company secretary,
Roland Peate. Towers Perrin, which was formally appointed in early
2003, has, during the year, provided independent advice to the
Committee. In December 2003, the Committee received external
and internal advice on the salaries of the executive directors and of
the senior management team. 
Chairman and the other non-executive directors
The Chairman and the other non-executive directors do not have
service contracts but have letters of appointment. The initial
period of their appointments is normally three years and may, by
mutual consent and with the approval of the Nominations
committee and the Board, be extended for a further three years. 
In exceptional circumstances appointments may be extended
beyond six years, by mutual consent and with the approval of the
Nominations committee and the Board, if it is in the interests of
the Group to do so.
Executive directors
Executive directors’ remuneration comprises basic salary, bonus,
share incentives, company vehicle or cash allowance, fuel where a
company vehicle is provided, medical health insurance,
membership of the Group’s Executive Pension Scheme, life
assurance and additionally, for Gareth Rhys Williams, contributions
towards a permanent health arrangement and contributions paid by
the Company to a funded unapproved retirement benefits scheme.
It is the Company's policy to make provision for pensions for
executive directors in respect of their basic salaries (but not in
respect of annual bonuses or benefits) through funded retirement
benefit schemes. Up to the maximum salary level permitted by
Inland Revenue rules (the earnings cap), retirement benefits are
provided through an approved retirement benefit scheme, as shown
in the table entitled Pensions related remuneration. 
Gareth Rhys Williams, Chief executive, aged 42, is employed under
a service contract dated 23 November 2001. The notice period by
the Company under his contract is 12 months; notice by the
employee is 6 months. The Company may, in the event of
termination of employment, pay a sum in lieu of notice equal to
twelve months’ gross basic salary together with the gross value of
the other benefits that he is entitled to receive under his service
contract, but excluding pension contributions and any bonus. The
bonus arrangements for 2004 will be calculated on the basis that
100% relate to the achievement of operating profit targets. The
unexpired term of Gareth Rhys Williams’ service contract, to his
normal retirement date, is 18 years.
Alastair Hewgill, Finance director, aged 49, is employed under a
service contract dated 17 April 2002. The notice period by the
Company under his contract is 12 months; notice by the employee
is 6 months. The Company may, in the event of termination of
employment, pay a sum in lieu of notice equal to twelve months’
gross basic salary together with the gross value of the other benefits
that he is entitled to receive under his service contract, but
excluding pension contributions and any bonus. The bonus
arrangements for 2004 will be calculated on the basis that 100%
relate to the achievement of operating profit targets. The unexpired
term of Alastair Hewgill’s contract, to his normal retirement date, is
11 years.
Incentive arrangements
The current policy of the Remuneration committee is to make
annual awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to the executive
directors and the other members of the Executive Board and grants
of conventional share options to the Group’s senior management
immediately below the level of the Executive Board. Such awards
and grants are based on a proportion of salary. Participation in the
Deferred Bonus Plan is open to those employees who are members
of the Group’s bonus scheme and who receive a bonus. There are
currently no plans to make any further grants under the Premium
Option Plan. Invitations under the Group’s Sharesave arrangements
are usually made annually. This policy is reviewed at least annually
and may be revised from time to time. Such awards and grants take
into account the overall and flow limits advised by the Association of
British Insurers.
To align the rewards of executive directors and other senior
employees more closely with the objectives and interests of
shareholders, the performance conditions applicable to the Group’s
share option schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan are as set
out below and relate to increases in earnings per share over a
performance period. The performance condition applicable to the
Premium Option Plan is also shown below and relates to a
significant increase in the Company’s share price. There is no re-
testing of performance in respect of grants or awards. Monitoring
and measuring of the performance conditions take place at the end
of each year when the Company’s results have been audited and
again at the time of exercise of options and awards.
24 The Vitec Group Annual Report 2003 25
The Group currently has the following incentive schemes and plans
in place under which incentives may be granted:
2002 Executive share option scheme. This is an Inland Revenue
approved scheme. Executive directors and other senior employees
are selected to receive options over shares. Exercise of an option is
subject to growth in the Company’s earnings per share, excluding
exceptional or extraordinary items, exceeding the growth in the retail
prices index over a performance period. The percentage growth over
the retail prices index determines the proportion of the award that
may be exercised. Options are exercisable between the third and
the tenth anniversaries of their dates of grant.
Performance condition: If the percentage growth in the adjusted
earnings per share of the Company exceeds the percentage growth
in the retail prices index over the 3 year performance period by
3.0301% (the base target threshold), an option will become
exercisable in respect of one-third of the shares over which it
is held. Full vesting takes place when such growth over the
performance period is 9.2727% or greater. A sliding scale operates
for performance between the lower and upper thresholds. Options
lapse if the base target threshold is not achieved. There is no
re-testing of performance.
2002 Unapproved executive share option scheme. Executive directors
and other senior employees are selected to receive options over
shares. As with the 2002 Executive share option scheme, exercise
of an option is subject to growth in the Company’s earnings per
share, excluding exceptional or extraordinary items, exceeding the
growth in the retail prices index over a performance period. Options
are exercisable between the third and the tenth anniversaries of
their dates of grant.
Performance condition: The performance condition is identical in all
respects to the performance condition of the 2002 Executive share
option scheme set out above. There is no re-testing of performance.
Long term incentive plan. Under this plan, executive directors and
other senior employees are selected to receive awards over shares
that vest in whole or in part depending on the satisfaction of a
performance condition related to the growth in earnings per share
compared to the retail prices index over a performance period.
Performance condition: The performance condition attaching to
awards under the plan relate to increase in earnings per share. For
an award to vest in its entirety, the increase in earnings per share
over the performance period of 3 years must be not less than the
increase in the retail prices index plus 36% or more. For an award
to vest at its lowest level of 25%, the growth in earnings per share
over the performance period must be equal to the increase in the
retail prices index plus 9%. Awards lapse if the performance is
below 9%. Where growth is between 9% and 36% awards are
realisable on a straight-line basis.
Premium option plan. Under this plan, selected executive directors
and other senior employees receive options over shares that are
granted in the form of two tiers. The exercise price of the first tier is
set at 25% in excess of the share price immediately prior to the date
of grant; the exercise price of the second tier is set at 50% in excess
of that same share price. 
Performance condition: First tier options are only exercisable if the
average middle market price of the Company's shares increases to,
and remains in excess of, the option exercise price for a minimum
of 20 consecutive dealing days within three years of the date of
grant. Second tier options are only exercisable if the average middle
market price of the Company's shares increases to, and remains in
excess of, the option exercise price for a minimum of 20 consecutive
dealing days within five years of the date of grant. Each tier of
options lapses if the share price does not achieve the required
threshold within the relevant performance period. Subject to the
share price reaching the required threshold, options are exercisable
between the third and the tenth anniversaries of their dates of grant.
Deferred bonus plan. Under the plan, an eligible executive may defer
between 10% and 50% of his cash bonus in exchange for receiving
an award over shares in the Company with a value equivalent, at the
date of award, to the amount of the deferred bonus. An award may,
in normal circumstances, be exercised by a participant after 2
years. However, if exercise is deferred until after 3 years and the
executive remains employed by the Group, the participant is entitled
to receive additional shares equal in number to those comprised in
the award. 
Performance conditions: Bonuses received by participants, and
which may be deferred under the plan, are themselves subject to
demanding performance conditions linked to Company and/or
individual performance. The awards under the plan are not subject
to any further performance targets.
2002 Sharesave scheme and International plan. The Group also
operates a Savings related share option scheme in the UK and a
similar International plan in respect of overseas employees in certain
countries. The scheme and plan are open to all the Group’s
employees in those geographical areas who have the necessary
length of service. Under the scheme and plan participants contract
to save a set amount each month in return for which they receive an
option over a specified number of shares. At the end of the savings
period participants may exercise their options to buy shares in the
Company using their savings. Exercise is not subject to any
performance condition. Remuneration report continued
Five-year share price performance 1999-2003
Under the requirements of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002, the Company is required to include a graph
showing the Company’s performance compared to an appropriate

have been declared, paid and reinvested in the Company’s shares)
relative to the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Index for the five
year period 1999-2003, assuming an investment of £100. The
Engineering and Machinery Index is the broad market index that
includes the Company and comprises comparable companies.
The following information has been audited.

Notes
1. The principal benefits are a company car, fuel, medical insurance and life
assurance. In respect of Gareth Rhys Williams only, a cash payment of £1,200
per month in lieu of a company car and a contribution of £400 per month to a
permanent health arrangement are included in the figures shown for benefits.
Details of the directors’ emoluments and compensation for 2003
with comparatives for 2002 are set out in the table below:
2. Gareth Rhys Williams receives a pension-related bonus calculated at 16%
of his annual salary in excess of the pensions earnings cap.
3. Information on the termination payment in 2002 is set out below.
During the year the highest paid director was Gareth Rhys Williams
who received £359,033 (2002: £395,407(excluding the termination
payment made to a director during 2002)).
When termination payments are included, the highest paid director
in 2002 was Richard Green who received a total of £431,188
(£387,563 shown in the table above plus a gain of £43,625 on the
exercise of a share option). That total included payments in lieu of
salary, bonus, company car benefit, pension-related bonus and
contributions to Mr Green’s FURBS and represented the Company’s
mitigated liability, shortened to 15 months, under his service
contract. In addition, £5,340 was paid direct to Mr Green’s legal
adviser in respect of advice he received in connection with the
negotiation of his termination arrangements. Mr Green resigned as a
director on 13 May 2002. Remuneration report continued
Notes
1. In November 2001, a share price related cash bonus scheme was adopted
under which an award equivalent to an option over 142,857 shares, at a price of
£3.50 per share, was made to Gareth Rhys Williams. This was replaced on 
19 September 2002 by an equivalent option over 142,857 shares at the same
exercise price of £3.50 per share under the Rules of the (1996) Unapproved
Executive Share Option Scheme, the Scheme used as the comparable for the cash
bonus scheme. There is a transitional arrangement for the cash bonus scheme to
run in tandem with the share option. If, and to the extent that, the cash bonus is
not triggered by Mr Rhys Williams prior to the first occasion upon which he
becomes entitled to exercise the share option granted on 19 September 2002,
the cash bonus scheme will lapse and will be replaced by the share option.
2. Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in the Company’s share
option or share incentive schemes and consequently they do not hold any share
options or other share incentives.
3. The total gain on the exercise of options by the directors during 2003 was nil
(2002: £43,625) as no options were exercised.
4. The share price at the end of the year and the highest and lowest prices during
the year are shown on page 72.

contribution payments to FURBS as follows: Gareth Rhys Williams
£38,748 (2002: £36,780). Richard Green left the company on 30
June 2002 and therefore no payments have been made during
2003 to his FURBS. For the period from 1 January 2002 to the date
of his leaving on 30 June 2002 contributions totalled £8,548.

1 March 2004 Corporate social responsibility report
30 The Vitec Group
Last year the Group published its first detailed corporate social
responsibility report although it has been including an environmental
policy statement in its annual report for some years. This year the
Group has developed further its social responsibility awareness and
internal reporting of statistics. We plan to continue development,
and the inclusion of an environmental report, in the future.
The Group has for many years taken a caring and considerate
approach to social, environmental and ethical matters throughout
its operations worldwide and this will continue. The Group regards
compliance with all relevant laws and guidelines as important and
socially responsible.
The Group’s current system of risk management and control, which
includes social responsibility matters, is led by the heads of each of
the Group’s operations. Those people are responsible at local level
for complying with the relevant environmental regulations in all the
geographical areas in which they operate. They report to the Board
on such issues through the Group’s Finance director, who has
ultimate responsibility for such matters, as part of the Group’s
system of internal control and risk management reporting.
Overall the Group continues to believe that it has limited
environmental impact. However, we recognise that we have a
responsibility to understand the impact that our activities might
have at local, national and global level. These have been monitored
and assessed locally and solutions have been implemented as
appropriate according to best practice, local legal and other
requirements. However, we have now developed and implemented a
more consistent approach to adopt sound policies throughout all our
operations. As part of the implementation programme, we have put
in place more formal systems and procedures for identifying,
measuring, reviewing and reporting on social, environmental and
ethical matters. Group policies are in place in the key areas of
employment, environment, human rights, community impact and
involvement and relationships with suppliers, customers and other
stakeholders. These policies have been implemented at the centre
and within each operating entity. Specific responsibility for such
matters has been assigned to designated employees. Reviews by
local management take place at each Group location and reports
are made of the major risks in these areas. These reports identify
risks, the current measures being taken to control them and the
steps being taken to eradicate or minimise their effect in the future.
The compilation of statistics commenced last year and they are
being used to monitor improvements and for reporting purposes.
1. Employment
Policy
To comply with all relevant legislation and codes of practice relating
to employment, health and safety and equal opportunities. To
provide good quality working environments & facilities for employees
and training and development appropriate to each of their roles;
not to discriminate in any way; to take a flexible approach towards
family responsibilities to assist them in establishing an appropriate
work/life balance; to provide a competitive range of quality
employee benefits. To keep the workforce informed of major
events and developments within the Group.
Actions
Employment policies throughout the Group already reflect the policy
set out above.
We continue to recognise the importance of involvement,
motivation, training and development of our employees at all levels.
The importance of good communication and working relationships
is actively encouraged. During 2003 the Group’s website was
re-written and significantly enhanced. It now provides much more
useful information and includes a gallery containing photographs of
Group products. This helps investors, potential investors and
employees alike to understand and view the wide variety of
products available from Group companies.  
Our policy is to keep employees informed on matters relating to
their employment and on financial and economic factors affecting
the Group through management briefings, via the Group’s website
and by internal distribution of press releases and internal
announcements. This enables our employees to gain a better
understanding of our business objectives and their roles in achieving
them. Building and developing the skills, competencies, motivation
and teamwork of our people is key to achieving our business
objectives and to ensuring best practices throughout the Group.
The senior executives of the Group, including the Chief executive
and the Finance director, meet on a regular basis. In addition, the
managements of the operating units employ a wide variety of
consultation and briefing methods, including conferences, joint
committees, specific project teams and briefing groups.
The Group operates in many countries and our employment
policies, which are designed to meet local conditions and
requirements, are established on the basis of the best practices in Annual Report 2003 31
each country in which we operate. The Group’s wide geographical
spread provides some opportunities for employees to work either
short term or on secondment for longer periods of time at the
Group’s various locations.
Encouragement is given to all employees both in the UK and
overseas to participate in the Group's savings related share option
schemes under which options are granted to employees who enter
into contracts to save agreed amounts each month. Invitations
under the UK and the International schemes have been made
each year since the schemes were first introduced in 1984.
Ability and aptitude are the determining factors in the selection,
training, career development and promotion of all employees. If
an employee becomes disabled during his or her period of
employment, we will, if necessary and to the extent possible, adapt
the work environment to enable the employee to continue in his or
her current position or retrain the employee for duties suited to that
employee's abilities following disablement. It continues to be the
Group’s policy to consider applications for employment from
disabled people on the same basis as other potential employees.
Health and safety
Health and safety training is part of the induction process for new
employees. Specific training is given, where relevant, for forklift
truck, crane and hoist operation and bottle gas usage as well as fire
safety and first aid training.
Risk assessments were introduced during 2003 in various parts of
the Group and these are being phased into the other parts of the
Group. Assessments are being carried out on a regular basis and
also when new equipment or machinery is acquired or new
processes are introduced.
During 2003 the recording and reporting of accidents and related
lost time statistics has become formalised. The figures are reviewed
monthly and at each meeting of the Executive Board.
Workplace injuries and fatalities in 2003
Rate of non-fatal over 3-day
workplace injuries (Notes 1 and 2) 1,333

from work of more than 3 days.
2 The above rates are expressed per 100,000 employees, in line with the
normal reporting standard by the Health & Safety Executive.
2. Environment
Policy
To promote and improve throughout the Group the benefits of
efficient usage of energy and water.
Actions
Recycling processes have been in use in the Group for many years.
Recycled materials and those that minimise negative environmental
impacts are used wherever possible. A steadily increasing proportion
of the packaging, paper, toner cartridges and cartons used by the
Group’s operations is recycled after use and in many cases
biodegradable packaging is used.
It is in the interests of the environment and in the financial interests
of the Group to make the most efficient and responsible use of
energy. The practice of responsible resource and energy
management through reduced consumption and the
encouragement of energy and water efficiency is widespread
throughout the Group’s operations world-wide.
Developments during 2003 include:
Vinten continues to refine and develop its Environmental
Management System, taking into account appropriate best
practices. Vinten strives to improve consumption of materials in
all operations and to reduce, rather than have to dispose of, waste
wherever possible and to promote recycling and the use of recycled
materials. Vinten works in partnership with its suppliers to minimise
the impact of operations through a quality purchasing policy and
recycling through suppliers. They also use a recycling system that
covers paper, cans and plastic cups and have an on-going
water-efficiency programme.
Drake has introduced the use of standard thickness packaging by
switching from tri-wall to double-wall packing to reduce cardboard
use. The use of bespoke packaging has also reduced the use of
bubble wrap and polystyrene chippings. Drake aims to further
reduce the use of bubble wrap and polystyrene chippings by
increasing their use of bespoke packaging. Their new building 
in Cambridge is generally more energy efficient than their 
previous premises.
During 2004, Drake and Clear-Com plan to implement any actions
necessary to comply with the EU Directives on Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment and on the Restriction of Use of Certain
Hazardous Substances.
Anton/Bauer continues to be an active member of the battery
recycling scheme in conjunction with The Rechargeable Battery
Recycling Corporation. In 2003 they increased their recycling of
nickel cadmium batteries by 18% and of NiMH batteries by 50%
over 2002 figures. Anton/Bauer currently uses energy saving
lightbulbs in all areas but will be switching to lead free bulbs with a
low mercury content in 2004.  Corporate social responsibility report continued
During 2003 ALU switched to using cardboard from using a
chemical foam substance for its own packing requirements when
shipping products. This means that the cardboard may then be
recycled by the receiver of the shipment, whereas this was not
possible with the chemical foam packaging. ALU was disposed of
in December 2003 and so its operations have no continuing
environmental impact in the Group. 
OConnor continues to recycle the remnant ink from its printers and
photocopier, use energy saving lightbulbs, use electronic timers for
heating and air conditioning units, and to recycle all of its machine
cutting chips and scrap metal. OConnor’s hazardous waste materials
and liquids are collected by a waste management company for
disposal. Deburr particles are separated from process liquid by a
cyclonic separator and properly disposed of – the liquid is then
reused. All OConnor’s product packaging uses recycled materials.
The energy consumption figures for 2003 compared to those for
2002 (excluding the acquisitions in 2003) show a reduction in the
usage of gas and water. However, overall in 2003, the Group’s use
of electricity and water has risen when compared to 2002 due to
higher activity levels and the acquisition of OConnor and Radamec
Broadcast Systems in the early part of 2003. The Group’s use of gas
in 2003 has reduced. The target for future years is to reduce or, at
worst, maintain the ratio of energy consumption at the Group’s
current activity levels.
Any increase or decrease in activity levels in the future, and any
acquisition or disposal by the Group, would result in an increase or
decrease in the Group’s energy consumption.
3. Human rights
Policy
To comply with the laws and customs of each country in which we
operate. Not to use child labour. Not to discriminate in any way and
to give equal opportunities to all workers.
Actions
The above policy has been part of the Group’s approach for many
years. The Group’s operating companies are required to include it
as part of their employee policies and to comply.
4. Community impact and involvement
Policy
To contribute to local worthwhile causes and charities and to ensure
that the Group’s operations cause minimal negative impact within
the community.
Actions
For many years the Group has contributed to worthwhile causes.
Donations are usually, and have been in the past, primarily to
childrens, cancer, police, fire brigade, drug rehabilitation and other
similar charities. The Group’s charity committee reviews all written
requests for donations and decides on the level of donation and the
charities to which donations are made.
During 2003 donations were made to 20 charities. The amount
donated by the charity committee totalled £7,000 (2002: £6,998).
Like all companies, the Group has limited resources and the
amount of money available for charitable purposes varies from
time to time.
5. Relationships with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders
Policy
The Group recognises the obligations it has towards the parties with
whom it has business and other dealings such as its customers,
shareholders, employees, suppliers and advisers. Dealings with
those groups of people depend upon the honesty, integrity and
enthusiasm of its employees and every effort is made to ensure that
a high standard of expertise and business principles is maintained
in such dealings. Where appropriate, training is given to maintain
and to raise the standards.
Actions
As stated in the Directors’ report, the Group's policy with suppliers is
that individual subsidiary companies are responsible for negotiating
terms and conditions under which suppliers operate. Once agreed,
payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms
and conditions, subject always to the supplier having complied with
them. That policy has been in place for a number of years and will
continue for the financial year ending 31 December 2004. We
continue to review and take action where appropriate to ensure the
reliable and consistent sources of quality materials from which our
products are made.
In all our dealings, honesty and integrity continue to be paramount.
The Group’s brands are a highly valuable asset and every effort is
made to enhance their reputation for high quality, service and
reliability.

Annual Report 2003 33
The Listing Rules require a company to include in its annual report
and accounts a statement of how it has applied the principles set
out in Section 1 of the Combined Code (the "Code") together with
an explanation to enable its shareholders to evaluate how the
principles have been applied. The Listing Rules also require a
company to include a statement as to whether or not it has
complied throughout the accounting period with the Code
provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code. A company that has
not complied with the Code provisions, or complied with only some
of the Code provisions or (in the case of provisions whose
requirements are of a continuing nature) complied for only part
of an accounting period, must specify the Code provisions with
which it has not complied, and (where relevant) for what part of
the period such non-compliance continued, and give reasons for
such non-compliance.
The Code was revised in 2003 (the "new Code"). The new Code
supersedes the Code for listed companies with reporting years
beginning on or after 1 November 2003. However, the Company has
already taken steps to ensure that it complies with the main and the
supporting principles of the new Code and with its provisions.
Statement of compliance
The Board considers that it has complied with the Code throughout
the year ended 31 December 2003. The Company regularly reviews
and revises its procedures, as necessary, to take account of the
requirements of the Code and of the new Code.
The Board
The Board meets on average six times a year and there is a formal
schedule of matters and levels of authority which are delegated to
the executive directors, all other matters and powers being reserved
to the Board. 
Throughout the year the Board comprised four non-executive
directors and two executive directors. All the non-executive directors
are considered to be independent. Gareth Rhys Williams was a
director and the Chief executive throughout the year. Alastair Hewgill
was the Finance director throughout the year. During 2003 all the
directors attended all the Board meetings.
The directors bring independent judgement to bear on strategic
matters, the performance of the Group, the adequacy of resources
and standards of conduct. The roles of the Chairman (who is
non-executive) and of the Chief executive are separate and they
each have a clear written division of responsibilities approved by
the Board. David Bell is the senior independent director and his
biographical details are shown on page 19. Outside of Board
meetings, the non-executive directors maintain regular contact with
each other by telephone and usually meet prior to Board meetings.
The same pattern of contact outside of Board meetings is planned
to continue through 2004.
Directors, having notified the Chairman, are able to take
independent professional advice at the Company's expense in
furtherance of their duties. All new directors are given an extensive
introduction to the Group, including meeting with senior executives
and visiting the Group's principal operations both in the UK and
overseas. All directors have access to the advice and services of the
Group company secretary.
The papers supplied for consideration by the Board are provided on
a timely basis and include budgets, strategy papers, reviews of the
Group's financial position and operating performance and annual
and interim reports and accounts. Further information is supplied
from time to time as and when requested by the Board.
The Board has an Audit committee, a Remuneration committee
and a Nominations committee. Each committee has formal terms
of reference. The members of these committees are shown on
pages 18 and 19.
The terms of reference and the effectiveness of each committee
have been reviewed and changes have been made in the light of
the new Code. Individual director performance evaluation has also
taken place. In the case of the executive directors this evaluation
takes place regularly throughout the year against achievement of
specific objectives. Evaluation of the Chairman has been carried
out by the senior independent director. Evaluation of each of the
other non-executive directors has been carried out by the
Chairman. Each evaluation has been carried out by using written
questionnaires and has been discussed individually with each of
the relevant non-executive directors. Similar evaluations will take
place each year in the future.
Audit committee
The members of the Audit committee and their biographical
details are shown on pages 18 and 19. The committee is chaired
by John Potter. Each member of the committee is required to be
independent. The Company’s external auditor is invited to attend
meetings of the committee on a regular basis. During 2003 the
committee met 3 times. One of those meetings was with the auditor,
without the executive directors being present. This will continue in
the future.
Duties of the committee:
Financial Reporting
Monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Company,
including its annual and interim reports, preliminary results’
announcements and any other formal announcement relating to its

Nominations committee
The members of the Nominations committee and their biographical
details are set out on pages 18 and 19. The committee is chaired by
Will Wyatt. The committee is delegated authority by the Board to
deal with succession planning and making recommendations to the
Board on all new Board appointments. During 2003, the committee
met formally on one occasion.
Duties of the committee:
• regularly review the structure, size and composition (including 
the skills, knowledge and experience) required of the Board in 
the future compared to its current position and make

36 The Vitec Group Annual Report 2003 37
Appointments and re-elections to the Board
The Chairman and the other non-executive directors are appointed
for an initial period of three years which, with the approval of the
Nominations committee and the Board, would normally be
extended for a further three years. In exceptional circumstances,
appointments of non-executive directors may be extended beyond
six years, with the approval of the Nominations committee and the
Board, if it is in the interests of the Group to do so. 
Under the Company's articles of association, each director is
required to be re-elected at the third annual general meeting
following that at which he or she was last elected or re-elected.
A new non-executive director, Nigel Moore, was appointed on 
1 March 2004. Mr Moore has also been appointed as a member 
of the Audit committee and it is intended that he will take over the
chairmanship of that committee in September. Mr Moore will be
proposed for election at the 2004 annual general meeting.
Alison Carnwath, the Chairman, and David Bell, the senior
independent director, both of whom are non-executive, have now
served for eight years and seven years, respectively. They have
significant business experience and detailed knowledge of the
Group and have been asked, and have agreed, to continue in their
current roles for a further period. However, as referred to in the
Chairman’s statement, a search process is taking place for a
successor to the Chairman with a view to making an appointment
during 2004.
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining regular contact
with its shareholders to ensure that its businesses, strategy and
remuneration policies are understood and that any concerns are
addressed in a constructive way. The Board communicates with its
shareholders through a combination of public announcements
through the Stock Exchange, analyst briefings and press interviews
at the time of the announcements of the interim and the full year
results and, when appropriate, at other times in the year. The
executive directors also meet with investors from time to time during
the year. The annual general meeting offers a further opportunity for
the directors to meet with shareholders.
At meetings of shareholders, the level of proxy votes received,
together with the numbers of votes in favour, against and abstaining,
is announced after each resolution has been dealt with on a show of
hands. Separate resolutions are proposed for each issue upon
which shareholders are asked to vote.
The Company has complied with the requirement set out in the
Code in respect of shareholders' meetings to send the notice of
annual general meeting and related papers at least 20 working days
before the meeting. It will continue to comply with the requirement.
Internal control and risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Group's system of internal control
to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the company’s assets
(Code principle D.2). As part of its responsibility, the Board reviews
the effectiveness of its internal controls. The Group has systems and
procedures for internal control that are designed to provide
reasonable control over the activities of the Group and to enable the
Board to fulfil its legal responsibility for the keeping of proper
accounting records, safeguarding the assets of the Group and
detecting fraud and other irregularities. However, it is recognised
that it is in the nature of any business that business and commercial
risks must be taken and that for a business to succeed, enterprise,
initiative and the motivation of employees are key elements that
must not be unduly stifled. It is not the intention of the Group to
avoid all commercial risks and commercial judgements will have to
be made in the course of the management of the business.
Since its implementation of the recommendations of the Cadbury
Committee Code of Best Practice through the guidance published
by the Working Group on Internal Control in December 1994, the
Board has adopted a risk-based approach to establishing the
system of internal control. The application of Code principle D.2 and
the process followed by the Board in reviewing the effectiveness of
the system of internal control during the year (Code provision D.2.1)
is as follows:
• operating company management is charged with the
ongoing responsibility for identifying risks facing each of the 
businesses and for putting in place procedures to monitor and 
manage risks.
• the responsibilities of the chief executive officer and chief 
financial officer at each operating unit to manage risks within 
their businesses are periodically reinforced by Group executive 
management.
• major commercial, technological and financial risks are formally 
assessed during the annual long-term business planning process 
around mid-year. These plans and the attendant risks are 
reviewed by the Board.
• large capital projects, product development projects and 
acquisitions require Board approval.
• the process by which the Board reviews the effectiveness of 
internal control has been agreed by the Board and 
documented. This involves bi-annual reviews by the Board, of 
the major business risks of the Group together with the controls 
in place to manage those risks as reported to the Board by the 
chief executives of each division. In addition, at the end of each 
year, businesses formally review, in detail, all of their business 
risks and their internal controls, including finance, cash, IT, sales,
purchasing and logistics. They then prepare statements that 
describe the extent of their compliance with control objectives. 
These statements are approved by the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of each operating unit and submitted to 
Group executive management for review. Any significant matters 
arising from this review are formally reported to the Board by the 
Finance director. The risk and control identification and 
certification process is monitored and periodically reviewed by 
group financial management.
• The Board has established a control framework within which the 
Group operates. This contains the following key elements:
• organisational structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility, delegation of authority and reporting 
requirements.
• defined expenditure authorisation levels. Corporate governance continued
• on-site and telephone conferencing operations reviews covering
all aspects of each business are conducted by Group executive 
management on a regular basis throughout the year.
• comprehensive system of financial reporting. The annual 
budget and long term plan of each operating company are 
reviewed in detail and approved by the executive directors. 
The Board approves the overall Group's budget and plans. 
Monthly actual results are reported against prior year and 
monthly budgets. Forecasts are revised where necessary but 
formally at least once every quarter. Any significant changes 
and adverse variances are questioned by the Group executive 
directors and remedial action is taken where appropriate. 
Group tax and treasury is co-ordinated centrally. There is 
weekly cash and treasury reporting to Group financial 
management and periodic reporting to the Board on the 
Group's tax and treasury position.
The Board considers that it has fully complied during the year and
up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts with
the Code provision D.2.1 as set out in the Guidance for Directors on
the Combined Code, published by the Internal Control Working Party
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
The Group does not have an internal audit function. However, the
need for such a function is regularly reviewed (Code provision
D.2.2). The current conclusion of the Board is that an internal audit
function is not required given the scale, diversity and complexity of
the Group's activities. Where required, third party audit consultants,
independent from the companies’ external auditors, are used on
specific assignments. The Company believes it can access
professional ‘internal audit’ support in the relevant country more
effectively than by having an internal department. Two such
outsourced audits took place in 2003.
Going concern
The directors have made appropriate enquiries and consider that the
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the directors continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements
for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss for
that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and the 
group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
38 The Vitec Group Independent auditor’s report to the members
of The Vitec Group plc
Annual Report 2003 39
We have audited the financial statements on pages 40 to 70.
We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration
report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the company and the company’s members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and
the directors’ remuneration report. As described on page 38, this
includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are
established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices
Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and by
our profession’s ethical guidance. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is
not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the group is not disclosed. 
We review whether the statement on page 33 reflects the company’s
compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or
its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report,
including the corporate governance statement and the unaudited
part of the directors’ remuneration report, and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by
the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements and the part
of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the company and the group as at 31 December 2003 
and of the profit of the group for the year then ended; and 
• the financial statements and the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Net operating expenses and cost of sales in the year ended 31 December 2002 have been restated following the re-categorisation to cost of sales of £5.3 million of variable 
warehouse and service costs within the Broadcast Services Division and £1.1 million of exchange gains previously classified as net operating expenses.
(2)
Net operating expenses in the year ended 31 December 2002 included £5.8 million of exceptional restructuring costs and £0.9 million of goodwill amortisation.
(3)
Adjusted basic earnings per share is presented as the Directors consider that this gives valuable additional information about the ongoing earnings performance of the Group.
There is no material difference between the Group's profit and loss account and the historical cost profit and loss account. Accordingly, no note of the historical cost 
profit and loss for the period has been presented.

Annual Report 2003 43 Notes to the accounts
44 The Vitec Group
1 Basis of presentation
The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheets include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up
to 31 December 2003. The accounts have been prepared in accordance with all applicable accounting standards under the historical cost
convention modified to include the revaluation of certain land and buildings.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of consolidation. The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are included in the accounts up to, or from, the date that
control passes, unless otherwise stated. 
For acquisitions which were made prior to 1 January 1998, the differences between the fair value of the consideration paid for investments
in subsidiaries or businesses and the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition was treated as purchased goodwill and was
written off directly against reserves.
For acquisitions made on or after 1 January 1998, purchased goodwill arising from the differences between the fair value of the consideration
paid and the fair value of the net assets acquired, as at the date of acquisition is capitalised in the balance sheet as an intangible asset. This
purchased goodwill is being charged to the profit and loss account through amortisation on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life up
to a maximum of 20 years.
Impairment tests are carried out on the purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions that occurred in the preceding year or when a triggering
event occurs. Where necessary, provision is made for any impairment that has arisen.
Upon the disposal of businesses which have become part of the Group by acquisition, purchased goodwill previously written off to reserves, or
the unamortised portion of purchased goodwill remaining in the balance sheet as an intangible asset, is written off to the profit and loss account.
Turnover. Turnover, which excludes value added tax and sales between Group companies, represents the value of products and services
sold. Other than for long term contracts, the treatment of which is set out seperately below, revenue arising from product sales is recognised
when title passes to the customer which is upon delivery of the product.
Revenue arising from asset rental is recognised over the duration of the rental contract at the gross amount billed to the customer, where we
act as principal in the rental transaction.
Long term contracts. The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long term contract is recognised when the outcome of
the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Turnover for such contracts is stated at cost appropriate to the stage of completion
plus attributable profits, less amounts recognised in previous years. Provision is made for any losses as soon as they are foreseen. 
Contract work in progress is stated at costs incurred, less those transferred to the profit and loss account, after deducting foreseeable losses
and payments on account not matched with turnover.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in debtors and represent turnover recognised in excess of payments on account.
Foreign currencies. Transactions in foreign currencies with overseas customers and suppliers are converted at the average rates for the
months in which transactions occur. Profits and losses arising from the difference between these rates and contracted rates on forward
exchange contracts, which are set up as hedges against such sales and purchases, are recorded in cost of sales. Foreign trading profits and
cash flows are translated at the average rates for the year. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rates and the gains or
losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account. Differences on translation of investments in overseas companies are taken
directly to reserves.
Research and development. Expenditure on the Group's research and development projects is generally charged to the profit and loss account
in the year in which it is incurred. In certain specialised cases where a development project meets clearly defined criteria and the commercial
outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty, development expenditure is capitalised. Such capitalised expenditure is amortised over the
life of the project.
Investments. Fixed asset investments are stated individually at cost less, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value. Current asset
investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes, where appropriate, accrued interest.
Fixed assets and depreciation. Depreciation is provided at rates estimated to write off the cost or valuation of the relevant assets less their
estimated residual values by equal annual amounts over their expected useful lives. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Other fixed
assets are depreciated at the rates indicated below:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2
1
/ 2% – 5% on cost or valuation
Short leasehold property over the remaining period of the lease
Plant and machinery 12
1
/ 2%– 25% on cost
Motor vehicles 25% – 33
1
/ 3% on cost
Equipment, fixtures & fittings 10% – 33
1
/ 3% on cost
Rental equipment 20% – on cost Annual Report 2003 45
Fixed assets are stated at cost except that, as allowed under FRS 15 ‘Tangible Fixed Assets’, on adoption of that Standard in the year ending
31 December 2000 when the book amounts of revalued land and buildings were retained. These book values are based on the previous
revaluation on 31 March 1989 and have not been subsequently revalued.
Stock and work in progress. Stock and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less progress payments. 
Cost includes materials, direct labour and production overheads incurred in bringing stocks and work in progress to their present location
and condition.
Capital instruments are stated in the balance sheet after the deduction of issue costs, which are charged to the profit and loss account over
the term of the debt.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the instrument. Cash flows
associated with derivative financial instruments are classified in the cash flow statement in a manner consistent with those of the
transactions being hedged.
Deferred tax. The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account tax deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. Full provision for deferred tax is made, on an un-discounted basis,
where there is an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Pension costs. The costs of providing pensions for employees under defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss
account over the working lives of the employees in accordance with the recommendations of qualified actuaries. Any funding surpluses or
deficits that may arise are amortised over the average working life of the employees but surpluses may first be used to improve members'
benefits. The costs of providing pensions for employees under state and other defined contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”. This Standard replaces use of actuarial values for assets in a pension scheme in favour of a market-based
approach. In order to cope with the volatility inherent in this measurement basis, the Standard requires that the profit and loss account
shows the relatively stable ongoing service cost, interest cost and expected return on assets. Fluctuations in market values and changes in
actuarial assumptions are reflected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. The Group has continued to account for pensions
and other post employment benefits in accordance with SSAP 24 but has complied with the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS 17.
Employee share schemes. The costs of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares (including conditional rights) are
recognised over the periods to which the employees' performance relates. No cost is recognised in respect of SAYE schemes that are offered
on similar terms to all or substantially all employees.
Leases. Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis.
Assets held for short-term rentals are recorded as plant and machinery within fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Rental income from these assets is recognised as earned on a straight-line basis over the rental periods.

A significant proportion of the Group's operating profits will continue to be earned in countries with a higher rate of tax than in the UK.
No deferred tax has been recognised on tax losses of £11.2 million (2002: £8.0 million) as these are not expected to be utilised in the
foreseeable future. Annual Report 2003 51

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on profit after tax of £5.5 million (2002: £7.5 million) and on the weighted average
number of shares in issue during the year of 41,034,098 (2002: 41,008,348).
Adjusted basic earnings per share is presented as the directors consider that this gives a useful additional indication of the ongoing 
earnings performance of the Group.
This calculation is based on profit after tax but before exceptional items and amortisation and impairment of goodwill. In 2003 this profit 
was £9.7 million (2002: £14.0 million).

The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on profit after tax of £5.5 million (2002: £7.5 million).
The number of shares used to calculate the diluted earnings per share incorporates the weighted average number of shares in issue
41,034,098 (2002: 41,008,348) and the number of shares under option of 2,608,381 (2002: 2,678,405), shares from the total of potential
Long Term Incentive Plan awards of 447,209 (2002: 404,560), contingently issuable, and shares issuable under the Deferred Bonus Plan of
63,709 (2002: 20,127), as adjusted for a weighting factor between the average exercise prices of the share options and the average market
price of the Company’s shares during 2003. The number of shares used for the calculation is 41,198,148 (2002: 41,022,262).

The holding company for the USA subsidiaries, issued in 1993 via a private placement, US$40 million of 6.72% unsecured Senior Notes
2003 guaranteed by the Company. The notes were repaid in equal installments over 7 years commencing in 1997. The final instalment was
paid in September 2003. 
Concurrent with the drawdowns under the notes, the Company entered into 10 year US dollar/sterling interest rate swap agreements with
banks whereby US$15 million of fixed rate obligations were exchanged for obligations of £10.1 million at interest rates linked to LIBOR. The
obligations under the swap agreements were amortised in line with the underlying notes.
Certain foreign currency loans in Italy amounting to £0.3 million at 31 December 2002 were secured on the land and buildings of subsidiary

(d) Foreign exchange hedging
Cost of sales include net gains of £2.9 million (2002: £1.1 million) arising from the difference between the exchange rates at which foreign
currency transactions are converted and the contracted rates on the forward exchange rate contracts, set up as hedges against such
transactions. When compared with their values at the exchange rates in effect on 31 December 2003, the cumulative unrecognised
aggregate gain on forward exchange rate contracts as of 31 December 2003 is £1.6 million (2002: £2.6 million). All of these unrecognised
gains relate to the year 2004. Because these contracts are put in place to hedge a portion of the underlying transactions, any net gain or
loss that may arise on these contracts over the forthcoming year will be more than compensated by the corresponding transactional gains 
or losses.
During the year forward option contracts selling US Dollars and purchasing Euros were taken out, covering the period August 2004 to June
2005. These totalled £8.4 million and the unrecognised gains on these options at 31 December 2003, based on the exchange rates on that
date, were £0.7 million. The Group’s foreign exchange hedging policy is set out in the Financial Review.
(e) Currency profile
The main functional (or “operating'') currencies of the Group are Sterling, US$ and Euro. The following analysis of net monetary assets and
liabilities, excluding cash and borrowings, shows the Group's currency exposures after applying the effects of forward contracts used to
manage currency exposure. Such net positions comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the
functional currency of the operating units involved.

Leasing commitments at 31 December 2002 comprised £3.9 million of land and buildings and £0.1 million of other commitments expiring between two and five years.
26 Pension commitments
During the year, the Group operated two funded defined benefit pension schemes set up under separate trusts and open to eligible
employees. The Company pays contributions to the fund in order to provide security for existing pensions and the accrued benefits of
current and former employees. At the end of the year, the Group closed both schemes to new members.
The adequacy of the schemes to meet the projected benefits is assessed by independent qualified actuaries at regular intervals. The most
recent actuarial valuations of the schemes, based on the projected unit method, were as at 5 April 2001. The schemes had assets with a
combined market value (excluding the value of insurance policies) of £28.0 million at that date.  On the basis of the assumptions adopted,
the value of the schemes' assets was equal to 108 per cent of the value placed on the benefits that had accrued to members allowing for
expected future increases in salaries. The surpluses arising are being spread over 14 years by way of variation from regular cost using the
straight-line method. 
The most significant actuarial assumptions were: investment return of 6.1% per annum in respect of liabilities for active members, and
5.1% per annum in respect of liabilities for deferred and current pensioners; price inflation of 2.5% per annum; general salary inflation of
4.5% per annum; pension increases of 2.5% per annum.
Company contributions to the schemes amounted to £0.8 million (2002: £0.7 million) for the year. On this basis, the pension charge for
2003 has been calculated as £0.9 million (2002: £0.8 million). There is a prepayment of £0.8 million (2002: £0.9 million) included in the
balance sheet, being the excess of the accumulated company pension contributions paid to the schemes over the amount charged to the
profit and loss account.
The disclosures required in relation to the transitional arrangements within FRS17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ have been based on the most
recent formal actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2001, updated to 31 December 2003, but using the following financial assumptions for the
purpose of FRS17:
Year ended 31 December
Price inflation 2.75 2.25
General salary and wage inflation 4.75 4.25
Increases to pensions in payment (in excess of GMPs) 2.75 2.25
Increases to deferred pensions 2.75 2.25

The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the
timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the schemes' assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change
before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes' liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long time periods and
thus are inherently uncertain.

The amount of the net pension liability would have a consequential effect on reserves. The assets and liabilities shown for the Vitec Group
Executive Pension Scheme include an amount of £0.5 million (2002: £0.5 million) in respect of certain insurance policies which meet part
of the benefit entitlement for some pensioners in the Scheme. The value placed on these insurance policies is in addition to the value of the
scheme’s investments.

2003 has seen significant progress on our ‘Consolidate-Leverage-
Grow’ strategy. While the emphasis has been on consolidation,
the benefits of our recent investments in R&D are beginning to
come through with continuing volume growth in Photographic
and encouraging projects in Broadcast. 
Despite falling TV audience figures in the US, there are signs of
an upturn in advertising there. In addition, photographic demand
remains strong and we expect this to continue during 2004.
However, we expect currency movements to continue to have 
a negative effect on the Group.

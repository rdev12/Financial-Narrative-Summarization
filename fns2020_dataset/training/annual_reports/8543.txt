Strategic report
■ Local knowledge, international sales  ■ Focus on emerging markets
What we do
ITE is an organiser of business 
to business (B2B) exhibitions and 
conferences specialising in emerging 
and developing markets. ITE 
organises high-quality events of an 
international standard throughout 
the 18 countries in which it operates. 
As an exhibition organiser, ITE 
hires venues at which it stages 
its events and markets the events 
to both exhibitors and visitors. 
Exhibitions and conferences provide 
an opportunity for participants 
from national and international 
companies to meet, network 
and transact business.
ITE’s principal business of organising 
B2B trade exhibitions accounts 
for 97% of the Group’s revenues. 
Conferences account for circa 
2% of the Group’s revenues and 
other activities relating to the 
core exhibition business (mostly 
publishing) account for 1% of revenue. 
Why we do it
The exhibition media is the best 
media for suppliers to display and 
demonstrate their products to 
potential buyers. This is particularly 
powerful in emerging and developing 
markets where face to face meetings 
are the cultural norm and where 
alternative media, B2B publishing 
and online marketing opportunities 
are less developed. 
How we do it
ITE’s strength derives from its focus 
on organising B2B exhibitions and 
conferences, the development of 
strong brands in key industry sectors 
and the regional expertise in the 
markets in which it operates. ITE 
has been operating in these markets 
for approaching 20 years and its 
experience and local knowledge 
are unique.
ITE’s sector brands are a key asset. 
The brands have been established 
through a sustained record of 
presenting high quality events which 
meet customer expectations. ITE 
events serve key industries including 
Construction & Interiors, Oil & Gas, 
Food & Drink, Travel & Leisure, 
Transport & Logistics, Security and 
Protection, Fashion and Beauty.
ITE has an extensive office network, 
covering both the territories where 
our events are held and international 
sales offices in other countries. ITE is 
able to operate at national level where 
local staff are close to local industry 
trends, and at an international level 
where our sales teams are in regular 
communication with key industry 
suppliers in our sectors. The Group 
has 31 offices across the world, each 
of them employing almost exclusively 
local staff.
The offices of the Group co-operate 
in a unique way. Each office sells its 
own exhibitions, but participates with 
equal levels of commitment in the 
exhibitions organised by other offices. 
This holistic approach has been 
carefully cultivated through the years 
and enables ITE’s business to follow 
long-established trading patterns.

Our business in 
a global context
The global exhibition market was 
estimated to be worth circa US$24 
billion in 2013, a 4% increase on 2012. 
The graph to the right sets out the 
distribution of the world’s exhibition 
business and shows that developed 
markets continue to account for the 
majority of the global market. However, 
emerging markets have increased their 
share of the global market and now 
account for over one third of the total. 
Russia, Turkey and the CIS countries 
– ITE’s core market area – account 
for approximately 6% of the global 
market, whilst Asian markets (China, 
India and South East Asia) account for 
approximately 10%. During 2013 China 
overtook the UK to become the world’s 
third largest exhibition market.
The graph to the right illustrates 
that emerging markets grew more 
quickly than developed markets during 
2013. A metric commonly used to 
illustrate future growth prospects is 
the share that an exhibitions market 
has of GDP. Based on this metric, India 
and China have the most substantial 
growth potential amongst exhibition 
markets worth US$200 million or 
more. Growth is expected to be led by 
both price increases, on the back of 
growing professionalism and increased 
international participation, and square 
metres increases, as new venue 
capacity comes on stream.
ITE was the fifth largest organiser in 
the world by revenue in 2013, and the 
third largest in emerging markets. ITE 
remains the largest exhibition organiser 
in Russia by some distance, with an 
estimated market share of 22%. Strong 
prices and a highly internationalised 
outlook mean that in the medium to 
long term, Russia continues to be an 
attractive market. ITE’s position in 
Central Asian markets is even stronger, 
where it is the dominant international 
exhibition organiser. The market in 
Turkey is more fragmented but ITE 
retains its position as the leading 
international exhibition organiser, 
with 7% of the market.
With good potential for long-term 
growth in its core markets, a key part 
of ITE’s strategy is to ensure it retains 
and builds upon its leading positions 
in these markets. In addition, ITE aims 
to apply the free cash flow from its 
exhibition business to expanding its 
business model to new markets where 
there is good potential for growth. 
Recent investments in Turkey, South 
East Asia and China are all designed to 
enable ITE to participate in the strong 
growth expected in these regions. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Build and strengthen existing 
market leadership
ITE’s existing positions of market leadership are founded 
on its ability to generate international sales, its recognised 
brands, its local office infrastructure and its long-standing 
relationships with venues. ITE targets new sectors and 
regions within its existing markets where there is potential 
to increase the participation of international exhibitors.
The Group has established a loyal customer base and a 
geographic reach which is increasingly valuable as it seeks 
to leverage its sales into new markets. In 2014 the Group’s 
international sales offices once again sold 132,000m
2
 which 
represents circa 25% of the Group’s 2014 revenues.
In its core markets ITE has supported the development 
of venue facilities which in turn has helped the Group’s 
exhibitions to prosper. Most of ITE’s major events have 
agreements which provide for venue facilities for at least 
three years ahead. This year ITE has provided funding to its 
key venues in Moscow and Istanbul in return for rights over 
future venue use and advantageous pricing arrangements 
through long-term agreements.

Leverage our business model into

In existing markets this strategy means targeting 
new sectors and regions in which to acquire or develop 
businesses where there is potential for the participation 
of international exhibitors. In new markets, ITE is targeting 
the development of exhibition businesses where there 
is clear opportunity for strong future growth.
During the year, ITE has built on the business base in 
Asia that was established in 2013. The most significant 
acquisition in the year was the purchase of a 50% stake 
in the Chinacoat – Surface Finishing event, the leading 
coatings and finishings exhibition in China and South 
East Asia, in November 2013. The 2013 event, which took 
place shortly after ITE acquired its interest, sold 34,500m
2
 
in the year. The Group also acquired a 50% stake in 
Indobuildtech, the leading construction event in Indonesia 
which has significant potential to grow as new venue 
capacity becomes available over the next four years.

Brand

Grow and develop our portfolio 
of international brands
ITE has established strong brand identity in certain 
exhibition sectors. ITE aims to ensure that new launches 
and acquisitions are aligned with existing brands in these 
sectors. ITE is also working to enhance and extend its 
existing brand identities, as well as developing brand 
identities in other sectors.
ITE has continued to strengthen its existing brands and 
improve international recognition of its local brands. As 
part of this, the industry vertical groupings established 
in 2013 have been strengthened through investments 
in the management team and focused marketing to 
ensure consistency of presentation and message 
across the Group.
ITE is continuing to develop its brand portfolios and the 
acquisition of Beauty Eurasia in October 2013 has been an 
important addition to the Group’s growing Beauty sector.

ITE is aware that its success is dependent on its people. 
As such, ITE is committed to investing in staff development

The Group has continued its programme of developing

to them to grow into future leaders, a Leadership 
Development Programme for our senior managers, 
and a rolling programme of development conferences, 
last year for Event Directors and this year by industry.
Communications have continued to improve, with a high 
level of usage of the intranet and newsletter and more 
co-operation by cross border industry groups. We will be 
conducting an Employee Engagement Survey later in the 
year, of which a major part will be how we communicate.   ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Group performance
These results reflect a good underlying 
trading performance in most of our 
markets. ITE has reported revenues 
of £175 million (2013: £192 million), 
and record headline profits before 
tax of £60 million (2013: £59 million) 
for the 2014 financial year. The 
political upheaval in Ukraine and the 
relative strength of Sterling against 
our principal trading currencies have 
had a significant impact on the year’s 
results and held back what would 
have otherwise been an even stronger 
financial and operating performance. 
Importantly, the Group has continued 
its strategy to diversify its business 
interests into Asia with the acquisition 
of 50% interests in the Chinacoat 
exhibition and the Indonesian 
construction event representing first 
steps in China and Indonesia. The 
acquisition of Beauty Eurasia in Turkey 
and the majority interest in Scoop, the 
Group’s London womenswear fashion 
business, have both helped to build 
on our industry positions in growth 
sectors. In this, the Group’s lesser 
biennial year, headline diluted earnings 
per share was 20.2p (2013: 19.3p). 
Reported pre-tax profit was £41.5 
million (2013: £43.9 million) and fully 
diluted earnings per share was 13.8p 
(2013: 14.0p). The Group finished the 
year with net debt of £15 million (2013: 
cash of £23 million), after investing £50 
million on acquisitions during the year.
Board and management
Mike Hartley stepped down from 
the Board at last year’s AGM, having 
handed over his duties as Audit 
Committee Chairman to Stephen 
Puckett who joined the Board last 
year. Edward Strachan, who has 
been an executive Director since 
2003, stepped down from the Board 
on 1 April 2014, but remains a key 
member of ITE’s management team 
as a Regional Director for certain 
territories in Central Asia which he 
originally established for the Group. 
Sharon Baylay was appointed to the 
Board as a non-executive Director on 
1 April 2014. She brings a wealth of 
international marketing, branding and 
communications expertise together 
with a strong understanding of digital 
marketing from her career at Microsoft 
and the BBC. I would like to express my 
gratitude to both Mike and Edward for 
their contributions to the Board over 
the last decade.
ITE is first and foremost a people 
business and its success is based upon 
the hard work and loyalty of its staff 
worldwide. The Group has over 1,000 
employees conducting its business in 
31 offices in 18 different countries with 
a broad range of cultural backgrounds, 
all co-operating with each other and 
participating in the development of 
ITE. Almost 50% of our staff have been 
employees of ITE for more than five 
years, and 54% are participants in one 
of our equity schemes. As Chairman 
I would, on behalf of the Board, 
like to thank and acknowledge the 
contribution of all of ITE’s employees 
to this year’s result and especially 
those staff in Ukraine who have worked 
under very difficult circumstances. 
ITE’s Board recognises that good 
corporate governance is in the long-
term interests of the Group and we 
are conscious of our responsibilities 
for setting values which underpin 
the Group culture. As Chairman, I am 
mindful of my personal responsibility 
for leading the Board and ensuring it 
operates diligently and effectively. 
Dividend
ITE’s growth has supported a 
consistent increase in annual dividends. 
This year the interim dividend was 
increased from 2.3p to 2.5p and 
the proposed final dividend is 4.9p, 
making a full dividend for the year of 
7.4p (2013: 7.0p). This is an increase in 
dividend of circa 6%, in line with the 
underlying earnings growth in headline 
profits over the biennial cycle. The final 
dividend is proposed for payment on 
10 February 2015.
Outlook
In the year ending 30 September 
2014 the Group enjoyed good trading 
conditions in its major markets for 
most of the first half of the year. 
The political crisis in Ukraine and the 
consequent sanctions imposed on 
Russia have increasingly changed the 
economic and trading environment in 
those countries over the second half 
of the year. Currency movements have 
also had a significant effect on the 
financial result for 2014 with Sterling 
being on average 20% stronger 
against the Ruble and having also 
appreciated against other emerging 
market currencies. Both these issues 
continue to affect the outlook for the 
next financial year. At 27 November 
revenues booked for FY 2015 were 
£81 million representing circa 51% of 
market expectations for the full year. 
Like-for-like revenues are circa 17% 
behind this time last year, and 9% 
behind at constant currency. 
ITE’s results remain sensitive to the 
economic climate in Russia which 
remains its largest market but with 
strong market positions the Group is 
well positioned to respond positively 
to any future improvement in the 
economies of its markets. ITE also 
enjoys increasingly good growth 
prospects in many of its other markets 
and its portfolio of leading events 
continue to perform well. Management 
will continue to review the Group’s 
cost base to ensure that it has the 
most efficient structure to execute 
its strategy of growing its business 
and diversifying its sensitivity to the 
circumstances of any one region. ITE 
is well equipped to achieve these 
objectives through its strong balance 
sheet and good operating cash flow. 
Accordingly the Board has confidence 
in the Group’s future prospects.

The Group’s performance this year
ITE has delivered a good performance 
this year with the underlying business 
delivering a solid improvement in 
constant currency revenue and profits. 
However on account of the relative 
strength of Sterling against our 
principal trading currencies and the 
political upheaval in Ukraine, the Group 
is reporting lower revenues this year. 
Despite these circumstances the Group 
has reported an increase in headline 
profits before tax to £60.3 million. 
The Ukrainian business reported profits 
£2.6 million down from last year, and 
movements in foreign exchange had a 
further £4.0 million net negative effect 
on headline profits. However excluding 
Ukraine, ITE’s recurring events 
performed strongly, growing constant 
currency profits by £5.9 million, and 
profits were further enhanced by a first 
time contribution from acquisitions of 
£4.7 million. This was a smaller biennial 
year, and the net contribution from 
biennial events and timing differences 
this year was £3.1 million less than 
in the previous year.
The year started well with good 
trading conditions across most of 
our markets resulting in a strong 
first quarter financial performance. 
However the second quarter saw the 
onset of political instability and conflict 
in Eastern Ukraine. Subsequently, 
sanctions imposed by the West on 
Russia and the ensuing deterioration 
in the Russian Ruble began to affect the 
Russian economy, firstly affecting the 
viability of import related businesses into 
Russia. Subsequently the construction 
sector across all the Group’s Russian 
offices was impacted, and latterly the 
indications are of a more widespread 
effect on other sectors. The Ukrainian 
office reported a 50% reduction in 
square metres sold over the year, and 
like-for-like trading volumes in Russia 
were down 4% over the year. The Central 
Asian business was a highlight growing 
like-for-like volumes by 7% overall, led 
by a very strong performance from the 
Azerbaijan business. The Turkish and 
Asian businesses traded well, whilst 
the UK’s fashion market was a little 
flat overall. 
Development of the business
The main objectives for the Group 
this year were continuing to expand 
and diversify the Group’s business 
and managing the effects of the 
Ukrainian crisis.
The Group made major steps forward 
in establishing a business base in Asia 
in the last financial year and in 2014 
continued to build on this base. The 
most significant acquisition of the year 
was announced in October 2013, with 
the Group taking a 50% stake in the 
Chinacoat – Surface Finishing event. 
The event addresses two sectors of 
the industry, the paint sector, and the 
machinery and technology involved 
in applying the paints. Both sectors 
have grown significantly over the 
last few years in line with Chinese 
manufacturing industries. The 2013 
event took place in Shanghai, shortly 
after ITE acquired its interest, and 
sold 34,500m
2
, which was in line with 
expectations at the time of acquisition. 
The 2014 event opens tomorrow with 
34,200m
2
, an increase of 11% over its 
biennially equivalent event from 2012. 
In June 2014 ITE announced the 
acquisition of 50% of Indobuildtech, 
the leading construction event in 
Indonesia. Indonesia is a bright 
prospect for the exhibition industry 
as it combines a large population 
and healthy GDP growth. With two 
potential new exhibition venues, 
which will quadruple the space 
available over the next four years, 
Indobuildtech (currently wall bound) 
has significant potential to grow. ITE 
has now developed a strong base for 
growing its business in South East Asia 
with offices in Indonesia and Malaysia, 
with both countries having started 
construction of new exhibition space. 
The main factors affecting Group profitability this year are  
summarised in the profit bridge below. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic report
Chief Executive’s 
statement continued
In October 2013 ITE announced the 
acquisition of 100% of Beauty Eurasia, 
the Istanbul-based cosmetics and 
beauty event. This is an important 
addition to our beauty portfolio in 
addition to the Ukrainian and South 
East Asian events in Indonesia, 
Vietnam and Malaysia. Beauty 
products are a strong proposition 
and early to respond to growing 
consumer prosperity – so a good 
asset for emerging markets. The 
June 2014 event was a success selling 
9,900m
2
 in its new venue, ahead 
of initial expectations.
Earlier in the year ITE extended its 
ownership in Scoop, the London-based 
high end womenswear exhibition 
which was an associate business, 
but is now a subsidiary. Scoop takes 
place twice a year in central London 
as part of the MODA portfolio and has 
become an important feature of the 
fashion calendar. 
ITE’s diversification strategy is 
working well and remains a priority 
going forward as we have illustrated 
in today’s announcement of the 
acquisition of Eurasia Rail in Turkey. 
In addition, ITE is increasingly focused 
on developing industry expertise and 
brands in its portfolio of events. The 
historic development of our business 
in Russia-CIS has left us with strong 
industry positions in Construction, 
Oil & Gas, Travel & Tourism and Food, 
with multiple shows in each sector. 
Often the events will represent slightly 
different parts of the supply chain 
for the industry depending upon 
where they are based. This logic is 
increasingly driving the development 
of our future new business as it both 
reduces risk and increases synergy to 
develop the business within sectors 
where there is expertise and a common 
customer base. The acquisitions of 
Beauty Eurasia and Indobuildtech are 
developments along this sector-based 
approach. Increasingly the entry into 
new markets will be driven by this 
logic, as acquisitions can be much 
less risky where ITE has customers 
and brands in place to support the 
new initiative.
In Russia, the benefits of common 
brands and systems which have been 
developed over the last few years 
are now being realised with an active 
programme of replicating and cross-
marketing events into and across 
the regional markets. The expertise 
developed by the Russian team 
is forming the base for a systems 
roll-out across the Group, bringing 
all customers and exhibitors into a 
common system. This will support 
the development of industry-based 
expansion strategies.
Venue expansion is important to 
the development of our business. 
In autumn 2014 the Expoforum 
venue opened in St Petersburg. This 
is a major new venue of 50,000m
2
 
gross with conference facilities that 
presents new opportunities for the 
further development of exhibitions 
and conference businesses in the 
north west of Russia. Construction 
has commenced on the new venue in 
Krasnodar, and completion is planned 
for early 2016. As noted before, there 
is new venue development under 
way in Indonesia and Malaysia that 
is expected to create opportunities 
for the Group to grow its events. The 
Group is well positioned to participate 
in the growth that the investments in 
local exhibition facilities are expected 
to generate.
ITE’s objectives and strategy 
ITE’s principal objective is to create 
a business with sustainable growth 
in headline earnings per share. Its 
strategy is to develop positions of 
market leadership in the exhibition 
business substantially in emerging 
and developing markets with good 
growth prospects.
ITE is evolving its strategic objectives. 
Whilst we have been successful in 
establishing positions in new markets 
the future accent will be more 
orientated towards development 
of brands and industry verticals in 
order to support our aim for industry 
leadership in certain sectors. This 
could also involve running exhibitions 
in established Western markets where 
there is synergy with our exhibitions 
in our existing markets. While we plan 
to continue our diversification efforts 
in our key emerging and developing 
markets with good prospects, we are 
also increasing our focus on expanding 
industry verticals.
Four priorities underpin ITE’s strategy: 
1. Improve its existing positions of 
market leadership; 
2. Expand into new sectors and 
geographies with potential for 
strong market positions; 
3. Enhance and improve our 
exhibition brands; 
4. Invest in developing our people. Strategic report Governance Financial statements
 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
 13
ITE’s performance against its strategic 
priorities is set out below:
(i) Improve on existing positions of 
market leadership:
ITE’s existing positions of market 
leadership are founded on its ability 
to generate international sales, its 
recognised brands, its local office 
infrastructure and its long-standing 
relationships with venues.
International sales strength 
ITE’s ability to generate international 
sales has differentiated it from its 
local competition in Russia and the 
related CIS markets. The same pattern 
is also true of China and South East 
Asia, with international participation 
and content being key differentiators 
for pricing and position. The Group 
has established a loyal customer 
base and a geographic reach, which 
is increasingly valuable as it seeks to 
leverage its sales into new markets. 
In 2014 the Group’s international sales 
offices once again sold 132,000m
2
 
which represents circa 25% of the 
Group’s 2014 revenues. Approximately 
13% of revenues were sold by the 
Group’s London office, and 4% by 
each of its German, Chinese and 
Turkish offices. 
ITE’s international brands
ITE has established strong brand 
identities in certain exhibition sectors. 
In particular, the Build brand in 
construction, the Oil & Gas events 
brand, the ITE Travel exhibition and 
World Food brands all have strong 
reputations with customers as leading 
events in the Russian and CIS markets 
earned through more than 15 years of 
sustained good performance. There 
are also new initiatives this year to 
enhance and develop brands in the 
Oil & Gas, Transport, Travel & Tourism, 
Food and Security portfolios. 
Local office infrastructure 
ITE’s brands have built their reputation 
through sustained delivery of 
successful exhibitions to customers. 
The foundation of this is in ITE’s local 
offices which now employ over 900 
staff. Local offices generate the 
local sales, reputation and visitor 
participation of the event as well as 
managing technical staging of the 
exhibitions. Critically they own and 
develop the database of local visitors 
who make the exhibition successful 
for the exhibitors. In its core markets, 
ITE’s local offices have always been 
a competitive advantage over other 
international exhibition organisers and 
a barrier to entry for new organisers 
wishing to run events. ITE will continue 
to develop strong local offices as 
part of its exhibition business in new 
markets. The Group has an integration 
programme for new offices acquired 
into the ITE network and is increasing 
its investment in the infrastructure that 
underpins these offices and in staff 
training. The Group has high rates of 
employee retention in its offices, and 
supports this by its commitment to 
having widespread equity ownership 
– currently 54% of staff participate 
in some form of equity scheme. 
Venue relationships
ITE has always enjoyed long-standing 
relationships with the venues that 
host its exhibitions. In its core markets 
ITE has supported the development 
of venue facilities which in turn has 
helped the Group’s exhibitions to 
prosper. The Group has always sought 
to establish rights to run its main 
exhibition themes in its partner venues 
at the time of its choice and ITE has 
continued to work on maintaining 
and improving the venue relationships 
that underpin its business. Most of 
ITE’s major events have agreements 
which provide for venue facilities for 
at least three years ahead. 
(ii) Expand into new sectors and 
geographies with potential for strong 
market positions:
In existing markets this strategy means 
targeting new sectors and regions in 
which to acquire or develop exhibitions 
where there is potential for the 
participation of international exhibitors. 
In new markets, ITE is targeting the 
development of exhibition businesses 
where there is clear opportunity for 
strong future growth. 
This year the Group has continued 
to expand its business presence into 
Turkey, South East Asia and China. 
In so doing it has acquired expertise 
in new sectors – some of which has 
potential in ITE’s core markets, and 
also made it possible for the Group 
to run its existing brands in the new 
markets The acquisition of Beauty 
Eurasia in Turkey has strengthened 
the opportunity for ITE to build a 
series of events in the Beauty and 
personal care sector. Indonesia is a 
market with potential for expansion 
of the exhibition business and in 
acquiring Indobuildtech, ITE is well 
positioned to build a presence in this 
market and the Group is working to 
ensure that Indobuildtech benefits 
from being part of the Build brand 
and that best practice is shared. The 
Group plans to extend the Chinacoat 
brand into South East Asia, and is 
reviewing opportunities to leverage 
the brand strength elsewhere.
As the Group’s acquisition activity 
over the last few years has opened 
up access to new markets, there are 
now increasing synergies and benefits 
to be gained from strengthening 
its industry portfolio in each sector. 
The Group aims to increasingly focus 
its acquisition activity on building 
portfolio strength and leadership in 
exhibition sectors – creating stronger 
more defensible business positioning 
for its exhibitions.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic report
(iii) Enhance our exhibition brands: 
The Group’s management has been 
working to improve the strength of 
ITE’s existing international brands. 
The acquisition of Beauty Eurasia 
has strengthened the opportunity 
for ITE to build an internationally 
recognised brand in the Beauty and 
personal care sector. This is being 
supported by introducing product 
improvements to enhance customer 
experience and ensuring consistency 
in the presentation and promotion 
of similar events in ITE’s vertical 
industry sectors. The Group’s brand 
development projects have covered 
all aspects of product quality, naming, 
character, tone-of-voice and graphic 
designs associated with events in 
the Group’s largest portfolios. The 
improvements will deliver numerous 
benefits, including increasing the 
global recognition of ITE’s brands 
and enabling the Group to launch 
events into new territories. 
(iv) Invest in developing our people:
The Group has continued its 
programme of developing the strength 
and depth of the leadership and 
management teams in the year as well 
as improving communications between 
offices. Current initiatives include 
a developing talent management 
programme focusing on the Group’s 
most promising employees which 
sets out development plans to 
enable them to grow into future 
leaders. In addition we continue 
to run a Leadership Development 
Programme for our senior managers, 
and a rolling programme of cross-
Group development conferences. 
Communications have continued to 
improve, with a high level of employee 
engagement via the intranet, the 
newsletter and through co-operation 
in cross border industry groups. 
ITE is evolving its strategic priorities 
by which it seeks to achieve its overall 
objectives. The Group has been 
successful in establishing positions 
in new markets and the future accent 
will be more orientated towards 
development of brands and industry 
verticals in order to develop industry 
leadership in certain sectors. This may 
involve running exhibitions in both 
emerging and established markets 
where there is synergy with the 
Group’s existing portfolio of events.

The Group has established a loyal customer base and a

international sales offices once again sold 132,000m
2
 which 
represents circa 25% of the Group’s 2014 revenues.
ITE’s local offices continue to provide a competitive 
advantage over other international exhibition organisers 
and a barrier to entry for new organisers wishing to run 
events. ITE’s local offices now employ over 900 staff and 
during the year further steps have been taken to integrate 
recently acquired offices into the ITE network.
In its core markets ITE has supported the development 
of venue facilities which in turn has helped the Group’s 
exhibitions to prosper. Most of ITE’s major events have 
agreements which provide for venue facilities for at least 
three years ahead. This year ITE has provided funding 
to its key venues in Moscow and Istanbul in return for 
rights over future venue use and advantageous pricing 
arrangements through long-term agreements. New 
opportunities are expected to rise from the expansion 
in regional venue capacity over the next few years. 
New regional exhibition centres in Ekaterinburg and 
Novosibirsk have demonstrated the positive effect that 
additional venue capacity can have on ITE’s exhibition 
portfolio, so the planned developments of new venues 
in both St Petersburg, Krasnodar and Indonesia offer 
considerable opportunities for future growth.

BUSINESS 
ACQUISITIONS 
IN THE YEAR
In existing markets, ITE targets new 
sectors or regions in which to acquire 
and develop acquisitions where 
there is potential for the participation 
of international exhibitors. In new 
markets, ITE is targeting the 
development of exhibition businesses 
where there is clear opportunity for 
strong future growth.
During the year, ITE has built on the business base in 
Asia that was established in 2013. The most significant 
acquisition in the year was the purchase of a 50% stake 
in the Chinacoat – Surface Finishing event, the leading 
coatings and finishings exhibition in China and South East 
Asia, in November 2013. The 2013 event, which took place 
shortly after ITE acquired its interest, sold 34,500m
2
 in the 
year. The Group also acquired a 50% stake in Indobuildtech, 
the leading construction event in Indonesia which has 
significant potential to grow as new venue capacity 
becomes available over the next four years.
In October 2013, ITE acquired 100% of the Platform 
Exhibitions Inc. Platform runs the successful Beauty Eurasia 
event which serves the beauty, personal care and cosmetics 
industries in Turkey and the surrounding region. Beauty 
Eurasia is held in Istanbul in June each year and is the 
leading event of its kind in Turkey. The 2013 exhibition was 
the 9th edition of this successful event which sold 9,900m
2
 
and was attended by over 21,000 professional visitors.
During the year ITE also acquired a majority stake in Scoop, 
its London-based womenswear fashion business which has 
delivered strong growth in recent years.
02
Expand into new sectors 
and geographies with 
potential for strong 
market positions
In December ITE announced the acquisition of the Eurasia 
Rail exhibition. The Eurasia Rail exhibition serves the rolling 
stock and railway infrastructure industries in Turkey and 
the surrounding region and is held each year at the IFM 
(World Trade Center) in Istanbul. The upcoming exhibition 
will be held in March 2015, marking the 5th edition of this 
event, which is expected to sell more than 10,000m
2
 net 
and be attended by around 20,000 professional visitors 
over three days.
These acquisitions, whilst being earnings-enhancing 
in their own right, also create significant opportunities 
for the Group by providing access to new marketplaces 
and offering synergies across industry verticals. Brand

In the last two decades, ITE has 
developed a number of successful 
brands that are renowned for 
providing effective marketplaces 
for businesses. ITE has established 
leading brands in a number of key 
sectors, in particular the Build brand 
in construction, but the Group also 
leads in Oil & Gas, Travel, Food and 
increasingly Beauty.
ITE has continued to strengthen its existing brands 
and improve international recognition of its local brands. 
As part of this, the industry vertical groupings established 
in 2013 have been strengthened through investments in 
the management team and focused marketing to ensure 
consistency of presentation and message across the 
Group. The Group has also continued its series of brand 
development projects which have covered all aspects 
of product quality, naming, character, tone-of-voice and 
graphic designs associated with events in the Group’s 
largest portfolios.
ITE is continuing to develop its brand portfolios and the 
acquisition of Beauty Eurasia in October 2013, which is 
the principal event serving the beauty industry in Turkey, 
has been an important addition to the Group’s growing 
Beauty sector.

Key Beauty brands acquired
Portfolio of leading exhibitions
ITE first gained significant 
exposure to the Beauty sector 
through its acquisition in 2012 
of Beautex Co LLC, which 
operates the Intercharm and 
Estet Beautex Expo events in 
Kiev. This exposure was 
bolstered by the acquisition of 
ECMI in April 2013, and Beauty 
Eurasia in October 2013. As a 
result, the Group now has a 
portfolio of leading exhibitions 
in the Beauty and Personal 
Care sector which increasingly 
benefit from shared sector knowledge,  
management expertise and cross-selling. People

ITE is aware that its success is 
dependent on its people. As such, 
ITE is committed to investing in staff 
development throughout the Group 
and in particular, the management 
team that supports growing events 
and the continued expansion of 
the business.
Job satisfaction and staff retention have always been 
strengths associated with ITE. The Group encourages staff 
to seize career development opportunities. Staff can switch 
job functions if they possess the necessary skills and drive 
to succeed in another role. Others move offices, relocating 
to a new city or country in order to progress. There are 
no fewer rewards for those who choose to stick to their 
profession of choice, because working for ITE provides 
the variety of products, markets and projects for people 
to constantly develop and test their talents.
ITE has high rates of employee retention in its offices, 
with almost half of the Group employees having served in 
the business for five years or more. Key to this commitment 
is widespread equity ownership – currently more than 50% 
of staff participate in some form of equity scheme.
The Group has continued its programme of developing 
the strength and depth of the leadership and management 
teams in the year as well as improving communications 
between offices. Current initiatives include a developing 
talent management programme focusing on our best 
employees, setting out development plans to enable them 
to grow into future leaders, a Leadership Development 
Programme for our senior managers, and a rolling 
programme of development conferences, last year 
for Event Directors and this year by industry.
Communications have continued to improve, with a high 
level of usage of the intranet and newsletter and more 
co-operation by cross border industry groups. We will be 
conducting an Employee Engagement Survey later in the 
year, of which a major part will be how we communicate.

Global conferences
Developing ITE’s management teams
As part of our rolling 
programme of global 
conferences, the summer 
of 2014 saw 68 of our Event 
Directors (EDs) gather in 
Istanbul for our first Event 
Directors’ Conference. 
Participants included the 
EDs from our top 40 shows, 
together with colleagues from 
newly acquired businesses. 
The conference provided the 
opportunity for this important 
group of people to meet, 
share ideas and work on the  
development of their shows  
and their own skills.

Overall in 2014 the Group ran 246 events (2013: 233). 
The Increase in the number of events is attributable to 
a combination of acquisition activity, launches and timing 
differences. A detailed analysis of volumes, revenues and

ITE delivered a good business performance in its lesser 
biennial year despite reporting lower revenues and gross 
profits. The underlying business has delivered a 10% 
improvement in constant currency profits, but this is 
obscured by the relative strength of Sterling against our 
principal trading currencies and the political upheaval 
in Ukraine. As part of ITE’s ongoing review of its event 
portfolio the Group discontinued four high volume low 
profit events in Turkey. Overall, the Group saw volume 
sales fall by 8% to 732,900m
2
 and revenues decrease 
by 9% to £174.8 million. On a like-for-like basis excluding 
discontinued events, volume sales fell by 4% and 
revenues fell by 10%.

3% growth in like-for-
like constant currency 
revenues
During the year ITE held 1 18 events 
in Russia (2013: 1 12), with total volume 
sales this year of 380,200m
2
 
(2013: 399 ,100m
2
). 
Revenue of £102.9m was 15% lower than the previous year, 
reflecting a flat trading environment, the absence of the 
biennial Moscow International Oil & Gas exhibition (MIOGE) 
and a weaker Ruble to Sterling exchange rate. On a like-
for-like basis, volume sales in Russia decreased by 4% and 
revenues decreased by 9% over the prior year, although 
revenues improved on a constant currency basis.
The Russian economy has slowly weakened during the 
year and this has impacted the ability of the business to 
grow as quickly as in previous years. This is particularly 
noticeable in the regions outside Moscow which have 
experienced a recessionary environment for a large part of 
the year. The construction sector across the whole country 
has experienced a contraction in activity during the year, 
which is reflected in the results.
Moscow is ITE’s largest office in Russia accounting 
for around 75% of the region’s revenues. The office 
operates the Group’s largest events a number of which 
are the ‘number one, must attend’ events which help 
insulate the Group in the event of economic weakness. 
Moscow’s volume sales for the year were 243,700m
2
 
(2013: 252,000m
2
); on a like-for-like basis volume sales 
were similar to the prior year with revenues higher after 
excluding the effects of foreign currency movements. 
The leading events in Moscow produced a mixed 
performance this year. The portfolio of industrial events 
held in the first quarter performed strongly as did the 
Moscow International Travel and Tourism exhibition which 
delivered sales of 20,000m
2
 (2103: 19,500m
2
). The Group’s 
largest event Mosbuild delivered a solid performance but 
in common with other construction businesses in Russia 
reported lower volumes than the previous year’s event, 
delivering volume sales of 65,400m
2
 a decrease of 5% 
on the prior edition (2013: 68,700). The logistics event 
TransRussia saw volumes decline by 11% to 10,000m
2
 (2013: 
11,200m
2
), whilst the security event, Moscow International 
Security & Protection continued to grow. The key event 
for the Group in September is World Food Moscow which 
again achieved a record size, growing by 4% to 25,800m
2
, 
despite recently announced sanctions on food imports 
from the EU and US.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

The Group operated 16 events from the St Petersburg office 
during the year, with overall volume sales of 34,900m
2
 
(2013: 38,200m
2
). Performance was mixed with growth in 
events such as Expo-electronica offset by a decline at those 
events in industries reliant on capital expenditure, such as 
construction and mining. From autumn 2014 ITE will run its 
St Petersburg events in a new, state of the art, venue which 
provides improved space and facilities in which to operate.
In Novosibirsk, Siberia, ITE is the anchor tenant in the 
city’s main venue. The international quality space it offers 
has provided a platform for good growth in the Group’s 
business in this region in recent years. However this 
trend reversed during 2014 as the region moved into a 
recessionary environment. During the year the region held 
34 events (2013: 27), with overall volume sales declining 
to 41,500m
2
 (2013: 45,000m
2
), although revenues grew 
in local currency terms.
The Krasnodar region in south-west Russia is one of the 
most prosperous outside Moscow and recently hosted 
the 2014 winter Olympic Games. The exhibition portfolio 
covers a broad range of sectors, the largest events being 
in the agriculture and construction sectors. In total this 
office contributed volume sales of over 60,000m
2
 (2013: 
63,900m
2
) as the local economy moved into recession 
led by the construction sector. Despite the decline in 
sales volumes this year, the Group’s business in Krasnodar 
continues to be restricted by the size of the current 
venue, especially in its two largest sectors. In 2013 the 
Group entered into an agreement to become the anchor 
tenant at a new 28,000m
2
 venue in the city, which is on 
schedule to be completed in early 2016. It is anticipated 
that this new facility will allow ITE’s largest events to grow 
and the business to expand into new industry sectors as 
the economy recovers. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

and Uzbekistan.
This year ITE organised a total of 79 events (2013: 69) 
across these territories with a number of events delivering 
total volume sales of 103,100m
2
 (2013: 82,300m
2
) and 
revenues of £33.5 million. This year was favourably 
impacted by the return of a number of events that had 
‘skipped’ 2013 and a favourable biennial pattern. Overall, 
on a like-for-like basis volumes increased by 7% over 
the previous year with revenues being impacted by 
the negative effects of foreign exchange movements, 
particularly in Kazakhstan our largest office in the region 
which saw a 30% devaluation of the Tenge in January 
2014. Excluding currency movements, like-for-like revenue 
growth was 9%. All of the economies in this region are 
heavily dependent on Oil & Gas for their overseas earnings 
and economic wealth. The consistent US$100+ price of oil 
during the past few years has helped support economic 
confidence within these economies feeding through to 
good levels of economic growth, which has been reflected 
in the growth of the Group’s business in the region this year.
The financial results from Kazakhstan were impacted heavily 
by the Tenge devaluation. Revenues were flat on the prior 
year, despite the negative foreign currency movements. 
This was driven by another strong performance in the 
construction sector which, while it has not yet recovered to 
its pre-recession peaks, grew by 7%, along with a further 
strong performance in the leisure sector. Oil & Gas remains 
the largest sector in the region, accounting for around 
30% of regional revenue, although continued delays in 
commissioning the Kashagan oil field have impacted sector 
performance this year. The largest event in the region is the 
Kazakhstan Oil & Gas Exhibition (KIOGE) which took place 
in Almaty in October 2013 and was slightly smaller than 
the prior edition at 8,000m
2
 (2013: 8,200m
2
).
In Azerbaijan, ITE has once again experienced very 
strong growth backed by the country’s continued 
economic expansion. This year helped by favourable timing 
and a biennial cycle the region achieved volume sales of 
42,000m
2
 (2013: 24,700m
2
) an increase of 28% on the 
prior year on a like-for-like basis. Revenues also increased 
strongly with all sectors showing good growth, especially 
Oil & Gas and Construction.
ITE’s Uzbekistan business showed an increase in 
activity in 2014 selling 13,100m
2
 (2013:11,600m
2
) as a 
result of a number of events returning having ‘skipped’ 
2013. Excluding these timing differences, volumes and 
revenues were flat on a like-for-like basis.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Turkey and Ukraine. 
Overall the region sold 174,300m
2
 in 2014 (2013: 
252,800m
2
), reflecting the impact of the political crisis in 
Ukraine and the closure of high-volume low margin events 
in Turkey. On a like-for-like basis excluding discontinued 
events this represented a decrease of 9% in volumes.
The Group’s business in Ukraine has suffered heavily as 
a result of the political turmoil and civil war in the east 
of the country. ITE runs all of its Ukrainian events in 
Kiev and to the great credit of its dedicated staff it has 
continued to operate all events despite the troubles. The 
size and financial success of these events has declined in 
comparison to the prior year as the year has progressed, 
with a strong autumn season giving way to increasingly 
impacted events. Overall the Group sold 35,400m
2
 in 
Ukraine during the year generating revenues of £6 million, 
which represents a decline of 46% in both volumes and 
revenues on the prior year. The Group’s profits from 
the region in 2014 have declined by circa £3 million in 
comparison to the prior year to less than £2 million, 
although the business remains profitable. With a population 
of over 45 million people and economy to be repaired, ITE 
remains committed to operating its business in this region 
and believes it offers attractive returns in the longer term.
As part of ITE’s ongoing review of its event portfolio the 
Group has reshaped its Turkish business during 2014, with 
the discontinuation of a number of high volume, low margin 
events; IMOB (furniture), TATEF (industrial machinery), 
Promuturk (promotional gifts) & Stationery. It now has 
a portfolio of high quality international events in its core 
sectors (Construction, Travel, Beauty and Food), all of 
which are free from the pressures of industry associations 
and operate at international profit margins. The acquisition 
of Beauty Eurasia announced in early October 2013 with 
its high level of international participants is in line with this 
strategy and improves the quality of the Turkish events 
portfolio and supports the Group’s establishment of 
an international Beauty brand. 
Overall total volumes in Turkey were 138,900m
2
 (2013: 
186,700m
2
), reflecting these changes. On a like-for-like 
basis excluding discontinued events volume sales were 4% 
ahead of last year and revenues were 3% down, although 
revenues were significantly ahead of the prior year in 
constant currency terms. In terms of specific events within 
the region, Turkeybuild, the pre-eminent construction event 
in Turkey, took place in early May and delivered its largest 
ever event with volume sales of 36,300m
2
. The event enjoys 
strong demand for additional space from its exhibitors 
and the completion of additional capacity at the venue 
will allow the event to grow from the 2015 edition onwards. 
The Group’s leading regional travel event EMITT again 
produced a record performance selling over 28,000m

East Asia. 
These regions represent relatively new markets for ITE 
in which to grow our existing products and develop 
new sectors. These markets are characterised by fast 
growing economies, underpinned by a rapidly expanding 
aspirational middle class population which is expected to 
drive consumer demand. In addition, they have relatively 
immature exhibition industries for the size of their economies 
and these two factors combine to offer excellent growth 
opportunities for ITE over the medium term. The Group’s 
operations in this region are largely through a series of joint 
venture arrangements and the Group’s income statement 
reflects only those revenues over which it has majority 
ownership, which totalled £5.7 million during the year (2013: 
£3.7 million), with profits largely recognised through the 
joint venture and associate line. In comparison revenues 
generated by 100% of the joint venture and associate 
businesses totalled around £35 million during the year.
The Indian exhibition industry offers significant potential 
due to the current lack of international quality venue space 
within the country which is severely limiting the industry at 
present. The Group operates two businesses in India: one 
through a small wholly owned subsidiary, ITE India, and the 
other through a 28.3% stake in ABEC, India’s largest private 
exhibition organiser. ABEC’s portfolio of 19 exhibitions across 
11 sectors includes Acetech – India’s leading construction 
event. Both businesses performed well this year, with ABEC 
delivering record profits and completing the successful 
launch of the Indian Travel and Tourism event. ITE India 
welcomed back its two leading biennial events MMMM 
and Paperex both of which showed good growth. 
In China the Group operates through its Hong Kong 
headquartered 50% joint venture partner Sinostar which 
runs the Chinacoat/Surface Finishing China event. The Group 
acquired the interest shortly before the November 2013 event 
which was a record size selling over 34,000m
2
. The Group is 
now looking to expand its portfolio of events in the coating 
sectors through a mixture of new launches and acquisitions.
In South East Asia the Group operates through three 
organisations based in Malaysia and Indonesia. In Kuala 
Lumpur, Malaysia the Group owns 75% of Tradelink 
which runs the Metaltech event, serving the machine tool 
technology and metal fabrication industries. The event, 
which sells over 12,000m
2
, takes place each May in Kuala 
Lumpur and performed well although it is likely to remain 
at its present size until construction of a new venue is 
completed in two to three years’ time. Also based in Kuala 
Lumpur are ECMI in which the Group has a 50% holding, 
and which operates the pan-ASEA professional beauty 
event series ‘Cosmobeaute’ and the laboratory equipment 
‘Lab’ exhibitions. These acquisitions, and ECMI in particular, 
offer the Group a base of operations from which to 
replicate its events across the region, and the Group has 
already successfully launched the inaugural Oil & Gas and 
Cosmobeatue events in Myanmar, Paperex in Indonesia, 
Cosmobeaute in Thailand and TransAsia in Singapore.
The Group further expanded its South East Asian operations 
in June with the acquisition of 50% of PT Debindo based 
in Jakarta, Indonesia. The company runs the Indobuildtech 
series of construction exhibitions, the largest of which takes 
place annually in Jakarta, and has already begun to leverage 
its international sales expertise in this sector to secure 
international participation at the 2015 event.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

and Scoop, a designer-led Womenswear event which the 
Group completed the purchase of during the year. Overall 
the portfolio achieved volumes sales of 42,800, a 4% 
decline on a like-for-like basis with continued growth in 
the London based events, especially at Jacket Required 
and Scoop, partially offsetting declines at MODA which 
continues to see the effects of a changing marketplace for 
midmarket independent fashion retailers. The Group is now 
looking to take its expertise in the fashion sector outside 
the UK and during the year it acquired a 40% interest in 
‘The Hub’ a designer-led menswear event in Hong Kong.

Revenue and gross profit 
Revenue for the year was £174.8 million 
(2013: £192.3 million) and gross profit 
for the year was £80.8 million (2013: 
£88.1 million), maintaining a gross 
margin of 46% (2013: 46%) in the 
Group’s weaker biennial year.
Administrative expenses across the 
Group decreased to £42.0 million 
from £44.5 million in the previous 
year. Administrative expenses include 
significant non-cash items, including 
an amortisation charge of £11.8 million 
on acquired intangibles (2013: £13.1 
million), an impairment charge of 
£6.2 million on goodwill relating to 
our business in Ukraine (2013: nil), a 
charge for share-based payments of 
£0.5 million (2013: £2.2 million) and a 
foreign exchange gain of £4.0 million 
arising on the revaluation of foreign 
currency monetary assets (2013: a loss 
of £0.2 million).
Excluding these non-cash items, 
administrative expenses decreased 
by £1.5 million to £27.5 million (2013: 
£29.0 million) primarily as a result of 
the strength of Sterling against the 
Ruble, in which a significant portion of 
overhead costs are incurred. Overall, 
Group administrative expenses 
excluding non-cash items and 
transaction related costs represented 
15% of revenue (2013: 15%).
Operating profit was £41.8 million 
against a prior year profit of £45.0 
million, resulting in net operating 
margins of 24% (2013: 23%) for 
the year.
Headline pre-tax profit for the year was 
£60.3 million (2013: £59.4 million).
Other operating income
£0.4 million (2013: £0.3 million)
Other operating income represents 
rental income earned from subletting 
surplus office space, principally at ITE’s 
London office.
Investment revenue
£1.0 million (2013: £1.1 million)
Investment revenue came from interest 
on bank deposits of £0.4 million (2013: 
£1.0 million), a gain on the revaluation 
of put options of £0.3 million (2013: nil) 
and a gain on revaluation of contingent 
consideration of £0.3 million (2013: nil). 
In the prior year there was also a gain 
on cash flow hedges pf £0.1 million.
Finance costs
£1.4 million (2013: £2.2 million)
Finance costs represent the interest 
cost of the Group’s borrowings of 
£0.7 million (2013: £0.5 million), bank 
charges of £0.6 million (2013: £0.5 
million) and an imputed interest 
charge arising on the discounting 
of the Group’s put option liabilities 
of £0.1 million (2013: £0.3 million). 
In the prior year there was also a loss 
on the revaluation of put options on 
acquisitions of £0.8 million, and a 
loss on the revaluation of contingent 
consideration of £0.1 million.
Tax charge
The tax charge of £7.4 million 
represents 18% of profit before tax 
(2013: 19%). The Group continues to 
focus on tax efficiency across the 
Group, with the reduction in the tax 
rate this year primarily resulting from 
efficiencies within the Group structure.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share decreased 
by 3% to 13.8p (2013: 14.2p). Diluted 
earnings per share also decreased 
by 2% to 13.8p (2013: 14.0p).
The Group achieved headline diluted 
earnings per share of 20.2p (2013: 
19.3p). Headline diluted earnings 
per share is based upon profit for 
the financial year attributable to 
equity holders of the parent, before 
amortisation and impairment of 
acquired intangible assets and goodwill, 
any profits or losses on disposal of 
Group undertakings, revaluation of 
financial liabilities in relation to put 
options over non-controlling interests, 
imputed interest charges on discounted 
put option liabilities and transaction 
costs relating to completed and 
pending acquisitions and disposals.

Return to shareholders
The Group has recommended a final 
dividend of 4.9p per share for 2014, 
to bring the total dividend for the 
year to 7.4p per share (2013: 7.0p), 
an increase of 6%.
ITE is committed to maximising 
shareholder value through a long-term 
progressive dividend policy, set against 
a principle of maintaining at least two 
times cover across the biennial cycle, 
together with the reinvestment of 
profits into expanding the business.
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations 
in the year was £48.5 million (2013: 
£67.1 million), which after adjusting for 
the non-cash foreign exchange gain 
of £4.0 million (2013: a loss of £0.2 
million) and venue advances of £6.9 
million (2013: utilisation of £4.7 million) 
represents 98% of headline profits 
(2013: 105%). The principal applications 
of cash were £50.7 million applied 
to acquisitions (2013: £26.1 million); 
£6.9 million applied to new venue 
loans and advances (2013: utilisation 
of £4.7 million); £8.7 million was paid 
in tax (2013: £11.1 million); and £17.4 
million was distributed as dividends 
to the Group’s shareholders (2013: 
£16.4 million). The decrease in net 
cash balances over the year was £38.3 
million, with the Group being £14.8 
million in net debt at 30 September 
2014 (2013: net cash of £23.5 million).
Acquisitions 
On 15 October 2013, ITE acquired 
Platform Exhibitions Inc, which runs 
the Beauty Eurasia event, for cash 
consideration of £9.0 million, £3.3 
million of which was deferred and 
paid in September 2014. This event 
contributed revenue of £1.9 million 
and £1.1 million of profit before tax 
to the Group’s headline results.
On 1 December 2013, the Group 
exercised its call option to acquire the 
60% of Scoop International Fashion 
Limited which it did not already own. 
Cash consideration of £1.8 million 
was paid.
On 3 February 2014, the Group’s 
put option to acquire the 90% of 
Summit Trade Events Limited which 
it did not already own was exercised. 
Summit is organiser of a number of 
Oil & Gas events in Turkmenistan. 
Cash consideration of £1.1 million was 
paid and further consideration of 
£0.3 million is payable contingent on 
performance of the business in 2015. 
Investments in Joint Ventures 
and Associates
On 15 November 2013, the Group 
acquired a 50% stake in Sinostar ITE 
which owns ChinaCoat and SFChina, 
the leading coatings and surface 
finishing exhibitions in China. The 
initial investment comprised £30.2 
million cash with a further amount of 
£3.9 million payable contingent on 
the performance of the business to 
31 March 2014. This deferred element 
was paid in two tranches, with the 
final tranche of £2.8 million paid in 
October 2014.
On 10 June 2014, the Group 
acquired a 50% stake in Debindo 
ITE which owns Indobuildtech, the 
leading construction show in Indonesia. 
The initial investment comprised 
£3.0 million cash, with a further 
amount estimated at £1.9 million 
payable in 2015 contingent on the 
results of the 2015 show. 
Net assets decreased by £3.9 million 
to £105.4 million. The main changes 
are in net cash (a decrease of £38.3 
million), investments in joint ventures 
and associates (an increase of £34.5 
million), goodwill and intangibles 
(a decrease of £19.9 million), the 
net derivative financial instruments 
balance (an increase of £8.0 million) 
and the movement in deferred revenue 
(a decrease of £16.0 million). 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill and intangible assets 
have decreased during the year 
due to the retranslation of overseas 
balances to Sterling at year end 
exchange rates and an impairment 
of goodwill relating to our business 
in Ukraine. Whilst the Ukrainian 
business remains profitable, a review 
of this business using prudent future 
growth rates results in a £6.2 million 
impairment of the goodwill balance. 
This decrease is partly offset by the 
acquisition of Beauty Eurasia. The 
intangible assets balance represents 
acquired customer relationships, 
trademarks and licenses, visitor 
databases and computer software.

Investment and capital expenditure
The Group’s capital expenditure 
on plant and equipment increased 
slightly during the year to £1.4 million 
(2013: £0.9 million) and included 
exhibition equipment, office fixtures 
and fittings. Capital expenditure on 
computer software in the year was 
£1.5 million (2013: £0.8 million). The 
increase reflects continued investment 
in computer software to enhance 
our exhibition visitor experiences, 
develop our office network and 
support our sales, marketing and 
accounting functions.
Venue arrangements
The Group has long-term 
arrangements with its principal 
venues in its main markets setting 
out ITE’s rights over future venue 
use and pricing.
The Group funds the development 
of venues and facilities where 
improvements will enhance the 
prospects and profitability of its 
business. The funding can take the 
form of a prepayment of future venue 
fees (‘advance payment’), or a loan 
which can be repaid by cash or be 
offset against future venue fees 
(‘venue loan’). Generally the funding 
brings rights over future venue use and 
advantageous pricing arrangements 
through long-term agreements. Venue 
loans and advance payments are 
included in the Balance Sheet under 
non-current and current assets. 
At 30 September 2014, the Group’s 
Sterling value of the outstanding 
balances of advance payments 
and venue loans was £10.2 million 
(2013: £4.1 million) as follows:
Share capital
During the year the Company issued 
348,000 (2013: 509,117) ordinary 
shares of 1p in the year. All of the 
total new issues were pursuant to 
the exercise of options and yielded 
aggregate consideration of £11,930. 
During the year the Company 
purchased an additional 1,665,000 
shares for the Employees Share 
Option Trust (ESOT) for a cost of 
£3,751,118. As at 30 September 2014 
ESOT held 3,703,588 (1.5%) of the 
Company’s issued share capital 
(2013: 3,654,988 (1.5%)).
Reserves
The movement in the translation 
reserve from £12.1 million to £33.3 
million represents the loss on the 
retranslation of the Group’s overseas 
assets denominated in foreign 
currencies. This is driven primarily 
by movements in Sterling/Ruble and 
Sterling/Ukrainian Hryvnia exchange 
rates. The movement in the hedge 
reserve from a debit balance of 
£0.4 million to a credit balance of 
£3.1 million primarily represents the 
gain on revaluation of Euro derivative 
instruments deemed effective hedges. 
The reduction in the put option reserve 
follows the acquisition of the remaining 
20% equity stake in Turkeybuild that 
the Group did not own which was 
exercised in April 2014.

Treasury
During the year, the Group 
experienced a net foreign exchange 
gain of £4.0 million (2013: loss of 
£0.2 million). The exchange rate 
for the Euro at 30 September 2014 
was €1.28:£1 (30 September 2013: 
€1.19:£1); the exchange rate for 
the Ruble at 30 September 2014 
was R63.8:£1 (30 September 2013: 
R52.0:£1); the exchange rate for the 
US Dollar at 30 September 2014 
was US$1.63:£1 (30 September 
2013: US$1.61:£1).
During the year, 42% of the Group’s 
sales were priced in Euros, 33% 
in Rubles, 8% in GBP, 3% in US 
Dollars, the balance being in 
various local currencies.
The average exchange rates used 
to translate sales into Sterling were: 
R58.7:£1 (2013:R48.9:£1), €1.22:£1 
(2013: €1.20:£1). The Group estimates 
that a 1 cent movement in the Euro 
impacts profit by £250,000 and a 
1 Ruble movement impacts profit 
by £500,000. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic report
Chief Financial Officer’s 
statement continued
The Group uses derivative instruments 
and currency borrowings to protect 
itself against the effect of currency 
fluctuations on a proportion of its sales 
and its balance sheet. The Group’s 
policy on derivative instruments is that:
 – it will hedge no more than 75% 
of the value of anticipated Euro 
denominated sales derived from 
outside Russia and the CIS; and
 – it will only enter into derivative 
transactions up to 36 months ahead.
At 30 September 2014, the Group 
had entered into forward contracts 
to sell Euros for Sterling between 
October 2014 and September 2017. 
The value of the contracts is €82.2 
million at an average rate of €1.21:£1. 
These instruments are designated 
as hedging instruments.
The Group finances its operations 
through cash holdings and banking 
facilities. The objective of the Group 
is to maximise investment income and 
minimise interest costs, bearing in 
mind its liquidity requirements.
Group borrowing facilities
The Group has long-term borrowing 
facilities provided by Barclays Bank 
and HSBC. The arrangements extend 
until 30 June 2018 and consist of 
revolving credit facilities totaling 
£80 million.
At 30 September 2014 the Group had 
borrowings in the form of revolving 
credit facility drawings of £42.9 million 
denominated in Sterling (2013: total 
borrowings of £20.6 million of which 
£15.9 million was denominated in 
Sterling, £1.8 million denominated 
in US Dollars and £2.9 million 
denominated in Euros).
For short-term debt, such as overdraft 
facilities or debt with a term of less 
than 12 months, fixed or floating rates 
of interest are used. For debt with 
a term of greater than 12 months, 
when the borrowing is not covered by 
existing cash holdings, it is policy that 
management will review the Group’s 
exposure to interest rate movements 
and fix interest rates to the extent 
deemed appropriate. It is Group policy 
that its cash balances are not invested 
in instruments that would put the 
capital value at risk. All invested funds 
have a determinable rate of interest.
Liquidity risk
The Group policy is to ensure 
continuity of funding for operational 
needs through cash deposits and 
debt facilities as appropriate. The key 
requirement for the business is to 
maintain flexibility to allow the Group 
to take advantage of opportunities that 
could arise over the short-term. The 
needs of the business are determined 
on a rolling cash flow forecast basis, 
covering weekly, monthly, annual and 
three-years’ requirements. Short-term 
flexibility is maintained by holding cash 
in current accounts and high liquidity 
money market funds. The Group has 
overdraft facilities in place both to 
permit currency borrowing as part 
of its foreign exchange management 
and to allow flexibility in where it 
holds its cash balances.
The Group is conscious of the risks 
associated with holding deposits in 
foreign-domiciled banks. The territories 
in which ITE operates do not all have 
internationally recognised banks and 
the Group has relationships with a 
number of domestic banks. The Group 
seeks to use the territories’ leading 
banks and to minimise the level of cash 
held in such banks. Of the Group’s 
total cash balance of £28.1 million as 
at 30 September 2014, 58% was held 
in institutions with a rating of grade A 
or above and 33% in B to BBB+.
Going concern
The Group and Company’s business 
activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set 
out in the Chief Executive’s Review 
and Divisional Trading Summary. 
The financial position of the Group 
and Company, its cash flow, liquidity 
position and absence of net long-
term borrowings are described within 
this Finance Director’s statement. In 
addition, note 21 refers to the Group 
and Company’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its 
financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures 
to credit risk and liquidity risk.
After making enquiries, reviewing 
the Group and Company’s forecasts 
and projections and taking account 
of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources 
to continue its operations for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they have adopted the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements.

Environmental impact
The Group is pleased 
to have met its target 
to reduce emissions 
per staff member 
during 2014
As a media services company, the 
Group acknowledges that its business 
has an impact on the environment, 
albeit relatively minor, and ITE follows 
current best practice in each of 
its markets by observing country 
legislation and leading industry 
practice. The Group is aware that 
this is an area of increasing concern 
to employees, shareholders and 
customers alike. By identifying 
environmental improvements, we 
expect to see increased efficiencies 
and with that reduced costs and the 
management of environmental issues is 
part of our business strategy to create 
long-term value for shareholders.
Board level responsibility
The Group Finance Director has 
direct responsibility for environmental 
matters and chairs the Environmental 
Matters Committee which monitors 
the Group’s emissions, considers 
and makes recommendations for 
improvements and mitigations of 
the Group’s environmental impact, 
and commissions and reviews 
external reporting of the Group’s 
environmental impact for regulatory 
or voluntary disclosure.
The Group’s Reporting Protocol
The Group recognises that its 
operations have an impact on the 
environment primarily through the 
GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions. 
As a result the Group continues 
to measure and report its material 
GHG emissions with the aim of 
minimising energy usage, improving 
environmental management across 
its offices and driving efficiencies, 
which in turn is expected to reduce 
costs and create long-term value 
for shareholders.

Emissions per staff member 1.08 1.16
Consistent with prior year, the scope 
of Group’s reporting continued to 
cover GHG emissions at the global 
level covering all of the Group’s 
operating offices.
The Group worked with CarbonSmart, 
a carbon consultancy, to develop a 
GHG Reporting Protocol, based on 
DEFRA and World Resource Institute 
guidelines. The Group has decided 
to measure GHG emissions based 
on financial control boundaries – so 
operations which are consolidated as 
subsidiaries in the Group’s financial 
statements have been included in the 
measurement exercise. Associates 
and joint ventures of the Group have 
not been included as the Group does 
not exercise sole control over these 
operations. As the Group does not 
exercise financial control over the 
properties in which exhibitions are 
held, emissions arising from these 
properties have not been measured.
The Group does not manufacture 
or sell any tangible products and 
has identified the following key 
activities as being within the GHG 
reporting requirements:
 – Scope 1: Natural gas; company cars; 
onsite fuel consumption and fugitive 
emissions (i.e. refrigerants). 
 – Scope 2: Purchased electricity and 
heat and steam.
At present, scope 3 activities (e.g. 
business travel; waste; freight shipping) 
are excluded from the reporting scope. 
It is believed that at present the quality 
of the data would not be sufficiently 
robust for accurate reporting in 
these areas.
Measurement of environmental 
impact in 2014
The Group has identified GHG 
emissions per employee as the most 
appropriate KPI. To measure this the 
Group collected data on a Group 
wide basis from most of its offices 
on the activities identified above 
for the year ended 30 April 2014. 
Results from similar offices have been 
extrapolated based on the number of 
employees to estimate total emissions. 
In some offices, where electricity 
and heat charges are included in 
office rental cost and the information 
is not provided by office landlords, 
an estimate has been calculated based 
on similar offices’ usage and office 
floor space data.
When compared to prior year the 
Group is pleased that it was able to 
reduce its total GHG emissions from 
1,229 tonnes of CO
2
e to 1,191 tonnes of 
CO
2
e as well as to meet its published 
target by reducing its emissions per 
staff member – from 1.16 CO
2
e to 1.08 
CO
2
e largely as a result of a reduction 
in gas consumption. 
Over the next three years the Group 
will target to reduce its GHG emissions 
by 10% (excluding the impact of 
new UK conversion factors which 
are outside Group management’s 
direct control). ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Corporate social 
responsibility
Overview
The Board of ITE believes that 
corporate and social responsibility 
is an important part of the Group’s 
culture and that the adoption of good 
practice will have a positive impact 
on profits and increase the long-
term value for shareholders. Due 
consideration is given to risks arising 
from social, ethical and environmental 
issues as part of an ongoing risk 
review process.
Employees 
The Board recognises the importance 
of diversity amongst its employees 
and is committed to ensuring that 
employees are selected and promoted 
on the basis of merit and ability, 
regardless of age, gender, race, 
religion, sexual orientation or disability.

The Group has a policy of encouraging 
employees, especially those from the 
locations in emerging markets, to move 
around the offices of the Group, thus 
providing development opportunities 
for all staff. In addition, employees are 
assisted in their career development 
through an annual appraisal scheme, 
and sponsored training is provided 
where there is a benefit to both the 
individual and the Company. All staff 
are eligible to receive share options 
or awards under the Employee’s 
Performance Share Plan as the Board 
feels that it is important for them to 
take an active part in the success 
of the Company and to share in the 
long-term value they help to create.
The Board recognises the need to 
provide a safe working environment 
for employees, exhibitors and visitors 
at the Group’s events. Each office is 
responsible for ensuring that their 
business operates in compliance 
with Group policies and the relevant 
local health and safety legislation. 
Employees receive regular Health 
and Safety training. Staff from all 
regions with lead responsibility 
for the operation of the Group’s 
exhibitions on-site also attend 
regular training courses.
Social interaction
The Board of the Company is 
aware of both the benefits to its 
business of engaging with its various 
constituencies in a socially-responsible 
manner and the risks of failing to do 
so. As an operator of internationally-
focused businesses in emerging 
markets, the Company ensures that 
it is culturally sensitive in its dealings 
with the local community and that its 
employment and development policies 
are non-discriminatory and encourage 
the employment of local nationals at 
all levels in the Company. 
The Company actively supports its 
employees in their support of local 
community projects. Charitable 
donations across the Group totalled 
over £49,500 in 2014 (2013: £46,000).
In Russia the Group supports a number 
of local charities – particularly those 
involving children’s charities. During 
2014 this has included providing direct 
financial funding as well as providing 
volunteers to assist on specific 
projects and workshops. 
During the year, the Moscow office 
continued its support for the charity 
called ‘Support Fund for Children in 
Difficult Circumstances’. As part of 
this support, the office organised a 
two-week collection of clothes and 
toys for children under 14, as well 
as raising money to buy nappies for 
the youngest children.
In St Petersburg, the local office raised 
funds for the local charity AdVita, 
which supports children with cancer. 
In return, AdVita gave ITE the right to 
use a drawing from one of its children 
for its corporate Christmas cards last 
year. Aged five and receiving treatment 
for leukaemia at the time of drawing, 
the artist is now nine and has 
overcome his illness.
In Uzbekistan, the local office raised 
funds to purchase hygiene products 
for local needy children who had 
lost their mother. This follows the 
office’s previous efforts in helping 
disabled children.
In the UK, the London and 
Huddersfield offices held charity 
auctions and sponsored activities, 
matching funds raised by employee 
contributions. The office continued 
its work with Events for Namuwongo 
during the year. Namuwongo is a slum 
on the edge of Kampala, Uganda, 
which has been adopted by the UK 
exhibitions industry to provide support 
and to work with the community to 
help them achieve their long-term 
objectives. During the year, ITE’s Chief 
Executive Officer, Russell Taylor, joined 
the charity’s organised cycle ride and 
cycled over 350km from London to 
Paris to raise money for Namuwongo. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Ethics and human rights issues
Integrity is core to the Group’s values 
which it actively promotes in its 
dealings with employees, shareholders, 
customers and suppliers and with the 
authorities of the countries in which it 
operates. The Group recognises that 
reputation is a valuable and fragile 
asset gained over a substantial period 
of time and is committed to good 
practice in respect of human rights. 
The leadership position of the Group’s 
exhibitions and the long-term growth 
of its core shows is a testament to 
the success of its practices.
All ITE staff are required to comply 
with the laws and regulations of the 
country in which the Group operates 
and with the Group’s Human Rights 
Policy. The Group promotes high 
ethical standards in carrying out 
its business activities and has clear 
guidelines for dealing with gifts, 
hospitality, corruption, fraud and 
the use of inside information. These, 
together with the Human Rights 
Policy, are available to all staff on 
the Group intranet.

Governance
Corporate governance report
UK Corporate Governance Code compliance
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance and supports the principles laid down in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012 (‘the Code’). This statement 
describes how the principles of the Code are applied and reports on the Company’s compliance with the Code’s provisions. 
The Board considers that the Company has been in compliance with all the principles and provisions of the Code 
throughout the year ended 30 September 2014 and to the date of this report. 
The Board
The Board of Directors (‘the Board’) currently has seven members, comprising the non‑ executive Chairman, Chief Executive, 
Chief Financial Officer and four independent non‑ executive Directors.
All the Directors bring strong judgement to the Board’s deliberations. The Board is of sufficient size and diversity that the 
balance of skills and experience is considered to be appropriate for the requirements of the business. 
The non‑ executive Directors are all independent of management and free from any business or other relationship, 
including those relationships and circumstances referred to in provision B.1.1 of the Code that could materially interfere 
with the exercise of independent and objective judgement. The Company considers that the Chairman was independent 
on appointment. 
The non‑ executive Directors were all appointed for an initial three‑ year term and (in common with the executive Directors) 
are subject to re‑ election each year by shareholders at the AGM, and, as set out in the Code, the Board continuing to be 
satisfied that they remain independent,.
The Chairman and Chief Executive
The different roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are acknowledged. A responsibility statement for each of those 
roles has been agreed and adopted by the Board. 
Senior Independent non‑ executive Director
Linda Jensen was appointed as the Company’s senior independent non‑ executive Director with effect from 30 January 
2014. Her responsibilities include being available to liaise with shareholders who have concerns which are not able to be 
resolved through the normal channels, being a sounding board for the Chairman and leading the annual performance 
evaluation of the Chairman.
The Directors
The biographical details of the Board members are set out on pages 40 and 41. The Directors have all occupied, or occupy, 
senior positions in UK and/or non‑ UK listed companies and have substantial experience in business. The non‑ executive 
Directors do not participate in any of the Group’s pension schemes or in any of the Group’s bonus, share option or other 
incentive schemes. At all times at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, has comprised independent non‑ executive 
Directors. At the AGM on 29 January 2015 all the Directors will once again offer themselves for re‑ election in compliance 
with Code provision B.7.1.
Role of the Board
The Board has overall responsibility to shareholders for the proper management of the Company. It met seven times during 
the financial year. It has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision making, including responsibility for the 
overall management and performance of the Group and the approval of its long‑ term objectives and commercial strategy, 
approval of annual and interim results, annual budgets, material acquisitions and disposals, material agreements and major 
capital commitments, approval of treasury policies, and assessment of its going concern position.
Board members receive appropriate documentation in advance of each Board or Committee meeting which normally 
includes a detailed report on current trading and full papers on matters where the Board will be required to make 
a decision or give approval. These are delivered through an electronic platform, improving the efficiency of its 
communications and reducing paper usage.
There is an established procedure for the preparation and review, at least annually, by the Board of medium‑ term plans 
and the annual budget. Management accounts are circulated to the Board on a monthly basis and business performance 
and any significant variances to budget are formally reviewed at scheduled Board meetings. All major investment decisions 
are subject to post‑ completion reviews.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
 43
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Board discussions are held in an open and collaborative atmosphere with sufficient time allowed for debate and challenge.
During the year the Chairman met with the non‑ executive Directors without the executive Directors present. The non‑executive 
Directors also met without the Chairman or executive Directors present.
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover, is provided by the Company, in line with normal market practice, for the benefit of 
Directors in respect of claims arising in the performance of their duties. 
Board effectiveness review
The formal annual review of the performance of the Board, its Committees and the Directors was carried out before 
the year end. This year the process consisted of an internally run exercise led by the Chairman assisted by the Company 
Secretary. The appraisal questionnaire used as part of the process was wide‑ ranging and included questions covering 
both Board and Committee performance. Individual performance was reviewed by the Chairman who, in turn, was 
appraised by the Senior Independent Director after consultation with both the other non‑ executive Directors and 
the executive Directors.
The appraisal confirmed that the Board and its Committees were operating effectively. The feedback received resulted 
in the agreement of a clear action plan for the year ahead focusing on the following areas:
 – Devoting more time to the discussion of the Group’s strategic objectives.
 – Progressing the Group’s focus on succession planning and talent management.
 – Improving communications between Board members between Board meetings.
Independent professional advice
The Board has approved a procedure for Directors to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, 
if required. No such advice was sought by any Director during the year. In addition, the Directors have direct access 
to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
Training and development
An induction programme is arranged for newly‑ appointed Directors which include presentations on the business, current 
strategy and shareholder expectations. Guidance is also given on the duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a Director 
of a listed company and key Board policies and procedures. Business familiarisation involves Directors visiting exhibitions 
in markets in which the Group operates to gain a greater understanding of the Group’s activities and to meet senior 
managers throughout the business. 
Every Director has access to training as required and is encouraged to continue his or her own professional development 
through attendance at seminars and briefings.
Conflicts of interest 
The Company’s Articles of Association, in line with the Companies Act 2006, allow the Board to authorise potential 
conflicts of interest that may arise and impose limits or conditions, as appropriate. The Company has established a 
procedure whereby any decision of the Board to authorise a conflict of interest is only effective if it is agreed without 
the conflicted Directors voting or without their votes being counted. In making such a decision, as always, the Directors 
must act in a way they consider in good faith will be most likely to promote the success of the Company. 
Board Committees 
There are a number of standing Committees of the Board to which various matters are delegated. They all have formal 
terms of reference approved by the Board which are available on the Group’s website (www.ite‑ exhibitions.com). 
Their reports are set out on pages 46 to 71. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standards require that Directors:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 – the Management Report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
 – Each of the Directors considers that the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.

Audit Committee report
The Audit Committee comprises Linda Jensen, Sharon Baylay (since April) and Stephen Puckett (Chair). All members 
of the Committee are independent non‑ executive Directors and they are considered to provide the wide range of 
international, financial and commercial expertise necessary to fulfil the Committee’s duties. The Board considers that 
Stephen Puckett has the appropriate financial expertise, as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’).
In either the current or prior year, individual members of the Committee have visited a range of the Group’s offices and 
shows, including Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Moscow and the Group’s main UK show Moda, holding meetings with local staff 
and, where appropriate, following up on matters previously identified by external and internal audits. 
The Committee’s role is to provide effective corporate governance over the appropriateness of the Group’s financial reporting. 
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on our website at http://www.ite‑ exhibitions.com/corporate‑ governance.aspx
Specific responsibilities include:
 – reviewing the financial results announcements and financial statements and monitoring compliance with relevant 
statutory and listing requirements;
 – reporting to the Board on the appropriateness of the accounting policies and practices including critical accounting 
policies and practices;
 – advising the Board on whether the Committee believes the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy;
 – overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, advising the Board on the appointment of the external auditor, 
agreeing their audit scope and audit fees and assessing the effectiveness of the external audit process;
 – considering and making recommendations to the Board on the nature and extent of the significant risks to which the 
Group is exposed and monitor management’s mitigation plans;
 – reviewing the scope and results of the Group’s internal audit activity and assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit process; 
 – monitoring the Group’s whistle‑ blowing process; and 
 – monitoring compliance with the UK Bribery Act. 
The Committee met four times during the year. By invitation, all meetings were attended by the Group Chief Financial 
Officer, the Group Chairman and our external auditor Deloitte LLP and for certain meetings or parts of meetings, the Group 
Financial Controller, and the Group’s Head of Internal Control. Other relevant people from the business were also invited to 
attend certain meetings or parts of meetings to provide a deeper level of insight into certain key issues and developments. 
To maximise effectiveness, meetings of the Committee generally take place just prior to a Company Board meeting. 
The Chairman of the Committee reports to the Board, as part of a separate agenda item, on the activity of the Committee 
and matters of particular relevance to the Board in the conduct of their work.
Separately, the Chairman of the Committee has also held meetings with:
 – the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial Controller and the external auditor to review the progress with 
matters raised in the management letter and separately the potential impact of technical accounting updates; 
 – the external auditor, and; 
 – the Group’s Head of Internal Control.
Each of the four Committee meetings held during the year has a particular specific focus, in order as follows: the 
management letter from the external auditor following the prior year’s audit; the review of the external auditor’s interim 
review work and the interim financial statements; the external audit plan; the results of the external audit and review of 
the annual financial statements and associated investor presentations. In addition, every meeting reviews summaries of 
the latest internal audit reports, the update of the risk assessment, and any correspondence received by the Board which 
falls within the Committee’s remit.
In assessing the appropriateness of the financial statements the Committee concentrated on the following significant 
audit risks, which were agreed with Deloitte in advance of the audit and were the focus of their audit and on which the 
Committee received written reports from management and Deloitte as part of the audit process: 
 – Acquisition accounting as there is exercise of judgement involved in identifying and valuing the consideration and 
the assets acquired in a business combination. The Committee assesses the processes used in the identification and 
valuation of acquired assets and liabilities including the reasonableness of any assumptions used. The Committee also 
assesses the final split of consideration between goodwill and identified intangible assets. This year the Committee 
considered both management’s papers and reports from the external auditors covering the principal acquisitions: 
Sinostar, Platform and Debindo.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
 47
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
 – Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets which involves measuring the carrying value of goodwill against the 
discounted cash‑ flows of each of the cash generating units (CGU). Each regional office is considered to be a CGU. 
There are a number of judgements to consider including the forecast cash flows of the office, discount rates used, the 
growth rates applied and the expected life of the shows. Forecast cash flows are based on Board approved budgets 
and plans. Discount rates are selected to reflect the risk adjusted cost of capital for the respective territory. Growth 
rates and the respective life of the shows reflect management’s view of the long‑ term forecast rates of growth (using 
third party sources such as the IMF where appropriate) and longevity for the shows in the respective territory. This year 
the Committee considered closely the performance of the Russian offices (where there is significant headroom), and 
the Ukraine office due to the ongoing political and economic situation. A suitable impairment has been booked against 
goodwill in the Ukraine. 
 – Recoverability of venue advances and loans. One of the key factors of success in the exhibition business is maintaining 
strong relationships with suitable venues. As part of these relationships, the Group often makes loans or advances to 
venues. Assessing the future recoverability of the venue loans and advances involves judgement. This is exercised by 
considering the track record of recoveries, together with assessment of economic conditions and show performance 
in the relevant territory. 
 – The appropriate recognition of revenue is critical to the financial statements. The Committee believes that the risk 
is focused on the validity and cut‑ off of revenue. All revenue is recognised when the service has been delivered. With 
respect to exhibitions and conferences the Group usually invoices its customers in advance of the show and so defers 
the revenue until the date the event has completed. Floor plan audits
1
 are seen as central to the controls process for the 
accurate recognition of revenue and confirming that floor plan audits are being performed on a timely and robust basis 
forms a critical part of internal audit testing of procedures during the year on a rolling basis to each operating unit.
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Group has a formal process of internal audit which involves the Group’s Head of Internal Control identifying a limited 
scope audit of minimum acceptable control practices. These audits are performed on a rolling basis amongst the Group’s 
operating units either by the Head of Internal Control or KPMG LLP. The reports are made available in summary form to 
the Committee and in detail form to the Group Chief Financial Officer, relevant operating management and the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. The Group’s Head of Internal Control assists with training and monitors correction to any 
identified issues. 
The Committee reviews the reports and considers progress against the recommendations. The Group operates across a 
number of territories and the role of the internal audit reviews and appropriate follow up is an important part of the Group’s 
overall control environment. 
The effectiveness of the internal control process is assessed annually through discussions with local management teams 
and others involved in the process. The conclusion of the review was that the current internal audit process was operating 
effectively. As a result of the review this year, the Committee plans to broaden the scope of internal audit to include 
identification and assessment of commercial and risk management processes in local offices. 
The Group’s risk management process is covered in detail in the report of the Risk Committee. The Audit Committee 
Chairman is a member of the Risk Committee which ensures effective and sufficient coverage of financial reporting risks 
within the Group’s risk management processes. 
External audit
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent on appropriate audit risk identification at the start of the audit 
cycle. A detailed audit plan is received from Deloitte, which sets out the key risks identified. For the 2014 financial year, the 
primary risks were in relation to acquisition accounting, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, revenue recognition 
and recoverability of venue advances. 
Deloitte provided the Committee with their views on these issues at the Committee meeting held to consider the financial 
statements. In addition they provided the Committee with details of any identified matters greater than £40,000 and any 
other adjustments that were qualitatively significant which management had not corrected on the basis that the matters 
were not, individually or in aggregate, material.

Governance
Audit Committee report continued
Private meetings were held with Deloitte at both of the Audit Committee meetings which considered the financial 
statements (in May and November) to provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback from the 
Committee and the auditor without management being present. Matters discussed were the preparedness and efficiency 
of management with respect to the audit, the strengths and any perceived weaknesses of the financial management 
team, confirmation that no restriction on scope had been placed on them by management and how they had exercised 
professional judgement. The Chairman of the Committee also meets with the external audit partner outside the formal 
committee process through the year.
The effectiveness of the 2013 external audit process was formally assessed by the Committee in January 2014. Feedback 
was sought from various participants in the process (management, Audit Committee members and management of 
subsidiary units). The effectiveness of management input, audit planning, execution, reporting, communication, team 
knowledge and partner performance was assessed and was discussed in the Audit Committee meeting. Overall the 
effectiveness of the external audit process was assessed as performing as expected, with the quality of the audit team 
noted as a special strength. 
Appointment and independence
The Committee considers the reappointment of the external auditor, including the rotation of the audit partner each year 
and also assesses their independence on an ongoing basis. The external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group audit every five years. The current audit partner was appointed last year. He was selected from 
a shortlist of three suitable and available partner candidates provided by Deloitte LLP and based on interviews conducted 
separately by the Group Chief Financial Officer and the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Committee reviewed and 
endorsed their recommendation.
Deloitte LLP were first appointed by the Company in 2002. Whilst the Group has not formally tendered the audit since 
then, the Committee has undertaken a review of the objectivity and effectiveness of the audit process each year. When 
considering the suitability of external auditor, the Committee takes account of the ability of the auditor to deliver an audit 
across the geographies in which the Group operates. In addition, considerable importance is placed on the findings set 
out in the Public Report on the most recent inspections of Deloitte carried out by the Financial Reporting Council’s Audit 
Quality Review team and their reports on all other auditors in its sample. The Committee notes the consistently good 
assessment of Deloitte against its peers. When considering suitable external auditors the Committee also takes account of 
the ability of the auditor to add value through observations from the audit process and their interactions with management. 
The Committee is cognisant of its responsibility under the revised Code to tender the audit every ten years and notes that 
this period can be extended to coincide with the period ending the current engagement partner’s rotation if longer. Under 
transition rules set out in the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) final order in response to recent EU regulations, the 
Group has to mandatorily tender the audit by the AGM held after 17 June 2023. Taking account of this, the Committee 
nevertheless plans to tender the audit in 2017 to take effect for the year ending 30 September 2018, after the five‑ year 
rotation period of the current external audit partner, although this decision shall be reviewed annually. For the year 
ending 30 September 2015, the Committee has provided to the Board its recommendation to the shareholders on the 
reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s auditors.
During the year, Deloitte LLP and member firms of Deloitte LLP charged the Group £343,000 (2013: £339,000) for audit 
and audit related services.
Non‑ audit services
To safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external auditor from becoming compromised, the Committee has 
a formal policy governing the engagement of the external auditor to provide non‑ audit services. No material changes 
have been made to this policy during the year. In addition, non‑ audit fees on any specific project cannot exceed £50,000 
without the express approval of the Chair of the Committee, who must report to the Committee on the use of this 
delegated authority at the next committee meeting. 
Our policy ensures that the Committee challenges the decision to use Deloitte LLP where suitable, practical and reasonably‑ priced alternatives exist. In addition, the Committee considers the overall level of non‑ audit fees and would not expect these 
fees to be in aggregate greater than the audit fee. Full details of the split between audit and non‑ audit fees can be found in 
note 6 on page 97.

Nomination Committee report
The Nomination Committee comprises Neil England, Linda Jensen and Stephen Puckett and is chaired by Marco Sodi. 
Michael Hartley served on the Committee during the year until stepping down from the Board on 30 January 2014.
It meets as required and is responsible for considering and recommending to the Board suitable candidates for 
appointment as executive and non‑ executive Directors. There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Directors to the Board which involves the Nomination Committee interviewing candidates proposed 
by either existing Board members or external search consultants. Careful consideration is given to ensure appointees 
have sufficient time available to devote to the role and that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board 
is maintained. When dealing with the appointment of a successor to the Chairman, the senior independent non‑ executive 
Director will chair the Committee instead of the Chairman. When the Committee has found a suitable candidate, the 
Chairman of the Committee will make a proposal to the whole Board and the appointment is the responsibility of the 
whole Board following recommendation from the Committee.
Diversity
ITE has adopted a Board Diversity Policy which recognises and embraces the benefits of having a diverse Board, and 
sees increasing diversity at Board level as an important element in maintaining a competitive advantage. A truly diverse 
Board in its broadest sense will include and make good use of differences in the skills, regional and industry experience, 
background, race, gender and other qualities of Directors. These differences will be considered in determining the optimum 
composition of the Board and when possible should be balanced appropriately. All Board appointments are made on merit, 
in the context of the skills and experience the Board as a whole requires to be effective.
The Committee met three times during the year and was active in the appointment of ITE’s new non‑ executive Director, 
Sharon Baylay. The selection process began with the agreement of a specification for the role by the Committee and 
the subsequent appointment of external search consultants, Sapphire Partners, who have no other connection with the 
Company, to carry out a search and review of prospective candidates. After completion of a rigorous interview process, 
the Committee’s recommendation that Sharon Baylay be appointed was passed unanimously by the Board, with Sharon 
joining the Company as a non‑ executive Director on 1 April 2014.
Other activities during the year included:
 – Reviewing the succession planning and talent mapping processes for senior management; and
 – Reviewing the balance of skills and experience on the Board and considering if any changes were necessary.

Remuneration Committee report
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2014, which has been 
prepared by the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) and approved by the Board.
The Group delivered a robust set of results in 2014. Revenues were £174.8 million (2013: £192.3 million) and yielded headline 
profits before tax of £60.3 million (2013: £59.4 million) and headline diluted earnings per share of 20.2p (2013: 19.3p).
This is the Company’s second year of reporting in line with The Large and Medium‑sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The report is divided into two sections. The first is the Policy 
Report which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 30 January 2014 and which outlines the Group’s remuneration 
policy applying from 1 October 2014 for Executive Directors. Whilst the remuneration policy is unchanged, for clarity 
we have updated the charts illustrating the application of the remuneration policy to reflect the latest salaries, and the 
recruitment policy to include the Committee’s confirmation (provided in advance of the 2014 AGM) that use of Listing 
Rule 9.4.2R will be limited to the ‘buy out’ of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, and have 
simplified the notes to the policy table and the section on consideration of shareholder views. The second section is the 
Annual Report on Remuneration which reviews how the policy was implemented in 2014 and includes a table showing 
a single figure of total remuneration for Executive Directors. It also summarises how the Remuneration Policy will be 
implemented in 2015. Mindful of the increasing length of remuneration reports, we have aimed here to be concise without 
compromising on transparency. I hope you find the Remuneration Report clear and easy to understand and would 
welcome any feedback or comments.
During autumn 2013, we undertook consultation with shareholders on the proposed introduction of a new long‑ term 
incentive plan. At the 2014 AGM, 99% of votes cast were in favour of the new Performance Share Plan (PSP) which the 
Committee felt reflected the constructive consultation exercise with shareholders. Awards were granted under the new 
PSP in March 2014.
The Committee reviewed the 3‑ year cumulative headline diluted EPS performance targets applying to the 2015 PSP cycle 
which are anticipated to be granted in January 2015. There are a number of factors likely to affect results which are either 
outside of management control or are difficult to mitigate in a material way. These effects include:
1. The appreciation of Sterling against the basket of transactional currencies used in the business, particularly the 
Euro and Ruble.
2. The translation of local currency profits into Sterling for reporting and target measurement.
3. The conflict in the Ukraine and its impact on exhibitors wishing to participate in Ukrainian events, together with the 
impact on the Ukrainian economy generally.
4. The slowdown in the Russian economy which represents ITE’s largest market.
5. The effect of international sanctions on Russia.
In accordance with our stated policy, and recently published best practice guidelines, the Committee determined to make 
no adjustment as a result of any of the above. This will make the growth targets challenging but the Committee felt the 
scheme must not be disconnected from the reality of the business.
Reflecting the reduced growth forecast in the Company’s core markets, the Committee has set a 3‑ year cumulative 
headline diluted EPS performance zone (2015 to 2017) of 62p to 70p, equivalent to a compound increase of 4% p.a. 
to 10% p.a..
A resolution to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration (subject to an advisory vote) will be put to shareholders 
at the AGM.

In line with The Large and Medium‑sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 
the following parts of the Annual Report on Remuneration Report are audited: the single total figure of remuneration for 
each Director, including annual bonus and performance share plan outcomes for the financial year ending 30 September 
2014; scheme interests awarded during the year; pension entitlements; payments to past Directors and payments for 
loss of office; and Directors’ shareholdings and share interests. All other parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
are unaudited.
Policy Report 
This section provides ITE’s remuneration policy for Directors which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. 
The Group’s principal remuneration policy aim is to ensure that the compensation offered is appropriate to attract, retain 
and motivate Executive Directors and staff with the ability and experience to deliver the Group’s strategy and grow the 
business, having regard to the prevailing economic conditions and competition for such people in the markets in which 
the Group operates.
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to and balances the following factors:
a) the need to align the interests of the executive with those of the shareholders;
b) the performance of the individual executive and of the Group as a whole; 
c) the remuneration practice in the markets in which the executive is principally based; and
d) the remuneration packages offered to executives in companies competing in the same markets as the Group.
Summary of ITE’s remuneration policy applying from 1 October 2014

shareholders through 
rewarding sustained 
growth in headline 
diluted EPS over the 
medium to long term, 
delivery in shares 
and, for the CEO, the 
additional relative 
TSR performance 
condition.
Awards of nominal‑cost 
(or nil‑cost) options may 
be granted annually as 
a percentage of base 
salary. Vesting is based on 
performance measured 
over three years. The 
performance period 
normally starts on the 
beginning of the financial 
year in which the date of 
grant falls.
Dividends accrue on PSP 
awards and are paid on 
those shares which vest.
Award levels and 
performance conditions 
are reviewed before each 
award cycle to ensure they 
remain appropriate.
Payments made under 
the PSP are subject to 
clawback, for the later of 
one year following date 
of vesting or completion 
of the next audit of the 
Group’s accounts, in the 
event of a fraud or material 
misstatement of results 
being identified in relation 
to the years in which the 
PSP is earned. 
Award opportunities are up to 
150% of base salary for the CEO 
(after consideration of the TSR 
performance condition) and up 
to 100% of base salary for other 
Executive Directors.
Awards of up to 200% of 
base salary may be provided 
in exceptional circumstances 
(e.g. recruitment).
20% of maximum vests for 
Threshold performance for 
the CEO (30% of maximum for 
other participants), rising on a 
straight line basis to full vesting 
for stretch performance.
Awards to Executive 
Directors are subject to 
three‑ year cumulative 
headline diluted 
EPS performance.
Awards to the CEO 
are subject to an 
additional relative TSR 
performance condition 
which runs concurrently, 
such that relative TSR 
without EPS growth is 
not rewarded. The TSR 
comparator group is 
normally the FTSE 250. 
There is no uplift if ITE’s 
TSR is median or below, 
rising on a straight line 
basis to a maximum 
uplift of 50% if ITE’s 
TSR is upper quartile 
or above.
In addition, for there to 
be any vesting on TSR, 
the Committee needs 
to satisfy itself that the 
recorded TSR outcome 
is a fair reflection of 
underlying business 
performance over the 
performance period.
When assessing this, the 
Committee will consider 
factors including, 
but not limited to, 
underlying profit and 
cash flow.
In exceptional 
circumstances, the 
Committee has the 
ability to exercise 
discretion to override 
the formulaic PSP 
outcome within the 
Plan limits to ensure 
alignment of pay 
with the underlying 
performance of the 
business during the

Notes to policy table 
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the 
approval and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report will be honoured.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting
Performance targets are set at such a level as to be stretching and achievable, with regard to the particular strategic 
priorities and economic environment.
Annual Bonus
The measures used under the annual bonus plan are selected annually to reflect the Group’s key strategic priorities for 
the year and reinforce financial performance and achievement of annual objectives as well as individual performance. 
Financial measures include, but may not be limited to, headline profit before tax to reinforce achievement of sustainable 
profit growth.
The annual bonus target is based on the annual budget approved by the Board. Prior to the start of the financial year, 
the Committee sets an appropriate performance zone (Threshold to Stretch) around the target, which it considers provides 
an appropriate degree of ‘stretch’ challenge and an incentive to outperform.
PSP
The Committee considers that headline diluted EPS is the most appropriate measure of long‑term performance of 
the Group as it is well‑aligned with shareholder interests and provides good line‑of‑sight. The scheme is simple and is 
well understood by participants. The additional relative TSR performance condition further reinforces alignment with 
shareholder interests and helps to provide a balanced and progressive relationship between pay and performance.
The Committee reviews the performance targets applying to the PSP annually, prior to the start of the performance period, 
taking into account a number of internal and external reference points to help ensure they are appropriately stretching. 
Three‑year cumulative headline diluted EPS performance targets are calculated as follows:
 – adjust the headline diluted earnings per share figure achieved in the base year to remove the biennial effect;
 – apply a compound increase to establish a ‘Threshold’ target for each of the three years;
 – apply a compound increase to establish a ‘Stretch’ target for each of the three years; and
 – aggregate the performance target figures for each year to produce the cumulative headline diluted earnings per share 
performance targets for Threshold vesting and for Stretch.
Ahead of the start of each new PSP cycle, the Committee will reconfirm the TSR comparator group to ensure it remains 
relevant and robust.
Differences in remuneration policy operated for other employees
ITE’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group. All employees are eligible to participate in an annual 
bonus scheme with similar metrics to those used for the Executive Directors. Opportunities and specific performance 
conditions vary by organisational level with business area‑specific metrics incorporated where appropriate.
Senior managers and other employees are eligible for consideration of awards of performance shares (under the PSP) 
or share options to further support alignment with shareholder interests (see page 119 in the notes to the consolidated 
accounts for more information on all‑employee share option plans).  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
 55
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee recognises the importance of aligning the interests of executives with shareholders through the building 
up of a significant shareholding in the Group. Executive Directors are required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of 
the after‑tax gain made on the vesting of awards under the Plans, until they have built up a minimum shareholding of a 
value equivalent to at least 100% of annual base salary. In 2013, the Group strengthened the shareholding guideline for the 
CEO to a minimum holding equivalent of 150% of base salary. Details of the current personal shareholdings are provided 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 58.
Remuneration policy for new Directors 
When hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, including by way of internal promotion, the Committee may make use 
of all the existing components of remuneration as follows:
Component Approach Maximum value
Base salary Determined in line with the stated policy, and taking into account 
their previous salary. Initial salaries may be set below market and 
consideration given to phasing any increases over two or three 
years subject to development in the role.
Not applicable.
Benefits In line with the stated policy.
Pension In line with the stated policy.
Annual bonus In line with stated policy, with the relevant maximum pro‑rated to 
reflect the proportion of the year served.
100% of base salary.
PSP In line with the stated policy. 150% of base salary
(200% in exceptional circumstances).
In determining appropriate remuneration for a new executive, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors 
(including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited) to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of both ITE and its shareholders. The Committee may consider it appropriate to 
grant an award under a structure not included in the policy, for example to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer, and will exercise the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.2 R where necessary. In doing 
so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including the expected value of all outstanding equity awards using a 
Black‑Scholes, or equivalent valuation and, where applicable, taking into account toughness of performance conditions 
attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met. The Committee has confirmed that the use of 
Listing Rule 9.4.2R will be limited to the ‘buy out’ of incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer and 
that such buyout awards would have a fair value no higher than the awards forfeited.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Group will honour any contractual 
commitments made prior to their promotion to Executive Director.
In cases of appointing a new Non‑executive Director, the approach will be consistent with the policy.
Service contracts and exit payments policy
Non‑executive Directors are engaged on the basis of a letter of appointment. In line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, all Directors are subject to re‑election annually at the AGM. The Chairman has a six ‑ month notice period and the 
Non‑executive Directors have a one ‑ month notice period. The Non‑executive Director Letters of Appointment are available 
to view at the Group’s registered office and the effective dates of their Letters of Appointment are as follows:

Remuneration Committee report continued
Executive Director service contracts have no fixed term and have a notice period of 12 months from either the Executive 
or the Group. Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Group’s registered office. The dates of the 
Executive Director service contracts and the relevant notice period are as follows:
Director
Effective date

period
Russell Taylor 25 March 2003 12 months
Neil Jones 3 November 2008 12 months
The Committee’s policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre‑established contractual arrangements and 
the rules of the relevant incentive plans. In doing so, the Committee’s objective is to avoid rewarding poor performance. 
Furthermore, the Committee will take account of the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate their loss.
Termination payments are limited to base salary and benefits during the notice period. If an Executive Director’s contract 
is terminated, they are eligible for a pro‑rated annual bonus over the period to the date of cessation of employment, 
subject to performance.
In addition to the contractual provisions regarding payment on termination set out above, the Group’s incentive plans 
and share schemes contain provisions for termination of employment.

An individual would normally be considered a good leaver if they leave for reasons of death, injury, ill‑health, disability,

Bad leaver provisions apply under other circumstances.
2. Under the 2004 PSP which expired in February 2014, awards normally lapse on leaving unless the awardholder is considered a good leaver. Upon 
death of an awardholder, awards would normally vest in full at that time. If an individual retires as determined by the Committee, outstanding PSP 
awards would normally continue and be pro rata for performance over the full period. The Committee can instead determine that the award will 
vest at the time of cessation, to the extent that performance targets are achieved and taking into account the length of the period served. Awards 
to other good leavers will normally vest to the extent that performance targets are achieved on the date of cessation. On a change‑of‑control, 
outstanding awards will normally vest to the extent that performance targets are achieved and taking into account the period served to the date 
of change‑of‑control.
External appointments 
The Executive Directors may accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Board and provided only that 
such appointments do not prejudice the individual’s ability to fulfil their duties at the Group. Whether any related fees are 
retained by the individual or remitted to the Group will be considered on a case‑by‑case basis.

Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group
When reviewing and setting executive remuneration, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment 
conditions of all employees of the Group. The Group‑wide pay review budget is one of the key factors when reviewing 
the salaries of the Executive Directors. Although the Group has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding 
Board remuneration, it does comply with local regulations and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly.
Consideration of shareholder views
It is the Committee’s policy to consult with major shareholders prior to any changes to its Executive Director remuneration 
structure. During autumn 2013, the Committee consulted with major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies, 
the ABI and ISS on the proposed introduction of a new long‑ term incentive plan. At the 2014 AGM, 99% of votes cast 
were in favour of the new Performance Share Plan (PSP) which the Committee felt reflected the constructive consultation 
exercise with shareholders. The remuneration policy is unchanged for 2015. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Remuneration Committee report continued
Annual Report on Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’)
The members of the Committee are the Group’s Non‑executive Directors, Neil England (Chairman), Linda Jensen, Marco 
Sodi and Sharon Baylay, following her appointment to the Board on 1 April 2014. Michael Hartley served on the Committee 
until his resignation from the Board on 30 January 2014. Stephen Puckett also stood down from the Committee from the 
same date.
The Committee met four times during the year. Further details of attendance of Non‑executive Directors at Remuneration 
Committee meetings can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 44. The following individuals attended 
meetings by invitation and provided material advice to the Committee to enable it to make informed decisions:
 – Russell Taylor, Chief Executive; and
 – Mandy Hossami, Group Human Resources Director and Jane Stables, her predecessor.
No individual was present when their own remuneration was being discussed. The Remuneration Committee’s Terms of 
Reference are available on the Group’s website.
The Committee is responsible for:
 – recommending to the Board the remuneration and terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman (who absents 
himself from discussions regarding his own remuneration), Executive Directors and key members of senior management; 
 – measuring subsequent performance as a prelude to determining the Executive Directors’ and key managers’ total 
remuneration on behalf of the whole Board;
 – determining the structure and quantum of short‑term remuneration; and
 – granting awards under long‑term incentive plans and options under the various ITE Group Share Option Schemes. 
The main issues discussed and/or approved during the financial year under review included:
 – approval of the prior year Directors’ Remuneration Report, review of shareholder comments and AGM voting 
on the report;
 – annual review of the Executive Directors’ salaries or fee arrangements and benefits;
 – review of the Executive Directors’ performance against the targets set under the 2014 annual bonus scheme;
 – review of the design and targets for the 2015 annual bonus scheme including personal objectives;
 – review and approval of awards made during the year under the Performance Share Plan;
 – approval of the vesting level for Performance Share Plan awards vesting on performance to 30 September 2014; 
 – review of the performance targets to be applied for the awards to be made under the Performance Share Plan 
in January 2015; and
 – review of the personal objectives of the Executive Directors.
Advisors
Kepler Associates (Kepler) were appointed by the Committee as its independent remuneration advisor following a 
competitive selection process in July 2012 and was retained during the year. The Committee evaluates the support 
provided by its advisors annually and is comfortable that Kepler does not have any connections with ITE that may impair 
their independence. Kepler is a founding member and signatory to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, 
details of which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. Other than advice to the Committee, no other 
services were provided by Kepler to the Group. The fees paid to Kepler for support to the Committee in 2014 were £48,800 
on the basis of time and materials.

in January 2015.
Executive Director base salaries/fees
During the year, Russell Taylor, the Chief Executive, received £440,000 in salary. On 1 October 2014, he was awarded 
an increase to £448,800 p.a., a 2% increase. His next salary review date will be 1 October 2015.
During the year, Neil Jones, the Chief Financial Officer, received £250,000 in salary. On 1 October 2014, he was awarded 
an increase to £255,000 p.a., a 2% increase. His next salary review date will be 1 October 2015.
Executive Director salary increases were broadly in line with the typical increase across the UK employee population.
Pension and other benefits
During the year, the Group made contributions equal to 10% of Russell Taylor’s base salary and 5% of Neil Jones’ base 
salary into their respective personal pension schemes. The contribution to Neil Jones’ pension scheme was increased 
from 5% to 10% of salary from 1 October 2014 consistent with that for Russell Taylor.
Benefits are in line with the policy.
Annual performance bonus
Russell Taylor, Neil Jones and Edward Strachan participated in a performance‑related annual bonus scheme, the Executive 
Bonus Plan, designed to reinforce delivery of sustainable profit growth and achievement of strategic objectives.
2014 bonus framework
For the 2014 financial year, the maximum annual bonus opportunity was 100% of salary for Russell Taylor and Neil Jones 
and 75% of the annual Director’s fee and consultancy fee for Edward Strachan. In each case the annual bonus was based 
80% on financial targets and 20% on personal targets.
The financial element was based upon the achievement of headline profit before tax. A range for headline profit before tax 
was set at £56 million to £61 million with 0% of potential at £56 million, 50% of potential at £58 million, 100% of potential at 
£61 million, and straight line vesting in between. The Committee considered these targets to provide an appropriate degree 
of ‘stretch’ challenge and an incentive to outperform. The table below summarises the financial performance targets set 
and actual performance during the financial year.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Personal objectives for Russell Taylor were set by the Group Chairman, and for Neil Jones and Edward Strachan by the 
Chief Executive. In all cases these were reviewed and approved by the Remuneration Committee in advance who also 
approved recommendations on the level of achievement against them at the end of the performance period.
Russell Taylor’s personal objectives for the year ended 30 September 2014 were related to business development in 
emerging markets outside of Russia, continuing to strengthen the senior management team, maintaining key venue 
relationships and continuing to develop the Group’s data systems and structures. Payout under this element of the 
bonus was assessed at 78% of the potential award on personal objectives.
Neil Jones’ personal objectives for the same period related to budgetary control, developing a more sophisticated approach 
to data and digital systems, global roll‑ out of new accounting system and other strategic projects. Payout under this element 
of the bonus was assessed at 78% of the potential award on personal objectives.
Edward Strachan’s personal objectives for the same period were related to maintaining key venue relationships and 
development of new launches in certain territories. Payout under this element of the bonus was assessed at 75% of the 
potential award on personal objectives.
After taking account of their personal targets, Russell Taylor, Neil Jones and Edward Strachan earned 68%, 68% and 81% 
of their respective potential bonus opportunities. Edward Strachan’s bonus was calculated on 80% financial KPIs, of which 
50% were Group targets and 50% local.
2015 annual bonus framework
For the financial year commencing 1 October 2014, the Executive Bonus Plan will operate in line with the remuneration 
policy. Bonuses are based 80% on headline profit before tax and 20% on personal objectives. Bonus opportunities remain 
unchanged. The Committee intends to disclose financial performance targets and personal objectives retrospectively 
in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, subject to these no longer being considered by the Board to be 
commercially sensitive.
Long‑term incentives
Scheme interests awarded during the year
The Group has two plans which it operates for the Executive Directors, the ITE Group plc Employees’ Performance Share 
Plan 2014 and the ITE Group plc Key Contractors’ Performance Share Plan 2014. Awards can be made to the CEO over 
shares worth up to 150% of base salary and for Executive Directors up to 100% of base salary each year, and under the 
latter scheme to key individuals who are not Group employees.
Awards granted on 13 March 2014 are subject to cumulative headline diluted EPS for the three financial years ending 
30 September 2016 for Executive Directors, and against an additional relative TSR performance condition for the CEO. 
The performance targets are provided below:

The TSR vesting condition is ITE’s 3‑year TSR rank vs. a comparator group which for March 2014 PSP awards is the 
FTSE 250. TSR performance in the upper quartile of ranked companies will result in a multiple of 1.5 being applied to 
the EPS element of the CEO’s award. TSR performance below median rank will result in a multiple of 1 being applied 
to the EPS element of the CEO’s award, with the multiple being calculated on a straight line basis for TSR performance 
between median rank and upper quartile performance.
In addition, vested awards will be subject to clawback for the later of one year following date of vest or completion of the 
next audit of the Group’s accounts in the event of a fraud or material misstatement of results being identified in relation 
to the years in which the PSP is earned.

2015 PSP framework
PSP awards are anticipated to be granted in January 2015 in line with the remuneration policy. Awards will be assessed 
against cumulative headline diluted EPS for Executive Directors, and against an additional relative TSR performance 
condition for the CEO. Both headline diluted EPS and TSR performance conditions will be measured over the three financial 
years ending on 30 September 2017.
The Committee has set a cumulative headline diluted EPS performance zone of 62p (for a 30% award, 20% of maximum for 
the CEO) and 70p (for a 100% award) to be earned over the three financial years ending on 30 September 2017. Vesting will 
be calculated on a straight line basis in between. The performance zone is equivalent to a compound increase of 4% p.a. to 
10% p.a. and takes into account reduced growth forecasts in the Company’s core markets. The Committee considers the 
resulting performance targets to be very stretching over the next three years.
The targets were calculated as follows:
 – Adjusting the fully diluted headline EPS achieved in the financial year ended 30 September 2014 to remove the 
biennial effect.
 – Applying a compound increase of 4% to establish a ‘threshold’ target for each of the three years.
 – Applying a compound increase of 10% to establish a ‘full vesting’ target for each of the three years.
 – Aggregating the target figures for each year to produce the aggregated fully diluted headline EPS targets for threshold 
vesting (20% for the CEO and 30% for other participants) and for maximum vesting (100%).
For the CEO’s award, the two measures operate concurrently so that relative TSR without EPS growth is not rewarded. 
Awards will be up to 150% of salary for the CEO if both the three‑year cumulative headline diluted EPS and relative 
TSR performance conditions are met in full, and up to 100% of salary to Executive Directors for full achievement of the 
three‑year cumulative headline diluted EPS performance condition. The TSR vesting condition is based on ITE’s 3‑year 
TSR rank vs. the FTSE 250 which is the same as for 2014 PSP awards, and we believe consistency of approach is generally 
desirable. TSR performance in the upper quartile of ranked companies will result in a multiple of 1.5 being applied to the 
EPS element of the CEO’s award. TSR performance below median rank will result in a multiple of 1 being applied to the 
EPS element of the CEO’s award, with the multiple being calculated on a straight line basis for TSR performance between 
median rank and upper quartile performance.
Chairman and non‑executive Director Fees
During the year the Committee reviewed the Chairman’s fee in light of the time commitment and fees payable at 
comparator companies and increased this from £145,000 to £157,500 p.a., effective from 1 March 2014.
With effect from 1 October 2014, the Non‑executive Directors receive a base fee of £45,000 (2013: £44,000), with an 
additional fee for the Senior Independent Director of £3,500 (2013: £3,000) and for the Audit and Remuneration Committee 
Chairs of £6,000 (2013: £5,500). The Non‑executive Directors’ fees for the year commencing 1 October 2014 are therefore 
as follows: Sharon Baylay £45,000, Neil England £51,000, Linda Jensen £48,500 and Stephen Puckett £51,000. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Payments to past Directors and payments for loss of office
Edward Strachan ceased to be an Executive Director of the Company on 31 March 2014. He continues to provide services 
to the Group under a consultancy agreement.
Edward Strachan holds unvested PSP awards over 56,250 shares granted in January 2013 and 56,000 shares granted in 
March 2014 which will continue to vest on schedule in 2016 and 2017, respectively, subject to continued employment and 
to the extent the performance conditions are met in line with the incentive plan rules.
Dilution limits
The Group has at all times complied with the dilution limits set out in the rules of its share plans (principally a limit of 
10% in ten years). The Group will also operate within a dilution limit of 5% in any rolling ten‑ year period for discretionary 
schemes. In the ten‑ year period to 30 September 2014, awards made under the Group’s share schemes represented 1.60% 
(2013: 1.7%) of the Group’s issued ordinary share capital. Shares to satisfy awards granted under the Performance Share 
Plan which are normally purchased in the market do not count towards the dilution limits.
Directors’ shareholding guidelines and share scheme interests
During the year the Executive Directors were required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after‑tax gain made 
on the vesting of awards under the Plans, until they have built up their minimum shareholding of at least 100% of annual 
base salary (150% for the CEO). All of the Executive Directors currently meet the shareholding guidelines. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

The table below shows the Directors’ interests in shares owned outright and/or vested, and the extent to which ITE’s shareholding

Risk Committee report
The Risk Committee was established during the year and held its first meeting in January 2014.
The ITE Group plc Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s risk management framework. It regularly reviews 
the Group’s key risks and is supported in the discharge of this responsibility by various committees, specifically the 
Audit Committee and the Risk Committee.
The purpose of the Risk Committee (‘the Committee’) is to identify, assess, monitor and recommend actions to management 
and the Board to manage risk. The Committee oversees, reports and makes recommendations to the Board in respect of 
risks faced by the Group. The Committee works closely with the Audit Committee (the Chairman of which is a member 
of the Committee) which remains responsible for risks arising in financial reporting.
The Committee’s work is primarily driven by the assessment of its principal risks and uncertainties. These risks and 
uncertainties are the output of a full review, performed annually, involving a ‘top down’ review by the Executive Directors 
and a ‘bottom up’ risk assessment performed by each operating unit management team considering the risks facing their 
business unit. As part of this annual process, the plans to mitigate the identified risks are reviewed. The Committee reviews 
these assessments and makes adjustments to the overall risk plan as appropriate.

Implementation
The Committee comprises three operational Regional Directors, the Chairman of the Group’s Audit Committee and 
is Chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer. 
The Committee met four times during the year; in January, April, July and September.
At the January and April meetings, the Committee reviewed the bottom‑ up Office Risk Assessments produced by local 
management teams, focusing particularly on developing effective mitigation plans for these risks. 
In the July and September meetings, the Committee reviewed updated risk monitoring tools and started a process of 
formalised Scenario Planning to consider the Group’s response to extreme circumstances that the Group may experience 
in the future.
During the year the Committee has reviewed, codified and formalised the existing risk management activities undertaken 
within the Group.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
 69
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The assessment of the review was that the risk management and internal control processes of the Group were operating 
effectively. However there was also a recognition that the processes could be improved to provide formal assessment 
over a wider range of factors and therefore the Committee has restructured the monitoring of risk within the Group 
and formalised the reporting of various monitoring activities with the expansion of the internal audit function to include 
consideration of non‑ financial risks.
In particular, the Group’s risk matrix has been updated to consider non‑ financial impacts of risks using additional risk 
factors such as reputational, regulatory and personnel risks.

Assessment of the Group’s risk profile
The key risks identified and monitored by the Group are set out on the next page, with an assessment of how the potential 
impact of the individual risk has changed since last year.
The year has seen significant events impact the Group – the Ukraine crisis and significant movements in exchange rates in 
many of our emerging markets. The occurrence of these events is a reminder that the Group operates in emerging markets 
with relatively high risk levels. The probability and potential impact of these risks has increased in the year and the Group’s 
ability to manage and, when possible, mitigate these risks ensures that the Group is well placed to continue operating in 
these challenging markets.

Risks and Uncertainties
The Group identifies and monitors the key risks and uncertainties affecting the Group and runs the business in a way that 
minimises the impact of such risks where possible. 
Risks Potential impact Mitigation
Change in potential 
probability and/or impact 
of risk vs prior year
Political uncertainty 
and regulatory risk
The Group’s business is principally 
carried out in Russia, the CIS, Turkey 
and Asia. Changes in law or the 
regulatory environment could have 
an effect on some or all of the 
exhibitions of the Group. 
ITE has reduced the risk by 
establishing its business as 
independent Russian, CIS, 
Turkish and Asian companies fully 
contributing to the local economy, 
and the diversity of businesses 
across sectors and geography 
provides protection for the longer 
term prospects of the Group.
Increased uncertainty 
around the nature 
and scope of trade 
sanctions by and on 
Russia increases the 
potential impact of 
regulatory change 
on the Group.
Economic instability 
reduces demand for 
exhibition space
Reduced demand for exhibition 
space would reduce the profits of 
the Group.
ITE operates across a wide range 
of sectors and countries to minimise 
the exposure to any single market. 
ITE, through its relationships with 
venues and staff has a relatively 
flexible cost structure, allowing 
it to manage its event margins 
in the short and medium term.
An economic 
slowdown in Russia, 
our largest market, 
increases the chances 
of reducing demand 
for exhibition space.
Financial risk – 
foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to movements 
in foreign exchange rates against 
Sterling for both trading 
transactions and for the translation 
of overseas operations. The principal 
exposure is to the Euro and the 
Ruble which form the basis of the 
Group’s invoicing and to the Ruble 
which forms the base books of the 
Group’s Russian operations.
The Group seeks to minimise 
exposure by:
 – Protecting a certain amount of 
Euro denominated sales with 
forward contracts. 
 – Seeking to maximise the 
matching of costs and revenues 
in the same currency.
 – Employing a hybrid pricing 
strategy which ensures local 
customers are exposed to 
currency risk. 
It is likely that the 
major trading 
currencies of the 
Group will experience 
a higher level of 
volatility in the future. 
A 23% weakening of 
the Ruble has led to 
a 7% impact on 
headline profit. 
Commercial 
relationships
The Group has key commercial 
relationships with venues which 
secure the Group’s rights to run 
its exhibitions in the future.
These key relationships are regularly 
reviewed and the Group seeks to 
maintain its exhibition rights for up 
to at least three years forward for 
significant exhibitions where 
possible. In the longer term the 
Group seeks to maintain good 
relationships with its principal 
venues to ensure the continuance 
of availability.
Venue availability Damage to or unavailability of a 
particular venue could impact the 
Group’s short‑ term trading position. 
The Group carries business 
interruption insurance policies which 
protect profits on its largest events 
covering annual revenue of circa 
£120 million against such an event 
in the short term.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Risks Potential impact Mitigation
Change in potential 
probability and/or impact 
of risk vs prior year
Competitor risk Competition has existed in ITE’s 
markets for some years. ITE faces 
competitive pressures on a market‑ by‑ market basis.
In all of its overseas markets, ITE has 
a strong position as an international 
organiser, achieved through effective 
use of its international sales network 
and its established brands for major 
events. A single exhibition or sector 
in a market could have its prospects 
curtailed by a strong competitor 
launch; however, the breadth of 
ITE’s portfolio of events, with its 
geographic and sector diversity, 
reduce the risk of a competitive 
threat to the Group’s overall 
business.
Integration and 
management of 
acquisitions
With new acquisitions there can be 
no assurances that the Group will 
achieve the expected return on its 
investment, particularly as the 
success of any acquisition also 
depends on the Group’s ability to 
integrate the acquired business 
or assets.
The Group has formal investment 
decision criteria to identify suitable, 
earnings enhancing, acquisitions 
targets and employs experienced 
professionals to drive the acquisition 
process and performs, when 
appropriate, financial, tax, legal and 
commercial due diligence. Post‑ acquisition plans are prepared to 
ensure businesses are effectively 
integrated into the Group and that 
planned synergies are realised.
People ITE’s employees have long‑standing 
relationships with customers and a 
unique knowledge of the exhibitions 
business. Loss of key staff could 
impact the short‑ term prospects 
of a specific event or sector.
ITE has sought to build loyalty in 
its staff by ensuring remuneration 
is competitive and through a wide 
distribution of the Group’s long‑ term 
incentive plans. ITE has a good 
record of retaining its key staff 
through both growth and 
recessionary times. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

The Directors have pleasure in submitting their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 
30 September 2014.

and associate undertakings which affect the profits or net assets of the Group in the year are listed in note 5 to the financial 
statements of the Company.
Details of the Group’s performance during the year and expected future developments are contained in the Chief 
Executive’s statement on pages 10 to 14 and in the Divisional summary on pages 24 to 31. Details of the Group’s financial 
risk management policies are contained on pages 68 to 71.
Results and dividends
The audited accounts for the year ended 30 September 2014 are set out on pages 80 to 86. The Group profit for the year, 
after taxation, was £34.1 million (2013: £35.7 million).
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 4.9p (2013: 4.7p). The total dividend for the year, including the proposed final 
dividend, is 7.4p (2013: 7.0p).
Capital structure
Details of the Company’s issued share capital and movements during the year are shown in notes 9 and 10 to the financial 
statements of the Company. The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. 
Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the 
general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 26. The Trustee of the ITE Group Share Trust is not permitted to vote 
on any unvested shares held in the trust unless expressly directed to do so by the Company. A dividend waiver is in place 
in respect of the Trustee’s holding.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all shares are fully paid.
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. 
There is a schedule of matters reserved for the Board and terms of reference for Board Committees, copies of which are 
available on request, and the Corporate Governance Report can be found on pages 42 to 44.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as 
commercial contracts, bank facility agreements, property lease arrangements and employees’ share plans. None of these 
are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore, 
the Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees that provide 
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Directors’ report continued
Employees
The Group’s human resources strategy is to attract and retain talented, high‑ calibre employees focused on achieving 
excellent results. The Remuneration policy is designed to achieve this aim.
The Group places great importance in the development of its staff to support the business in meeting its objectives. 
This is reflected in the training initiatives in place for staff, both internally and externally. The Group keeps employees 
informed on matters affecting them and on matters affecting the Group’s performance through regular newsletters 
and through meetings, both formal and informal. Employees are able and are encouraged to move around the Group 
in order to experience the business environment in other offices. The Group actively encourages the participation 
of employees in activities of offices other than their own. The Group distributes long‑ term incentives widely to staff 
in all offices. At 30 September 2014 approximately 54% of staff held long‑ term incentives in some form. As a result, 
the Group’s employees identify strongly with ITE’s overall objectives. 
It is the Group’s policy to consider fully applications for employment by disabled persons, bearing in mind a number 
of factors including their suitability and fit for the role, irrespective of any disability. In the event of a member of 
staff becoming disabled, every effort would be made to ensure their continued employment and progression in the 
Group. It is Group policy that training, career development and promotion of disabled employees match that of other 
employees as far as possible.
Supplier payment policy
The Company’s policy, which is also applied to the Group, is to agree payment terms with suppliers when entering into 
each transaction to ensure that suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and abide by the terms of payment. 
The Company has no trade creditors. Trade creditors of the Group at 30 September 2014 were equivalent to 6.5 days 
(2013: 0.9 days) purchases, based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Information on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions is set out in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of the 
Annual Report on page 38.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice convening the AGM to be held at 12 noon on 29 January 2015 is contained in a circular sent to shareholders 
at the same time as this report. 
Auditors
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office. A resolution to reappoint them as the Company’s 
auditors and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Fair, balanced and understandable statement
Each of the Directors considers that the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
Directors’ Statement as to Disclosure of Information to Auditors
Each Director of the Company at the date when this report was approved confirms:
 – so far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by the Companies Act 2006) 
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
 – each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given in accordance with section 396 of the Companies Act 2006.

Opinion on financial 
statements of ITE 
Group PLC
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent 
Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2014 and of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs 
for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
 – the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the related notes 1 to 
27 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company Balance Sheet and notes 1 to 10 of 
the Company Financial Statements. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Separate opinion in 
relation to IFRSs as 
issued by the IASB
As explained in note 2 to the Group financial statements, in addition to complying with its legal 
obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the Group has also applied IFRSs 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Chief Financial Officer’s statement on page 36 
that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
 – we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
 – we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not 
a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks 
of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest 
effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team.

100% of Platform in Turkey. Some of the acquisition agreements 
are in new territories for the Group and are complex in 
structure. In addition, the accounting for these acquisitions 
is complex and involves judgement including the appropriate 
classification (associate, joint-venture, or subsidiary) and in 
relation to the valuation of acquired intangible assets. Given 
the complexity, there is a risk of inappropriate accounting and 
therefore misleading presentation in the financial statements.
We reviewed the sale and purchase agreements and discussed 
the substance of the arrangements with management, validating, 
where appropriate, to supporting evidence. We audited the 
acquisition accounting noting in particular the requirements 
of IFRS 10 (“Consolidated Financial statements”) and IFRS 11 
(“Joint Arrangements) in assessing the appropriate classification. 
We also tested the validity and completeness of consideration by 
reference to supporting evidence; and evaluated management’s 
assumptions and methodology supporting the fair values 
of net assets acquired for each significant acquisition in the 
period, by reference to, amongst other things, historical trends, 
customer attrition rates and assumptions used in similar 
historical acquisitions.
The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are the most significant 
assets on the balance sheet (£102m) and as the Group is 
acquisitive and entering new territories, it is an area of focus 
for management. Management prepare a detailed assessment 
of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets by 
cash generating unit (‘CGU’, country basis) using a number of 
judgmental assumptions (as described in note 11 to the financial 
statements) including future profitability, discount rates and 
long-term growth rates. There is a risk that the application 
of inappropriate assumptions supports assets that should 
otherwise be impaired.
This year there was particular focus on the goodwill and 
intangible assets in Russia and Ukraine due to the significant 
political and economic challenges facing the regions, and the 
subsequent impairment of goodwill in the Ukraine CGU. We 
challenged management’s assumptions used in the impairment 
assessment for goodwill and intangible assets. Specifically, this 
involved challenging the detailed FY15 Board approved cash flow 
projections, the growth rates, the discount rate and sensitivities 
used. We considered short-term cash flow projections against 
recent performance, historical forecasting accuracy and 
benchmarked the forecasts against past performance. We 
compared the forecast growth rates against independent market 
data and benchmarked the discount rate applied against a broad 
comparator group as well as using our valuation specialists to 
consider the key components of the discount rate calculation. 
We calculated a range of reasonably possible sensitivities and 
compared these to those sensitivities calculated by management.
Recoverability of venue advances
Securing the rights to venues is a key commercial risk of the 
Group. In some territories significant sums are advanced to 
secure these rights. The recoverability of venue advances is 
largely dependent on the Group’s ability to utilise the exhibition 
space for future shows at these venues, although some of the 
advances have cash repayment options. Economic conditions 
and show performance varies across ITE’s principal territories. 
There is therefore a risk that the utilisation of venues fall 
with the consequence that recoverability of venue advances 
is less certain.
We have reviewed any new advances made in the period, the 
classification of advances and the utilisation of the new and 
existing advances. This involved a review of management’s 
analysis and agreeing the repayment analysis to underlying 
records. We also challenged management’s assumptions 
surrounding the recoverability of these advances.
We held discussions with local management to understand the 
commercial arrangements for recoverability; determined whether 
there have been any changes in circumstance, disputes or new 
advances in the year; we seek confirmations from venue owners; 
and we assess recoverability by reference to forecast utilisation.   ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Revenue recognition
The Group generally invoices their customers in advance of the 
show and then defers this revenue on the balance sheet until 
the date the show has completed. Controls over the recognition 
include detailed floor plan audits after each show which help 
ensure the revenue recognised is valid. 
There is nevertheless a risk that revenues could be recorded 
against the wrong show in the wrong period or at inappropriate 
exchange rates.
In Russia and in the UK we test the operating effectiveness of 
the key revenue controls. We also perform a series of substantive 
procedures at each component in scope which included: testing 
sales from exhibition floor plans to accounting records; assessing 
whether the show end dates used are consistent with the 
published show calendar; and performing a gross margin analysis 
to look for outliers and to seek evidence/explanations where 
unusual variances noted.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered 
by the Audit Committee, discussed on page 46.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. 
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described 
above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters
Our application of 
materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed 
or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.0 million (2013: £2.0 million), which is 3.5% of 
headline pre-tax profit; 4.8% of profit before tax; and 2% of equity. We have used profit before tax 
as our basis for our assessment of materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences 
in excess of £40,000 (2013: £40,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope 
of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, 
including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on this assessment our group audit scope focused on the UK, Russia, Turkey and Azerbaijan. 
These entities represent the principal business units and account for 83% of the Group’s revenue, 
85% of the operating profit and 73% of net assets. Our audit work at each location was executed at 
levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality. Our 
specific audit procedures in Azerbaijan replaced work performed last year in Kazakhstan. Coverage 
has remained consistent with the prior year, with business units accounting for 85% of the Group’s 
revenue and operating profit in 2013.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical 
procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement 
of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit 
of specified account balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed 
so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or a senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the 
principal locations (2014: Russia and Turkey; 2013: Russia and Kazakhstan) where the Group audit 
scope was focused. For each component in scope, we reviewed and challenged the key issues and 
audit findings, attended the component close meetings and reviewed formal reporting from the 
component auditors. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are 
required to report by 
exception
Adequacy of explanations 
received and accounting 
records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 – the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures 
of Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report 
arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance 
Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other 
information in the 
Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between 
our knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective 
responsibilities of 
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply 
with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools 
aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality 
controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent 
partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by 
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the consolidated accounts
For the year ended 30 September 2014
1 General information
ITE Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is given on page 128. 
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 39 and 
in note 3. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the 
accounting policies set out below.
Impact of new accounting standards
New, revised or changes to existing standards which have been adopted by the Group in the year ended 
30 September 2014
The following new standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year but have not impacted the 
reported results or the financial position:
 – Amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’; 
 – Amendment to IAS 27;
 – Amendment to IAS 28;
 – Amendment to IAS 32;
 – Amendment to IFRS 7;
 – IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’;
 – IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’;
 – IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’; and
 – IFRS 13 ’Fair Value Measurement’
The adoption of these new standards and interpretation has not changed any previously reported figures. Adoption of 
IFRS 12, IFRS 13 and the amendments to IAS 32 and IFRS 7 have resulted in additional disclosures being made, but have not 
changed the underlying figures included in the financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been 
applied in these ‘financial statements’ were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted 
by the EU):
 – Amendments to IAS 19;
 – Amendments to IAS 36;
 – Amendments to IAS 39; 
 – Amendments to IFRS 11;
 – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38;
 – Amendments to IAS 27;
 – Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28;
 – IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement’; and
 – IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for:
 – IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – This will introduce a number of changes in the presentation of financial instruments.
2 Basis of accounting
ITE Group plc (‘the Company’) is a UK listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to 
as ‘the Group’. The Company is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. In addition, the Group has complied with IFRS as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’).
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses. These 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time 
and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions are 
reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are made.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future as disclosed in the Chief Financial Officer’s statement on page 36. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

For the year ended 30 September 2014
2 Basis of accounting continued
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, 
except for the revaluation of financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and the subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company 
drawn up to 30 September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. 
The interest of non controlling shareholders is stated at the non controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values 
of assets and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used 
in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified separately from the Group’s equity 
therein. Non controlling interest consists of the amount of those interests as at the date of the original business 
combination and the non controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses 
applicable to the non controlling interest in excess of their interest in the subsidiaries equity are allocated against 
non controlling interest even if this results in a deficit balance.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Any costs attributable to the business combination are 
expensed directly to the Income Statement. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet 
the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current 
assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current assets held for sale 
and discontinued operations), which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost 
of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised. If the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the 
Income Statement.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted 
against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the 
fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. 
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the non controlling interest’s proportion of the 
net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value 
of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and 
reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested 
for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro-rata on the basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
 89
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
2 Basis of accounting continued
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Intangible assets
Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost. Customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor 
databases are measured at fair value. Computer software, customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor 
databases have a definite useful life and are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is 
calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives 
are typically between three and ten years for customer relationships, for some trademarks up to 20 years and for visitor 
databases between five and eight years. Computer software is amortised over four years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment is recognised 
immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement immediately, unless the relevant asset 
is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, 
on the following bases:
Leasehold improvements  – term of lease
Plant and equipment  – 4 to 10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, 
or where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

2 Basis of accounting continued
Associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence. Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control over those policies.
A joint venture is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise joint control. Joint control exists when decisions 
about the activities of the entity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements using 
the equity method of accounting. Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost 
as adjusted by post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture, less any 
impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate or joint venture in excess of Group’s interest 
in that entity (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the 
associate or joint venture) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Where a Group Company transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant associate or joint venture. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of 
the asset transferred in which case an appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Venue advances
Venue advances arise where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either off-setting 
against future venue hire or by cash repayment. Where the advance can be settled in cash, the loan balance is measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method where the impact of discounting is material. Appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that 
the asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are 
recognised at cost as prepayments in venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Financial Instruments
Classes of financial instruments
The Group aggregates its financial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics. The details of 
financial instruments by class are disclosed in note 21 to the accounts.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: investments, cash and cash equivalents, loans and 
receivables and derivative assets at fair value through profit or loss. The classification is determined by management upon 
initial recognition, and is based on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the Income Statement where there is objective evidence of impairment. Financial assets are derecognised 
(in full or partly) when the Group’s rights to cash flows from the respective assets have expired or have been transferred 
and the Group has neither exposure to the risks inherent in those assets nor entitlement to rewards from them.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
2 Basis of accounting continued
Investments
Investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market are classified as available-for-sale financial assets 
and stated at fair value. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 21. Gains and losses arising from changes 
in the fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve 
with the exception of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gain 
and losses on monetary assets which are recognised directly in the Income Statement. Where the investment is disposed 
of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve 
is reclassified to the Income Statement.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the Income Statement when the Group’s right to 
receive the dividends is established.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes 
in value. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition 
cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value with all realised gains or losses recognised in the Income Statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market. This category includes the following classes of financial assets: trade and other receivables and 
venue advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the Income Statement when there is 
objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The estimates are based on specific credit circumstances and the Group’s 
historical bad receivables experience. No interest is charged on the loans and receivables, due to either their short-term 
nature or specific arrangements in place, and hence the effective interest rate method is not applied.
Derivative assets
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no 
or little net initial investment and is settled at a future date. Derivative assets are classified as at Fair Value Through Profit 
or Loss (‘FVTPL’). Derivative assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured 
to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the Income Statement. 
These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Group’s treasury policies.
Financial liabilities 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: written put options, bank borrowings, trade and other 
payables held at amortised cost and derivative liabilities through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Written put options
Any contract with a single or multiple settlement option that contains an obligation for the Group to purchase equity in 
a subsidiary for cash gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the repurchase price. An amount equal to the 
liability is recorded in equity on initial recognition of a written put option. The liability is subsequently remeasured through 
the Income Statement.
Where considered significant, the Group’s written put options are discounted to their appropriate value. The unwinding 
of the discount is charged through the Income Statement over the period to exercise.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Finance charges are accounted for on 
an accruals basis in the Income Statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise. Loan and overdraft interest and associated costs that are considered to 
be financing in nature are presented as financing activities in the cash flow statement. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
92
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
For the year ended 30 September 2014
2 Basis of accounting continued
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Trade payables are derecognised in full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it expires, is cancelled or replaced 
by a new liability with substantially modified terms. Trade and other payables are short-term and there is no interest 
charged in connection with these, hence the effective interest method is not applied.
Derivative liabilities
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in an underlying variable, requires no 
or little net initial investment and is settled at a future date. Derivative liabilities are classified as Fair Value Through Profit 
or Loss. Derivative liabilities are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair 
value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement. These derivatives are 
acquired in full compliance with the Group’s treasury policies.
Hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group uses 
derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition in the Income Statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates its derivative 
financial instruments as cash flow hedges. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the 
remaining maturity of the instrument is more than twelve months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 
twelve months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and 
the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. 
At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is 
used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values of cash flows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The effective portion of changes in the fair value 
of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement as investment 
revenue or finance costs respectively. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the Income Statement in the periods 
when the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement, in the same line of the Income Statement as the recognised 
hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in 
equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or 
loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity 
is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
The Group’s use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s financial policies. Further details on these policies can 
be found in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 39.
Fair values
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction 
between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The Group determines the fair value of its financial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely 
accepted valuation techniques for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cash flows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer quotes 
for similar instruments and use of comparable arm’s length transactions.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
2 Basis of accounting continued
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business 
net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised on completion of an event. Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs 
relating to future events are deferred. The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income 
and prepaid event costs respectively until the show has completed. If an event is anticipated to make a loss then the 
prepaid event costs held on the balance sheet as at the balance sheet date are written off in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest 
rate applicable.
Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions
Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, 
revenues and costs are recognised in the Income Statement.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after the share of results of associates & joint ventures and profit or loss on disposal of Group 
undertakings and before investment income and finance costs.
Headline pre-tax profit
Headline pre-tax profit is a non-statutory measure of performance used by the Group as it better reflects the underlying 
trading performance. The amounts adjusted relate to acquisition or disposal related activities, or exceptional items 
(such as impairment). It is defined as profit or loss from operations before tax expense not including amortisation of 
acquired intangibles, impairment of goodwill, profits or losses arising on disposal of Group undertakings, revaluation of 
financial liabilities in relation to put options over non-controlling interests, imputed interest charges on discounted put 
option liabilities, gains or losses on the settlement of contingent consideration, direct costs on completed and pending 
acquisitions & disposals and tax on income from associates and joint ventures.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax charge is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will 
be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual 
rate where applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the 
rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the 
retranslation of monetary items, are included in income for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation 
of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in income for the period except for differences arising on the 
retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity. For such 
non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Group’s accounting policies for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative 
financial instruments.
On consolidation, the monthly results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for each 
month, and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising are classified 
as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or 
as expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 (the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates), cumulative translation 
differences for all foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero. Consequently, any gain or loss 
on disposal will exclude translation differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Employee Share Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company 
held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off 
to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
Pension and other retirement benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan in the United Kingdom. Contributions payable are charged to the 
income statement as they fall due as an operating expense.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied IFRS 2 (Share-based payments). IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 
7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding 
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments 
are not made on such a basis. Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by 
management and have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

2 Basis of accounting continued
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-
generating units to which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimation of future cash flows expected from the cash-generating unit to perpetuity and a suitable discount rate in order 
to calculate present value. The period used in the calculation is based on management’s average expectation of the period 
over which the value will be derived from the cash generating units. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets 
at 30 September 2014 is £67 million and £35 million respectively.
Acquired intangible assets
The valuation of acquired intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future 
cash flows arising from customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases to determine the value of 
those intangible assets. The key assumptions used in estimating the net present value of the additional future cash flows 
are the discount rate, royalty rate, attrition rate and the period over which the intangible assets affect future cash flows.
Intangible asset useful economic lives
The life of an intangible asset is estimated by management based on the expected period over which cash flows generated 
from that asset will arise. The amortisation charge reflected in the financial statements is directly impacted by the 
estimation of useful lives by management.
Share-based payments 
The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at their estimated fair value 
at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually 
vest. The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Group’s share price 
volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives. Management regularly performs a true-up of 
the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest.
Taxation 
Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a tax structure which makes 
the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of 
the Group and is often dependent on the efficiency of legal processes. Such issues can take several years to resolve. The 
Group takes a considered view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that 
the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Group’s results 
and future cash flows.
3 Segmental information
IFRS 8 introduced the term Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The Senior Management Board is considered to 
be the CODM and consists of Neil Jones (Chief Financial Officer), Stephen Keen, Suzanne King, Baris Onay, Nik Rudge, 
Alexander Shtalenkov, Russell Taylor (Chief Executive Officer) and Colette Tebbutt.
ITE’s reportable segments are strategic business units that are based in different geographic locations, predominantly 
in the developing and emerging markets. Each business unit is managed separately and has a different marketing strategy 
as determined by the local management. The products and services offered by each business unit are identical across 
the Group.
The Group evaluates the performance of its segments on the basis of headline pre-tax profit and operating profit. 
See note 2 for more details.
The revenue and profit before taxation are attributable to the Group’s one principal activity, the organisation of trade 
exhibitions, conferences and related activities and can be analysed by geographic segment as follows. No individual 
customer amounts to more than 10% of Group revenues. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

11 Goodwill continued
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected 
to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the reportable segments 
as follows:
2014
£000
2013
£000
Russia 34,066 41,015
Central Asia & Caucasus 7,301 7,968
Eastern & Southern Europe 10,623 15,976
UK & Western Europe 9,083 7,662
Asia 5,943 5,954
67,016 78,575
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be 
impaired. The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key 
assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes 
to cash flows during the period.
Management estimates discount rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks 
specific to the cash-generating units. The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash generating units are between 12% 
and 20% (2013: 13% and 15%).
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based upon the most recent one-year financial plans approved by the Board and 
extrapolates the planned cash flows. Growth rates beyond the detailed plans are based on IMF forecasts of GDP growth 
rates in the local markets, with management judgements applied to the first three years. These growth rates, of between 
0% and 10% (2013: between 2% and 7%), do not exceed the long-term growth rates for the economies in which these 
businesses operate.
The Group considers that the only goodwill relating to a CGU that is individually significant (more than 20% of the Group’s 
total carrying value of goodwill and intangibles) is in respect of the Moscow business.
The Moscow business has goodwill with a carrying value of £25 million. The intangible assets for the Moscow business have 
a finite useful life and are amortised in accordance with the Group amortisation policy disclosed in note 2. The recoverable 
amount of the goodwill and intangible assets was determined using the value in use calculation using the following 
information.
 – Cash flow forecasts based on the 2015 financial plan approved by the Board and extrapolated based on assumed 
long-term growth rate for the Moscow business of 2%, based on IMF forecasts of GDP growth rate in Russia.
 – A pre-tax discount rate of 12%.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £290 million. Sensitivity 
analysis has been carried out considering reasonably possible changes to the discount rate and the forecast cash 
flows, the key assumptions that the value in use calculation is most sensitive to. Reasonably possible changes to these 
key assumptions have been deemed to be a 1% increase in the discount rate and a 5% decrease in forecast cash flows, 
with neither change in key assumptions resulting in the need to recognise impairment.
The impairment testing conducted by the Group at 30 September 2014 indicated no impairment in any CGU other 
than Ukraine. 
Ukraine
An impairment loss of £6.2 million has been recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of goodwill 
in Ukraine within the Eastern and Southern Europe segment.
The impairment loss in Ukraine reflects reduced levels of exhibitor attendance particularly from international participants 
and lower future economic growth predictions for Ukraine.
The impairment loss was based on the value in use calculated using key assumptions stated above as well as specific 
factors applicable to Ukraine. These assumptions were as follows: ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
For the year ended 30 September 2014
11 Goodwill continued
Budgeted cash flows – the budgeted cash flows have been based on the most recent financial plans approved by the 
Board, which take into consideration management’s expectations of the future performance of the business in light of 
the difficult economic conditions and political uncertainty in Ukraine.
Growth rates – the growth rates have been based on management forecasts for the annual growth rate for the Ukrainian 
business. The assumed growth rates were 0% in FY16 and FY17 and 4.5% thereafter, based on IMF forecasts.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate – the pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used was 20%. This discount rate was based 
on the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital for the Ukraine business.
Forecast period – cash flows were forecast over a three-year period and into perpetuity.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and growth rates used. The Group has conducted a 
sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on these assumptions arising from a range of reasonably possible 
trading and economic scenarios. The scenarios have been performed separately for each CGU with the sensitivities 
summarised as follows:
 – An increase in the discount rate by 1%.
 – A decrease of 5% on forecast cash flows over the term for all CGUs.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease 
in forecast cash flows in any CGU other than Ukraine and India.
Given the current uncertainty in Ukraine, a reasonably possible change in assumptions covers a very wide range of 
outcomes including further impairment of the remaining £4 million balance of assets of the Ukraine business.
For information, for the Ukraine business, an increase in the discount rate by 1% would increase the required impairment 
charge by £0.2 million; a decrease of 5% on forecast cash flows over the term of the forecast would also increase the 
required impairment charge by £0.2 million.
For information, for the India business, an increase in the discount rate by 1% would decrease the value in use by 
£0.4 million resulting in potential impairment of £25,000; a decrease of 5% on forecast cash flows over the term 
of the forecast would not result in any impairment needed.

1 Acquisition took total shareholding to 100%.
Details of the aggregate net assets acquired as adjusted from book to fair value, and the attributable goodwill are 
presented as follows:
Platform
On 10 October 2013, E Uluslararası Fuar Tanıtım Hizmetleri A.Ş, the Group’s wholly owned Turkish subsidiary, acquired 
100% of the shares of Platform Exhibitions Inc, a company incorporated in Turkey, for cash consideration of £5.7 million 
and deferred consideration, contingent on the results of the 2014 show, estimated at the time of acquisition at £2.7 million.
The acquired business organises the Beauty Eurasia exhibition which takes place in June and serves the beauty and 
cosmetics industries in Turkey. As such the acquisition of this company is consistent with ITE’s strategy of expanding 
into new sectors in existing markets, and enhances ITE’s presence in the beauty sector.
The Group incurred transaction costs of £0.4 million in relation to this acquisition, which are included in administrative 
expenses. An additional £0.6 million expense is recognised in financing costs in relation to the increase in contingent 
consideration payable as a result of a stronger than expected performance on the 2014 show, resulting in a final 
deferred payment of £3.3 million on 5 September 2014.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Goodwill arising on acquisition of £4.9 million represents the perceived value placed by the Group on synergies expected 
across its beauty portfolio and within the existing Turkish business.
The acquired business has contributed £1.9 million to Group revenue and £1.1 million to Group profit since acquisition. 
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2013 the contribution of the acquired business to Group results would 
be unchanged.
Scoop
On 1 December 2013, the Group exercised its call option to acquire the 60% of Scoop International Fashion Limited which 
it did not already own.
The acquired business organises Scoop, a high end womenswear fashion exhibition in the UK. The acquisition is expected 
to strengthen the Group’s position in the UK fashion sector.
Disposal of investment
In order to recognise and fully consolidate the assets and liabilities of the Scoop subsidiary, first the Group derecognised 
its existing 40% investment in Scoop previously recorded within Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. This resulted 
in a gain of £1.0 million which represents the difference between the fair value of £1.2 million and book value of £0.2 million 
of the existing holding. This gain is recognised within administrative expenses.

12 Goodwill acquired through business combinations continued
Goodwill arising on acquisition of £1.4 million reflects expected synergies with the Group’s existing UK fashion business.
The acquired business has contributed £2.1 million to Group revenue and £0.8 million to profit since acquisition. 
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2013 the contribution of the acquired business to Group results would 
be unchanged.
On 4 September 2014 the Group sold 5% of Scoop International Fashion Limited to one of the previous shareholders of the 
business for proceeds of £0.1 million.
 
Summit
On 3 February 2014, the Group’s put option to acquire the 90% of Summit Trade Events Limited which it did not already 
own was exercised.
The acquired business organises a number of conferences in the Oil & Gas sector in Turkmenistan. As such the acquisition 
of this company is consistent with ITE’s strategy of expanding into existing sectors in new markets.
Disposal of investment
In order to recognise and fully consolidate the assets and liabilities of the Summit subsidiary, first the Group derecognised its 
existing 10% investment in Summit previously recorded within Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. This resulted in a 
loss of £0.3 million which represents the difference between the fair value of £0.2 million and book value of £0.5 million of the 
existing holding. This loss is recognised within administrative expenses.

The values used in accounting for the identifiable assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are provisional in nature 
at balance sheet date. If necessary, adjustments will be made to these carrying values and the related goodwill, 
within twelve months of the acquisition date.
The gain on bargain purchase, which is included within administrative expenses, results from the terms of the put and call 
options contained in the contractual arrangements.
The cost of the acquisition includes £0.3 million of consideration which is contingent upon the results of the business for 
the year ended 31 December 2015.
The acquired business has contributed £0.6 million to Group revenue and £0.3 million to profit since acquisition. If the 
acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2013 the acquired business would have contributed an additional £1.0 million 
to Group revenue and an additional £0.2 million to Group profit.
Other acquisitions
On 5 May 2014, EUF, a subsidiary of the Group, exercised its put option to acquire the remaining 20% of Yem Fuar which

1 The net liabilities balance include ITE’s share in net liabilities of Sinostar ITE amounting to approximately £21 million. Of this balance, approximately 
£16 million related to loans due to the Group.
The Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, recognised initially 
at cost. The carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise ITE’s share of the profit or loss of the associate or 
joint venture after the date of acquisition. ITE’s share of the profit or loss of the associate or joint venture is recognised 
in the income statement. Distributions received from the associate or joint venture also reduce the carrying amount of 
the investment.
On 14 November 2013, ITE’s wholly owned subsidiary, ITE Overseas Ltd, established a 50:50 joint venture, Sinostar ITE, 
with Hong Kong based Worldcoat Exhibitions Ltd, for an investment of £34.1 million, of which £3.9 million was deferred 
and contingent upon the results of the business for the year ended 31 March 2014. As part of the transaction, Sinostar 
ITE acquired the ChinaCoat exhibition from Sinostar International Ltd. ChinaCoat is the leading coatings and finishings 
exhibition in China and South East Asia. As such the acquisition of this joint venture is consistent with ITE’s strategy 
of expanding into new high growth markets.
The Group incurred transaction costs of £0.4m in relation to the acquisition of Sinostar ITE, which are included 
in administrative expenses.
On 11 June 2014, ITE’s wholly owned subsidiary, ITE Asia Pte Ltd, acquired 50% of the issued share capital of PT Debindo 
Unggul Buana Makmur (‘Debindo’) for total consideration of £4.9 million, of which £1.9 million is deferred and contingent 
upon the results of the business for the year ended 31 December 2015. In addition the Group holds put and call options to 
acquire an additional 26% of the business in 2017. Debindo owns the Indobuildtech exhibitions which serve the building and 
construction industries in Indonesia and the surrounding region. As such the acquisition is consistent with ITE’s strategy of 
expanding into new high growth markets.
During the year the Group also increased its investment in Lentewenc, its associate in Poland, by £0.1 million, and acquired 
a 40% stake in The Hub (Hong Kong) Limited for £0.2 million. The Hub organises fashion exhibitions in Hong Kong.
During the year ABEC, one of the Group’s associates, demerged a property-owning entity from their business resulting 
in the receipt of proceeds from the demerger of £2.5 million.

18 Bank Borrowings
At 30 September 2014, following a refinancing of the Group’s borrowing facilities on 30 July 2014, the Group had significant 
available borrowing headroom available through an £80 million multi-currency revolving credit facility which is committed 
through to 30 June 2018. This replaced the Group’s previous facilities, which were in place at 30 September 2013, which 
comprised a £10 million multi-currency revolving credit facility and a £20 million multi-currency net overdraft facility. 
The new facility has been similarly secured by a guarantee between a number of Group companies.
The Group’s borrowings are arranged at floating interest rates, thus exposing the Group to interest rate risk. Drawdowns 
under the new facility bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin of 2.15%. Previously, drawdowns under the 
revolving credit facility bore interest at interbank rates plus a margin of 2.0%; drawdowns under the overdraft bore interest 
at interbank rates plus a margin of 1.75%. During the year ended 30 September 2014, the average interest rate on the 
Group’s borrowings approximated 2.4% (2013: 2.3%).
The total drawdowns under the facility of £42.9 million at 30 September 2014 were all denominated in Sterling (2013: 
£15.9 million in Sterling, £1.8 million in US Dollars, £2.9 million in Euros). The Directors estimate that the carrying value 
of the borrowings approximates their fair value. At 30 September 2014 the Group had £37.1 million (2013: £9.4 million) 
of undrawn committed facilities.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

The Group seeks to minimise the effects of foreign currency risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the 
risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board. Compliance 
with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis. The Group does not enter into financial 
instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.

Financial risk management
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency 
and interest rate), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. This note presents the Group’s exposure to each of the above 
risks. The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks can be found in the Strategic report 
on pages 1 to 39.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Board has established policies to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value 
of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest 
rates. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. Market risk 
exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence, exposures to exchange rate 
fluctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward-plus 
or forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the

Forward foreign exchange contracts 
As at 30 September 2014 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the Group has 
committed to amounted to £64.1 million (2013: £61.5 million). These arrangements are designed to address significant 
exchange exposures for the next 36 months and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing 
the Group to less than six months or more than 36 months in the future.
At 30 September 2014, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a net asset of approximately £3.3 million 
(2013: net liability of £0.4 million). These amounts are based on market valuations.
Interest rate risk management
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, other than cash, the Group’s income and operating cash flows 
are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its 
borrowings at floating interest rates. This risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate level of floating 
interest rate borrowings. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed 
in the liquidity risk section of this note.

Credit risk management
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its contractual obligations. The Group’s principal financial 
assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative financial instruments. 
These represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The Group has adopted a policy of only 
dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group’s 
objective is to ensure all customers have paid before any service is provided to them. The concentration of credit risk 
is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The ageing profile of the Group’s trade receivables and the details of the Group’s allowances for doubtful receivables 
can be seen below.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments arises due to where the liquid funds are held. 
The territories in which ITE operates do not always have banks with high credit ratings assigned by international 
credit rating agencies such as Moody’s and Fitch. The Group aims to minimise the exposure to credit risk by minimising 
the level of cash held in such banks. The Group’s exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously 
monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.

Management review debtors ageing on a contractual basis and also based on when an event has been held. The Group 
raise invoices on events using stage payments. Any overdue amounts, after the stage payment due date, are reviewed 
and chased. Management also review the debts due based on when an event has taken place, as this is typically when 
the service is provided. Both measures are included in the table above as both are used by management to manage 
outstanding debts.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by 
the Group’s management based on prior experience, specific credit issues and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical 
areas and the Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The 
demographics of the Group’s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country, in which the customers 
operate, has less of an influence on credit risk. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade 
receivables when there is objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full. The allowance is recognised and 
measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows. Where 
material, it is discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition. The main component of this allowance 
is a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposure on shows which have taken place but the debt 
has not been collected in full. This allowance is determined by reference to the specific circumstances of each show and 
past experience.
The details of the movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables are shown below.

Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due. Such risk may result from 
inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests 
with the Board of Directors. They have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of 
the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt 
facilities as appropriate.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure 
of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdraft and bank loan which is disclosed in note 17 and note 
18 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as 
disclosed in note 23 and in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £7.0 million (2013: £4.3 million) available for offset 
against future profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the 
unpredictability of future profit streams. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £20 million (2013: £46.1 million). No liability 
has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

23 Share capital continued
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. At the Extraordinary General Meeting 
held on 17 November 1998, shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE Group Employee Share Ownership 
Trust (ESOT). The terms of the ESOT allow the trustees to transfer shares to employees who exercise options under the 
Company’s Share Option Schemes, to grant options to employees and to accumulate shares by buying in the market or 
subscribing for shares at market value. The ESOT is capable of holding a maximum of 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital. The ESOT reserve arises in connection with the Employee Share Ownership Trust. The amount of the reserve 
represents the deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds for the consideration paid for the Company’s shares purchased 
by the Trust which had not vested unconditionally in employees at the balance sheet date.
The ESOT held 3,703,588 shares in ITE Group plc at 30 September 2014 (2013: 3,654,988 shares). During the year 689,000 
share options and 906,500 nominal share options under the Employees Performance Share Plan were granted against 
ESOT held shares. During the year, the Company purchased 1,665,000 shares for the ESOT for a cost of £3.8 million. 
The market value of the ordinary shares held by the ESOT at 30 September 2014 was £6.3 million (2013: £9.9 million).
The Company has agreed to make available to the ESOT an interest-free loan of up to £12.5 million for the purpose of 
buying shares. At 30 September 2014, the amount of the loan drawn down was £11.6 million. The ITE Group plc Company 
only profit and loss account and balance sheet include the results of the ESOT for the year ended 30 September 2014. The 
trustees have waived their current and future rights to all dividend entitlement on the shares held by the ESOT. 1,616,400 
options were exercised from ESOT during the year. The total consideration for the options exercised from ESOT was 
£1,423,212. 6,224,711 of outstanding options are to be settled by ESOT, so all shares held by the ESOT are under option 
as at 30 September 2014. Details of the options in issue and their exercise dates can be seen at note 26 to the accounts.

26 Share-based payments
The Company operate two share option schemes.
Share option plans
The Company operates a share option plan for certain employees of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal 
to the average quoted market price of the Company’s share on the date of grant. The vesting period is either three or five 
years and are exercisable up to ten years from granting. The options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before 
the options vest.
Performance share plans
The Company operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for executives and staff. Awards under the PSP are at an 
exercise value of 1p. Awards can be made to an employee over shares up to a maximum of 100% of base salary, or 150% 
for the Chief Executive, each year based on market value. The vesting period is three years and awards are exercisable up 
to ten years from the date of grant. For conditional awards the vesting is automatic on the satisfaction of performance 
targets. The options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. The awards are also subject 
to a performance target. Further details of the performance targets can be found in the Remuneration committee report 
on page 61.

Financial statements
Notes to the Company accounts
For the year ended 30 September 2014
1 Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The financial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Group going concern disclosure on page 87.
These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Companies Act 2006 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) and have been 
applied consistently.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in Financial Reporting Standard No.1 (Revised 1996) from the 
requirement to produce a cash flow statement on the grounds that its cash flows are included in the Group cash 
flow statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption granted by paragraph 3(c) of Financial Reporting Standard No. 8, 
Related Party Transactions, not to disclose transactions with other members of the Group.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year 
and the preceding year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets
Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. 
The estimated useful lives are up to 20 years.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors and creditors
Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value. Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for 
on an accrual basis to profit or loss.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) 
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits 
and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments 
in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all 
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the 
future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
 123
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
1 Basis of accounting continued
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement 
to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements. 
Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled 
over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences 
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at 
that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets are included in profit or loss for the period.
Employee Share Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company 
held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off 
to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
Details of the Company’equity-settled share-based payments are included in note 26 to the Group accounts.
2 Profit for the year
The profit after tax for the year ended 30 September 2014 was £59.1 million (2013: profit of £5.8 million). As permitted 
by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

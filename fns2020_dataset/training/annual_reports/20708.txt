1 Alliance & Leicester I am pleased to be able to report another
successful year for Alliance & Leicester plc.
In a year when we celebrated 150 years 
of serving customers, the Group made
excellent progress in developing our
business. That progress is reﬂected in our
ﬁnancial results, in the growth we have
seen in sales and revenues, and in the
increasing optimism amongst
commentators about our future.
Financial Results
Pre-tax proﬁt in 2002 was £468m, up 
18% on 2001. Basic earnings per share
were up 21% to 68.0p. The Board has
proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 26.9p, 
making a total dividend of 39.9p, a 10%
increase on the equivalent ﬁgure for 2001.
Board and Management
In June 2002, Richard Pym became Group 
Chief Executive. Richard has been with the
Group since 1992 and his leadership and
focus have made, and will continue to make,
a tremendous difference to the performance
of the Group. I very much enjoy working
with Richard and, on behalf of the Group
Board, I thank him for his efforts.
Also in June, Chris Rhodes was appointed
to the Group Board as Operations Director.
Chris has been at the forefront of a number
of business developments in the Group,
including our strategic partnerships with
MBNA and Legal & General, as well as
leading a variety of signiﬁcant systems 
and process improvements which are
fundamental to delivering our strategy.

Chairman’s Statement
John Windeler, Chairman 3 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
In September, Richard Banks became
responsible, as Wholesale Banking Director,
for the Group’s Commercial Banking and
Treasury businesses. David Bennett remains
our Group Finance Director, and details of
all executive directors’ responsibilities can
be found on pages 26 and 27 of the
Report & Accounts.
Upon Richard Pym’s appointment, I reverted
to being non-executive Chairman of the
Group. I would like to thank the Board and
all the management of Alliance & Leicester
for the support given to me during my
period as executive chairman.
Business Performance
Each of the Group’s business sectors had a
successful 2002, as is highlighted elsewhere
in this Report. These results reﬂect the
excellent work of the executive team,
under Richard Pym’s leadership, as well 
as the dedication and ability of our staff. 
Outlook
Alliance & Leicester is widely regarded as
being a low-risk bank. We have worked
hard to gain and maintain that reputation,
consistently pursuing prudent lending
criteria in each of our markets, and we 
will continue to do so.
The outlook for the UK economy, and the
housing market in particular, is uncertain
for 2003. We are conﬁdent, however, 
that if the UK economy broadly follows 
the path suggested by consensus forecasts,
then we will be able to hit our targets 
and continue to deliver shareholder returns
that compare well with our peer group. 
We are also conﬁdent that, should
economic conditions prove to be
signiﬁcantly tougher than current forecasts
suggest, we are better positioned than
many of our competitors to ride out any
economic turbulence – again to the beneﬁt
of our shareholders. We are growing
revenues and controlling costs successfully,
is at the heart of Alliance & Leicester’s
business activities. We believe that we 
have an important role to play in our 
local communities, by being a responsible
employer and through charitable giving
and staff volunteering. We have recently
published our ﬁrst Corporate Social
Responsibility Report and we have
signiﬁcantly increased our contribution to
our local communities through donations,
gifts-in-kind and staff volunteering in 2002.
The Future
In July 2000 we set out a vision for Alliance
& Leicester, to become “the most customer
focused ﬁnancial services provider in the
UK – bar none”. The Group continues to
make very positive progress towards meeting
that vision, and the ﬁnancial beneﬁts are
shown in our 2002 results. The Board has
now approved further targets for the
Group, taking us through 2004, and
achievement of those targets will further
demonstrate the value of our strategy for
our shareholders.
By maintaining our focus on driving real
value, on simpliﬁcation and on excellent
customer service, I am conﬁdent that 
2003 will be another successful year 
for the Group.
John R. Windeler, Chairman
but that is not, and nor will it be, at the
expense of asset quality standards.
Corporate Social Responsibility
As well as achieving shareholder value from
our business performance, we also recognise
the wider impact we have on all our
stakeholders. Corporate social responsibility
“During 2002 the Group made
excellent progress in implementing
our customer focused strategy.”
John R. Windeler, Chairman I took over as Group Chief Executive in
June 2002 and as this is my ﬁrst report 
to shareholders it is pleasing to be 
able to report on a successful year for 
Alliance & Leicester.
In 2002 Alliance & Leicester made excellent
progress against all its strategic objectives
whilst delivering a good set of results. Pre-tax
proﬁt was up 18% to £468m, and our core
proﬁt, before strategic costs, was up 8% at
£519m. Earnings per share (EPS) increased
by 21%, and the Board has proposed 
a ﬁnal dividend of 26.9p per share, 
making a total dividend of 39.9p, an
increase of 10%. 
Commentators often refer to Alliance &
Leicester as a low risk bank. In all the
business sectors in which we lend we aim 
to be at the prudent end of the credit
spectrum. However, lending money to
customers can never be viewed as a zero 
risk business, and the economic environment
we face in 2003 is more uncertain, with
much of the world economy entering 2003
in a somewhat depressed state. Although
the UK economy held up well in 2002 on
the back of a strong consumer sector, 
and the housing market remained very
strong, we will continue to be alert to
economic risks in 2003 and will maintain 
our cautious stance. Our current planning is
based on the consensus of market forecasts
which currently forecast GDP growth of
between 2 – 2.5% in 2003. We expect single
ﬁgure increases in average house prices –
although that may mask house price
decreases in some localised areas.
Strategic Objectives
Our primary aim remains the maximisation
of shareholder value. We have three
strategic objectives to enable us to achieve
this and have made excellent progress
against each of these objectives in 2002: 
• revenue growth in 2002 was 5.7% 
(like for like, excluding income from the
rationalisation of properties), exceeding
our target of 4%;
• we achieved our targeted cost savings 
of £20m; 
• and we made signiﬁcant progress in
improving our capital efﬁciency by
reducing our regulatory tier 1 capital
ratio to 7.6%.
Over the next two years we have one new
primary target, which is to deliver double
digit percentage growth in basic earnings
per share. This target is supported by our
existing goals relating to revenue growth,
costs and the management of our capital. 
Customer Focus 
Our vision remains that of being “the 
most customer focused ﬁnancial services
provider in the UK – bar none”. We are
making good progress towards that vision,
and all that we do within the business is
driven by our brand values. We aim to
attract new potential customers by 
offering them a “better value” proposition,
to convert potential customers into 
actual customers by being “simple and
straightforward” to deal with, to keep
customers and encourage them to buy
more from us by offering “friendly and
approachable” service, and by appropriate
“management of the customer relationship”.
We have simpliﬁed our marketing 
material across the Group, introducing 
a cost-effective, clearer and more
consistent approach. Our branding
emphasises the “real plus” which we can
provide to the customer, re-inforced by 
the visual ‘plus’ symbol within our logo. 
In addition, later in 2003 we intend that
our Commercial Banking brands, currently
marketed under the names of Girobank,
Sovereign Finance and Alliance & Leicester
Business Banking, will be consolidated
under the name Alliance & Leicester
Commercial Bank.
Retail Banking
Our Retail Banking business had an
excellent year in 2002. Pre-tax proﬁt of
£432m was up 14%, income was up over
5%, costs were down 2% and asset quality
remains very strong.
During 2002 we focused Retail Banking’s
resources on mortgages, unsecured personal
loans, current accounts and savings. We refer
to these four products as the “Core 4”.

Core 4
In the ﬁrst half of the year the mortgage
lending market grew signiﬁcantly faster than
we and many market commentators had
expected. Our net lending market share 
in the ﬁrst half of the year was 1.7%. 
However, the second half saw a signiﬁcant
improvement, with our net lending market
share rising to 2.7%, giving a total for the
year of 2.2%. Whilst this is below our 2002
year end market share of total UK mortgage
balances of 3.5%, we achieved our goals in
the markets and distribution channels that 
we targeted and announced at the start of
2002. The maintenance of asset quality is a
key objective, and we do not operate in the
higher risk sectors of the mortgage market
that offer personal customers buy-to-let
mortgages, sub-prime mortgages or high
loan-to-value loans. These areas are estimated
to have accounted for around 20% of new
mortgage lending in the UK in 2002. 
In 2002 proﬁts in our unsecured personal
loans business increased by 34%, ﬁrmly
reversing the previous downward trend.
Lending balances were maintained at
around £2.1bn, with new business of
£1.4bn. During 2002 we increased our
emphasis on selling credit protection
insurance to customers and implemented 
a new application processing system, 
which in December enabled us to start 
risk-based pricing. 
Our Premier current account was
consistently a ‘best buy’ for customers 
in 2002 and we now have more than
300,000 customers. The launch of our new
internet banking system in July was very
successful and we have plans to further
develop this system. Much of our systems
infrastructure has been redeveloped over
the last three years, giving us conﬁdence 
in our ability to meet future targets.
2002 was a good year for our retail deposit
business with customer deposits rising by
£1.1bn to £17.5bn.
Retail Banking’s focus on the provision of
good value products across the Core 4 
has gained signiﬁcant media coverage
during 2002. The Core 4 products
achieved over 1,000 ‘best buy’ mentions 
in national newspapers, and we received 
a series of awards for both our mortgage
products and our on-line solutions for
intermediary and retail mortgage customers.
By focusing our promotions on the 
Core 4, with simple, easy to understand
advertisements, we have achieved a
significant improvement in the efficiency 
of our marketing expenditure. 
Partner 4 
We also sell to customers our “Partner 4”
products of credit cards, investment
products, life assurance and general insurance. These are provided in
partnership with market leading suppliers.
During 2002 we extended our
partnership arrangements, with new
agreements with MBNA for credit cards
and Legal & General for life assurance.
Our partnerships with these leading
companies enable us to offer our
customers a more attractive range of
credit cards and life assurance products
than we could previously. We remain
committed to growing our credit card
business, with all cards continuing to 
be branded Alliance & Leicester.
Customer Relationships
The development of customer relationships
is a key element of our strategy. Since 
July 2000 we have increased the average

product holding per customer from 
1.50 products to 1.63 products at the 
end of December 2002, and are on track
to achieve our 2003 year end target of
1.65 products. 
Commercial Banking
2002 was a year of change within our
Commercial Banking business, with pre-tax
proﬁt of £70m compared to £74m in 2001,
reﬂecting £9m of increased costs associated
with new cash market agreements.
A lot of progress has been made in
developing and implementing a new
business model for our cash handling
business during 2002. The market for
cash in the UK and the role of the Post
Office in the cash cycle are changing
from 2003 onwards. As a result of these
Customer Services, Tunbridge Wells forthcoming changes, the Post Office
gave notice on our cash handling
contract in 2001. In March 2002 we
launched our new partnership with
Securicor for wholesale cash handling,
and we reached agreement with the Post
Office for retail cash handling services.
The changes in the cash market have
resulted in a number of new alliances
being established, and we are very pleased
that Alliance & Leicester with Securicor are
providing the cash for Lloyds TSB branches
and ATMs in England and Wales.
Our commercial lending activities saw
continued growth, although in the current
economic climate we maintain a cautious
approach on credit standards. 
Our Staff
I would like to thank our staff for their
contribution to our success in 2002. Our
market research shows that we rate highly
as a ‘friendly and approachable’ bank. 
This is due to the positive attitudes of 
our staff, which are reinforced by training
programmes and the general culture of 
the business. Our staff have continued to
adapt to considerable change in 2002 as
we make further progress in implementing 
our strategy.
The major emerging issue for all employers
and staff is how future pensions are funded.
Reduced returns on investments, longer 
life expectancy and additional taxes on
pension funds makes the funding of future
pensions more expensive. 
We closed our deﬁned beneﬁt scheme to
new members in 1998, introducing a new
deﬁned contribution scheme, and less 
than 50% of our current staff are members
of the original deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. 
We have increased our contributions to 
the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme to the levels
recommended by our Actuary. The total
charge to the Group’s proﬁts in respect of
pensions increased from £16.5m in 2001
to £27.5m in 2002, including £5m relating
to a one-off provision for pension claims
from part-time employees. 
The Euro
A key political decision, which may affect us
in 2003, is the possible conclusion of the
debate on the adoption of the euro as the
UK’s currency. This is not a matter on which
we express a corporate view; our role is to
ensure that we will be ready if the euro is
adopted and we are undertaking suitable
preparatory work to reﬂect that possibility.
Actual conversion to the euro will be a
complex task which we estimate will 
be more expensive than dealing with 
the Year 2000 ‘millennium bug’. If the
Government is given a euro mandate by
the UK electorate, it is vital that the UK
banks and the Government itself be given
sufﬁcient time to convert all the complex
systems that constitute the UK’s ﬁnancial
and economic backbone. 
The Board
When the Group Board asked me to take
over as Group Chief Executive, I inherited
executive leadership of the business from
our Chairman, John Windeler, who had 
led the Group in an executive capacity for
just over two years. During that time he 
set in hand a major strategic review of 
our business, the successful results of which
began to show in 2002. John has now
reverted to non-executive Chairman and
he has been an excellent mentor to me in
my new role. He has let me get on with
my new job whilst always being available
to provide advice and support, and I thank
him for his assistance.
During John’s chairmanship the Board has
been strengthened and we have very full
and lively debates on business issues. All
our non-executive directors contribute fully
to the business and I have been delighted
both by the personal support they have
given me, and for the more general advice
they contribute to the management team
throughout the year.
The Future
During 2002 we celebrated our 150th
Anniversary. On 15 November 1852, 
John Henry Davies founded the Leicester
Permanent Beneﬁt Building Society. From
those origins, the Group has grown both
organically and via acquisitions to be a
major player in UK ﬁnancial services. 
With so much good work put in place in
2002, and 150 years of experience behind
us, we look forward to the future with
conﬁdence. But there is nothing in our
attitude which is complacent, and we 
are mindful of the potential dangers of 
the economic climate. We are building 
In 2002 we celebrated 150 years

a new challenger in British banking, giving
customers a genuine alternative to the
traditional players, and using our size to
our advantage by being quicker to
respond to customer needs and by being
genuinely customer focused.
Richard A. Pym, Group Chief Executive Retail Banking saw signiﬁcant franchise
growth in 2002, with revenues growing 
by over 5% and proﬁts rising by 14% to
£432m (2001: £380m).
Core 4 
The new partnerships for the provision 
of life assurance and credit cards, which
were implemented in the second half of
the year, complete the organisational
changes required to enable our own
resources to be ﬁrmly focused on the 
sale and servicing of our Core 4 products
of mortgages, unsecured loans, current
accounts and savings. 
2002 saw the implementation of new
technology for each of the Core 4
products. We implemented a new industry
standard mortgage system, a new
unsecured loans application processing
system and a new internet banking
package for current account and savings
customers. These developments have taken
signiﬁcant resource in terms of investment
expenditure and management time over
the past 2 years. In 2003 we will ensure
that we exploit the operational beneﬁts of
these new systems for both our customers
and shareholders.
Mortgages
Against a background of record growth 
in the UK mortgage market and 
substantial increases in house prices, 
we have continued to focus our lending 
on proﬁtable products and the highest 
quality assets. Gross mortgage lending
during 2002 was £6.4bn, an estimated
market share of 2.9%, whilst net mortgage
lending was £1.8bn, an estimated market
share of 2.2%. 
At the beginning of 2002 we set out two
goals for our mortgage lending. Firstly, 
to increase the amount of business sold
through our own branch, telephone and
internet channels. We achieved this goal
with the value of applications received
through these channels increasing by over
50% compared to 2001. Our second goal
was to increase to 50% the proportion of
mortgage intermediary business using 
our online mortgage intermediary system. 
We have exceeded our goal, with nearly
two-thirds of intermediary applications
processed through the system in 2002,
with consequential improvements in both 
costs and service.
In September 2002, in response to
customer demand, we launched an
additional form of competitive base 
rate tracker mortgage. This product 
has an early repayment fee structure which
ensures that any discounts received by 
the customer are reclaimed in the case 
of early repayment. In accounting terms
this product’s incentive costs are amortised
over its early repayment period. Our
accounting policy remains to immediately
write-off incentive costs as incurred on all
other products, as any repayment fees are
not linked to the incentives given. Sales of
the new product in 2002 have not had 
a material impact on the Group’s net
interest income.
Despite the surge in remortgaging within
the industry, our retention activity resulted
in our share of redemptions being below
our share of mortgage stock for each of
2001 and 2002. Over this period there
have been signiﬁcant volumes of internal
transfers from one Alliance & Leicester
mortgage product to another. These
transfers are not included within either 
our gross lending or redemption ﬁgures.
This volume of transfers has resulted in 
the proportion of mortgages on standard
variable rate falling signiﬁcantly since 1997.
Whilst we expect a continuing reduction 
in the proportion of our mortgage book 
on standard variable rate in the future, 
this rate of decline is expected to slow. 
Mortgage balances at 31 December 2002
were £23.5bn, an estimated 3.5% of 
the market.
Unsecured Loans
In 2002 we focused on increasing the
proﬁtability of our unsecured lending
business through a combination of
increased penetration of credit protection
insurance and improved marketing
efﬁciency. This has been successful, with
proﬁts from this business increasing by
34% in 2002. Business volumes remained
relatively stable in 2002 compared with
2001, with gross lending of £1.4bn and
balances of £2.1bn. Our asset quality is
very strong, with the bad debt charge
relating to unsecured personal loans
reducing by £8m in 2002.
We continue to make use of our full range
of distribution channels for the sale of
unsecured loans. In 2002 over 15% of
applications came via the internet, and
branch lending increased by more than
15% compared with 2001. During 2002
we used direct response TV advertising 
for personal loans for the ﬁrst time, which 
has proved very effective.
In the ﬁnal quarter of the year we
implemented a new application processing
system for unsecured loans. The new
system enables us to price applications

part of our plans for growth in this business
in 2003. However the maintenance of asset
quality is key to our success in this business,
and we will not be taking on increased risk
as a result of the new system.
Current Accounts
In 2002 around 184,000 new current
accounts were opened, a 28% increase
compared with 2001. The account base
has now grown to 1.8m accounts.
The current account is a key product 
in developing and retaining customer
relationships. The Premier current account
– with its competitive credit and debit rates
of interest, unique offerings of discounts 
on additional products, and free travel
insurance – continues to provide us with 
an excellent means for acquiring new
customers with whom we can develop
strong relationships. The average Premier
current account customer currently holds
3.9 products compared to an average of
1.5 for the remainder of Retail Banking’s
customer base. 
Savings
The volatility of the stock market beneﬁted
the retail savings market in 2002. We
consistently ensured that our EasySaver
branch based account and Premier
PhoneSave account have been ‘best buy’
products, which helped us to increase
personal account deposit balances by over
£1.1bn to £17.5bn at 31 December 2002.
Partner 4
Partner products play a key part in the
generation of Retail Banking’s fee income.
In 2002 credit cards generated £69m 
of fee income whilst the other partner
products generated £67m. 
We do not market our partner products
externally, primarily cross-selling them to
existing Group customers.
Credit Cards
In August 2002 we announced a new
partnership with MBNA Europe Bank
Limited for the marketing and
management of new and existing credit
card balances. As part of the partnership,
MBNA purchased Alliance & Leicester’s
existing credit card accounts. All new and
existing credit cards continue to be
branded Alliance & Leicester, and the
product remains a key part of our Retail
Banking portfolio.
The new business model for credit cards
has had a minimal impact on proﬁts in
2002. Total income for credit cards in 2002
was £26m higher than in 2001. As we
indicated in August 2002, £5m of this
increase resulted from the sale of the 
credit card accounts to MBNA. The
majority of the remaining £21m was 
due to higher fee income from initiatives
taken in late 2001 and early 2002, and
represents income earned prior to the 
sale to MBNA in August 2002.
MBNA have paid Alliance & Leicester 
an excess of £230m over the outstanding
credit card balances. The excess is being
recognised over the initial seven years of
the partnership in accordance with the
terms of the agreements and licences. 
The amount of the excess recognised, in
line with these agreements, was £36m in
2002 and is expected to be £56m in 2003,
£41m in 2004, £34m in 2005, £27m in
2006, £20m in 2007 and £16m in 2008.
The excess is recognised within Personal
Banking’s other operating income. This,
together with commission payments
received, reﬂecting customer growth,
replaces the loss of interest and fee income
from the existing card base that is now
owned by MBNA.
In 2002 around 118,000 credit card
accounts were opened and we are
planning to increase this number further 
in 2003 with the help of our partner
MBNA. The beneﬁts from the new
partnership are already being seen with
Alliance & Leicester’s new credit card
launched in January 2003, offering a very
competitive customer proposition including
an initial 0% on balance transfers.
The transfer of the account opening 
and servicing operations to MBNA is
progressing on schedule and is due to 
be completed in March 2003.
Life Assurance
In July 2002 we announced the extension 
of our partnership with Legal & General 
to cover life assurance products as well as
long term investment products. As part of
the new arrangements Legal & General also
purchased our existing life company. Sales
of life assurance products have increased by
almost 40% compared to the same period
in 2001, since the launch of the new Legal
& General product range in August. 
Long Term Investments
Our partnership with Legal & General
enabled us to offer a wider range of
products during 2002 than in previous
years. This enhanced product range has 
led to a 34% increase in the value of 
new investments in 2002.

risks underwritten will roll-off over the

Distribution
Retail Banking operates a full range of
distribution channels – branch network,
ATMs, telephone, internet and post. We
have continued to upgrade the branch
network and over 60% of our 312
branches have now been refurbished 
with the latest design. We have also 
made a number of improvements within
our network of agency branches. These
improvements aim to provide customers
with a consistent quality of service at 
all points of contact. During 2002 we
continued to expand our ATM network,
giving customers easier access to their
funds. At the end of 2002 we had an 
ATM network of over 2,500 machines. 
Over £750m of applications for mortgages
and unsecured loans were received directly
from personal customers via the internet in
2002. During 2002 we also received a
number of awards for our internet
application systems. “ISIS”, our
intermediary on-line system, was voted
‘Best E-commerce lender’ by the Legal &
General mortgage club, and our overall
internet services resulted in us being voted
‘Best E-commerce lender’ by Your
Mortgage and Incisive Media.
We launched our new internet banking
package for both new and existing current
and savings account customers in July
2002. The new package uses middleware
technology and is proving extremely
successful, having already attracted over
100,000 registrations with no signiﬁcant
marketing of the service. We are planning
to further enhance this service in 2003.
Asset Quality
Retail Banking’s asset quality remains very
strong and the maintenance of our credit
standards remains a core objective of 
the Group.
We continue our prudent mortgage
lending policies of not lending over 95% 
of the value of the property, nor lending 
in the buy-to-let or sub-prime segments of
the market. In the South East area, where
we see the greatest threat to house prices,
we maintain a conservative approach to
high loan-to-value (LTV) lending, including
a policy of not lending over 90% LTV on
properties valued over £150,000. Around
65% of our existing mortgage book is
located outside the South East area, a trend 
which continues with new loans.
Mortgage arrears have continued to 
reduce from £13.2m to £9.7m over the
past 12 months. Further details on our
residential mortgage asset quality are
provided on page 78. Only 0.85% of 
total mortgages were in arrears at the 
end of 2002. Only 8% of new lending 
in 2002 had an LTV over 90% and as in 
the previous two years over half of our 
new lending had an LTV below 75%. The
average LTV of new lending over the past 
5 years has reduced on a year on year basis
and in 2002 was 63%. We believe that 
the LTV ratio of new lending is the best
statistic for comparison purposes. The
estimated LTV of Alliance & Leicester’s 
total mortgage book, based on house
prices at 31 December 2002, was 38%.
Our unsecured lending asset quality is 
very strong and we continue to maintain
our prudent approach to lending in this
sector. Non-performing assets (loans over
30 days in arrears) comprise 5.3% of the
unsecured loan book (2001: 5.9%).

proﬁt was £70m in 2002 (2001: £74m),
including the additional £9m of costs
associated with the change in the cash
market business model.
Commercial Banking is focused on three
areas. Each of these business sectors has
seen franchise growth in 2002. 
Universal Payment Bank
This business focuses on the provision of
money transmission services for medium
and large corporate customers.
Cash Business
Commercial Banking’s cash handling
business processed record cash deposits
and cash sales in 2002. The value of cash
processed was 4% higher at £61bn (2001:
£59bn) and the value of cheques processed
also increased to £25bn in 2002 (2001:
£24bn). We continue to be the principal
provider of cash to the Post Ofﬁce.
In October 2002 Alliance & Leicester 
Cash Solutions and Securicor Cash Centres
started to manage all Lloyds TSB cash
provisioning requirements in England and
Wales. This has contributed to cash sales to
non-Post Ofﬁce users increasing by 55% 
to £19.7bn in 2002 (2001: £12.8bn). 
Payments
Our merchant acquiring business
continued to see growth, with the total
number of transactions increasing by 10%
to 313m (2001: 284m). We have seen
particularly strong growth in the sale of 
our merchant acquiring services to small
business banking customers, with
transactions for these customers 
increasing by over 20%.
Bill payment transactions continued to
migrate from higher margin paper to lower
margin electronic payment mechanisms,
but the overall volume of transactions 
grew to 229m in the year (2001: 222m).
Lending
In the current economic climate we
continue to take a cautious approach 
to our asset ﬁnance and commercial
lending activities. Lending balances
increased by £0.5bn to £3.4bn in 2002.
Asset quality is strong in all sectors of the
lending book. Non-performing assets
(loans over 30 days in arrears) represent
0.6% of the book (2001: 0.7%). Almost
all of the ‘big ticket’ leasing book is
covered by bank guarantees, and the
small and medium ticket advances are
performing satisfactorily.
Small Business Banking (SME)
The recommendation from the
Competition Commission of price controls
for other banks has removed a key
differentiator, namely the payment of
interest on credit balances. This has 
made it more difﬁcult for us to attract 
new customers. 
The full impact of the changes made 
to Small Business Banking tariffs by other
banks as a result of the Competition Report
have yet to be seen, most changes only
being implemented in the ﬁnal quarter 
of 2002.
Against this backdrop we remain
committed to the SME market and
continue to develop this business, gaining
industry recognition for our range of
competitive small business banking
services. Alliance & Leicester Business
Banking current account products came
top in two out of three small business
scenarios chosen by leading ﬁnance guide
Business Moneyfacts. This excellent
performance was achieved both before 
and after the implementation of new tariffs
by competitor banks in response to the
Competition Commission report.
In 2002 we opened around 18,000 new
current accounts, an increase of 5%
compared to 2001.
We now have around 153,000 small business,
charity and club and society customers.
Overdrafts and term loans to the SME
sector are only just over £10m, with no
signs of deterioration in quality.

We operate a conservatively-run Treasury
function, the primary role of which is to
manage the liquidity, funding and hedging
requirements of the Group. Consistent
focus on these objectives and favourable
market conditions during 2002 have
enabled strong growth in income, 
whilst maintaining credit standards.
A major achievement in 2002 was 
the successful implementation of a new 
Treasury system. This provides improved
processing of treasury transactions, credit
and risk management capabilities, and
enhanced management information.

A marketing programme to overseas banks

Asset quality within Treasury remains
strong with 94% of exposures having a
long term credit rating at or above single
‘A’, and we continue our policy of not
investing in corporate bonds, emerging
markets, venture capital funds or hedge funds.
Capital
During 2002 we have made signiﬁcant
progress in improving the efﬁciency of our
capital base by reducing our regulatory tier
1 capital ratio from 8.3% to 7.6% through
a share buyback programme. Our regulatory
tier 1 capital ratio excludes 2002 retained
earnings and the capital released as a result
of the sale of our life company. During 
the second half of 2002 we bought back
22.7m shares at a total cost of £188m.
In the future we are targeting a statutory
tier 1 capital ratio of between 7.0% and
7.5% (including retained earnings) and 
are planning to undertake a further share
buyback programme in 2003. We have no
current plans to raise hybrid tier 1 capital
in 2003. Strategic Targets 2003 – 2004
The Group’s current strategic objectives, which were set in
October 2000, contained targets covering the three years to the
end of 2003. As these objectives are now close to being completed
we have set out our targets for 2003 and 2004. 
These targets have been set against the background of current
consensus forecasts for the UK economy. Over the next two years
we will have one primary target relating to earnings per share,
which is supported by our existing goals for revenue growth, cost
reduction, and the management of our capital. And, as in 2002,
we will not lower our credit standards.
Earnings Per Share
To deliver double digit percentage EPS growth in 2003 and 2004.
Our existing targets all support the achievement of this target. The
revenue and cost targets remain unchanged and we are pleased to
announce plans to further improve the efﬁciency of our capital base.
Revenue
We will continue to target accelerating annual income growth in
2003 and 2004 on a like for like basis.
To enable a meaningful comparison, reﬂecting the changed
business model for our credit card business, income growth for
targeting purposes for 2003 will be calculated excluding credit
card income in both 2002 and 2003. Similarly, for this
comparison, the growth rate in 2002 will also exclude credit 
card income. In 2002, credit card income was £102m (2001:
£76m). The growth rate in 2004 will not require such an
adjustment, as the business model will not have changed either
in 2003 or 2004. As before, we will also remove the distortion
from any signiﬁcant property disposals (2001: £12m, 2002:
£5m). Using these deﬁnitions, income growth in 2002 was 3.9%.
Costs
We continue to target a £100m reduction by the end of 2003 in
the Group’s core operating costs compared to 2000, based on
2000 business volumes and prices. 
The 2003 element of this target remains to reduce 2000 core
costs by £50m. The Group’s 2004 cost base is targeted to reﬂect
the £100m reduction against 2000 core operating costs, based
on 2000 business volumes and prices. We continue to endeavour
to make the extra savings necessary to offset the additional £20m
annual cash market related costs, as highlighted in our interim
results announcement in July 2002.
Capital
We will continue to improve the efﬁciency of our capital base 
in 2003 and 2004, targeting a statutory tier 1 capital ratio of
between 7.0% and 7.5%.
In 2003 we plan to undertake further share buybacks to reduce
our tier 1 capital towards the top end of our targeted range by
the end of the year.

The restatement of the 2001 comparative results is due to a change in accounting
policy for high loan-to-value mortgage fees, as explained in Note 2 on page 50.
The Retail Banking sector pre-tax proﬁt of £432m was £52m
(14%) higher than 2001. Income growth was 6% (5% excluding 
a £5m one-off proﬁt on disposal of a branch property). Costs
reduced by 2% over the comparable period. In addition to the
£5m proﬁt on disposal, the increase in proﬁt was due to higher
income from the sale of long-term investment products, increased
current account fee income, higher unsecured personal loans fee
income, and lower administrative costs, partly offset by higher loss
charges due to the beneﬁts of residential and commercial mortgage
recoveries in 2001 not being repeated. Higher income from credit
cards was partially offset, at Group level, by strategy costs of £19m
resulting from the sale of the credit card accounts to MBNA. These
strategy costs are not included in Retail Banking’s results.
17 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Financial Review Net interest income
Net interest income of £611m was £18m lower than in 2001.
Average interest-earning assets have increased by 10% over the
comparable period whilst the sector margin has fallen by 0.27% 
to 2.09%. This reduction represents a 0.16% fall in interest spread
and a 0.11% reduction in the contribution of interest-free liabilities
due to lower interest rates.
The MLI net interest margin has fallen by 0.16% from 1.69% to
1.53%. This reﬂects a fall in interest spread of 0.09% primarily
driven by an increase in the cost of funds relative to bank base 
rate, and lower earnings on interest-free liabilities of 0.07%. 
Further details are disclosed on page 78.
The Personal Banking margin has fallen from 5.32% to 4.75%,
with a reduction in interest spread of 0.44% and a 0.13%
reduction in the contribution of interest-free liabilities. The
reduction in interest spread was due to the sale of the credit 
card accounts to MBNA, a fall in personal lending margins, and
the impact of the cost of paying competitive rates on our Premier
current accounts. The sale of credit card accounts to MBNA
resulted in lower net interest income of £11m compared to 2001,
which reduced the Personal Banking net interest spread by 0.22%.
Its impact on the Retail Banking interest spread was a reduction of
0.05% for the year and of 0.10% for the second half of 2002.

these, non-interest income increased by 11%. This represents
increased income from the sale of long-term investment products,
unsecured personal loans insurance commission, and higher income
from current accounts and ATMs.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses fell by £8m to £406m. Increased costs
associated with the expansion of the ATM network of £11m, and
volume related staff costs, were more than offset by signiﬁcant cost
reductions in line with our targets. The direct costs of operating
the credit card book were £12m lower than in 2001.

The charge for bad and doubtful debts increased by £5m to £61m,
primarily due to the £9m beneﬁt of residential lending and other
mortgage recoveries included in 2001, not being repeated in 2002. 
The arrears performance for both our mortgage and unsecured
lending businesses continues to compare favourably with
industry data. The value of residential mortgage arrears has
fallen by 27% since December 2001, and at 31 December 
2002 represented 0.04% of mortgage balances. For unsecured
lending the value of loans over 30 days in arrears as a
percentage of total loans was approximately 30% lower than 
the average for Finance and Leasing Association members, 
as at 31 December 2002.
Further disclosures on the number of mortgage cases in arrears 
are given for the ﬁrst time on page 78.

whilst the average total interest-earning assets were 12% higher
than the previous year.
The net interest margin has fallen by 0.27% from 2.28% to 2.01%,
with a reduction in the interest spread of 0.09% and a reduction in
the contribution from interest-free liabilities of 0.18% compared to
2001. The fall in interest spreads is driven by reduced margins in
Retail Banking and the impact of changing business mix driven by
growth in lower margin treasury assets. The lower contribution
from interest-free liabilities reﬂects lower market interest rates.

whilst operating expenses of £691m, which exclude the planned
strategic investment costs and depreciation on operating lease
assets, have increased by £7m over the comparable period.
Staff related expenditure increased by 8% as a result of growing
business volumes, higher bonuses to customer facing staff, increased
pension costs and a £5m provision for potential pension claims
from part-time employees.
As stated in our 2001 results announcement, for 2002 we planned
ATM costs of £10m, cost savings from the implementation of our
strategy of £20m, as well as inﬂation and volume related increases,
compared to our core cost base of £650m in 2000.
The £691m of operating expenses in 2002 included £33m of
inﬂation related expenses, £39m of volume related expenses and
£11m of actual ATM related expenses compared to the core cost
base in 2000. The remaining £608m of core costs, compared to
£650m in 2000, reﬂects £9m of increased costs associated with 
the new cash market agreements and £12m of credit card
operating cost savings. This demonstrates that we have more than
delivered our targeted saving of £20m in the year as a whole.
20 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Financial Review continued Strategic investment costs included expenditure on key customer
processing systems. In addition, £19m was incurred relating to the
implementation of the new business model for our credit card business.
Our current strategic investment programme is expected to be
complete at the end of 2003, and planned total expenditure on
the programme remains unchanged. Our one-off strategic
investment expenditure in 2003 will be around £26m, reﬂecting
the £23m originally signalled (including £11m of costs associated
with the implementation of the new credit card business model)
and £3m of expenditure originally planned in 2002 which will now
take place in 2003.
The Group cost:income ratio, excluding depreciation on 
operating lease assets, was 58.0% (2001: 62.6%). Excluding 
strategic investment costs the Group core cost:income ratio was
54.0% (2001: 55.7%). Including depreciation on operating lease
assets, the Group cost:income ratio was 59.9% (2001: 64.0%),
with a core Group cost:income ratio of 56.1% (2001: 57.3%).

for credit cards in 2002 was £18m, of which £3m represented a
further provision against the £31m of credit card balances retained
following the transfer to MBNA. Total provisions against these
balances were £24m at 31 December 2002.

(Note 1) Personal Banking comprises unsecured loans, current accounts and credit cards
For residential lending, the ratio of closing provisions to gross loans
and advances increased slightly from 0.10% to 0.11%, reﬂecting
our continued prudent provisioning policy, and the economic
environment. In addition to the £26m of residential provisions
above, the Group has an offshore captive insurance subsidiary 
with available funds of £14m, and a further £11m of high
percentage loan fees held on balance sheet. These funds are
deducted from ‘Loans and advances to customers’ in the Group
balance sheet. Together this pool provides £51m of cover within
the Group for losses in the residential mortgage book. Further
cover is provided through insurance of risk with external insurers. 
The provision for unsecured loans, current accounts and credit
cards increased marginally from £112m to £113m. This represents
4.81% (2001: 3.51%) of gross balances, reﬂecting the retention 
of credit card accounts that were subject to debt and fraud
recovery processes when the rest of the accounts were transferred
to MBNA.
The Commercial Banking lending book is split between ‘big-ticket’
structured ﬁnance transactions of £1.0bn (2001: £0.9bn) and
other commercial loans and smaller ‘ticket’ leases of £2.4bn (2001:
£2.0bn). The total level of provision at 31 December 2002 was
£22m (2001: £20m), representing 0.6% of gross balances, a
similar level to 2001. In addition, there is a further £8m of residual
value provision against operating leases. Almost all of the £1.0bn
‘big-ticket’ portfolio is covered by agreements with, or guaranteed
by banks.
Pensions
The total charge to the Group’s proﬁts in respect of pensions
increased from £16.5m in 2001 to £27.5m in 2002, including 
£5m relating to a one-off provision for pension claims from part-
time employees and £2m for post-retirement medical beneﬁts.
Under FRS 17, at 31 December 2002 the net retirement beneﬁts
liability was £223m, as explained in Note 40 on page 68.
Taxation
A corporation tax rate of 30% (2001: 30%) has been used in
preparing these results. The tax charge for the year of £128.0m
(2001: £112.0m) represented 27.3% of proﬁt before tax (2001:
28.3%). The Group expects that it will maintain a tax charge
below the statutory rate as it will continue to carry out its
commercial activities and structure its business in a tax efﬁcient
manner.
The Group is presently in discussions with the Inland Revenue
regarding the utilisation of certain tax allowances in respect of one
speciﬁc transaction undertaken by its leasing operation in 1997.
This transaction subsequently resulted in reduced corporation tax
paid by the Group of approximately £30m. The Group has taken
legal advice and does not believe that any additional tax liability
should arise from these discussions. However, if any additional
liability were to arise, there are indemnities and legal rights, which
should enable recoveries from third parties. Therefore no provision
is necessary.
Dividends
A ﬁnal dividend of 26.9p per share is proposed, giving a total
dividend of 39.9p for the year, up 10% on 2001. This compares to
basic earnings per share of 68.0p. The directors have proposed the
dividend for 2002 after considering the core proﬁts of the
business, excluding strategy costs.

Risk management and control
As a result of its normal business activities, the Group is exposed to
a variety of risks, the most signiﬁcant of which are operational risk,
credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The following table details
the work of the main committees that have been established
within the Group to manage these risks:

22 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Financial Review continued Operational risk
Operational risk is deﬁned as “the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or
from external events”. All of the Group’s activities give rise to the
potential for operational loss events.
The Group monitors its operational risks through a variety of
techniques. These include the six-monthly Group Internal Control
Policy certiﬁcation by senior management undertaken across all 
the Group’s business areas, and the presentation to the Group
Board of a monthly operational risk dashboard assessing the extent
of each of the Group’s operational risks.
Operational risk is managed through a combination of internal
controls, processes and procedures and various risk mitigation
techniques, including insurance and business continuity planning.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the potential risk of ﬁnancial loss where counterparties
are not able to meet their obligations as they fall due. The Group is
ﬁrmly committed to the management of this risk in both its retail
and wholesale lending activities.
The Group employs sophisticated credit scoring, behavioural
scoring, underwriting and fraud detection techniques to support
sound decision making and minimise losses in its lending activities.
Behavioural scoring also operates within the personal account
management and collections processes. A proactive approach to
the control of bad and doubtful debts is maintained within the
collections areas. 
Experienced credit and risk functions operate within the Group,
and are driven both by the recognised need to manage the
potential and actual risks, but also by the need to continually
develop new processes to ensure sound decisions into the future.
In this way, any changes in risk from market, economic or
competitive changes are identiﬁed and the appropriate controls
developed and put in place. 
Comprehensive management information on movement and
performance within the various personal and wholesale portfolios
ensure that credit risk is effectively controlled and trends identiﬁed
prior to any potential impact on performance. Group performance
is also measured against the industry, where appropriate, to ensure
debt default levels remain below that of the industry average. This
management information is distributed widely across the Group
and monitored within tight boundaries at Board and credit 
policy committees. 
Policy statements covering, amongst other things, criteria to 
be used in considering limits on counterparties and countries, 
are reviewed annually by the GCPC. Authorised limits on a
counterparty are governed largely by the size of its capital base
and, where published, credit ratings assigned by the major 
rating agencies. 
Market risk
Market risk is the potential adverse change in Group income or 
the value of Group net worth arising from movements in interest
rates, exchange rates or other market prices. Market risk exists to
some extent in all the Group’s businesses. The Group recognises
that the effective management of market risk is essential to the
maintenance of stable earnings and the preservation of
shareholder value.
The Group’s exposure to market risk is governed by a policy
approved by the GCPC. This policy sets out the nature of risk
which may be taken and aggregate risk limits. Based on these
aggregate limits, the ALCO assigns risk limits to all Group
businesses and monitors compliance with these limits. Each
business has its own market risk policy which is approved by the
ALCO. At each meeting the ALCO reviews reports showing the
Group’s exposure to market and liquidity risks. 
The Group has established a transfer pricing system with the
intention of transferring materially all of the market risks that 
arise in the various Group businesses to Group Treasury. Market
risk is transferred to Group Treasury by way of appropriate hedging
arrangements. Group Treasury plays a pivotal role in managing the
Group’s market risk. Group Treasury acts as a ‘Risk Clearing House’,
managing these risks within its own limits, and seeks to take
advantage of natural hedges within the Group’s businesses. 
Market risk is measured and reported using a variety of techniques,
according to the appropriateness of the technique to the exposure
concerned. The techniques used include interest rate gap analysis,
scenario analysis and value at risk.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the most signiﬁcant market risk to which the
Group is exposed. This risk mainly arises from mismatches between
the re-pricing dates of the interest bearing assets and liabilities on
the Group’s balance sheet and from the investment proﬁle of the
Group’s reserves and other net non-interest bearing liabilities.
Outside of Group Treasury, interest rate risk primarily arises in the
Group’s mortgage, savings, leasing and personal loan businesses.
The exposure in these portfolios is hedged with Group Treasury
using interest rate swaps and other appropriate instruments.
Net non-interest bearing liabilities comprise mainly interest-free
personal and corporate current accounts and shareholders’ funds,
and totalled £4.2bn at 31 December 2002 (2001: £4.1bn –
restated). Wherever it decides to invest these funds, the Group is
exposed to market risk – if the funds are invested short term net
interest income will be very volatile but the market value of the
assets will be relatively stable, whilst investing the funds longer
term will achieve more stability in net interest income but at the
expense of greater volatility in the market value of the assets. In
balancing these two extremes the Group’s objective is to minimise
volatility in net interest income over the medium term. 
These balances, particularly current account balances, are
constantly changing and it is therefore necessary to establish 
a view of the core balance and to keep this under review on 
a regular basis. This responsibility rests with the ALCO. At 
31 December 2002, the core fund was £3.4bn (2001: £3.4bn) 
and the remainder, representing fluctuations above core balance
levels on current accounts and capital not allocated to business
units, was £0.8bn (2001: £0.7bn – restated).
The following table summarises the repricing proﬁle of the core fund.

23 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s policy is not to run material, speculative foreign
exchange positions.
The Group offers foreign exchange services to customers through
both Group Treasury and Girobank, and detailed limits and
controls are established within those businesses to control the
exposure. Girobank clears its positions with Group Treasury in
accordance with the policy of transferring market risk positions 
to Group Treasury wherever possible.
As part of its normal operations Group Treasury raises and invests
funds in currencies other than Sterling. The foreign exchange risks
of these activities are hedged within Group Treasury’s limits.
Equity risk
The Group markets equity related products to its customers,
including guaranteed stock market bonds. The Group’s policy is 
to have no material exposure to equity markets. The exposures
arising from the Group’s products are eliminated as far as is
practicable by appropriate hedging contracts.
Liquidity risk
It is Group policy to ensure that resources are at all times available
to meet the Group’s obligations including the withdrawal of
customer deposits, the draw-down of customer facilities and
growth in the balance sheet. The development and implementation
of policy is the responsibility of the ALCO. The day to day
management of liquidity is the responsibility of Group Treasury,
which provides funding to and takes surplus funds from each of
the Group’s businesses as required.
Liquidity policy is approved by the GCPC and agreed with 
the Financial Services Authority. Limits on potential cashﬂow
mismatches over deﬁned time horizons are the principal basis 
of liquidity control. The size of the Group’s holdings of readily
realisable liquid assets is primarily driven by such potential outﬂows.
Derivatives
A derivative is an off balance sheet agreement which deﬁnes
certain ﬁnancial rights and obligations which are contractually
linked to interest rates, exchange rates or indices. Derivatives are
an efﬁcient and cost effective means of managing market risk and
limiting counterparty exposures and are an indispensable tool in
treasury management. Derivatives are primarily used by the Group
for balance sheet management purposes. However the bank also
runs trading book positions in derivatives; details of the level of
interest rate risk in the trading book are contained in Note 43 on
page 72.
Types of derivatives and uses
The principal derivatives used in balance sheet risk management
are interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements (FRAs), futures,
interest rate options and foreign exchange contracts which are
used to hedge balance sheet exposures arising from ﬁxed and
capped rate mortgage lending, personal loans, leasing
arrangements, funding and investment activities and foreign
exchange services to customers.
The following table describes the signiﬁcant activities undertaken
by the Group, the related risks associated with such activities and
the types of derivatives which are typically used in managing such
risks. These risks may alternatively be managed using on balance
sheet instruments or natural hedges that exist in the Group
balance sheet.

and other net 
non-interest liabilities
Control of derivatives
With the exception of credit exposures, which are managed 
within policies approved by the GCPC, all limits over the use 
of derivatives are the responsibility of the ALCO. 
All exchange traded instruments are subject to cash requirements
under the standard margin arrangements applied by the individual
exchanges and are not subject to signiﬁcant credit risk. Other
derivatives contracts are on an “Over the Counter” basis with
OECD ﬁnancial institutions. The exposures arising from these
contracts are shown in Note 43 to the Accounts on page 73.

Authority to Purchase Shares
During the year, 22,716,125 shares of 50p each representing a
nominal value of £11,358,062 were repurchased and cancelled,
representing 4.69% of the Company’s issued capital as at 
31 December 2002. The aggregate consideration (including 
stamp duty) paid for the shares was £188,000,004. The purpose
of the share buybacks was to continue our programme to improve
capital efﬁciency and meet our capital target of a regulatory tier 
1 capital ratio (excluding retained earnings) of 7.5%.
Capital efﬁciency remains a key ﬁnancial objective and shareholder
authority will again be sought, at the Annual General Meeting, for
the Company to purchase in the market up to 48.4 million of its
shares, representing some 10% of the issued share capital, in order
to retain ﬂexibility in managing the Company’s capital requirements.
Special Business at the Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 6 May 2003.
Shareholders will see from the Notice of the Annual General
Meeting that they are asked to consider and, if thought ﬁt,
pass two resolutions relating to the Political Parties, Elections
and Referendums Act 2000 as special business. The terms of this
Act are widely drafted and it could affect donations to, or
sponsorship of, campaigning charities. A precautionary authority 
is being sought to ensure that the Group’s programme of
charitable donations is not adversely affected.
Auditors
A resolution re-appointing Deloitte & Touche as auditors and
authorising the directors to determine their remuneration will
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

taken from our first Corporate Social
Responsibility Report (CSR) which was
published on the Group’s corporate
website (www.alliance-leicester-
group.co.uk/csr) in February 2003.
We know that our future success 
depends on taking into account the
interests of all stakeholders in our 
business: our customers, our employees,
our shareholders and the wider
community in which we work and live.
The demands of these different
stakeholders may differ at times, but a
successful business recognises the
important role each plays in making 
the business a success.
The progress we have made with CSR-
related matters to date has been reﬂected
in the Group maintaining membership of
the FTSE4 Good index during 2002.
Alliance & Leicester is a member of the
British Bankers Association (BBA) CSR
Advisory Panel. During 2002, the BBA
contributed to the publication of the
FORGE Group guidance on CSR
management and reporting in the
financial services sector. 
The FORGE Group guidance was published
whilst we were collating this report, and
we have structured the report under the
headings outlined by FORGE as being
those most relevant to ﬁnancial 
services organisations.
Our Marketplace
Access to products and services
Our distribution network covers the whole
of the UK and includes branches, ATMs,
telephone and postal banking, and the
internet, as well as access through Post
Ofﬁces. We recognise that some of our
customers have additional needs and we
have developed a number of services to
supplement our distribution channels.
For customers who are deaf, hard of hearing
or have speech impairments, a fully qualiﬁed
sign language interpreter is available on
request. Customers can also use a Typetalk
operator to relay a message to us. 
For customers with visual impairments 
we make our documents easier to read by
printing brochures, letters and statements
in larger print, or providing them in an
audio or Braille format. 
New and refurbished branches of Alliance
& Leicester are being designed, wherever
possible, to make them more convenient
and accessible for customers.
We are a supporter of the Government’s
Universal Banking initiative, and offer a
basic bank account product.
Customer service
Internally we monitor our customer
service performance on a monthly basis
as part of our business strategy. This
includes regular sampling of our personal
customers concerning what they think 
of our service – helping us to identify
what we are doing well and where there
are areas for improvement. We formally
compare our service performance to that
of our competitors, and we use mystery
shopping to measure our performance
against our own internal service
standards. The results of these surveys
provide vital input to our management. 
Business ethics 
Our statement of Business Principles, 
which was approved by the Board and
communicated to all staff in May 2002,
includes a number of items which
encapsulate the Group’s business ethics. 
28 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Corporate Social Responsibility Report
The following extracts from that document
address ethical matters:
• We will not risk the Group’s reputation by
knowingly associating with people,
organisations, products or transactions that
could potentially damage our reputation.
• We are positive about complying with
our legal and regulatory obligations – 
this protects our customers, our
shareholders and ourselves. 
• Each member of staff has a personal
responsibility to contribute to the
Group’s success and reputation by
carrying out his or her job conscientiously,
efﬁciently and honestly, and maintaining
the highest standards of integrity and
personal conduct in all matters which
affect the Group. 
• Consistent with the highest standards 
of integrity, we do not countenance 
the solicitation or acceptance of
hospitality or gifts which may be
mistaken for an inducement, nor do 
we countenance use of information
received in the course of our business
dealings for personal gain. 
• We provide the means whereby 
staff can report any suspicions of
wrongdoing to senior management 
or to our Internal Audit and 
Compliance Departments.
• We seek business relationships which 
are mutually beneﬁcial and lead to
success through fair dealing and high
standards of business integrity.
• We will normally seek competitive
proposals from suitable suppliers.
“We know that our future success
depends on taking into account the
interests of all stakeholders in our
business: our customers, our
employees, our shareholders and 
the wider community in which we
work and live.”
• We do not knowingly do business 
with organisations or bodies which are
involved in the abuse of human rights.
We are still vigilant in ensuring that we
lend only to respected institutions and 
do not deal knowingly with businesses
involved in any illicit activities, such as
money laundering or foreign regimes 
that violate human rights.
Privacy 
The Group’s policies comply with the Data
Protection Act and it has stringent policies  We carry out an annual employee 
opinion survey which is sent to all Group
staff, asking their views on the Group. 
The Group results from the 2002 survey
showed improvement over the 2001 
survey in each of the categories surveyed –
Communications, Leadership &
Involvement, Morale & Commitment, 
and Development.
Learning and development 
Our innovative “Valuing Individual People”
(VIP) training programme aims to help our
employees achieve our vision. VIP focuses
on putting the internal and external
customer at the centre of everything we
do, and ensuring that everyone is treated
as a valued and respected individual. 
We are proud that we have achieved
Investors in People accreditation in over 70%
of our business, including all of our principal
customer-facing areas. We aim to increase
this proportion further during 2003.
Alliance & Leicester operates a number 
of development schemes aimed at high
achievers, including our management
trainee scheme, an accelerated leadership
programme and sponsorship of further
education training.
In addition, Alliance & Leicester invests 
in further education opportunities 
that support the development of our 
of Company trade creditors at the end of
the year to the amounts invoiced during
the year by trade creditors.
Our Workplace
Our business vision commits Alliance &
Leicester to becoming “the most customer
focused ﬁnancial services provider in the
UK – bar none.” We know that we cannot
achieve that without the whole-hearted
commitment of our employees.
Responsibility for all employee related
issues, including Health & Safety, rests with
the Group’s Human Resources Director
who reports to the Group Chief Executive.
Throughout the Group, there are
numerous examples of actions aimed at
developing and motivating our workforce.
During 2002, many of these have been
brought together under the heading
“Living Life Better at Alliance & Leicester”.
We believe that effective communication
and consultation with our employees 
is crucially important. Almost all of our
employees have access to our Group
Intranet either at their workstation or at
designated Intranet points. The Intranet
not only keeps employees up to date 
with business related information, but 
also provides staff with the facility to 
ask questions on any subject related 
to the Group. 
on the protection of customer privacy,
conforming to standards set by the
voluntary banking codes and legislation.
Terms of trade 
Our products are aimed at UK-based
customers or British expatriates, and all 
of our operations are based in the British
Isles. In this context, Terms of Trade
issues are not a significant issue for 
the Group, nor does our behaviour
significantly impact on such issues as they
would for a more international company. 
Creditor payment policy 
The Group is a signatory of the DTI’s
Better Payment Practice Code.
Information regarding this code and 
its purpose can be obtained from the
Better Payment Practice Group’s website
at www.payontime.co.uk.
It is Group policy to:
• agree the terms of payment at the start
of business with that supplier
• ensure suppliers are aware of the
payment terms
• pay in accordance with any contractual
and other legal obligations.
Trade creditor days of the Company for 
the year ended 31 December 2002 were

Alliance & Leicester is involved in the Right to Read campaign in 3 local education areas. Right to Read is a national initiative which invites individual volunteers,
sponsored by their employer, to go into a local school and give children with difficulties the help and advice they need to improve their reading skills. employees, such as CeMAP, CeFA, CIM 
and CIPD qualiﬁcations.
Disciplinary practices
The Group encourages employees to 
adopt a responsible attitude to work,
encompassing self imposed discipline. 
The main aim of the Group’s Discipline
policy is to be corrective rather than
punitive and is in line with the ACAS Code
of Practice on discipline at work. It sets
reasonable standards of performance and
behaviour and aims to ensure consistency
and fairness of treatment of all employees
when these standards are not met.
Work/life balance 
We believe it is important for all staff to 
be able to share the beneﬁts of good
performance by the Company. 
This is reﬂected in a number of ways.
More than 90% of our employees are
Alliance & Leicester shareholders and more
than 90% participate in one or more of 
our Company share schemes.
Our Flexible Holidays scheme enables
employees to buy or sell up to ﬁve days’
holiday each year. More than 20% of our
staff take advantage of this beneﬁt.
We offer our staff incentives to own 
and use Alliance & Leicester products, 
and we also offer our employees the
chance to participate in various promotion
and partnership packages, including
discounted health club membership,
holidays and childcare. The Group offers
employees an enhanced maternity,
paternity and adoption leave package
which exceeds statutory obligations 
and is ﬂexible to the requirements of
individual employees. 
We offer our employees a range of
ﬂexible working hours and location
arrangements to match their individual
needs wherever possible.
Health and safety 
Alliance & Leicester’s Health and Safety
Mission Statement commits us to ensuring
that our employees are provided with a
safe and healthy working environment, 
and to achieving Health & Safety
excellence through statutory compliance. 
We recognise that the Health & Safety 
at Work Act and recent Safety Regulations
allocate responsibilities to both managers
and employees within the workplace. 
Our Health & Safety Management System
outlines personal responsibilities for 
Health & Safety at work.
Our security policies state clearly that the
safety, health and welfare of our staff must
always be placed before the minimisation of
ﬁnancial or other loss by Alliance & Leicester.
Diversity and equal opportunities 
Alliance & Leicester recognises the right 
of every employee to be treated with
dignity and respect at work. Working 
with our union representatives we have
produced and promoted a Group policy 
to ensure that any problems are dealt 
with promptly and with sensitivity. We 
take our responsibilities under the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995 very seriously and
ensure all reasonable measures are taken to
enable customers and potential customers
to access the full range of Group products
and services at all our premises within the
timescales as deﬁned within the Act. Our
Equal Opportunities policy commits us to
removing barriers which would prevent the
employment of disabled people in Group
jobs and to implement all reasonable
measures to ensure disabled staff can
effectively carry out their jobs. As an
employer Alliance & Leicester recognises
the potential that all people bring to the
workplace regardless of sex, race, ethnic 
or national origin, religious belief, marital
status, disability or sexual orientation. 
As part of that philosophy and in keeping
with our values, we believe that every
employee should be treated with the 
same respect and dignity.
Freedom of association/collective bargaining 
Alliance & Leicester recognises the
Communications Workers Union (CWU),
the Public and Commercial Services 
Union (PCS) and Alliance & Leicester
Group of Staff (ALGUS) for collective 
bargaining purposes. We enjoy good
relations with these recognised unions and
endeavour to involve their representatives
at all levels. To this end, for example, union
representatives are invited to attend our
regular senior management brieﬁngs.
Working with our Local Communities 
Responsibility for Community affairs 
rests with the Director of Corporate
Communications, who reports to the Group
Chief Executive. We are proud of the links
we have built up with the community, in
particular with the local communities in
which our employees live and work. 
We actively support local communities
through charitable donations, gifts in kind
and through the involvement of our staff 
in volunteering initiatives. Our charitable
donations policy particularly emphasises
support for the communities from which
we draw large numbers of employees – 
in particular Leicestershire and Merseyside.
In each of these areas we have strong links
with local schools, voluntary groups 
and charities. 
During 2002 Alliance & Leicester made
donations for charitable purposes
amounting to £560,000. This included
£150,000 donated by the Group to the
NSPCC’s FULL STOP campaign as a result
of our account opening promotion run in
December 2001 and January 2002.
In addition to these donations our
Corporate Community Investment
programme has given support to a large
number of organisations nationally and
locally. This support has taken various
forms including gifts in kind, management
secondments, organising fund raising
events and the use of ofﬁce space. This
support in total amounted to an estimated
£100,000 in 2002. During 2002 Alliance &
Leicester staff organised a “fun day” at the
Group’s Carlton Park headquarters. This
event was well supported by both Group
employees and the local community and
raised over £9,000 for local charities 
and schools.
30 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued
“We actively support local
communities through charitable
donations, gifts in kind and through
the involvement of our staff in
volunteering initiatives.” We have also provided a further £50,000
of sponsorship to the Leicester Tigers 
TAG rugby initiative designed to allow
young children to learn both team skills
and basic rugby skills in a fun environment.
Alliance & Leicester and the Tigers teamed
up over two years ago after ﬁnding that
less than 10% of all primary schools in
Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland
actively participate in the sport. 
2002 also saw Alliance & Leicester support
the NSPCC’s “Change for Kids” campaign.
The campaign, which called on the public
to hand in spare European currencies at
Alliance & Leicester branches before the
introduction of the Euro, resulted in over
£1m being raised for the NSPCC.
In January 2003 Alliance & Leicester was
made a Patron of the NSPCC FULL STOP
appeal in recognition of our role in raising
over £1m for the NSPCC during the past
12 months.
The Environment 
Responsibility for the implementation of
the Group’s environmental policy rests with
the Group’s Operations Director who is a
member of the Group Board and reports 
to the Group Chief Executive. We recognise
that our actions as a Group can have an
effect on the world around us. We believe
that improving environmental performance
is sound business practice. 
This means that environmental best
practice is, wherever reasonably
practicable, incorporated into our 
decision-making processes. We invest in
environmentally friendly and sustainable
products and services, minimise energy
usage, encourage energy efﬁciency (also
by encouraging staff to be environmentally
friendly) and promote waste minimisation
and environmentally friendly waste disposal. 
Alliance & Leicester sets objectives aimed
at evaluating and managing our impact on
the environment. We benchmark our
progress using our membership of the
Business in the Environment Index of
Corporate Environmental Engagement, 
and our environmental programme is
being developed to ensure further
improvements in performance, data
availability, environmental management
and reporting.
In December 2002, the Institute of Energy
conﬁrmed that Alliance & Leicester has
been approved for re-accreditation under
the Energy Efﬁciency Accreditation
Scheme, one of only 10 ﬁnancial services
companies to be accredited. The Group
has been able to demonstrate it meets the
required high standards in the management
and use of energy as dictated by the
Scheme rules at that time.
Corporate Social Responsibility is a
potentially wide-ranging and complex
subject and we are keen to get our strategy
right. Throughout 2002 we have taken 
big steps to identify Corporate Social
Responsibility activity being undertaken 
by the Group and to pull together all of
that work under a Corporate Social
Responsibility banner. Over the next year
we will carry out further work to identify
actions we can take to improve matters
further.
Our approach, now and in the future as 
we develop our strategy, is rooted in the
belief that Corporate Social Responsibility 
is about businesses committing themselves
to working with their employees and their
families, the local community and society
at large to improve the quality of life.
Alliance & Leicester has helped raise over

This report has been prepared pursuant to the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 and the Listing Rules issued by the Financial
Services Authority.
Remuneration Committee’s Composition and Scope
The Board Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) comprises 
the following ﬁve non-executive directors: 
Mr M P S Barton 
(Chairman and senior independent non-executive director)
Mr M J Allen
The Hon D. Brougham
Miss F A Cairncross
Mr J R Windeler 
Mr G N Corah, who retired from the Board on 23 January 2002, 
was a member of the Committee until his retirement. Mr Windeler 
was appointed to the Committee on 25 July 2002. All other members
of the Committee served throughout 2002. 
The Secretary of the Committee is Mr J Hepplewhite, Company
Secretary, who is appointed by the Board and who minutes proceedings
of the Committee, submits reports and provides professional assistance
to the Committee on governance issues. The Committee was also assisted
by Mr Windeler (whilst he was Executive Chairman) and Mr R A Pym
(Group Chief Executive) in relation to those directors who reported to
them. Mr G A Ledward, the Company’s director of Human Resources
also provided assistance to the Committee. 
The Committee is responsible for determining, pursuant to a policy
framework on executive remuneration agreed by the Board, the pay
and beneﬁts and contractual arrangements of each executive director
and for overseeing the Group’s Share Schemes.
Within the parameters set by the Board, individual performance-
related payments and share awards are made by the Committee with
the objective of rewarding achievements and aligning the interests of
the individual with those of the Group’s shareholders. The individual
salary, bonus and beneﬁt levels of executive directors are normally
reviewed annually by the Committee and due consideration is given 
to advice from independent advisers. The independent advisers
appointed by the Committee during 2002 were Towers Perrin for
general remuneration advice and comparator information, and 
Mercer Human Resource Consulting speciﬁcally for pension-related
issues. Mercer Human Resource Consulting also provide pension-
related ﬁnancial advice to the Company. Ernst & Young LLP were
appointed by the Company with the agreement of the Committee 
and provided specialist advice to the Committee in relation to the
Group’s Share Schemes. 
Statement of Remuneration Policy and its Development
The broad policy of the Board and the Remuneration Committee remains
to set remuneration so as to attract and retain high calibre executives and
to encourage and reward superior business performance. Remuneration
for executive directors should reward both individual and company
performance measured against performance criteria that are relevant and
realistic but also challenging, so that good performance is encouraged. 
Of the total remuneration package of executive directors, a signiﬁcant
proportion should relate directly to the performance of the Group and
the share price performance. This accords with the objective of both
the Board and the Committee to ensure a sufﬁciently direct and clearly
deﬁned “line of sight” (i.e. a clear relationship between actions and the
corresponding level of reward received), in order to deliver successful
implementation of the Group’s strategy to maximise shareholder value.
That strategy focuses on business development and rigorous control of
costs, with customer service as a key differentiator. Under Committee
guidelines agreed in 2001 each executive director is required to build
up over a period of ﬁve years, and retain, whilst a director, a minimum
holding of shares in the Company with a value of the order of his
annual basic salary.
In designing schemes of performance-related remuneration, 
the Committee has followed the provisions in Schedule A to the
Combined Code.
The Board’s objective is to make the Company ‘the most customer
focused ﬁnancial services provider in the UK – bar none’. To deliver 
this strategy, remuneration arrangements will continue to focus on
incentive plans that encourage delivery of operating plans as well 
as shareholder value, rather than just annual salary.
Thus for 2003 and beyond, annual salary will continue to be set 
at market median to remain competitive in the market place, while
bonuses and long term incentive plans will reﬂect market upper
quartile competitive levels and be based on delivery of targets and
Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”).
Performance Graph
The performance graph below shows the Company’s performance 
in comparison with the FTSE 100 Index over the ﬁve years ended 
31 December 2002. The FTSE 100 Index was chosen as it is a broad
equity market index consisting of companies of similar complexity 
and size to the Company. 
Remuneration for Executive Directors
The main components of the remuneration package for executive
directors are:
Basic salary
Basic salary for executive directors takes into account the role,
responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual. This 
is normally reviewed annually unless responsibilities change, and 
salary levels are set against background information from independent
advisers on salary levels for similar positions amongst a specific
comparator group of ﬁnancial organisations and with due regard to
general salary trends within companies in the FTSE 100 Index. The
current comparator group comprises:
Abbey National plc Aviva plc
Barclays Bank plc Bradford & Bingley plc
Britannic Assurance plc Egg plc
Friends Provident plc HBOS plc
HSBC Holdings plc Legal & General plc
Lloyds TSB Group plc Prudential plc
The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc Zurich Financial Services
Annual bonus
At the discretion of the Committee, executive directors are eligible 
to receive an annual performance bonus. 
Bonuses are contingent on achievement of one year performance
targets set annually by the Committee. These comprise a mix of
corporate targets – revenue growth, cost reduction, pre-tax proﬁt 
and growth in Earnings per Share (“EPS”) – and individual personal
performance targets. The level of bonus for on-target performance for
2002 and beyond is 60% of salary, with a maximum of 200% of salary
for exceptional performance (amounts over 100% of salary would be
taken in the form of deferred shares under the Deferred Bonus Scheme

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
For The Year Ended 31 December 2002 
TSR: Alliance & Leicester v FTSE 100
01.01.98 — 31.12.02 34 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
(see below), but without any matching element). Bonuses are
discretionary and are non-pensionable. 
In order to encourage executive directors to build up a signiﬁcant
personal stake in the Company, they may be required to receive one-
quarter of their annual bonus in the form of a deferred shares option
award which the Company will match if related performance criteria
are achieved (see below under Long-Term Incentive Schemes). For
2003, executive directors will be able to voluntarily defer up to 100%
of their annual bonus (to a maximum of 100% of salary) for this
purpose. This also acts as a retention tool and ensures executive
directors share a signiﬁcant level of personal risk with the Company’s
shareholders. The rights to deferred shares cannot normally be
exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised within seven 
years. If a director leaves before the third anniversary of the grant, 
the Trustees to the Scheme may exercise their discretion in allowing 
the options over deferred shares to be exercised. Deferred shares 
are not awarded within two years of an individual’s 60th birthday.
Long-term incentive schemes
There are share schemes for executive directors designed to align 
the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders:
Share options
Each executive director is eligible for the grant of options under the
Alliance & Leicester Approved and Unapproved Company Share Option
Schemes. The price at which shares can be acquired on exercise of
options is the market value of the shares on the day prior to the date of
grant. Accordingly, the share price has to rise above the price at which
the option is granted before an executive director can beneﬁt. 
The aggregate value of new shares for which options to subscribe may
be granted to each executive director in any year, cannot normally
exceed a maximum total annual award of two times basic salary, with
a power for the Committee to increase this up to four times basic
salary if it considers that this is warranted in exceptional circumstances.
Annual grants have typically been in relation to shares valued at up to
one times basic salary (two times for new appointments), with the
grants being made in two tranches following the ﬁnal and interim
results. Options cannot normally be exercised for three years from the
date of grant. From 2002, the current performance condition applied
to grants is that options are exercisable if the percentage growth in EPS
exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) by at least 9% over
a three year period (earlier grants have used a percentage between 6%
and 9%). The Committee reviews this condition before each new grant
paying due regard to market practice. The Committee considers this
performance condition to be suitable and appropriate as a means of
focusing executive directors on generating earnings growth and
accords with market practice. No options are awarded within two 
years of an individual’s 60th birthday. 
Vesting of options is normally after three years and from 2002 there 
is the opportunity to measure performance again only after years four
and ﬁve, calculated from the base grant year and based on EPS growth
of RPI +12% (year 4) or RPI +15% (year 5) (for earlier grants the period
to be measured is any three year period). 
Under the rules of the share option schemes, options are exercisable
prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant where an option
holder ceases to be employed by the Company by reason of death,
injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement or transfer of the
employing company outside the Group, or at the discretion of the
Committee in any other circumstances. Also, in these circumstances,
any performance conditions attaching to the exercise of the options
cease to apply.
Deferred bonus scheme
Under the Alliance & Leicester Deferred Bonus Scheme, the Company
may match an award of deferred shares on the basis of up to three
matched shares for each deferred share awarded. The maximum
matched award is given for upper quartile performance in terms of
the Total Shareholder Return measured relative to a peer group of
Retail Banks. Total Shareholder Return measures the change in value
of a share and reinvested income over the period of measurement.
The current constituents of the peer group, excluding the 
Company, are:
Abbey National plc Barclays Bank plc
Bradford & Bingley plc HBOS plc
Lloyds TSB Group plc Northern Rock plc
The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc
These banks have been chosen because they are all in the ﬁnancial
services sector and are broadly comparable in the range of activities
undertaken. Awards only begin to vest when median performance
relative to the peer group is achieved, with linear progression from one
matching share at median performance up to three matching shares for
upper quartile performance. The rights to matching shares, as detailed
on page 38, cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if
not exercised within seven years. Total Shareholder Return is considered
by the Committee to be a suitable measure for this type of scheme, 
as it provides clear links with the creation of shareholder value.
Under the Deferred Bonus Scheme options may be exercised prior to
the third anniversary of the date of grant where the executive director
ceases to be employed by reason of death, injury, ill-health, disability,
retirement or at the discretion of the Trustees to the Scheme based 
on the recommendation of the Committee in any other circumstances.
Performance conditions apply unless waived by the Committee.
Performance conditions are not subject to re-testing and are normally
subject to a three year performance period. 
Employee share schemes
Executive directors may also participate in the Company’s existing
Employee Share Schemes, including the Savings Related Share Option
Scheme and the Company’s Share Incentive Plan on the same basis as
all other employees. There are no performance conditions attached to
these schemes.
Pensions
Executive directors are members of the deﬁned beneﬁt section of the
Alliance & Leicester Pension Scheme which has a normal retirement
age of 60.
The main features of the pension promise for executive directors based
on the standard terms of the Scheme, are:
(a) Pensions from age 60 of 1/60th of basic salary averaged over 
the last twelve months prior to retirement for each year of
pensionable service.
(b) A cash beneﬁt on death in service of 4x annual rate of basic salary
at date of death.
(c) Pensions payable in the event of ill-health.
(d) Pensions for dependants on a member’s death are generally 
equal to half the member’s prospective retirement pension at 
60 on death in service, or half the member’s pension entitlement
on death in retirement.
Member contributions are 5% of basic salary.
The following directors have special arrangements:
(a) Mr Pym and Mr Bennett are entitled to a pension of 2/3rds 
of their ﬁnal pensionable salary on retirement at age 60 inclusive 
of retirement beneﬁts from service at other organisations.
(b) Mr Pym is not required to contribute. Mr Bennett contributes 
15% of the Earnings Cap. 
There is an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement to increase 
the pension and lump sum life assurance beneﬁt to the level promised,
where, because of Inland Revenue limitations (including those resulting
from the Earnings Cap) these cannot be paid in total from the Scheme.
Such arrangements apply to Mr Pym and Mr Bennett.
On retirement from service an executive director may, with the 
consent of the employer, draw his accrued pension from the Alliance 
& Leicester Pension Scheme at any time after his 50th birthday (subject
to a reduction of 3% for each year by which retirement precedes his
60th birthday).
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
For The Year Ended 31 December 2002  35 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Pensions in payment are subject to contractual increases each April 
in line with the annual percentage rise in the RPI over the previous
calendar year, subject to a maximum of 5%.
It is conﬁrmed that there are no discretionary practices which are 
taken into account in calculating transfer values on leaving service.
Other benefits
Executive directors are eligible for a range of beneﬁts which include 
the provision of company cars, payment of car operating expenses
including fuel, concessionary mortgage facilities, life assurance and
membership of a private medical insurance scheme.
Other directorships
The Group is supportive of executive directors who wish to take one
non-executive directorship with a publicly quoted company in order 
to broaden their experience. They are entitled to retain any fees they
may receive. 
Remuneration for Non-Executive Directors
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the Board 
as a whole in the light of recommendations by the Group Chief
Executive and within the limits speciﬁed in the Articles of Association 
of the Company. Towers Perrin assist with comparator information for
this purpose.
Other beneﬁts for non-executive directors include the reimbursement
of travel and other incidental expenses for attendance at Board or
other meetings, in connection with the Company’s business. They 
are not eligible for share options.
Until 1 June 2002 Mr Windeler (Chairman) combined the roles of
Chairman and Chief Executive and was employed under a service
contract dated 24 July 2000. Following separation of these roles 
Mr Windeler, as Chairman, has entered into a new contract dated 
2 September 2002, relating to his employment until his 60th birthday.
His contract is terminable on three months’ notice. He is entitled to 
a company car, non-exclusive use of a chauffeured car for business
purposes, life assurance and membership of a private medical
insurance scheme. 
Mr Windeler is a member of the Deﬁned Beneﬁt Section of the Alliance
& Leicester Pension Scheme with a normal retirement age of 60. 
He contributes 5% of the Earnings Cap and the unfunded pension
arrangements referred to earlier in this report apply to him also up 
to his 60th birthday. 
Following his 60th birthday (in March 2003) Mr Windeler will continue
as a non-executive director on the basis of an appointment letter
similar to that applicable to other non-executive directors (save that 
he will continue to enjoy the beneﬁt of non-exclusive use of a
chauffeured car and his appointment will be terminable on three
months’ notice). Whilst an executive director, he participated in 
the Long Term Incentive Schemes speciﬁed earlier in the report and
such options continue to subsist.
No options have been, or will be, granted to any non-executive
directors (including Mr Windeler) in their capacity as non-executive
directors of the Company.
No payments were made during the year to third parties for the
provision of the services of any non-executive directors. Non-executive
directors who are in full time employment with a third party employer
may elect to pay the whole or part of their fees to it.
Service Contracts
With the exception of Mr Windeler’s contract, the non-executive
directors do not have service contracts with the Company. On
appointment they are issued with an appointment letter.
There are no provisions for compensation being payable upon the 
early termination of an appointment. Appointments are normally for 
an initial three year period with the opportunity for the Board to
consider renewals for two year periods thereafter.
Dates appear below of appointment periods:

* which may follow earlier renewals
Executive Directors have service contracts that continue until
terminated by twelve months notice (but which in any event terminate
on their 60th birthday). Notice periods were reduced from the three
years applicable at the time of conversion to plc status to two years
without payment of compensation, and this process had continued
with the recently agreed reduction to twelve months notice periods
which now apply to all executive directors’ contracts.
Under the terms of existing service contracts, if the employment of 
an executive director is terminated by the Company for any reason
(other than due cause) without notice being given, he is entitled to
receive payment of twelve months’ basic salary, his last annual bonus
(or where no previous bonus was received a sum determined at the
discretion of the Committee) and twelve months’ pension beneﬁts
(plus an additional three months’ basic salary and pension beneﬁts at
the discretion of the Committee as a ‘good leaver’, or, an additional six
months’ basic salary and pension beneﬁts where employment is
terminated by the Company within six months of a change of control
of the Company). No such payments of salary and pension beneﬁts, 
on termination by the Company, will in any event exceed a payment
based on the number of months from the date of termination of
employment to the executive director’s normal retirement date. 
The executive directors may terminate their contracts of employment
at any time by giving six months’ prior notice.
The Board will always consider best practice, industry guidelines 
and shareholder interests when negotiating contracts.

On behalf of the Board
M P S Barton
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
20 February 2003 Principles of Corporate Governance
The Company’s Board appreciates the value of good corporate
governance not only in the areas of accountability and risk management
but also as a positive contribution to business prosperity. It believes
that corporate governance involves more than a simple ‘box ticking’
approach to establish whether a company has met the requirements 
of a number of speciﬁc rules and regulations. Rather the issue is one 
of applying corporate governance principles (including those set out 
in Section 1 of the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best
Practice (‘the Combined Code’) published by The Financial Services
Authority) in a sensible and pragmatic fashion, having regard to the
individual circumstances of a particular company’s business. The key
objective is to enhance and protect shareholder value.
The Group will be giving careful consideration to the recently published
Higgs Report on the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors
and the Financial Reporting Council’s ‘Audit Committees – Combined
Code Guidance’ (‘The Smith Report’). These reports are a welcome
addition to the debate on the framework of corporate governance.
Board Structure
The Company’s Board comprises seven non-executive directors and
four executive directors who have the collective responsibility for
ensuring that the affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries are
managed competently and with integrity. The Chairman is Mr J R
Windeler. The senior independent non-executive director is the 
Deputy Chairman, Mr M P S Barton. Following the departure of the
former Group Managing Director in October 2001, Mr Windeler
combined the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive until 1 June 2002
when Mr R A Pym was appointed Group Chief Executive. 
The Board considers that all the non-executive directors (with the
exception of Mr J R Windeler due to his previous role as both Chairman
and Group Chief Executive) are ‘independent’ within the deﬁnition 
of this term in the Combined Code.
Whilst providing ‘challenge’ to executive directors, the non-
executive directors nevertheless play a full part as members of the
Board ‘team’. They bring a diversity of business perspective and
objectivity which complements the ‘hands on’ expertise of their
executive director colleagues. All members of the Board share
responsibility for Board decisions.
The composition of the Board is kept under review with the aim 
of ensuring that there is a proper balance of power and authority
between executive and non-executive members of the Board and 
that the Board collectively possesses the necessary skills and 
experience for the proper direction of the Group’s business activities.
Newly appointed directors submit themselves for election by shareholders
at the ﬁrst opportunity after their appointment and at three yearly
intervals thereafter. They receive induction training upon appointment.
Operation of the Board
The Board meets regularly and approves and closely monitors the
Alliance & Leicester Group’s strategic direction and business strategy.
There is a formal schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved to the 
Board for decision including major capital expenditure, annual budgets
and corporate objectives. Procedures are in place which allow directors
to take independent professional advice in the course of their duties
and all directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary.
The Board receives regular management performance and internal
control reports and operates a system of Board reviews of individual
business units and their performance against key business targets 
and objectives.
The Board has established several committees with specified 
terms of reference which assist the full Board in the exercise of 
its responsibilities:
Nomination Committee
Under the chairmanship of Mr Windeler this Committee, comprising
non-executive directors, has the task of recommending new
appointments to the Board and reviewing re-appointments when 
they become due. It has formal Terms of Reference and its current
membership comprises:
Mr J R Windeler (Chairman)
Mr M J Allen 
Mr M P S Barton 
The Hon D Brougham
Miss F A Cairncross
Remuneration Committee
Under the chairmanship of Mr Barton (Deputy Chairman of the
Company) this Committee, comprising non-executive directors,
determines the remuneration and contractual arrangements of
individual executive directors, having regard to a general policy
framework for executive remuneration established by the Board. 
The Board’s Report on Directors’ Remuneration appears on pages 
33 to 38. 
It has formal Terms of Reference and its current membership
comprises: 
Mr M P S Barton (Chairman)
Mr M J Allen 
The Hon D Brougham
Miss F A Cairncross
Mr J R Windeler (from 25 July 2002)
Statement of Corporate Governance
39 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002 Group Audit & Risk Committee
Membership of the Committee comprises Mr P Barton (Chairman), 
the Hon. D Brougham, Mr M McTighe and Mr J Watts (all of whom 
are non-executive directors). Mr Barton succeeded Mr N Corah who
was Chairman of the Committee until his retirement from the Board 
in January 2002. Meetings of the Committee are normally attended 
by the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Director
of Accounting and Taxation, the Director of Group Risk, the Head of
Group Internal Audit, the Head of Group Compliance (who is also the
Group Money Laundering Reporting Ofﬁcer) and the external auditors.
The Chairman of the Committee has independent access to both
internal and external auditors (and to the Group’s statutory regulator,
the Financial Services Authority).
The duties of the Committee fall into two main areas: internal control
and ﬁnancial reporting.
Internal Control: The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the
Group’s systems of internal control and risk management and monitors
compliance with regulatory requirements. To do this, the Committee
approves the annual Internal Audit and Compliance plans, which are
based on thorough risk assessments of the full scope of the Group’s
business activities, and monitors progress against the plans. Each
meeting of the Committee receives reports from the Head of Group
Internal Audit and the Head of Group Compliance regarding the 
state of internal control and compliance within the Group. The salient
points of these reports are presented to the next Board meeting.
Financial Reporting: the Committee’s role is to review, on behalf of 
the Board, the Annual Report and Accounts, the Preliminary Results
Announcement, the Interim Report and internal audit reports. The
Committee focuses on reviewing any changes in accounting policy,
major areas of judgement and estimates, and compliance with
accounting principles and regulatory requirements. 
The Committee recognises the importance of maintaining a sound
system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investments 
and the Group’s assets. Further information on the systems of business
control appears later in this statement. The Committee has formal
Terms of Reference. The Company’s independent external auditors 
are present at meetings of the Committee, and the Committee keeps
under review the overall ﬁnancial relationship between the Company
and its auditors in order to ensure a proper balance between the
maintenance of objectivity and obtaining value for money.
The Committee also receives on behalf of the Board the Annual Report
of the Group Money Laundering Reporting Ofﬁcer. All authorised ﬁrms
are required by the Financial Services Authority to commission such a
report on an annual basis.
Other Committees
The Chairman’s Committee is empowered to take urgent decisions
between Board meetings and comprises the Chairman or a 
non-executive director, the Deputy Chairman or another non-executive
director and the Group Chief Executive or one other executive director.
The Board also has other established committees. The Group Credit
Policy Committee reviews all aspects of credit, market and liquidity risk
and the Group Assets and Liabilities Committee establishes strategies
for, and monitors and controls, the levels of balance sheet risk,
including liquidity, funding and currency exposures across the Group,
and the monitoring of interest rate reﬁxing proﬁles.
The Executive Directors’ Committee facilitates the Group’s effective
operation and the Credit, Controls & Security Committee reviews
credit, audit, compliance and Group accounting issues.
Pension Funds
The Group’s pension funds are held and controlled by trustees separately
from the Group; in particular no scheme assets are invested in or loaned
to the Company or its subsidiaries. Independence is reinforced by strong
employee trustee representation.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company values dialogue with its institutional shareholders
through meetings and results brieﬁngs. The Annual General Meeting
and the documents sent to shareholders before that meeting provide
an opportunity for the Board to account to shareholders for its
stewardship of the Group’s business.
Compliance Statement
The Company has complied with the provisions of Section 1 of the
Combined Code throughout the year ended 31 December 2002 
save that Mr Windeler, who is not considered to be an independent
non-executive director, as deﬁned by the Combined Code, due to his
previous role as both Chairman and Group Chief Executive, has been 
a member of the Remuneration Committee since 25 July 2002. The
Board considers that Mr Windeler’s experience makes him a highly
valuable member of the Remuneration Committee.
Internal Control
The Group Audit & Risk Committee has regularly reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control for the 
year to 31 December 2002 on behalf of the Board, and has taken
account of any material developments that may have taken place
since the year end.
40 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Statement of Corporate Governance continued System of Business Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls 
and for monitoring its effectiveness. The Group’s business involves 
the identiﬁcation, acceptance and mitigation of risk, and appropriate
internal control systems have been implemented and embedded.
These systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and provide
reasonable but not absolute assurance as to the effectiveness of the
safeguards protecting the business against the risk of material error,
loss or fraud, but it must be recognised that they cannot provide
absolute assurance.
The directors are required by law to establish systems for the control 
of the conduct of the business in accordance with the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 and to conduct the business with
prudence and integrity, ensuring that there are adequate reserves 
and other capital resources and assets in liquid form for the protection
of depositors.
There has been in place for the year under review and up to the date
of this report a process of identifying, evaluating and managing the
signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group. This process is regularly reviewed
by the Board and accords with the Turnbull Guidance for Directors on
the Combined Code issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales in September 1999.
The Board receives monthly reports from the key executives identifying
performance against budget, major business issues and the impact 
of the external business and economic environment on their areas of
responsibility. The Board also receives the minutes of the Group Audit
& Risk Committee, and reports from the Chairman of the Group Credit
Policy Committee. These identify any signiﬁcant issues relating to the
adequacy of the Group’s risk management policies and procedures
across the full range of risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Board has delegated oversight of the Group’s Internal Control
Policy to the Group Audit & Risk Committee. Each regular meeting 
of this Committee receives a report identifying the effectiveness of
internal control together with speciﬁc reports on major issues. An
annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal control within the
Group is submitted by the Head of Group Internal Audit to this
Committee. The Board retains control over this area through the
presentation of a regular Group Audit & Risk Committee ‘activities’
report together with the minutes of the Committee meetings.
The key features of the system of business control established by the
Board are:
• A Group Internal Control Policy requiring senior management to
identify major risks and monitor the effectiveness of internal controls
through key performance indicators and certify to the Board on 
a twice yearly basis that they are effective. The results of this self
certiﬁcation are subject to internal audit scrutiny and are reported
via the Group Audit & Risk Committee;
• A well deﬁned management structure with clear accountabilities 
and delegations;
• A system of executive management committees, including the
Executive Directors Committee and the Credit, Controls & Security
Executive Committee. These committees enhance and support the
oversight role of the Board;
• A planning and budget process that delivers detailed annual ﬁnancial
forecasts and targets for Board approval;
• Management information systems enabling the Board to receive
comprehensive monthly analysis of ﬁnancial and business performance
including variance against budget;
• A Group Risk Management function with overarching responsibility
for the monitoring and reporting of all major risks to which the
Group is exposed, supported by specialist risk functions;
• An Internal Audit function to report to the Board on the effectiveness
of key internal controls in relation to these major risks;
• A Compliance function to manage relationships with the Group’s 
key regulators and to identify and control major compliance risks; 
• The appointment of a Money Laundering Reporting Ofﬁcer and the
establishment and maintenance of anti-money laundering procedures
and controls including training programmes for staff; and
• Documented procedures and authority levels to ensure that risks
involved in major projects are properly assessed and controlled.
The activities of the Group, including the systems of business control,
are subject to supervision by the Financial Services Authority. The
Group is required on a regular basis to submit detailed prudential and
statistical returns covering all areas of its business and meets regularly
with its supervisors, conducting the relationship in an open and
constructive manner. 
Going Concern
The directors conﬁrm that they are satisﬁed that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in business for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
41 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002 UK company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial accounts
for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and Group as at the end of the ﬁnancial year
and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing
those ﬁnancial accounts, the directors are required to:
• select appropriate accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
accounts; and
• prepare ﬁnancial accounts on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to assume the Group will continue to be in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect
fraud and other irregularities.
42 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Alliance & Leicester plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2002 which comprise the consolidated
proﬁt and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash ﬂow
statement, the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and
losses, the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds, the
statement of accounting policies and the related notes 1 to 45. These
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein. We have also audited the information in the part of the
directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As described in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the
Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards. They are also responsible for the preparation 
of the other information contained in the annual report including 
the directors’ remuneration report. Our responsibility is to audit the
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited in accordance with relevant United
Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and 
the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having 
been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and transactions with the Company and other members of the Group
is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects the
Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained 
in the Annual Report for the above year as described in the contents
section including the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration
report and consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes
an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the
Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that
the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of
the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2002 
and of the proﬁt of the Group for the year then ended; and
• the ﬁnancial statements and part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

48 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 1 Principal accounting policies
Basis of presentation
The consolidated accounts are prepared in accordance with the 
special provisions of Part VII, Chapter II of the Companies Act 1985
applicable to banking companies and banking groups.
Accounting convention
The Group prepares its accounts under the historical cost convention,
and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the bank and all its
subsidiaries at the end of the year. Where subsidiaries are acquired
during the year, their results are included in the Group accounts from
the date of acquisition.
Statements of Recommended Practice (SORPs)
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with British Bankers’
Association SORPs on Advances, Securities, Derivatives, Contingent
Liabilities and Segmental Reporting by Banks, and the Finance &
Leasing Association SORP ‘Accounting issues in the asset ﬁnance 
and leasing industry‘.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies, which is
represented by the excess of fair value of the purchase consideration
over the fair value of assets acquired, is capitalised and shown as an
asset in the balance sheet and subsequently amortised over a period 
of between 3 and 10 years on a straight line basis as a charge to the
proﬁt and loss account. Negative goodwill is amortised over a period
of 3 years. Goodwill written off to reserves before the adoption of FRS
10 ‘Goodwill and Intangible Assets’ amounts to £42.2m. This would 
be charged to the proﬁt and loss account in the event of the disposal
of the relevant business.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided using the full provision method following the
Group’s adoption of FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax‘. Deferred tax is recognised 
in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed
at the balance sheet date. Provision is calculated at rates expected to 
be applicable when the liability or asset crystallises. Deferred tax is
provided on a non-discounted basis.
Fixed assets and depreciation
The cost of additions and major alterations to ofﬁce premises, plant,
ﬁxtures, equipment and motor vehicles is capitalised. The cost of ﬁxed
assets less estimated residual value is written off on a straight line basis
over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 40 to 75 years
Leasehold buildings over the remainder of the
lease up to 75 years
Fixtures and major alterations 10 to 15 years
Equipment and motor vehicles 3 to 9 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course 
of construction.
Software costs and external consultancy costs associated with software
development are written off to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred.
Operating lease assets
Assets acquired for the purpose of renting out under operating lease
agreements are capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the
accounting policy set out above. 
Depreciation is provided on operating lease assets acquired for the
purposes of renting out at rates calculated to write off the cost of 
the assets, less estimated residual value, over their useful lives using
methods which allocate depreciation charges on a systematic basis 
to the periods which are expected to beneﬁt from their use.
Finance and rental agreements
The minimum lease payments receivable from ﬁnance lease and 
other ﬁnance agreements, less appropriate future income arising from
ﬁnance charges, are included in net investment in ﬁnance leases and
hire purchase contracts.
Gross earnings on ﬁnance and rental agreements comprise the income
component of repayments, after recognising sufﬁcient income to cover
initial direct costs, which are credited to the proﬁt and loss account
using methods which produce an approximate constant rate of return
on the net cash investment.
Operating lease agreements
Rentals under operating leases are charged to administrative expenses
on a straight line basis.
Finance lease agreements
Assets acquired under ﬁnance leases are capitalised at fair value at the
start of the lease, with the corresponding obligations being included 
in other liabilities. The finance lease costs charged to the profit and 
loss account are based on a constant periodic rate as applied to the
outstanding liabilities.
Wholesale funding issue costs
Premiums or discounts, net of commission costs associated with the 
issue of fixed and floating rate notes and subordinated liabilities, 
are amortised over the relevant period to maturity and are included 
in the proﬁt and loss account within interest payable.
Pensions and post-retirement medical beneﬁts
The Group operates both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution
pension arrangements. Under the deﬁned beneﬁt sections the cost of
providing pensions and related beneﬁts is charged to the proﬁt and loss
account so as to spread the costs evenly over the employees’ working
lives. The difference between the charge to the proﬁt and loss account
and the contributions paid to the scheme is shown as an asset or a
liability in the balance sheet. The assets of the defined contribution
section are held separately in an independently administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the proﬁt and loss account
as they fall due.
The cost of providing post-retirement medical beneﬁts is charged to 
the proﬁt and loss account so as to spread the costs evenly over the
employees’ working lives. A provision is included within ‘Other
provisions for liabilities and charges’.
Securities
Securities intended for use on a continuing basis in the bank’s
activities are classiﬁed as investment securities and are stated in the
balance sheet at cost less any impairment in value. Adjustments are
made to cost for premiums and discounts arising on the purchase 
of investment securities, which are amortised over the period to 
the maturity date of the security, and for the effect of the annual
movement in the retail price index where redemption is so fixed
under the terms of the issue. Securities used in trading activities 
are carried at fair value, with all gains and losses taken directly 
to the profit and loss account.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts
Speciﬁc provisions are made in respect of loans and advances where
recovery is considered doubtful; a general provision is made for losses
which, although not speciﬁcally identiﬁed, are known to be inherent 
in any portfolio of lending. Provisions for residential mortgages are
reduced by the level of funds held in the Group’s offshore captive
insurance subsidiary and by high percentage loan fees held in the
Group balance sheet.
Where the collection of interest is in signiﬁcant doubt, it is credited 
to a suspense account and written off when there is no longer any
realistic prospect of recovery. The outstanding provisions are deducted
from loans and advances, along with the interest on non-performing
loans held in suspense. The charge in the proﬁt and loss account
represents the net increase (or decrease) in the provisions less
recoveries for the year.
Notes to the Accounts
49 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report & Accounts 2002 1 Principal accounting policies continued
Income recognition
Interest is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account on an accruals
basis. The costs of mortgage cashbacks, discounts and other incentives
to borrowers are charged as incurred to interest receivable except for
the deep discount mortgage product launched during 2002. On this
product the customer has a deep discount in the early years following
which they have an obligation over a period of time to return the
discount if they redeem the mortgage. For this product only the early
redemption penalty is closely linked to the incentive cost. Therefore 
the deep discount is recorded within ‘Prepayments and accrued
income’ and spread over the term of the customer’s obligation.
Mortgage arrangement fees are taken to income in the proﬁt and loss
account on a received basis. Other fees receivable are credited to
income when the related service is performed.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, other than those
covered by forward contracts which are translated at contracted rates,
are translated into sterling using year end exchange rates and any
differences charged or credited to the proﬁt and loss account.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivatives used in trading activities are carried at fair value, with 
all gains and losses taken directly to the proﬁt and loss account.
Gains and losses on non-trading derivatives are taken to the profit
and loss account in accordance with the accounting treatment 
of the underlying transaction being hedged. Accrued income or
expense is reported in ‘Prepayments and accrued income’ or
‘Accruals and deferred income’ as appropriate. Profits and losses
relating to hedges of commitments and anticipated transactions 
are deferred and taken to the profit and loss account over the life 
of the underlying hedge.
Hedging contracts and instruments are used by the Group as part 
of its overall risk management strategy. Instruments used for hedging
purposes include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, collars and
ﬂoors, futures, forward rate agreements and spot and forward foreign
exchange transactions.
The criteria required for a derivative instrument to be classiﬁed 
as a designated hedge is:
i) the transaction must be reasonably expected to match or eliminate
a signiﬁcant proportion of the risk inherent in the assets, liabilities or
positions being hedged which results from potential movements in
interest rates and exchange rates;
ii) adequate evidence of the intention to hedge and linkage with the
underlying risk inherent in the assets and liabilities being hedged
must be established at the outset of the transaction.
Hedge transactions which cease to be effective or are terminated early
are measured at fair value. Any proﬁt or loss arising is deferred and
amortised over the remaining life of the asset, liability or position being
hedged. Where the underlying asset, liability or position no longer
exists, the hedging transaction is measured at fair value and any proﬁt
or loss arising is recognised in full.
Mortgage guarantee income
The bank charges a fee to reﬂect the increased risk on high loan 
to value advances, and has established a wholly owned subsidiary 
as a captive insurance company, for the purposes of insuring part 
of the risk upon such secured lending. In the Group accounts, fees 
are taken to ‘Other interest receivable and similar income‘ over the
average anticipated life of the loan. The deferred element is shown 
as a deduction from ‘Loans and advances to customers‘ in accordance
with ICAEW Technical Release 20/01.
Long-term life assurance business
The value of long-term assurance business represents an actuarial
assessment of the value of the shareholders’ interest in the long-term
assurance funds, comprising the present value of future surpluses
expected to emerge from business currently in force together with 
the surplus retained in the long-term funds. The value is determined
on the advice of a qualiﬁed actuary.
Movements in the value of long-term assurance business, grossed 
up at the effective rate of corporation tax, are included within other
operating income in the Group proﬁt and loss account.
Securitisation
Securitisation transactions are reported in accordance with FRS 5,
‘Reporting the Substance of Transactions’. Where assets are sold under
securitisation, if there is no signiﬁcant change to the Group’s rights and
beneﬁts to those assets and its exposure is limited to a ﬁxed monetary
ceiling, linked presentation is used. Under linked presentation the
ﬁnance is shown deducted from the gross amount of the item it
ﬁnances on the face of the balance sheet within a single asset caption
‘Loans and advances to customers’.
2 Changes in accounting policy
The 2001 comparative ﬁgures have been restated to reﬂect two
changes in accounting policy:
1. FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax‘ has been adopted. Previously, deferred tax
was recognised and provided only on assets and liabilities where it
was expected that the tax would crystallise in the foreseeable future.
Now, under FRS 19, deferred tax is provided on all timing
differences which have not reversed by the balance sheet date, apart
from certain exceptions detailed in FRS 19. The impact of adopting
FRS 19 has been to increase the tax charge for the year ended 
31 December 2001 by £2.9m.
2. In previous results, fees earned from high loan-to-value mortgages
were reported within ‘Other operating income‘ and ‘Fees and
commissions receivable‘. The Group has now adopted the ICAEW
guidance “Tech 20/01: Mortgage Lenders – Accounting for Self
Insurance of Loan Risk”. As a result, for the year ended 31 December
2001, £3.5m of income previously reported within ‘Fees and
commissions receivable‘ is now included in ‘Other interest receivable
and similar income‘ and £9.7m of income previously reported within
‘Other operating income‘ is now included in ‘Other interest
receivable and similar income‘. At 31 December 2001, £36.1m
included in ‘Accruals and deferred income‘ on the balance sheet is
now shown as a deduction from ‘Loans and advances to customers‘.
The impact of these two changes on the proﬁt and loss account for
2002 is similar to that for 2001. 
In addition there are two changes to the presentation of the Balance
Sheet:
(i) ‘Net investment in ﬁnance leases and hire purchase contracts’ is
shown as a separate balance sheet category. Previously this was
included within ‘Loans and advances to customers’.
(ii) ‘Operating lease assets’ are shown as a separate balance sheet
category. Previously they were included within ‘Tangible ﬁxed assets’.

of £339.6m (2001: £284.1m – restated) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and ranking for dividend of 499.4m 
(2001: 503.6m) during the year.
The diluted earnings per share of 67.4p (2001: 56.0p – restated) is based on the total dilutive potential shares, as detailed below, and the Group
proﬁt attributable to shareholders. The total dilutive potential shares are the weighted average number of ordinary shares together with all weighted

16 Securitisation
On 1 November 2000, the Company sold residential mortgage assets of £250.0m to Fosse Securities No.1 plc (‘Fosse’). Fosse issued Mortgage
Backed Floating Rate Notes to finance the purchase of the portfolio of loans. These notes are serviceable only from cash flows generated
by the mortgage assets together with £3.0m (2001: £3.8m) of subordinated finance from the Company. In addition, the Company has a
subordinated loan of £0.9m at 31 December 2002 (2001: £1.1m) to ﬁnance certain issue related expenses.
The Group is not obliged to support any losses in respect of these mortgages other than to the extent of its subordinated loans, nor does it intend
to do so. This is clearly stated in the agreements with bondholders. 
The Company has an option to sell further mortgage loans to Fosse where at the end of any interest period the actual rate of repayment of
principal (‘ARR’) exceeds 20% per annum, so long as the sale price of such loans does not exceed the principal repayments received in the interest
period and the ARR after the sale is not less than 20% per annum.
The controlling interest of Fosse is held by a discretionary trust established for charitable purposes. The Group receives administration fees for servicing
Fosse’s mortgage portfolio together with its residual income arising after the claims of the bondholders and other creditors are met. Fosse is
consolidated and included in the Group ﬁnancial statements as a quasi-subsidiary.
The summary results of Fosse are as follows:

On all other mortgage products, incentives are charged to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred. This amounted to £284m (2001: £273m).
26 Long-term assurance business
In July 2002 we announced the extension of our partnership with Legal & General to cover life assurance products as well as long-term investment
products. From this date the Group began selling Legal & General long-term assurance products, and as part of the new arrangements the entire
share capital of Alliance & Leicester Life Assurance Company Ltd was sold to Legal & General on 3 September 2002 for £83.8m (cash of £71.3m
and deferred consideration of £12.5m), resulting in a loss on disposal of £4.7m in the Group accounts.
The value of long-term assurance business attributable to shareholders included in the consolidated balance sheet comprised:

Long-term assurance assets attributable to policyholders – 230.3
The increase in value of the Group’s long-term assurance business included in the proﬁt and loss account within Other operating income up to the
date of sale amounted to £8.6m before tax (2001: £10.9m) and £6.5m after tax (2001: £7.7m).
The value placed on long-term assurance business is calculated by discounting estimated future ﬂows of statutory proﬁts from in-force business at
a discount rate that includes a risk margin. The future ﬂows are based on prudent assumptions about long-term economic and business experience
determined with the advice of a qualiﬁed actuary. The risk margin is designed to reﬂect uncertainties in expected future ﬂows.

The number of shares in issue at 31 December 2002 reﬂects the adjustment for the cancellation of shares following the share buyback. During the
year, the Group repurchased 22,716,125 shares with a nominal value of £11.4m, at a cost of £188.0m. This has been charged against proﬁt and
loss account reserves.
In 1998 the Group established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (QUEST) to acquire shares in the Company for the benefit of
employees and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. On 5 April 2002 the QUEST subscribed, at a market price of 900p per share, for
1,158,555 of the Company’s ordinary 50p shares. The cost of ﬁnancing of £10.4m has been transferred by the Company directly to proﬁt and 
loss account reserves. The excess of the subscription price over the nominal value, amounting to £9.8m, has been credited to the share premium
account. Under the terms of the Trust Deed, dividends are required to be waived on the shares held by the QUEST.
In addition, 91,856 new shares were issued during the year to SharePlan members. 515,320 shares were issued between 510p and 900.5p under
the Alliance & Leicester Executive Share Option Plan. The combined nominal value of these issues was £0.3m, with total cash consideration
received of £3.9m. Also, 22,635 shares were issued under the Deferred Bonus Scheme.
At 31 December 2002, there were 5,597,650 options outstanding under the Alliance & Leicester ShareSave Scheme and 4,688,118 options
outstanding under the Alliance & Leicester Executive Share Option Plan. The options enable members of staff and executive directors to subscribe 
for ordinary shares of 50p between 2003 and 2012, at prices ranging from 364.4p to 900.5p. There are also 617,582 options outstanding under the
Alliance & Leicester Deferred Share Bonus Scheme. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption from UITF 17 permitted for ShareSave Schemes.

The above assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling do not indicate the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk. 
The Group has hedged all material foreign currency exposures by using off balance sheet hedging instruments so that there are no material
unmatched exposures at the balance sheet date. All of the principal subsidiaries owned by Alliance & Leicester plc use sterling as their functional
currency. Therefore, the Group is not subject to any structural currency exposures.
40 Pensions
Pension costs relating to deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution sections of the Scheme can be analysed as follows:
2002 2001
(a) SSAP 24 Disclosures (Group) £m £m
Regular cost 17.1 18.3
Variations from regular cost (i) 4.9 (1.9)
Notional interest on prepayment (1.5) (1.6)
Total 20.5 14.8
(i) Variations from regular cost arise from the scheme deﬁcit/(surplus) being spread on a basis changing in line with pensionable payroll over the average expected future working
life of the membership (15 years).
The Alliance & Leicester Pension Scheme (the Scheme) comprises funded deﬁned beneﬁt sections which became closed to new entrants on 
31 March 1998. New employees joining the Group on or after 1 April 1998 were eligible to join a deﬁned contribution section of the Scheme.
The principal scheme is an exempt approved pension scheme under which retirement and death beneﬁts are provided for Group employees. 
The funds of the Scheme are administered by trustees independently of the ﬁnances of the participating employers.
In addition beneﬁts are provided by the Company on an unfunded unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989 whose
beneﬁts would otherwise be restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualiﬁed actuaries using the projected unit method. The latest
actuarial valuation was made as at 31 March 2002. The signiﬁcant assumptions in these valuations were that salaries increase on average by 2.0%
p.a. above inﬂation, long-term return on investments is 7.0% p.a. in the period before members reach retirement and 5.5% p.a. in the post-
retirement period, and that pensions increase at 2.5% p.a. Assets were valued at their market value as at 31 March 2002.
At 31 March 2002 the market value of the assets of the deﬁned beneﬁt section of the Scheme was £727.7m and this was sufﬁcient to cover 92%
of the liabilities for beneﬁts due to members in respect of service prior to that date. As explained in (b)(i) of this note, the Group will be making
additional contributions to the Scheme in 2003 to address this shortfall. Contributions to the Scheme in 2002 amounted to £18.1m (2001: £11.8m).
The excess of £2.4m of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension charge over the contributions has reduced the prepayment of £21.8m at the start of the year.
An asset of £19.4m representing total net accumulated prepaid contributions is included in the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2002.
Post-retirement beneﬁts
The Group provides post-retirement medical beneﬁts to certain pensioners and active employees. The liability has been assessed by an independent
qualiﬁed actuary as at 31 December 2002, using the projected unit method. The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were a discount
rate of 6.0% and medical beneﬁt cost inﬂation of 8.0% for 2 years gradually reducing to 4.35% over 5 years and remaining at 4.35% thereafter.
The charge in the year for post-retirement medical beneﬁts in the Group accounts is £1.6m (2001: £1.4m). 
(b) FRS 17 Retirement Beneﬁts: Group accounts
(i) Deﬁned beneﬁt section
The following disclosures are provided under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 which requires certain disclosures only for periods ending
subsequent to 22 June 2002. The amounts disclosed under these transitional arrangements, which apply to both the funded and unfunded
Schemes, are not included in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. If FRS 17 were to be fully adopted, the impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheet,
Proﬁt and Loss Account and Statement of Total Recognsied Gains and Losses would be as set out below. 
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2002 and updated by an independent
qualiﬁed actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2002. Scheme
assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2002.

There is a provision of £20.2m in the Group accounts at 31 December 2002 (2001: £18.6m) for post-retirement medical beneﬁts (see note 34),
which is based on SSAP 24 and assumes a discount rate of 6.0%. Under FRS 17, a discount rate of 5.5% would be used, increasing the provision
to £22.0m (2001: £20.2m). Other assumptions would be unchanged.

The deﬁned beneﬁt section of the Scheme is closed to new members. Therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost will
increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
The Group made contributions of £15.0m during the year being 15.4% of pensionable salary (2001: £9.3m being 9% of pensionable salary). 
It has been agreed with the trustees that the contribution rate for 2003 will be 17.5%, plus an additional £1.5m per month.
(ii) Deﬁned contribution section
Employer contributions payable during the year were £2.9m (2001: £2.5m). There were no unpaid contributions at 31 December 2002 or 
31 December 2001.
(c) Company accounts
It is not possible, on a reasonable basis, to identify the Company’s share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt section of
the Scheme and accordingly the Company will account for the Scheme as a deﬁned contribution scheme in accordance with paragraph 9(b) of FRS 17.
The Company contributions payable during the year to the defined benefit section were £10.0m (2001: £6.5m). There were no unpaid
contributions at 31 December 2002 or 31 December 2001.
The Company contributions payable during the year to the defined contribution section were £2.3m (2001: £1.9m). There were no unpaid
contributions at 31 December 2002 or 31 December 2001.

Contingent liabilities
In addition to the above amounts, the Group is presently in discussions with the Inland Revenue regarding the utilisation of certain tax allowances
in respect of one speciﬁc transaction undertaken by its leasing operation in 1997. The transaction subsequently resulted in reduced corporation tax
paid by the Group of approximately £30m. The Group has taken legal advice and does not believe that any additional tax liability should arise
from these discussions. However, if any additional liability were to arise, there are indemnities and legal rights, which should enable recoveries
from third parties. Therefore no provision is necessary.
Litigation
Certain Group undertakings are engaged in litigation, involving claims by and against them which arise in the ordinary course of business. The
directors, after reviewing the claims pending and threatened against Group undertakings and taking into account the advice of the relevant legal
advisers, are satisﬁed that the outcome of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the net assets of the Group.
42 Guarantees and other financial commitments
a) Alliance & Leicester International Limited, a subsidiary licensed under the Isle of Man Banking Acts 1975 to 1986, has a contingent liability 
to the Isle of Man Depositors Compensation Scheme.

43 Risk management
The Group uses ﬁnancial instruments, including derivatives, to manage its ﬁnancial risks.
Financial instruments have the potential to reduce, modify or increase the liquidity, credit and market risks arising from normal business activities.
Details of the objectives and policies for managing the risks associated with the Group’s use of ﬁnancial instruments are presented in the Financial
Review on page 24. These disclosures form part of the audited ﬁnancial statements.
i) Interest rate repricing analysis
The following table provides a summary of the interest rate repricing proﬁle of the Group’s assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2002. 
Assets and liabilities have been allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next interest rate reset date and the contractual maturity
date. The table takes account of derivative ﬁnancial interests whose effect is to alter the interest basis of Group assets and liabilities.
The trading book and non-interest bearing balances have been included in a separate column; the interest rate risk of the trading book is analysed
under ii) below.
Differences between the balance sheet and the totals below for 2001 arise due to the exclusion of life assurance assets and liabilities from the
interest rate repricing analysis.

ii) Trading book
The Group’s trading activities are conducted through the Group’s Treasury division. Material trading assets comprise debt securities for which the
carrying value is equal to the fair value at 31 December 2002 and 2001. Dealing proﬁts are disclosed in note 3.
The bank uses a variety of techniques to measure market risk in the trading book, including calculating the sensitivity of the market value of
positions to hypothetical changes in interest rates. The following table sets out the change in the value of the trading book arising from a 1%
change in market interest rates, for the year ended 31 December 2002, with all other variables remaining constant:
Change in value
£m £m
2002 2001
Highest exposure 0.9 1.0
Lowest exposure 0.3 0.0
Average exposure 0.5 0.4
Exposure as at 31 December 0.5 0.4
The sensitivity analysis technique used by the Group measures the change in the fair value of the Group’s trading book arising from hypothetical
changes in market rates. Actual results in the future could differ from these projected figures if fluctuations in interest rates exceeded the
hypothetical 1% shift. The Group’s trading book is not materially exposed to other market risks.
iii) Fair values
The table below compares the book and fair values of some of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments by category at the balance sheet date. Where
available, market prices have been used to determine fair values. Where market prices are not available, fair values have been calculated for
options by using option-pricing models and for other ﬁnancial instruments by discounting cash ﬂows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Minor changes in assumptions used could have a signiﬁcant impact on the resulting estimated fair values, and, as a result, readers of these
ﬁnancial statements are advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group’s ﬁnancial position.
The concept of fair value assumes realisation of ﬁnancial instruments by way of sale. However, in many cases, the Group intends to realise assets
through collection over time.

The tables below analyse the Group’s derivatives portfolios by type of contract and maturity and shows the contract amount and the replacement
cost. Contract amount indicates the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and does not represent amounts at risk. The
replacement cost represents the cost of replacing contracts, calculated at market rates current at the balance sheet date and reﬂects the Group’s
exposure should counterparties default. No account is taken of offsetting positions with the same counterparty.

iv) Hedging
As explained in the Financial Review on pages 22 to 24, the Group’s policy is to hedge the following exposures:
• Interest rate risk – using interest rate swaps, caps, collars and ﬂoors, futures and forward rate agreements;
• Transactional currency exposures – using spot and forward foreign exchange transactions.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows:

The above table shows the gains and losses on off-balance sheet derivative instruments used for hedging by the Group. The gains and losses do
not therefore represent absolute gains or losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from
on-balance sheet instruments.

Notes
a) Capital is allocated to business sectors on the basis of 7% equity and 3.5% subordinated debt. Excess capital is held within Treasury & Group.
b) Costs have been assigned to each sector based on resources consumed. Corporate overheads not directly attributable to business units, including strategy costs of £50.6m
(2001: £84.7m) are included within Treasury & Group.
c) The Group operates entirely within the banking and insurance business, and operations are not managed on the basis of an allocation of net assets. The level of banking assets 
can ﬂuctuate throughout the year, therefore the information derived from the year end ﬁgures does not provide a picture representative of the year as a whole. A more meaningful
analysis of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities by business sector is contained within the Business and Financial Reviews on pages 8 to 24.

to bank base rate, incentives fell £21m from £56m (December 2001)

a close proxy to the actual cost of discounts which impact the proﬁt 
and loss account.
The variable rate discounts have an average remaining life of 21 months
(December 2001: 23 months). For ﬁxed rate discounts, the average
remaining period was 24 months (December 2001: 16 months). At the
end of December 2002 42% (December 2001: 54%) of balances on
individual mortgage accounts, including ﬁxed and variable rate
mortgages, were covered by redemption penalties.

Answers to some frequently-asked shareholder questions
Chairman’s Message
Welcome to Alliance & Leicester’s 2002 Summary Annual Report 
from Chairman John Windeler
Group Chief Executive’s Statement
Richard Pym summarises Alliance & Leicester’s business performance in 2002
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to be able to report another successful year for Alliance & Leicester plc.
During 2002 the Group made excellent progress in implementing our customer
focused strategy, as shown in our ﬁnancial results, which met our targets for revenues
and costs. We have seen growth in sales across our business, and we are receiving
increasing recognition amongst commentators of the beneﬁts of our strategy.
Pre-tax proﬁt in 2002 was £468m, up by 18% on 2001. Basic earnings per share were
up 21% to 68.0p. The Board has proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 26.9p, making a total
dividend of 39.9p, a 10% increase on the equivalent ﬁgure for 2001. We also bought
back and cancelled 22.7m shares costing £188m, improving our capital efﬁciency.
Whilst the economic outlook is uncertain, we are confident that by maintaining 
our focus on driving real value, on simpliﬁcation and on excellent customer service,
Alliance & Leicester will continue to be successful in 2003.
John R. Windeler, Chairman
We are making good progress towards delivering 
our vision of becoming “the most customer focused
ﬁnancial services provider in the UK – bar none”. 
In 2003 we will continue to implement that vision, 
by continuing to offer our customers good value
products, friendly and approachable customer
service, straightforward communications and by
recognising and rewarding customers who buy
additional products from us.
Our Retail Banking business has had an excellent 
year in 2002. Pre-tax profit was up 14% to £432m,
income was up over 5%, costs were down 2%, and
asset quality remains strong.
Retail Banking’s core products of mortgages, savings,
current accounts and unsecured personal loans all saw
franchise growth. During 2002 we achieved record
gross mortgage lending of £6.4bn, grew our personal
customer deposit balances to £17.5bn, opened
184,000 new current accounts and increased proﬁts
from unsecured personal lending by 34%.
Pre-tax profit in our Commercial Banking division 
was £70m, compared to £74m in 2001. This reﬂected 
£9m of increased costs associated with changes to 
the market for cash in the UK and the role of the
Post Ofﬁce in the cash cycle. During 2002 we put 
in place new processes to prepare ourselves for the
changing future of that market. Commercial Banking
saw growth in each of its main businesses, including
increases in the amount of cash we handled and 
sold, and in the number of small business accounts
we opened.
The quality of our balance sheet is of immense
importance to Alliance & Leicester. We have maintained
our rigorous policies to ensure that we accept only high
quality business, and this has been reﬂected in our
asset quality – which remains strong.
In July 2002 we announced the extension of our
already successful partnership with Legal & General.
As well as investment products, Legal & General now
also supply the life assurance products which we sell
to our customers. In August 2002, we announced the
sale of our credit card accounts to MBNA. The credit
card market is a global market, and partnering with a
major world-wide player means that we can continue
to offer our customers very attractive products, whilst
focusing our own resources on what we do best.
We celebrated Alliance & Leicester’s 150th Anniversary
on 15 November 2002. From our origins in Leicester,
the Group has grown, both organically and via
acquisitions, to be a leading player in UK ﬁnancial
services. With so much good work put in place in
2002, and 150 years of experience behind us, we 
look forward to the future with conﬁdence.
Richard A. Pym, Group Chief Executive
Our vision is to be
the most customer
focused financial
services provider in
the UK – bar none
The Facts and Figures
Summary Annual 
Report 2002
10%
increase in dividend
payment 
(to 39.9p per share)
How does the return I get on my shares compare 
to investing my money in a savings account?
Share prices move up and down, so calculating 
a return on the shares is very difficult. However,
based on a share price of say £7.50 per share, a
39.9p dividend would represent a 5.3% return before
tax. This compares very favourably with savings
accounts where returns typically range between 
3% and 4% before tax.
The reason for the lower return 
on savings accounts is that this 
investment is virtually risk free 
whereas returns from shares are 
more volatile.
When will I receive my dividend?
Dividends are paid twice a year. Normally an interim
dividend is paid in October, based on the results for
the ﬁrst six months, and a ﬁnal dividend is paid in
May based on the full annual results.
How much dividend will I receive?
The interim dividend paid on 14 October 2002 was
13.0p per share. The Board has proposed a ﬁnal
dividend of 26.9p per share due to be paid on 12 May
2003. The ﬁnal dividend needs to be approved at the
Company’s Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2003.
Your total dividend based on the 2002 results will
therefore amount to 39.9p per share, compared to 
36.3p for the 2001 results, a 10% increase.
Do I pay tax on my dividend?
Tax is basically deducted at a rate of 10% from your
dividend which is not reclaimable from the Inland
Revenue. If you are a higher rate tax payer you will 
have further tax to pay on your dividend via the
Inland Revenue’s Self Assessment system.

year in 2002. Pre-tax profit was up 14% to £432m,
income was up over 5%, costs were down 2%, and
asset quality remains strong.
Retail Banking’s core products of mortgages, savings,
current accounts and unsecured personal loans all saw
franchise growth. During 2002 we achieved record
gross mortgage lending of £6.4bn, grew our personal
customer deposit balances to £17.5bn, opened
184,000 new current accounts and increased proﬁts
from unsecured personal lending by 34%.
Pre-tax profit in our Commercial Banking division 
was £70m, compared to £74m in 2001. This reﬂected 
£9m of increased costs associated with changes to 
the market for cash in the UK and the role of the
Post Ofﬁce in the cash cycle. During 2002 we put 
in place new processes to prepare ourselves for the
changing future of that market. Commercial Banking
saw growth in each of its main businesses, including
increases in the amount of cash we handled and 
sold, and in the number of small business accounts
we opened.
The quality of our balance sheet is of immense
importance to Alliance & Leicester. We have maintained
our rigorous policies to ensure that we accept only high
quality business, and this has been reﬂected in our
asset quality – which remains strong.
In July 2002 we announced the extension of our
already successful partnership with Legal & General.
As well as investment products, Legal & General now
also supply the life assurance products which we sell
to our customers. In August 2002, we announced the
sale of our credit card accounts to MBNA. The credit
card market is a global market, and partnering with a
major world-wide player means that we can continue
to offer our customers very attractive products, whilst
focusing our own resources on what we do best.
We celebrated Alliance & Leicester’s 150th Anniversary
on 15 November 2002. From our origins in Leicester,
the Group has grown, both organically and via
acquisitions, to be a leading player in UK ﬁnancial
services. With so much good work put in place in
2002, and 150 years of experience behind us, we 
look forward to the future with conﬁdence.

the most customer

The Facts and Figures
Summary Annual 
Report 2002
10%
increase in dividend
payment 
(to 39.9p per share)
How does the return I get on my shares compare 
to investing my money in a savings account?
Share prices move up and down, so calculating 
a return on the shares is very difficult. However,
based on a share price of say £7.50 per share, a
39.9p dividend would represent a 5.3% return before
tax. This compares very favourably with savings
accounts where returns typically range between 
3% and 4% before tax.
The reason for the lower return 
on savings accounts is that this 
investment is virtually risk free 
whereas returns from shares are 
more volatile.
When will I receive my dividend?
Dividends are paid twice a year. Normally an interim
dividend is paid in October, based on the results for
the ﬁrst six months, and a ﬁnal dividend is paid in
May based on the full annual results.
How much dividend will I receive?
The interim dividend paid on 14 October 2002 was
13.0p per share. The Board has proposed a ﬁnal
dividend of 26.9p per share due to be paid on 12 May
2003. The ﬁnal dividend needs to be approved at the
Company’s Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2003.
Your total dividend based on the 2002 results will
therefore amount to 39.9p per share, compared to 
36.3p for the 2001 results, a 10% increase.
Do I pay tax on my dividend?
Tax is basically deducted at a rate of 10% from your
dividend which is not reclaimable from the Inland
Revenue. If you are a higher rate tax payer you will 
have further tax to pay on your dividend via the
Inland Revenue’s Self Assessment system.

Report of the Independent Auditors
The independent auditors’ report on the full accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2002 was unqualiﬁed
and did not contain a statement under section 251 of
the Companies Act 1985.
Independent Auditors’
Report
Independent Auditors’ Statement to the Members 
of Alliance & Leicester plc
We have examined the summary ﬁnancial statement,
which comprises the summary consolidated proﬁt
and loss account and summary consolidated balance
sheet, and the summary directors’ report.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,
as a body, in accordance with section 251 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our work has been undertaken
so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company, and the Company’s members as a body,
for our audit work, for this report, for our audit
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and
Auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the
summary annual report in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law. Our responsibility 
is to report to you our opinion on the consistency 
of the summary ﬁnancial statement with the full
annual accounts, the directors’ report and the
directors’ remuneration report, and its compliance
with the relevant requirements of section 251 of 
the Companies Act 1985 and the regulations made
thereunder. We also read the other information
contained in the summary annual report and 
consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the summary ﬁnancial statement.

In our opinion, the summary ﬁnancial statement

The Company may ‘match’ an award of deferred
shares on the basis of up to three matched shares 
for each deferred share for upper quartile Total
Shareholder Return performance over a three-year
period relative to a peer group of Retail Banks. 
Share Options
Under the Scheme rules, share options may be
granted over shares with a value that cannot
normally exceed two times basic salary per annum. 
Annual grants have typically been up to one times
basic salary. Options are exercisable at the share
price at grant, so any benefit is dependent upon 
a subsequent share price increase. Options cannot
normally be exercised for three years from the date 
of grant and become exercisable only if growth in
Earnings Per Share exceeds the increase in the Retail
Price Index by at least 9% over a three-year period. 
Executive directors may also participate in the
Company’s existing Employee Share Schemes such 
as the SAYE Share Option Scheme and the Share
Incentive Plan, on the same basis as all other employees.
Pensions
Executive directors are members of a deﬁned beneﬁt
pension scheme. 
Other Beneﬁts
Executive directors are eligible for a range of 
benefits, which include the provision of company
cars, life assurance, concessionary mortgage and
private medical insurance.
Remuneration for Non-Executive Directors
The fees of the non-executive directors are
determined by the Board as a whole in the light 
of recommendations by the Group Chief Executive.
Other beneﬁts for non-executive directors include 
the reimbursement of travel and other incidental
expenses for attendance at Board or other meetings
in connection with the Company’s business. No
options are granted to non-executive directors. 
Mr J R Windeler (Chairman) is employed under 
a contract terminable on three months’ notice, 
until his 60th birthday (in March 2003). Thereafter 
he will continue as a non-executive director on 
the basis of an appointment letter similar to that
applicable to other non-executive directors, subject 
to three months’ notice. He participates in the
Company Pension Scheme until his 60th birthday
and retains share options granted whilst an
executive director.

The 2001 results have been restated for two changes in accounting policy:
(i) The Group has adopted FRS 19 “Deferred Tax”. Previously, deferred tax was provided only on assets and liabilities where it was expected that the tax
would crystallise in the foreseeable future. Now, under FRS 19, deferred tax is provided on all timing differences which have not reversed by the balance
sheet date. This has resulted in an increase of £2.9m in the tax charge for 2001 and an increase in ‘Other liabilities’ of £5.9m at 31 December 2001.
(ii) The Group has adopted ICAEW guidance on accounting for fees earned from high loan-to-value mortgages. As a result, ‘Net interest income’ for
2001 has increased by £13.2m with a corresponding decrease in ‘Non-interest income’. ‘Loans and advances to customers’ at 31 December 2001 have
decreased by £36.1m, with a corresponding decrease in ‘Other liabilities’.
Approved by the Board of Directors on 20 February 2003 and signed on its behalf by: R A Pym, Group Chief Executive and D J Bennett,
Group Finance Director.
Earnings per share
This is calculated by dividing proﬁts made by the
Group of £339.6m by the average number of
shares in issue of 499.4m.
Loans and advances to customers
This mainly consists of residential mortgages
(£23,457m), unsecured personal loans
(£2,136m), commercial loans (£1,425m) and
leases (£1,591m).
Proﬁt attributable to shareholders
Proﬁt earned in the year available to pay
dividends to shareholders and re-invest in the
business.
Dividends
Amounts paid to shareholders comprising the
interim dividend in October 2002 and ﬁnal
dividend payable in May 2003 (subject to approval
at the AGM).
Customer accounts
This comprises retail deposits (savings accounts,
current accounts etc.) of £17,546m and
commercial deposits of £4,814m.

to support the business.

The 2001 results have been restated for two changes in accounting policy:
(i) The Group has adopted FRS 19 “Deferred Tax”. Previously, deferred tax was provided only on assets and liabilities where it was expected that the tax
would crystallise in the foreseeable future. Now, under FRS 19, deferred tax is provided on all timing differences which have not reversed by the balance
sheet date. This has resulted in an increase of £2.9m in the tax charge for 2001 and an increase in ‘Other liabilities’ of £5.9m at 31 December 2001.
(ii) The Group has adopted ICAEW guidance on accounting for fees earned from high loan-to-value mortgages. As a result, ‘Net interest income’ for
2001 has increased by £13.2m with a corresponding decrease in ‘Non-interest income’. ‘Loans and advances to customers’ at 31 December 2001 have
decreased by £36.1m, with a corresponding decrease in ‘Other liabilities’.
Approved by the Board of Directors on 20 February 2003 and signed on its behalf by: R A Pym, Group Chief Executive and D J Bennett,
Group Finance Director.
Earnings per share
This is calculated by dividing proﬁts made by the
Group of £339.6m by the average number of
shares in issue of 499.4m.
Loans and advances to customers
This mainly consists of residential mortgages
(£23,457m), unsecured personal loans
(£2,136m), commercial loans (£1,425m) and
leases (£1,591m).
Proﬁt attributable to shareholders
Proﬁt earned in the year available to pay
dividends to shareholders and re-invest in the
business.
Dividends
Amounts paid to shareholders comprising the
interim dividend in October 2002 and ﬁnal
dividend payable in May 2003 (subject to approval
at the AGM).

This comprises retail deposits (savings accounts,
current accounts etc.) of £17,546m and

normally exceed two times basic salary per annum. 
Annual grants have typically been up to one times
basic salary. Options are exercisable at the share

a subsequent share price increase. Options cannot
normally be exercised for three years from the date 
of grant and become exercisable only if growth in
Earnings Per Share exceeds the increase in the Retail
Price Index by at least 9% over a three-year period. 
Executive directors may also participate in the
Company’s existing Employee Share Schemes such 
as the SAYE Share Option Scheme and the Share

The 2001 results have been restated for two changes in accounting policy:
(i) The Group has adopted FRS 19 “Deferred Tax”. Previously, deferred tax was provided only on assets and liabilities where it was expected that the tax
would crystallise in the foreseeable future. Now, under FRS 19, deferred tax is provided on all timing differences which have not reversed by the balance
sheet date. This has resulted in an increase of £2.9m in the tax charge for 2001 and an increase in ‘Other liabilities’ of £5.9m at 31 December 2001.
(ii) The Group has adopted ICAEW guidance on accounting for fees earned from high loan-to-value mortgages. As a result, ‘Net interest income’ for
2001 has increased by £13.2m with a corresponding decrease in ‘Non-interest income’. ‘Loans and advances to customers’ at 31 December 2001 have
decreased by £36.1m, with a corresponding decrease in ‘Other liabilities’.
Approved by the Board of Directors on 20 February 2003 and signed on its behalf by: R A Pym, Group Chief Executive and D J Bennett,
Group Finance Director.
Earnings per share
This is calculated by dividing proﬁts made by the
Group of £339.6m by the average number of
shares in issue of 499.4m.
Loans and advances to customers
This mainly consists of residential mortgages
(£23,457m), unsecured personal loans
(£2,136m), commercial loans (£1,425m) and
leases (£1,591m).
Proﬁt attributable to shareholders
Proﬁt earned in the year available to pay
dividends to shareholders and re-invest in the
business.
Dividends
Amounts paid to shareholders comprising the
interim dividend in October 2002 and ﬁnal
dividend payable in May 2003 (subject to approval
at the AGM).
Customer accounts
This comprises retail deposits (savings accounts,
current accounts etc.) of £17,546m and
commercial deposits of £4,814m.

Answers to some frequently-asked shareholder questions
Chairman’s Message
Welcome to Alliance & Leicester’s 2002 Summary Annual Report 
from Chairman John Windeler
Group Chief Executive’s Statement
Richard Pym summarises Alliance & Leicester’s business performance in 2002
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to be able to report another successful year for Alliance & Leicester plc.
During 2002 the Group made excellent progress in implementing our customer
focused strategy, as shown in our ﬁnancial results, which met our targets for revenues
and costs. We have seen growth in sales across our business, and we are receiving
increasing recognition amongst commentators of the beneﬁts of our strategy.
Pre-tax proﬁt in 2002 was £468m, up by 18% on 2001. Basic earnings per share were
up 21% to 68.0p. The Board has proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 26.9p, making a total
dividend of 39.9p, a 10% increase on the equivalent ﬁgure for 2001. We also bought
back and cancelled 22.7m shares costing £188m, improving our capital efﬁciency.
Whilst the economic outlook is uncertain, we are confident that by maintaining 
our focus on driving real value, on simpliﬁcation and on excellent customer service,
Alliance & Leicester will continue to be successful in 2003.
John R. Windeler, Chairman
We are making good progress towards delivering 
our vision of becoming “the most customer focused
ﬁnancial services provider in the UK – bar none”. 
In 2003 we will continue to implement that vision, 
by continuing to offer our customers good value
products, friendly and approachable customer
service, straightforward communications and by
recognising and rewarding customers who buy
additional products from us.
Our Retail Banking business has had an excellent 
year in 2002. Pre-tax profit was up 14% to £432m,
income was up over 5%, costs were down 2%, and
asset quality remains strong.
Retail Banking’s core products of mortgages, savings,
current accounts and unsecured personal loans all saw
franchise growth. During 2002 we achieved record
gross mortgage lending of £6.4bn, grew our personal
customer deposit balances to £17.5bn, opened
184,000 new current accounts and increased proﬁts
from unsecured personal lending by 34%.
Pre-tax profit in our Commercial Banking division 
was £70m, compared to £74m in 2001. This reﬂected 
£9m of increased costs associated with changes to 
the market for cash in the UK and the role of the
Post Ofﬁce in the cash cycle. During 2002 we put 
in place new processes to prepare ourselves for the
changing future of that market. Commercial Banking
saw growth in each of its main businesses, including
increases in the amount of cash we handled and 
sold, and in the number of small business accounts
we opened.
The quality of our balance sheet is of immense
importance to Alliance & Leicester. We have maintained
our rigorous policies to ensure that we accept only high
quality business, and this has been reﬂected in our
asset quality – which remains strong.
In July 2002 we announced the extension of our
already successful partnership with Legal & General.
As well as investment products, Legal & General now
also supply the life assurance products which we sell
to our customers. In August 2002, we announced the
sale of our credit card accounts to MBNA. The credit
card market is a global market, and partnering with a
major world-wide player means that we can continue
to offer our customers very attractive products, whilst
focusing our own resources on what we do best.
We celebrated Alliance & Leicester’s 150th Anniversary
on 15 November 2002. From our origins in Leicester,
the Group has grown, both organically and via
acquisitions, to be a leading player in UK ﬁnancial
services. With so much good work put in place in
2002, and 150 years of experience behind us, we 
look forward to the future with conﬁdence.
Richard A. Pym, Group Chief Executive
Our vision is to be
the most customer

the UK – bar none
The Facts and Figures
Summary Annual 
Report 2002
10%
increase in dividend
payment 
(to 39.9p per share)
How does the return I get on my shares compare 
to investing my money in a savings account?
Share prices move up and down, so calculating 
a return on the shares is very difficult. However,
based on a share price of say £7.50 per share, a
39.9p dividend would represent a 5.3% return before
tax. This compares very favourably with savings
accounts where returns typically range between 
3% and 4% before tax.
The reason for the lower return 
on savings accounts is that this 
investment is virtually risk free 
whereas returns from shares are 
more volatile.
When will I receive my dividend?
Dividends are paid twice a year. Normally an interim
dividend is paid in October, based on the results for
the ﬁrst six months, and a ﬁnal dividend is paid in
May based on the full annual results.
How much dividend will I receive?
The interim dividend paid on 14 October 2002 was
13.0p per share. The Board has proposed a ﬁnal
dividend of 26.9p per share due to be paid on 12 May
2003. The ﬁnal dividend needs to be approved at the
Company’s Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2003.
Your total dividend based on the 2002 results will
therefore amount to 39.9p per share, compared to 
36.3p for the 2001 results, a 10% increase.
Do I pay tax on my dividend?
Tax is basically deducted at a rate of 10% from your
dividend which is not reclaimable from the Inland
Revenue. If you are a higher rate tax payer you will 
have further tax to pay on your dividend via the
Inland Revenue’s Self Assessment system.

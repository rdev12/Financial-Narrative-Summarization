CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S LETTER 7
This context forced a reprioritisation of objectives. Looking 
to capitalise on the brand’s momentum, management
focused on the growth opportunities. SAP implementation
was re-phased to minimise potential disruption, while the
distribution and logistics reconfiguration required acceleration.
Implementation of other operational initiatives slowed relative
to the initial plan – supplier transition and Spain integration,
as examples.
The front end/back end tension required this accelerated
growth to be funded by incremental expense – from temporary
warehouse facilities to the parallel running and maintenance
of legacy information systems, among other limitations on 
the ability to rationalise the infrastructure as planned. 
Despite these impediments, the Group produced a 14%
increase in underlying adjusted operating profit for the year
against a 17% gain in the previous period.
Foundation for the future
While executing Phase I, management also began to lay 
the foundation for the plan’s next phases. New businesses,
including Burberry Sport and jewellery, were introduced.
Childrenswear was elevated to full product division status.
New, closer, collaborative relationships are being formed in
the Middle East and China, and a more precise view of the
opportunities in our large Spain business is emerging.
Beyond commercial activities, we have also formalised the
Burberry Foundation, its board of trustees, and the global
organisations it will initially support with grants and employee
volunteering and mentoring programmes as coordinated by
our internal employee board. The Foundation along with
Burberry’s new Horseferry headquarters will further unite 
our teams and solidify our culture.
Our teams around the world remain the most important
ingredient of Burberry’s success. Their passion, dedication,
adaptability and drive continue to impress and inspire me
every day. Together, we intensely executed on the core
strategies while navigating a transformational year, and
delivered strong financial results. With a powerful brand,
brilliant creative director and seasoned management team,
Burberry is well equipped to face the challenges of the 
year ahead. 
Angela Ahrendts
Chief Executive Officer 
I am pleased to report that 2007/08 was another strong 
year for Burberry. We continued to be true to the brand’s
amazing heritage, while evolving to capture the present. 
We executed current priorities, while thoughtfully evolving
our plans and structure for the future.
Having refined the strategic agenda during 2006/07,
Burberry’s management and their teams were intensely
focused on executing across the five strategic themes in 
this first full year of execution. With these efforts, the first
stage of the strategic plan is now largely implemented. 
The Group achieved a milestone year: reaching nearly 
£1 billion in revenue, opening a record number of stores 
and concessions, and achieving double digit growth across
primary product categories, geographic regions and
wholesale and retail channels. The year’s 18% underlying
revenue growth was on top of 15% growth in 2006/07.
Intensely executing Phase I
Major execution themes in 2007/08 included:
– Organisation enhancement. Continued enhancement 
of the organisation’s efficiency and effectiveness.
Regionally, this was achieved with more complete
integrations of each of the European and Asian regions.
Functionally, the Group moved closer to its goal of a 
single, seamless design, merchandising and supply chain
organisation. Corporately, business units adopted more
formalised methods of reporting and communications.
– Front-end evolution. The front end also continued 
its evolution with the singular brand vision more clear
throughout the organisation and the ‘One Brand’ strategy
more consistently pursued. The year saw further alignment
of design and merchandising, a shift in marketing to
encompass the full brand expression and efforts to more
closely include global licensing partners in these initiatives.
– Back-end transformation. In 2007/08 fundamental
transformation of the back end of the business – the
operational core – began. SAP implementation entered 
its most intensive phase, with deployment in key central
functions and European retail operations. Restructuring 
of the sourcing network gained momentum and
reconfiguration of local distribution operations began. 
This fundamental transformation extends into 2008/09.
Dynamic prioritisation
This progression across the organisation, front and back
ends, resulted in a challenging tension. Advances on the 
front end enabled the business’s accelerated growth, while
creating ever greater demands on Burberry’s transitional
infrastructure. This growth was on top of the strong revenue
expansion in 2006/07.    11
GROUP OVERVIEW
The past
Burberry was founded in 1856, when Thomas Burberry
constructed his first outerwear pieces for the local
sportsmen of Basingstoke, England. In the century 
and a half since then, Burberry has come to represent 
the standard for quality and style in outerwear, anchored 
by its iconic trench coats, now legendary the world over.
As early as the beginning of the twentieth century, Burberry
was operating stores in Paris, London and Buenos Aires; its
clientele have been international for over a century, evidence
of the brand’s appeal and cachet across cultures. 
Throughout the decades Burberry has continued to honour
the brand’s defining elements and legacy, while tailoring its
products to meet the needs of present consumers:
– Authentic British heritage, rooted in the integrity 
of outerwear
– Broad consumer appeal, across genders and generations
– Globally recognised icon portfolio – the trench coat,
trademark check and the Prorsum horse logo
The present
In 2007 Burberry was listed by Interbrand among the 100
most valuable global brands. Looking forward to the next
chapter, management continue to build on the brand and 
its outstanding platform:
– Unique democratic positioning in the luxury sector
– Multi-category competence: womenswear, menswear, 
non-apparel – with innovative, functional outerwear 
at the core
– Global reach with a balance across geographies
– Channel expertise in retail, wholesale and licensing
– A unified, seasoned management team
The team remains acutely aware of the brand’s heritage 
and the associated responsibility while mindful of emerging
market trends, rising new economies and changing
consumer demands.
The following pages outline Burberry’s strategy through 
the lens of the five strategic themes:
– Leveraging the franchise
– Intensifying non-apparel development
– Accelerating retail-led growth
– Investing in under-penetrated markets
– Pursuing operational excellence       18
LEVERAGING THE FRANCHISE
FRONT-END OPPORTUNITIES
Total underlying revenue growth 2007/08
+18%
Through more coordinated use of brand assets 
and greater integration of its organisation around 
the globe, Burberry has the opportunity to enhance
consumer responsiveness and operate more
efficiently and effectively. The potential remains 
at both the front end of the business, as well as 
in back-of-house operations.
The front end comprises everything the consumer
sees – products, marketing imagery, and stores. 
Key initiatives include:
– Capitalising on unique positioning. Burberry is
uniquely positioned. No other brand within the
luxury sector enjoys a comparable platform:
approach to the consumer, product breadth 
and global reach. Day after day, year after 
year, management seeks to capitalise on 
the opportunities inherent in this positioning.
– Maintaining brand momentum. Aspirational
marketing supports all strategies. In 2007/08
Burberry’s consumer communication was
restructured for greater clarity and reach. Burberry
now consistently delivers the full seasonal expression
of the brand to targeted consumers throughout 
all mediums: runway fashion, modern classic 
style, casual lifestyle across outerwear, apparel 
and non-apparel categories.
– Rebalancing the product portfolio. Burberry’s
renowned Prorsum runway collection continued 
to lead the reshaping of the product pyramid.
Prorsum sales nearly doubled during the year. 
As the highest expression of the brand, Prorsum
also led the way to design innovation throughout
the pyramid.
– Reinforcing outerwear heritage and leadership.
Rooted in the iconic trench coat, outerwear 
is the brand defining category. To maintain its
leadership, Burberry concentrates on design
innovation, category segmentation and supply
chain specialisation. In 2007/08 the launch of
Burberry Sport added another dimension to 
the outerwear offering.  20
LEVERAGING THE FRANCHISE
BACK-OF-HOUSE OPPORTUNITIES
Back-of-house operations comprise the infrastructure
and administrative elements that the consumer never
sees, but are required to produce Burberry’s creative
front end.
Historically, Burberry’s organisation has been highly
decentralised. In 2007/08 the Group continued 
to integrate, streamline and simplify the structure 
and processes, creating a more effective and 
efficient model.
– Central. Burberry continued to elevate and
strengthen central functions in supply chain
(including sourcing, quality assurance and 
control, distribution, customer service), planning
and procurement. External expertise was added
where required, while internal talent was realigned
to support and leverage.
– Regions. In Europe, the Group combined the 
retail and wholesale businesses, creating a single
integrated unit better able to capitalise on the
opportunities presented by the region. In Asia,
Burberry largely completed the integration of a
regional unit from a legacy of individual country
operations. At the same time, key functional
expertise was added across the regions to 
support continued excellence in execution 
of core strategies.
Global licences
Global licences remain a key component in leveraging
the Burberry franchise. These relationships extend
the brand into important consumer categories which
require the specialised expertise of licensing partners.
In eyewear, a new sun and optical business was
rolled out across the globe. The second half of the
year saw the successful global launch of Burberry
The Beat, a new women’s fragrance.      INTENSIFYING NON-APPAREL DEVELOPMENT
26
Intensify, focus on and invest in non-apparel categories. 
While non-apparel was Burberry’s fastest growing
product segment in 2007/08, this business continues
to offer substantial room for growth. In product
categories, such as shoes, small leather goods and
belts Burberry’s presence is small relative to the total
market. Non-apparel provides the opportunity to
further leverage Burberry’s unique positioning, 
design and merchandising expertise and iconic
branding. The Group is intensifying its focus on 
these categories through investment in product
development, marketing and supply chain.
– Handbags. In 2007/08, Burberry continued to 
build the luxury assortment in handbags with 
this pyramid tier accounting for over 40% of
handbag sales in its own stores. The offering
continues to attract new luxury fashion consumers
to the brand. At the same time, modern 
inspirations continued to re-energise and elevate
core handbag programmes. In 2007, Burberry
appeared among the top ten handbag brands 
on the Luxury Institute’s list of brands named 
by luxury customers.
– Shoes. Shoe sales more than doubled in the year.
Investment in design and technical product expertise
along with supply chain functions, in combination
with consistent focus on development across the
product pyramid, continued to drive the growth of
this category.
– Increased marketing focus. Non-apparel categories
continued to receive marketing and PR focus 
via prominence on the runway, editorial priority 
and heightened presence in global advertising
campaigns. In spring 2008, iconic merchandise
benefited from renewed marketing emphasis.

ACCELERATING RETAIL-LED GROWTH
Retail-led growth refers not only to the operation of
Burberry’s own stores, but also to a fundamental shift
in the Group’s operating culture. Burberry continues
to move from a relatively static, traditional, wholesale
structure to a more dynamic, retail culture and
mindset. This more consumer-centric, responsive
organisation is having a positive impact on directly
operated stores, franchise partners, wholesale
customers and licensing partners worldwide. 
Centrally, we continue to work on:
– Efficient collections. Re-orientating design and
merchandising toward more style efficient and
frequent collections.
– Flow frequency. Increasing the frequency of new
goods flowing to stores.
– Extend replenishment. Developing a more extensive
replenishment programme.
– Delivery accuracy. Improving the accuracy of
scheduled product deliveries.
Looking to the retail stores, we remain focused on:
– Enhancing store productivity. Through balanced
assortments, compelling visual presentations,
improved sales and service and engaging
marketing we look to drive traffic, increase
conversion and build average transaction size.
Comparable store sales increased 8% in 2007/08.
– Accelerating new store openings. This includes
department store concessions, flagships in new,
high-demographic markets, and additional stores 
in new and proven markets. The Group opened 
net 76 stores during the year.
– Developing and testing retail concepts. In 2007/08,
Burberry began testing a new smaller format store
concept featuring a largely non-apparel assortment
of core accessories, shoes and outerwear.
E-commerce, still a relatively new business for
Burberry, now extends to 26 European countries.
– Upgrade store image. The Group continues to
renovate high profile locations worldwide with 
a brighter, modern, aesthetic and more efficient 
and productive design concept.
Underlying retail revenue growth 2007/08
+20%      38
INVESTING IN UNDER-PENETRATED MARKETS
For Burberry, under-penetrated markets consist of
both developed markets like the U.S. and emerging
economies, including China, India, the Middle East
and Russia. The Group utilises all three of its
distribution channels (retail, wholesale and licensing)
to optimise its approach to these opportunities.
North America continues to present rich growth
prospects. Ongoing efforts with key department and
specialty stores customers combined with rapidly
expanding retail operations (net eight stores added)
drove over 20% underlying sales growth in the North
American market in 2007/08. The addition of regional
product merchandising, sales and store expertise has
underpinned this growth and provided a platform for
the future.
In emerging consumer economies, Burberry 
works with local partners who possess the specific
knowledge and resources required to develop the
brand in their respective regions. In the Middle East,
for example, Burberry has franchised retail and
wholesale distribution for the UAE, Kuwait and 
Saudi Arabia since 2004. This has resulted in a 
highly successful operation with eight stores and
27% revenue growth in 2007/08. 
Number of stores in emerging markets as at March 2008
79      44
PURSUING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
Burberry continues to pursue its goal to be
recognised as much for operational expertise 
as for product and marketing excellence.
Project Atlas – a programme to redesign Burberry’s
business processes and information systems –
remains the key enabler as the Group seeks to
operate more efficiently and effectively. Having
successfully completed SAP deployment in core
central functions in 2007/08, the project moves 
to regional implementation in 2008/09. This
investment benefits every aspect of the business 
from product design to retail operations to 
financial reporting.
While Atlas operates on a global scale, Burberry
continues to enhance excellence within 
individual functions:
– Design. Continued style reduction to improve
sourcing efficiency, order fulfilment and 
retail productivity.
– Merchandising. Ongoing effort to build a more
dynamic and extensive replenishment programme
across retail and wholesale.
– Sourcing. Implementation of an integrated global
sourcing strategy and requisite organisation.
– Logistics and distribution. Development of a 
global logistics strategy, including transition 
to a global carrier programme and regional 
distribution hub configuration.
During the year, Burberry has also finalised
specification and design of its new Horseferry House
headquarters which will allow consolidation of
corporate and central functions currently partitioned
among five separate locations in London. Relocation
is planned for late autumn 2008.

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER 49
I would like to mark a significant Board change. In July 2007,
Rose Marie Bravo stepped down following a twelve-month
period as Vice-Chairman. As Chief Executive of Burberry 
from 1997 to June 2006, Rose Marie led the Group through
a time of enormous growth and transformation. I would like 
to thank Rose Marie for her decade of leadership and
contribution to Burberry and for her support of the Group’s
strategic vision for the future.
On behalf of all shareholders, I thank Angela and the team
whose people work together so seamlessly to deliver
consistent growth. I am confident of their continued 
success and of the long-term performance of the iconic
Burberry brand.
John Peace
Chairman
2007/08 has seen strong growth in Burberry’s sales and
profits, while the team has successfully delivered on the
critical elements of the Group’s five-point strategy for
generating future value.
This year, the Group neared £1billion in total revenue,
representing 18% underlying growth compared to the
previous financial year. Adjusted operating profit increased 
by 14% underlying while adjusted diluted EPS increased 
9% to 31.6p. Accordingly, the Board has announced 
a 14% increase in the full year dividend to 12.0p, as we
progressively move to a dividend payout ratio of 40%. 
We also returned a further £40m to shareholders via a 
share buyback.
As you can see from this Annual Report, Burberry has 
five very clear and measurable strategic initiatives, which
determine how it acts and how it invests. During the year,
Burberry has made further progress in enhancing the luxury
quotient of the business (led by the success of our Prorsum
ranges), growing retail (with a record number of store
openings) and increasing the penetration of non-apparel 
(now 32% of retail/wholesale revenue). At the same time, we
have been investing to strengthen Burberry’s infrastructure,
improving efficiency and giving us a platform from which to
grow the business so we can deliver sustainable, long-term
value to shareholders.
Looking ahead, we are facing an increasingly volatile
economic environment. Against this background, Burberry
remains above all committed to creating value for our
shareholders via the evolution and execution of our 
strategic initiatives.  50
BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
OVERVIEW
Burberry is a British global luxury brand with a solid platform, strong international recognition and differentiating brand
values that resonate across a multi-generational and dual-gender consumer base. Burberry designs, markets and sources
outerwear, womenswear, menswear, non-apparel and childrenswear categories, distributed through a diversified network of
retail, wholesale and licensing channels worldwide. Since its founding in England in 1856, Burberry has been synonymous
with outerwear quality and its trademarked check icon.
Regions Channels
Broad geographic portfolio
Burberry has a broad spread of operations around the 
world, with stores in 38 different countries. Burberry is 
under-represented in the Americas (currently 26% of sales) 
as well as Emerging Markets, including China, India, Russia,
Eastern Europe and the Middle East, which today contribute
6% to sales.
Balanced channel mix
Burberry sells its products to the end consumer through both
the retail and wholesale channels and has a good balance
between the two – retail was 49% of revenue in 2008 and
wholesale was 43%.
Americas: includes US and Canada 
Asia Pacific: South East Asia and Australasia
Retail: includes 97 mainline stores, 231 concessions within department stores and 
40 outlets
Wholesale: includes sales to hundreds of prestige department stores and specialty
retailers around the world, as well as sales to franchisees who operate 79 Burberry 
stores, mainly in Emerging Markets 
Licensing: royalty income received from Burberry’s partners in Japan and from global
licensees for fragrance, eyewear and timepieces

Products
Diversified offering
The Burberry brand has broad consumer appeal. The
business is balanced between womenswear (38% of 
2008 revenue), menswear (27%) and non-apparel (32%).
Outerwear is the core of the product offer and the category
in which Burberry is top-of-mind among consumers. 
Burberry continues to grow this category by constant
product innovation. Another of its key strategies is to 
grow non-apparel – revenue here increased by nearly 
40% in 2008. Burberry also sees opportunities in 
menswear and childrenswear over time. 
Product pyramid
As Burberry develops each collection, it thinks about building 
a ‘pyramid’ or product hierarchy in each product category.
At the top, are the Prorsum collections. These are the 
most luxurious and fashion forward lines, based on four
catwalk/runway shows each year – they provide design
inspiration for other ranges.
In the middle of the pyramid, is the London Collection – best
thought of as what Burberry’s customer wears weekdays.
And at the base of the pyramid, are the Lifestyle collections 
– best represented by what Burberry’s customer wears at 
the weekend.
Non–apparel: includes handbags, soft accessories such as scarves, small leather goods,
shoes, belts and jewellery
Other: mainly childrenswear
Historically, sales at Burberry have been concentrated in the
base of the pyramid. While it defends and innovates these
Lifestyle ranges, Burberry’s strategy is to improve the luxury
quotient of the business – driving up the proportion of sales
in the Prorsum and London Collections. This is a key
component of one of the five strategies – leveraging the
franchise and Burberry has proven success in areas such 
as luxury handbags and outerwear. 
Product pyramid
Prorsum

Lifestyle
The business is managed in three ways – by region, by product and by channel. Each category (womens, mens,
non-apparel and childrenswear) is distributed in all regions (Europe, Spain, Americas and Asia Pacific) through retail 
and wholesale channels and with selective licence arrangements.  BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
MARKETS
Markets in which Burberry operates 
Burberry operates in the global luxury sector. Although there
are many ways of defining this market, Burberry estimates it
is worth about £140bn globally.
As the chart below shows, the luxury goods market has
grown by about 9% per annum over the last few years. 
The fundamental long-term drivers of growth include:
– rising GDP around the world, particularly in emerging
economies including Brazil, Russia, India and China;
– rising disposable incomes, with more high net worth
individuals (HNWIs) in both core and emerging markets.
HNWIs are defined as consumers with financial assets 
(not including their primary residence) in excess of
US$1million. They have a higher propensity to purchase
luxury goods than other consumers;
– increasing demand for luxury brands, especially among 
the younger generation as consumer aspirations develop;
– more international travel and tourism; and 
– continuous product innovation by luxury brands creating
demand for new products.
The luxury goods market is made up of apparel (c.30%),
accessories (c.20%) including handbags and shoes, 
perfume and cosmetics (c.25%) and hard luxury (c.20%)
including watches and jewellery. Burberry designs and
sources its own products in the apparel and accessories
sectors. Elsewhere it uses the expertise of its global licence
partners, in categories often too technical for it to produce 
or distribute, such as fragrances, timepieces and eyewear.
Competitive position 
In the year to 31 March 2008, Burberry’s reported sales 
were £995m. If however its wholesale and licensing revenue
is converted to retail sales value (that is what the consumer
spends on Burberry products), the global sales of the
Burberry brand are estimated to be £3bn. This makes
Burberry a significant global luxury brand. 
Burberry competes with many different luxury goods
companies. Some are large international conglomerates,
owning many luxury brands; others are focused on just 
one brand globally; while others are smaller or more local
brands. Some are listed on stock exchanges around the
world; others are privately held. Burberry has slightly different
peers in womenswear, menswear and non-apparel as
Burberry is one of the few luxury brands that can succeed
across all categories. 
Part of Burberry’s management team’s remuneration 
depends on how well it performs relative to its peers. 
The full list of competitors used for this purpose is given 
on page 89 of this report and includes Bulgari, Hermes, 
LVMH, PPR and Richemont.

STRATEGY
Key strategies
To capitalise on the growth opportunities that Burberry has,
we have five key strategic initiatives, which are described in
detail on pages 10 to 47.
The following key performance indicators (KPIs) are reviewed
by the Board and the management team to assess Burberry’s
progress against its five strategic initiatives. Although the
trends in each of the KPIs below will obviously be influenced
by more than one of the strategic initiatives, the following
information provides investors with a clear scorecard for
Burberry’s performance. 
KPIS 54
BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
OUR KEY STRATEGIES AND KPIS
Leveraging the franchise
KPI: Total revenue growth, which measures the appeal of 
the brand to consumers, be it through Burberry stores or
those of its department store or specialty retail customers.
In 2008, Burberry’s revenue was £995m – an 18% 
underlying increase on the previous year. Sales through 
the retail channel increased by 20%; in wholesale by 20%
and licensing 3%, as the modernisation of its core icons, 
the diversified product offering and consistent marketing
message, continued to appeal to consumers globally. 
Intensifying non-apparel development
KPI: Growth in non-apparel revenue, which measures the
success of Burberry’s initiatives to expand in this category,
which includes handbags, small leather goods, scarves,
shoes, belts and jewellery. 
In 2008, non-apparel revenue increased by 39%, compared
to 18% for Burberry as a whole. Non-apparel accounted for
32% of retail and wholesale revenue, compared to 28% last
year. Luxury handbags continued to drive growth and
revenue from shoes more than doubled from a small base.

Accelerating retail-led growth
KPI: Growth in retail revenue, being comparable store sales
growth, which measures how Burberry is increasing the
productivity of its existing stores; plus sales from new space.
In 2008, comparable store sales growth increased by 8% 
(H1 11%; H2 6%) – a solid performance as global economic
conditions deteriorated throughout the year. The balance of
revenue growth came from new space, which increased 
12% on average during the year.
KPI: Number of stores, which measures how Burberry
extends the reach of its brand globally. 
Burberry opened 76 stores in 2008, including a net 20
mainline stores and a net 49 concessions around the world.
This is a marked acceleration from 2007 when it opened 11 
mainline stores and 17 concessions. In 2009, it expects to
open about 15 mainline stores and add a total of 12-13% 
to average selling space.
Investing in under-penetrated markets
KPI: Number of stores in Emerging Markets, which measures
how Burberry extends the reach of its brand in these high
potential countries. 
In Emerging Markets, in conjunction with its local partners,
Burberry added another 10 franchise stores during 2008.
(Burberry also reclassified 11 wholesale accounts to
franchise stores during 2007/08). Burberry expects about
15-20 new stores to be opened in 2009, including further
stores in Russia, India and the Middle East. 
In North America, which Burberry has also identified as an
under-penetrated market, underlying retail and wholesale
revenue increased by 26% in 2008.

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
OUR KEY STRATEGIES AND KPIS
Pursuing operational excellence
KPI: Retail and wholesale gross margin, which 
measures, among other things, how efficiently Burberry 
is sourcing products.
Creating shareholder value
KPI: Growth in adjusted diluted EPS which is a key valuation
metric for Burberry shareholders.
Gross margin in retail and wholesale channels combined
increased by 160 basis points in 2008 due to better 
sourcing of products and the mix change in favour of
non-apparel, which, as a whole, is a higher gross margin
category than apparel. For the year as a whole, retail and
wholesale revenue grew by broadly the same amount so
there was no mix impact. 
KPI: Adjusted retail and wholesale operating profit margin,
which measures how Burberry’s initiatives and its investment
to improve its business processes, including sourcing, IT and
logistics are impacting its profit margin.
Burberry’s adjusted retail and wholesale operating profit
margin increased by 30 basis points to 14.9% in 2008. The
increase in margin has been achieved after costs associated
with a record number of new store openings in the year and
significant investment in the corporate centre to support the
current and forecast levels of growth. Particular areas to
highlight are supply chain, IT, design and merchandising 
and marketing, as well as upgrading corporate functions. 
Adjusted diluted EPS rose 9% to 31.6p in 2008, reflecting
11% growth in adjusted operating profit, partially offset by 
a net interest charge of £6m and a higher tax rate in 2008
than the prior year. 
Total shareholder return
As explained on page 85 in the Report on Directors’
Remuneration and related matters, Burberry also monitors
Total Shareholder Return (TSR). This measures the growth 
in value of a shareholding, assuming dividends are reinvested
to purchase additional units of stock.
While Burberry and its luxury peers have underperformed the
market this year, over the last five years the TSR for Burberry
shares continues to outperform the FTSE 100 index.
Corporate responsibility
Burberry also recognises its responsibility to key 
stakeholders in managing its business. On pages 69 to 
73 the progress Burberry has made this year in respect 
of its supply chain, people management and employee
communications, community involvement and environmental
matters, is reported.

RESOURCES
In order to drive growth by pursuing its five key strategies,
Burberry must continue to invest in its key resources of:
People 
Burberry employs more than 5,500 people worldwide. The
team has increased and been strengthened considerably
over the past year to drive delivery of the five strategic
initiatives and support and sustain continued growth.
Burberry is committed to attracting, retaining and developing
world class talent. As the business grows and the demand
for expertise and ability across the organisation increases,
Burberry is ensuring that it develops a robust ‘pipeline’ of
talent throughout the Group. 
Brand
With over 150 years of history, rooted in its authentic British
heritage and the integrity of its outerwear, Burberry continues
to strive to elevate and extend the brand. The brand has
broad consumer appeal across genders and generations; a
unique demographic positioning within the luxury arena and
global reach. Burberry continues to invest in the brand by
continually promoting design innovation, reinventing its icons
to enhance their aspirational appeal and supporting the brand
with effective marketing and merchandising campaigns.
Infrastructure
Crucial to Burberry’s ability to deliver sustainable growth is 
an efficient infrastructure, including its stores, supply chain, 
IT systems, logistics and distribution capabilities. Historically
Burberry’s organisation has been highly decentralised, so
today it is integrating this around the world. Burberry aims to
be recognised as much for its operational expertise as for its
product and marketing excellence and has been investing in
its business processes and systems recently. 58

Continued to execute against the five key
strategic initiatives 
In the year to March 2008, Burberry grew revenue by 
18% and adjusted operating profit by 14% on an underlying
basis. There was further evolution in the front end of the
business, with growth in the top part of the product 
pyramid, a record number of store openings and increased
non-apparel penetration. The back of house infrastructure
and processes were further upgraded, especially in IT, 
supply chain and logistics.
All of this was achieved in an external environment that
became increasingly challenging during the second half.
Against this background, Burberry continued to deliver
operational efficiencies, while maintaining the strong
momentum of the brand with consumers worldwide. 
Leveraging the franchise
Historically, Burberry was a collection of decentralised
regions and business units, each with an independent
approach in areas such as design, merchandising and
supply chain. Over the last year, continued progress has
been made in working as one company and one brand – 
with a more cohesive global advertising campaign, small
apparel licences brought in house and further strengthening
of the regional and corporate teams.
Outerwear, which is the cornerstone of the brand, continues 
to show strong growth, driven by product and fabric
innovation, the launch of Burberry Sport and packables 
and global replenishment for top styles. For Autumn/Winter
2008, the penetration of outerwear as a proportion of sales 
is expected to increase by several percentage points for both
womenswear (to over 50% of category sales) and menswear
(to over 40% of category sales).
Intensifying non-apparel development
In the year to March 2008, non-apparel sales increased by
39% on an underlying basis, generating 32% of retail and
wholesale revenue – up from 28% in 2007. Luxury handbags
continued to perform strongly and sales of shoes more than
doubled in the year. Soft accessories benefited from
increased product innovation, especially in the use of the
iconic check. Jewellery was launched for Spring/Summer
2008 and luggage is being tested in Autumn/Winter 2008.
Investment in these categories continues, adding dedicated
teams in product development and sourcing, for example.
Accelerating retail-led growth
During the year, a record number of Burberry stores were 
opened – a net 20 mainline stores, 49 concessions and 
10 stores operated under franchise. These included
directly-operated mainline stores in key luxury markets such 
as Florence, Italy, the Beverly Center, Los Angeles and Aspen,
Colorado; more concessions in prestige department stores in
London, Milan, Dublin and Korea; and franchise stores in high
potential markets including Russia and the Middle East. 
The culture of Burberry continues to move from a traditional
wholesale structure to a more dynamic retail mindset.
Initiatives include more frequent flow of products and basic
replenishment, which are benefiting the group’s retail stores
as well as its wholesale and licensing partners.
Investing in under-penetrated markets
North America remains a key target market for Burberry.
Revenue increased by 26% on an underlying basis in the
year to March 2008, with strong growth in both the wholesale
and retail channels. In 2008/09, Burberry plans to open 8-10
mainline stores, refurbish several of its higher profile stores
including Beverly Hills, Los Angeles and the Venetian, Las
Vegas, while further upgrading its wholesale offer, especially
in new categories such as childrenswear and shoes. 
Wholesale revenue from Emerging Markets, which include 
China, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Russia, Brazil and
India, increased by over 50% in the year, with strong
double-digit comparable store sales growth in these
franchised stores. Ten stores were opened during the year,
including three in Russia, one in Saudi Arabia and a third
store in Turkey. Burberry plans to open about 15-20 stores in
conjunction with its franchises in 2008/09, weighted towards
the second half, in locations including South Africa and India.
Pursuing operational excellence
As highlighted in the Interim Management Report in
November 2007, Burberry faced an intense period of activity
in the second half of the year. The business continued to
experience high volume growth driven by the strength of its
product designs. At the same time, the group was in the
most demanding phase of implementing its new IT
infrastructure (SAP), while also rapidly evolving its global
supply chain and logistics functions.
During the second half, the new SAP platform was used 
to sell, procure and ship Spring/Summer 2008 products 
and the retail selling system in Europe (excluding Spain) 
was implemented. Although typical data and process 
issues arose, the project is now starting to deliver very 
early benefits, especially in the core central product and
merchandising functions. Full rollout to the US and much 
of Asia is planned during the year to March 2009. The 
wider Atlas programme, which included improving business
processes as well as the SAP implementation, has delivered
the targeted cumulative £20m benefit to profits, mainly
through supply chain efficiencies. Revenue analysis

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Outlook
Retail
In the year to March 2009, Burberry expects average selling
space to increase by 12-13% year-on-year, including about
15 mainline store openings.
Wholesale
Based upon orders received to date, Burberry expects
wholesale revenue in the six months to September 2008 
to increase by around 10% on an underlying basis. Spain 
is expected to show further weakness offset by good 
growth in all other regions, especially North America (up 
by over 20%) and Emerging Markets.
Licensing
In the year to March 2009, Burberry again expects broadly
flat underlying licensing revenue, with modest volume growth
in apparel in Japan and good volume growth from global
product licences, offset by the non-renewal of certain other
licences. The impact of the Yen exchange rate on reported
revenue and profit is expected to be about £2m favourable. 
Capital expenditure
In the year to March 2009, Burberry expects capital
expenditure to be between £90m and £95m (2008: £49m).
As previously disclosed, this includes the costs of fitting out
the new global headquarters and showrooms (Horseferry
House) which will be between £20m to £25m in total. The
balance is broadly equally split between new stores, store
refurbishments (including Beverly Hills, Los Angeles and
Knightsbridge, London) and other spend, including supply
chain and IT projects. 
Net debt
Burberry had net debt of £64.2m at 31 March 2008 
(30 September 2007: £89.2m; 31 March 2007: £2.8m). 
The net interest charge for the year to March 2008 was
£6.0m. A higher charge is expected for 2009 as average 
net borrowings for the year exceed the year-end debt
position, due in part to the seasonality of the business. 
Going forward, the Board now believes it is appropriate 
to carry year-end net debt of up to about £100m, enabling
Burberry to return any funds not required for investment in
the business to shareholders through share buybacks.  61
Europe 
Revenue in Europe increased by 26% on an underlying basis
(27% reported), with Italy and Germany among the best
performing markets. Retail and wholesale revenue both grew
by over 20%, helped by the strength of product designs,
newly opened stores and new and refurbished concessions.
Wholesale revenue accounted for just over half of the
region’s sales. 
Spain 
Revenue in Spain was up 1% on an underlying and 6% on 
a reported basis. 
Retail sales accounted for nearly 40% of Spain’s revenue,
with the majority coming from over 100 women’s,
non-apparel and childrenswear concessions. Comparable
store sales were strongly ahead in the first half of the year,
but reversed sharply in the second half, falling year-on-year.
This reflects a more difficult economic environment in Spain. 
Wholesale revenue in the year continued to trend down,
reflecting the challenging external environment and the
ongoing decline of small independent retailers in Spain. 
The majority of wholesale revenue comes from selling to
about 1,000 multi-brand accounts.
For 2008/09, Burberry is planning on the basis of no
improvement in the Spanish economy or retail environment
over that seen in the second half of 2007/08. Burberry
continues to implement a series of initiatives in Spain –
further evolving the product offer and integrating the brand
and infrastructure, including the supply chain, more closely
with its global business. Childrenswear is one of the Group’s
key growth opportunities and the existing team in Spain is
being strengthened to help capitalise on this. 
Americas
Americas revenue increased by 26% on an underlying basis
(19% reported). There was over 20% underlying growth in 
the retail channel, which accounts for more than two-thirds 
of Americas revenue, and exceptional growth in wholesale,
driven in both channels by increasing productivity of existing
space and new stores and doors. 
Asia Pacific 
Asia Pacific revenue increased by 17% on an underlying
basis (13% reported). Retail and wholesale channels 
grew roughly equally (retail accounted for over half of the
region’s revenue).
During the year, significant progress was made in realigning
the region under one strengthened management team
(historically it reported as eight separate businesses). In
Korea, Burberry’s largest Asian market outside Japan, the
distribution of the brand has been refined, luxury handbags
are now 40% of handbag sales (up from 17% a year ago) 
and concessions are being relocated and refurbished – an
initiative which will continue in the current year. Hong Kong
remains a strong market for Burberry, with double-digit
comparable store sales growth in the year, led by continued
focus on non-apparel and outerwear and increased tourism
from mainland China. 62

Retail 
Retail sales grew by 20% on an underlying basis (18%
reported) in the year, contributing 49% of total revenue. 
Comparable store sales grew by 8% (11% in H1; 6% in H2),
with the economic environment becoming more volatile as
the second half progressed. Growth came from successful
product innovation, a more frequent flow of new goods and
replenishment. Luxury handbags and outerwear performed
particularly well, contributing to a further increase in the
average unit retail price in mainline stores. 
There was double-digit comparable store sales growth 
in the United States, with strong performances in major
metropolitan areas and tourist cities. Europe and Asia Pacific
showed positive comparable store sales growth, with France,
Italy and Hong Kong among the strongest markets. 
Year-on-year average selling space increased by 12% 
and the total net selling space at 31 March 2008 was
approximately 740,000 square feet. During the year, Burberry
opened a net 20 mainline stores, bringing the total to 97
stores globally. The number of concessions in prestige
department stores increased by 49, including additional and
upgraded concession corners in Korea and the conversion to
retail of 20 babywear corners in Spain. Store refurbishments
continued, increasing selling capacity, sales efficiency and
improving aesthetics. 
Wholesale 
Wholesale revenue, which contributed 43% of total sales in
the year, increased by 20% on an underlying and reported
basis. By region, Europe, North America and Emerging
Markets had the strongest growth, while Spain remained
down year-on-year. 
Wholesale momentum reflects both the strength of Burberry’s
product designs, as well as its more dynamic, retail-led
model, with a more frequent flow of product to customers
and inventory now available to replenish core styles during 
a selling season. Wholesale revenue grew by 16% in the first
half of the year to March 2008, increasing to 25% in the
second half. This performance builds on 17% growth in the
second half of the financial year 2006/07.
In North America, sales of core categories such as outerwear
grew strongly, reflecting increasing penetration in existing
doors. New doors were selectively added in major
department stores in categories such as handbags, shoes
and Prorsum. 
Licensing 
Total licensing revenue in the year increased by 3% on an
underlying basis (down 2% reported). The weakness of the
Yen reduced reported revenue by £5.4m in the year, although
this was partly compensated for by the strength of the Euro
in the second half. 
There was modest growth in Japan in both apparel and
non-apparel and global product licensees delivered strong
growth. New products included Burberry The Beat and Brit
Sheer fragrances, as well as Black Label eyewear in Japan,
appealing to a young, male consumer. As part of Burberry’s
strategy to move to a more consistent global product offer,
certain licences, predominantly in menswear, were not
renewed, which reduced revenue by £1.7m.  Operating profit analysis

Womenswear (38% of sales)
Womenswear revenue grew by 14% on an underlying basis,
driven by Prorsum, seasonless and fashion outerwear.
Menswear (27% of sales)
Menswear revenue grew by 10% underlying, with new
modern outerwear styles driving this performance. The
revitalisation of menswear continues in Autumn/Winter 2008,
with further product innovation in outerwear, Sport and
tailoring (in the London Collection part of the pyramid). The
non-renewal of certain menswear licences enables a more
cohesive tailored collection. 
Non-apparel (32% of sales, up from 28% in 2007)
Non-apparel was the fastest growing of Burberry’s main
product categories in the year, up 39% underlying, as it
benefited from product innovation and prominent positioning
in global advertising campaigns. 
Luxury handbags continued to drive the growth in both 
retail and wholesale channels. During the year, revenue 
from shoes more than doubled at wholesale value, albeit
from a small base, as Burberry replicated the strategies it 
has used successfully in outerwear and luxury handbags.
Notably, Burberry invested in dedicated design, merchandising
and sourcing teams, expanded the Prorsum and London
Collection shoe ranges and supported this with more
focused marketing. As a result, the average selling price in
shoes increased by over 20% for Autumn/Winter 2007. 
Other 
Revenue here, which is mainly childrenswear, grew by 38%
on an underlying basis. Burberry’s first ever standalone
childrenswear store was opened in Lee Gardens, Hong Kong
in March 2008. 
Atlas costs, which relate to the Group’s infrastructure
redesign initiative, were £19.6m. As previously announced,
Burberry completed the sale of its central London building
(Haymarket) during the year, in advance of the global
headquarters relocation planned for late 2008. The net profit
relating to this disposal was £15.1m and the cash proceeds
were £28m.
Adjusted operating profit grew by 11% to £206.2m in the
year. Exchange rates reduced profit by £5.0m or 3%. The
adjusted operating margin fell by 110 basis points, with 
the increase in retail/wholesale operating margin offset by 
a lower proportion of profit from higher margin licensing.  64
BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Gross margin
Gross margin in retail and wholesale combined increased 
by 160 basis points for the year as a whole (H1: 300 basis
points; H2: 40 basis points). 
The majority of the improvement came from Atlas-related
benefits, predominantly from better sourcing of products.
Burberry also benefited from non-apparel growth, which, 
as a whole, is a higher gross margin category than apparel.
For the year, retail and wholesale revenue grew by broadly
the same amount so there was no impact from channel mix.
As previously noted, retail sales in the second half came in
modestly behind plan, with proportionally more inventory 
sold during the usual sale period. As expected, this
negatively impacted gross margin in the second half.
For 2008/09, Burberry expects a further improvement in
gross margin from supply chain savings, although not at 
the rate experienced during 2007/08, offset in part by the
continuing impact of reducing excess inventory. 
Operating expenses
About two-thirds of Burberry’s operating expenses are
incurred in the regions, with the balance at corporate
headquarters, which includes design, product development,
merchandising, marketing, supply chain, warehousing and
distribution and IT, as well as central functions such as
finance, human resources and legal.
In the year to March 2008, operating expenses incurred by
the regions fell as a percentage of sales. This reflected the
operating leverage benefits of 19% revenue growth and was
achieved despite the costs associated with a record number
of store openings. 
In the corporate headquarters, as previously discussed, 
there was significant investment to support the current and 
forecast levels of growth at Burberry. Warehousing and
distribution costs also increased significantly as additional
shifts and temporary capacity was added to deal with volume
growth and changes in the business model.
Combined, these factors led to operating expenses as a
percentage of sales increasing by 130 basis points in
2007/08.
For 2008/09, a further reduction in operating expenses as 
a percentage of sales is expected from the regions. 
However, two factors are expected to lead to an increase 
in operating expenses as a percentage of sales of over 100
basis points in 2008/09. As planned, the move to Horseferry
House, the new global headquarters and showrooms, will
incur one-off double running costs of about £6m, mainly in
the first half of the year. Secondly, the roll out of SAP to Asia
and the United States will incur about £4m of costs, which
will be charged to operating expenses (in 2007/08 the costs
were charged below adjusted operating profit). 
In addition to these £10m of costs, there will be continued
investment in areas such as design and supply chain to
support new product categories, as well as the full year
impact of the investments made during 2007/08. Given 
the current challenging external environment, the group is
carefully monitoring all discretionary spend in areas such 
as headcount, travel and marketing. 
Burberry has recently implemented new global carrier
arrangements for the transport of goods from suppliers 
to distribution centres. By reducing the number of carriers
from over 30 to three, there will be savings of about £2m 
in the first year by leveraging scale. The initiative will also
significantly improve visibility and service levels.

As outlined earlier, on an underlying basis, licensing revenue
was up by 3% (down 2% reported). As the table above
shows, exchange rates reduced both revenue and gross
margin by £3.5m, leading to compression of the operating
margin. The exchange rate impact reflects a weak Yen
(£5.4m negative impact), partly offset by a stronger Euro 
in the second half. In the year to March 2009, the impact 
of the Yen exchange rate on reported revenue and profit 
is expected to be minimal (about £2m favourable). 
Taxation
The taxation rate on reported profit before tax for the year
was 30.9%. This compares to 29.5% for 2006/07 when
there was a 1.5% one-time benefit relating to the settlement
of certain transfer pricing arrangements.
The taxation rate on adjusted profit before tax was 30.1%,
after an adjustment relating to the net profit on the disposal 
of its central London building (Haymarket). 
For 2008/09, Burberry expects a similar taxation rate on
reported profit before tax of about 31%. 
Cash flow and net debt 
Net debt at 31 March 2008 was £64.2m, compared to
£89.2m at 30 September 2007 and £2.8m at 31 March
2007. The major cash flow movement was a £123m outflow
for inventory, as a result of three main factors. The largest of
these was a one-off step change in stock required to support
the new business model, particularly holding inventory for
replenishment and the new market calendar with an April
floorset. The second largest factor was inventory to support
growth in the business, with the balance being an outflow
due to retail sales modestly behind plan in the second half 
of the year. 
Other major cash flows were capital expenditure (2008:
£49m up from £34m in 2007), taxation paid (£53m), a 
£28m inflow from the disposal of the central London building
(Haymarket), dividend payments of £47m (2007: £37m) and
a £40m outflow on the share buyback programme, where
6.2m shares were purchased.
The net interest charge for the year to March 2008 
was £6.0m. 66
RISKS
The management of the business and the execution of 
the Group’s growth strategies are subject to a number of
risks, the occurrence of any one of which may adversely
affect the management of the Group and the execution 
of growth strategies.
The key business risks affecting the Group are set out below.
The steps the Group takes to address these risks, where
they are matters within its control, are also described. Such
steps will mitigate but not eliminate these risks. Some of the
risks relate to external factors which are beyond the Group’s
control. The order of the risks is in no way an indication of
their relative importance, and each of the risks should be
considered independently. If more than one of the events
contemplated by the risks set out below occurs, it is 
possible that the combined overall effect of such events 
may be compounded.
Risks are formally reviewed by a Risk Committee of executive
management including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, General Counsel and Secretary and also by
the Audit Committee. Key business risks are also considered
generally as part of the Group’s strategy development and
ongoing business review processes.
The cumulative change and significant growth within the
business places a significant pressure on resources
The combination of the significant business growth, the
development of the Group’s IT infrastructure and the
development of the global supply chain combine to exert
significant pressure on the business. Governance processes
have been put in place for each major programme and these
are supplemented by monthly operational meetings with
senior management to review operational performance. The
senior management team has been strengthened to further
support these key initiatives and external consultants are
used to supplement internal skills where required. 
Burberry faces increasingly intense competition
Competition in the luxury goods sector has intensified 
in recent years and Burberry is faced with increasing
competition in many of our product categories and markets.
The Group competes with international luxury goods groups
who control a number of luxury brands and may have greater
financial resources and bargaining power with suppliers,
wholesale accounts and landlords. If Burberry is unable 
to compete successfully, operating results and growth may
be adversely impacted.
The inability to anticipate and respond to changes in
consumer demand and product category trends on 
a timely basis could adversely impact sales
The Group’s business depends, in part, on the ability to
shape, stimulate and anticipate consumer demand by
producing innovative, fashionable and functional products.
Categories are cyclical, so it is critical the Group builds
responsive product teams to exploit trending categories,
launch new categories and balance core apparel and
non-apparel categories. The Burberry check and outerwear
are both an integral part of the brand’s success. 
Burberry continues to protect its classic core market by
adding innovation to further stimulate sales to current
customers, while attracting new customers to the brand. 
The Group balances and plans all categories and brand
icons through a strict product hierarchy. The Group is 
also increasing the frequency of its collections so as 
to be more responsive to fashion and consumer trends 
and implementing a replenishment programme to protect 
the core.
To continue brand momentum, and to protect market 
share in apparel and non-apparel, the Group features
outerwear and the Burberry check icons as part of 
seasonal marketing initiatives.
Burberry’s operating results are subject to seasonal
fluctuations and vary based on the weather
In recent years, the world has seen more unpredictable
global weather patterns. Burberry’s business, particularly 
with respect to apparel, broadly operates on a seasonal
basis (Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter) and the Group
has experienced, and expects to continue to experience,
substantial seasonal fluctuations in sales and operating
results. In particular, results vary based on the weather
because of the large proportion of outerwear products
Burberry offers and the effect of the weather on retail markets
generally. As a result of these fluctuations, comparisons 
of sales and operating results between different periods
within a single financial year are not necessarily meaningful.
In addition, these comparisons cannot be relied on as
indicators of the Group’s future performance.
The economic downturn could affect consumers’ purchases
of discretionary luxury items which could adversely affect
Burberry’s sales
In common with all Burberry’s competitors, there are many
factors which affect the level of consumer spending on
discretionary luxury items. During a recession, when
disposable income is lower, a downturn in our key markets
may adversely affect Burberry’s sales. 
A significant proportion of the Group’s sales are generated by
customers, (in particular Middle Eastern, Russian, Japanese, 67
Chinese and other Asian customers) who purchase products
while travelling either overseas or domestically. As a result,
shifts in travel patterns or a decline in travel volumes could
materially affect trading results.
Burberry is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations
Burberry derives a significant percentage of its profits from 
its Japanese licensing arrangements. As a consequence, 
the Group is exposed to a significant risk associated with 
the Yen to Sterling exchange rate.
In addition, the Group is continuing to expand its operations
in the US and Europe as part of its strategy to accelerate
retail expansion in key under-penetrated markets. As the
Group’s presence in the US and Europe increases, it will be
exposed to an increased risk associated with the US Dollar
to Sterling exchange rate and Euro to Sterling exchange rate.
The Group manages a significant proportion of the foreign
currency exposures by the use of forward exchange
contracts. Currency fluctuations affecting the Yen, Euro and
the US Dollar will nevertheless affect results and profitability.
Burberry is dependent on the strength of its trademarks 
and other intellectual property rights
Burberry’s trademarks and other proprietary rights are
fundamentally important to the success and competitive
position of the business. Unauthorised use of the ‘Burberry’
name, the Burberry check and the Prorsum horse logo as
well as the distribution of counterfeit products damage the
Burberry brand image and profits. If a third-party registers
one of the Group’s trademarks or similar trademarks, in a
country where we do not currently trade, this would create 
a barrier to commencing trade under those marks in that
country. In addition, if a third-party publishes harmful material
using our trademarks, Burberry’s brand image could suffer.
The Group has a dedicated team operating internationally 
to establish and protect its trademarks and other intellectual
property rights. Where infringements are identified, the Group
resolves these through a mixture of criminal and civil legal
action and negotiated settlement.
Nevertheless, it is not possible to guarantee that the actions
taken to establish and protect the Group’s trademarks and
other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation
of Burberry’s products by others. Trademarks and intellectual
property rights, while subject to international treaties, are
largely driven by national law and the protection of intellectual
property rights varies from one jurisdiction to another. The
Group cannot therefore necessarily be as effective in all
jurisdictions in addressing counterfeit products. In many
territories the Group is dependent upon the vigilance and
responsiveness of law enforcement bodies whose priorities
may differ from our own. They are also subject to budgetary
constraints and prioritise their actions accordingly. Whilst the
Group works closely with customs and other law
enforcement bodies, ultimately we cannot direct their actions.
There is a risk of over-reliance on key product
manufacturers
In a number of key product categories Burberry is reliant 
on a small number of suppliers. During the year, the Group
has further strengthened its supply chain management 
team to enable us to continue to evolve and develop our
manufacturing base to further mitigate the risk associated
with over-reliance on key product suppliers. Where suitable
alternatives exist, the Group has reduced volumes with key
suppliers on whom the Group is over-reliant and continues 
to look for suitable additional suppliers to further reduce 
such over-reliance.
Burberry could suffer if its supply chain is unable to
produce and deliver goods at a competitive price, on time
and to our specification
Burberry continues to evolve its sourcing strategy, refining 
its selection of suppliers to maintain and enhance product
quality whilst improving sourcing efficiency. Burberry has
already realigned its organisational design to help facilitate
this. There are further opportunities to develop more robust
supplier management processes and these will help ensure
that the Group continues to produce merchandise of the right
quality, in accordance with our ethical policy, and delivered 
in accordance with our requirements. This process may
adversely affect relationships with existing suppliers during
the transition period. If Burberry suppliers fail to ship products
on time, or quality is substandard, this could lead to the
Group missing delivery dates to its customers, potentially
resulting in cancelled orders or price reductions. Further,
such a failure could affect wholesale customers’ confidence
which could adversely affect subsequent seasons. The
Group has evolved its design calendar to enable increased
product refreshment and replenishment. This will enable the
Group to respond more efficiently to changing circumstances
and to reduce the risks associated with placing excessive
capacity with key product suppliers. The Group has also
increased the capacity of our distribution centres.
If Burberry loses key management or is unable to attract
and retain the talent required for its business, its operating
results could suffer 
Burberry’s performance depends largely on its senior
managers and design teams. The resignation of key
individuals and the inability to recruit people with the right
experience and skills to facilitate future business growth
could adversely impact Burberry’s results. To mitigate these
issues the Remuneration Committee regularly benchmarks
the Group’s incentive schemes against the market and
considers the framework in place to recruit, incentivise and 68
RISKS
retain key individuals. In addition, there is an ongoing
recruitment programme overseen by the EVP Corporate
Resources and Chief Executive Officer to ensure that we
strengthen and develop our senior management team by
identifying, developing and nurturing high potential talent.
A substantial proportion of the Group’s revenue 
and profits is reliant upon business in Japan and key 
global licensees
A significant source of profit is derived from the royalties
received from licensees, specifically the Group’s licensees in
Japan, and the fragrance licensee InterParfums S.A. Burberry
relies upon licensees, among other things, to maintain
operational and financial control over their businesses.
Should these licensees fail to effectively manage their
operations the Group’s income from royalties would decline.
Failure to manage these key relationships effectively could
have a material impact on the sales, profitability and
reputation of the Group. To minimise the risks in Japan,
Burberry has established its own offices and operations 
in Tokyo. 
A number of the Group’s licences have been renegotiated 
to give improved control over the brand, and more active
product development is being undertaken with key 
licensees. The Group regularly implements royalty reviews 
of licensees, but cannot guarantee that they will reveal any
non-compliance with the terms of the relevant licence.
Burberry may be unable to control its wholesale and 
licence distribution channels satisfactorily
The Group relies upon the ability to control its distribution
networks and licensees to ensure that products are sold 
in environments consistent with the Group’s luxury image. 
An action by any significant wholesale customer or licensee,
such as presenting Burberry products in a manner
inconsistent with our preferred positioning, would be
damaging to our brand image. If, due to regulatory, legal or
other constraints, we are in any way unable to control our
wholesale distribution networks and licensees, the Burberry
brand image, and therefore results and profitability, may be
adversely affected. 
In key emerging markets, particularly China, Burberry is
largely dependent upon third-party operators with the
associated lack of direct control and transparency
In key emerging markets, Burberry operates through
third-party franchisees. In particular, a third-party retail
operation has been developed in China. The Group largely
depends upon the expertise of these franchisees given our
relative lack of experience in this region. During the year, the
Group has strengthened its resources internally, and where
appropriate have our own staff based within these operations
who work closely with our franchisees to further develop
operational models to enable greater control and visibility.
Burberry has a number of key customers whose business
represents a substantial portion of our sales
The Group dedicates resources to these customers and
maintains close relationships with such customers so we 
can understand and respond to their needs. 
Burberry relies upon our licensees, suppliers, franchisees,
distributors and agents to comply with relevant legislation
The Group expects its licensees, suppliers, franchisees,
distributors and agents to comply with employment and 
other laws relating to their country of operation and to
operate to good ethical standards. We are, however, unable
to guarantee that this is the case, although we are improving
our processes to gain assurance that our licensees,
suppliers, franchisees, distributors and agents comply with
our terms and conditions and relevant local legislation and
good practice.
Major incident
A significant incident such as a terrorist attack at one of the
Group’s key locations could significantly impact the operation
of our businesses. In such circumstances, we cannot ensure
the uninterrupted operation of the business, particularly in the
short-term. Business continuity plans are in place to mitigate
but not eliminate the operational risks. 69
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
The quality of Burberry products is implicit.This does not
simply refer to the rigorous nature of the design, sourcing
and quality assurance functions. When buying a Burberry
product, customers associate themselves with the heritage
and craftsmanship of the brand. Ever since Thomas
Burberry started making outdoor garments for explorers
and military officers, Burberry has strived to exceed the
expectations of its customers. It is therefore important that
the Group’s relationships with suppliers and other
stakeholders are fair, responsible, and of high integrity.
The Group’s Corporate Responsibility Committee (the
‘Committee’) is responsible for ensuring that the overall
management of social, ethical and environmental matters 
are given due consideration. The Committee is chaired 
by the General Counsel and Secretary who takes overall
accountability for Corporate Responsibility matters on behalf
of the Board. The Committee held four formal meetings in 
the financial year to 31 March 2008. In addition, the
Environmental Committee, comprising of operational staff
from our UK, Spanish and US divisions, met four times. The
Risk Committee, which also considers Corporate Responsibility
matters, met three times, and a Worldwide Health and Safety
Committee was established during the year.
Burberry is included in the FTSE4Good Indices and is a
signatory of the UN Global Compact. Burberry embraces,
supports and enacts the ten UN Global Compact principles
of human rights, labour standards, the environment, and
anti-corruption. The human rights and labour standards
principles are embedded in the management of the Group’s
supply chain, the environment principles in the environmental
management systems and anti-corruption in the code of
business ethics.
Supply chain
Our approach
Pursuing operational excellence is one of the Group’s key
strategic themes and Burberry’s goal is to be recognised as
much for operational expertise as for luxury products. This
strategy is applied to the Group’s relationships with suppliers
and to the expectations placed upon them. Regardless of
where the Group’s factories are based they are governed by
its ethical trading policy, which includes managing labour
standards and environmental conditions in the factories that
produce Burberry’s luxury goods. This policy is based on
internationally accepted codes and published in full on our
website at www.burberryplc.com under the ‘Corporate
Responsibility’ section.
As a global luxury goods group, Burberry manufactures the
majority of its products in Europe, primarily in Italy and the
UK. The Group supports its standards with a programme of
factory assessments conducted either by its own specialist
teams or by third-party experts, during which assessments of
the working environment and worker interviews take place. 
Burberry engages in many industry initiatives and has
recently joined Business for Social Responsibility (BSR).
Since 2006, Burberry has been an active participant in the
apparel industry Corporate Responsibility Brand Collaboration
Network. Through this network the Group works with other
brands to conduct factory audits more effectively and to
ensure a clear message is given on what improvements are
needed. Brand collaboration allows factories to spend more
time on making improvements and less on dealing with
auditors from different brands. 
Highlights of the year:
– Conducted over 300 factory visits to assess compliance 
with the Burberry Ethical Trading Policy.
– Further increased the Group’s internal specialist team of
compliance officers, responding to some concerns from
stakeholders regarding third-party monitoring.
– Increased the number of audits with non-governmental
organisations’ auditing bodies.
– 17 suppliers have invested in long-term Corporate
Responsibility training programmes, which focus on 
solutions to labour and environmental issues.
– Burberry held seminars for many of its suppliers updating
them on the global Corporate Responsibility programme 
and providing training on the Burberry Ethical Trading Policy.
These seminars were held in the suppliers local language.
– Burberry launched a confidential worker hotline in a 
number of factories. The hotline has the dual benefit of 
being both a whistle-blowing line as well as providing
counselling to workers.
Operational responsibility for ethical supply chain
management resides with Burberry’s Corporate Responsibility
Manager who is supported by an internal team and external
experts. Performance is reported to the Risk Committee
(comprising the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial
Officer and the General Counsel and Secretary) as well as to
the Corporate Responsibility Committee.
In 2007/08 the Group’s objectives were to:
– Continue to assess suppliers’ adherence to the Group’s
ethical standards. 
– Increase the number of random spot check visits by Burberry
Corporate Responsibility personnel to ensure high standards. 
– Increase the levels of ‘on the ground’ resource to better
enable suppliers to achieve high standards. 
– Increase levels of stakeholder engagement so that, where
applicable, the Group can align its activities with the
expectations of its stakeholders. 
– Continue and increase involvement in leading industry
Corporate Responsibility initiatives, cooperating in
innovation and best practice to raise industry standards.  70 70
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
– Commence the roll-out of confidential worker hotlines, 
both to act as a counselling line for workers and to provide 
a tool for whistle-blowing on poor practice. 
The Group has met all of the above objectives.
In 2008/09 the Group intends to:
– Continue to assess suppliers’ adherence to the Group’s
ethical standards, further increasing the number of random
spot check visits by Burberry Corporate Responsibility
personnel and adding further ‘on the ground’ resource 
for auditing and training. 
– Participate in a number of Business for Social
Responsibility (BSR) working groups such as the ‘Mills’
working group and ‘Beyond Monitoring’ working group.
– Launch the confidential hotline in two more countries.
Fur
As an international luxury brand producing apparel and
accessories with a strong outerwear heritage, there has 
been and will continue to be occasions where consumer
tastes demand the use of natural hides. The Group believes
that any materials derived from animals should be produced
without inflicting cruelty or threatening the environment and
will not use natural hides if there is any concern that they
have been produced by the unacceptable treatment of the
animals. For this reason the Group does not source such
materials from China. 
The Group sources natural hides very carefully, safeguarding
the correct ethical standards and traceability. Fur is principally
sourced from SAGA furs in Finland who are known for
upholding high standards of ethical treatment of animals 
and share the Group’s concerns about animal welfare. The
farms which supply fur are open to third-party inspections 
at any time.
People
Employment
The Group employs over 5,500 people worldwide and is
organised into three regions – Europe, Asia and the Americas
with the Global Head Office based in London. The workforce
has increased and strengthened considerably over the past
12 months to drive delivery of the five strategic themes and
support and sustain continued growth.
The Group is committed to attracting, retaining and
developing world class talent. As the business grows 
and the demand for expertise and capability across the
organisation increases, Burberry is ensuring that it 
develops a robust 'pipeline' of talent throughout the Group.
Succession planning is a critical activity whereby we evaluate
who we have within the business that can develop over time
to move into more senior/critical roles throughout the Group.
To encourage open dialogue about personal development,
the performance of all employees is reviewed in a structured
format on an annual basis. Informal conversations also take
place throughout the year to review progress and discuss
employees’ views and aspirations. The performance rating
awarded on an annual basis is used as one of the factors
which determine pay, supporting our aim of paying 
for performance.
As the business continues to grow and we evolve our
organisational design, the requirements for new roles and
skills are identified. Where appropriate, our preference is to
promote internally. To support our succession planning we
are committed to supporting all employees with their personal
development. This takes a variety of formats such as specific
projects, attending bespoke workshops or relevant work
experience. Those identified with high potential will receive
more robust development support, tailored to address
individual needs. If it becomes necessary to recruit externally
we follow a fair and thorough selection process. In all cases,
people are selected on the basis of skills and experience 
and without regard to sex, race, ethnic origin, nationality,
marital status, age, religion, disability or sexual orientation. 
People management
The integrated global Human Resources (HR) function is
structured to support the three regions and the Global Head
Office. The team consists of a) generalists who demonstrate
a broad skill set and b) experts in the dedicated centres of
excellence: resourcing, learning and development, and
compensation and benefits. 
Employee communications
A dedicated communications function is responsible for
ensuring that effective mechanisms are in place to provide 
all employees with sufficient information and updates about
the Group’s progress. The Chief Executive Officer and senior
management host a quarterly webcast which has a global
reach and discusses the Group’s financial performance,
progress against the strategic themes and current
developments/initiatives taking place within the Group. In
addition, the Chief Executive Officer regularly hosts ‘round
table’ meetings with each function. These meetings provide
the opportunity for employees to share progress in their
functions and the challenges they face across the business. 
The Group is proud to announce the success of the first
series of award ceremonies which are taking place across
the three regions and Head Office. Employees across the
globe have the opportunity to nominate their colleagues for 
a Burberry Icon Award, which is awarded to employees 
who have made an exceptional contribution to the business,
measured against the five strategic themes. This has 
become a highly coveted accolade.  71
Health and safety
In 2003, the Group began a partnership with a third-party
health and safety auditor in the UK to review its existing
standards. Since then, the Group has continued with the
audit programme and ensures that all UK manufacturing 
sites and distribution centres are audited at least annually
with our major offices and retail locations being audited at
least once every three years. We are pleased to report that
our overall UK audit scores continue to steadily improve 
as a result of the thorough implementation of audit
recommendations (prioritised on the basis of risk) and
improved overall housekeeping.
As with many global businesses, the challenge the Group
faces is to find a consistent approach to the management
and reporting of health and safety worldwide that is easy 
to administer yet meets regional legislative expectations.
The Group has already extended the auditing programme to
include some of the major European retail stores and have
also had audits undertaken in the US operation. In addition,
the Group is in the process of reviewing its accident reporting
and assurance framework for its major operations.
Further information regarding the Group’s health and safety
policy is provided in the Directors’ Report on page 77.
Burberry and the community
Community involvement
The Group’s community involvement is focused on working 
in the spheres of fashion and textiles education, humanitarian
issues and the arts. By working in close partnership with a
number of organisations we aim to raise awareness and
promote understanding of issues we believe are important in
our industry and in the communities in which we operate.
Examples of the Group’s involvement during 2007/08 include:
– Burberry contributed a specially designed coat to Earth
Pledge’s FutureFashion Show at New York Fashion Week, an
eco-friendly runway show aimed at raising awareness about
the need to use sustainable materials in the fashion industry.
– Christopher Bailey, Creative Director, designed a T-shirt for
the Fashion for Relief initiative. The T-shirts were sold at
Burberry’s UK stores and through the ecommerce website,
with 100% of the proceeds going to the Rotary Flood Appeal.
In addition, the Group donated merchandise for the Fashion
for Relief catwalk show at London Fashion Week; the
merchandise was later sold as part of a special auction with
all proceeds also benefiting the Rotary Flood Appeal.
– Christopher Bailey acted as mentor to the finalists in the
Fashion Fringe competition, which supports young up and
coming designers. The winner of the competition received 
a £10,000 bursary donated by Burberry.
– Burberry, accompanied by Razorlight, participated in Fashion
Rocks 2007, an event which celebrated the relationship
between music and fashion. Proceeds from the event went
to the Prince’s Trust. 
– Employees at Burberry’s offices in Korea established a
charitable programme of events in support of the Zion Home
Orphanage in Seoul, which included the donation of personal
computers, a television and books. 
Following a review of its supply chain in 2006, the Group
closed its factory in Treorchy. Prior to the closure on 
30 March 2007, the Group made every possible effort 
to mitigate the consequences for those employees who 
were affected, by offering a programme of retraining and
outplacements. To help address the wider longer-term 
issues the Group committed to donating £150,000 a year
over the next ten years to projects to benefit the community.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2008, the Group
made its first donation of £150,000 to the Rhondda Trust, 
an independent trust, which will determine how to use
Burberry’s donations for the benefit of the local community. 
During the financial year, the Group committed £1.0m for the
benefit of charitable causes of which £0.4m was donated
during the year.
The Burberry Foundation
The Burberry Foundation (the ‘Foundation’) was established
as a charitable trust during 2007/08. The mission of the
Foundation is to help young people realise their dreams 
and potential through the power of their creativity. The
Foundation is committed to dedicating its global resources 
to help young people build confidence, make connections 
in their communities, and grasp opportunities to succeed.
The Foundation is in the process of establishing partnerships
with a view to making long-term commitment to multi-year
investments with selected charitable organisations in the UK,
US and in Hong Kong, representing one location in each of
the regions in which Burberry operates.
A global employee committee, made up of regional and
corporate employee representatives, has been established 
to consider the Foundation’s potential partnerships and 
make recommendations to its board of trustees. The global
employee committee will also seek to promote and harness
employee involvement with the Foundation’s partners.
Burberry and the environment
The Group has a wide-ranging dependence and impact on
the planet’s resources. These range from the growing and
processing of raw materials to produce yarns and fabrics, 
to the shipping of goods to Burberry stores and customers,
to the running of retail operations, offices and factories and
finally to the plastic and paper packaging the consumer
throws away. 72
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Burberry is committed to reducing these dependencies and
impacts as far as possible throughout its business, meeting
all environmental legislation and reducing all major sources of
pollution. The Environmental Committee met four times in the
last year to track performance against targets and included
input from our European, US and Asian retail and wholesale
operations. This committee then reports into the Corporate
Responsibility committee. 
Highlights of the year:
– Burberry’s Spanish wholesale operation achieved
ISO14001 accreditation in June 2007.
– Conducted an environmental review and training
programme of our operations in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
These are now included in the Group’s Environmental
Management System.
– Worked with the Carbon Trust in the UK to assess 
the energy saving opportunities in our internal UK
manufacturing sites. 
– Continued to install 20 watt metal halide bulbs in our
European stores replacing the 50 watt versions.
– Installed ‘smart meters’ to track electricity use in our UK 
retail stores that do not already have continuous monitoring 
in place.
– Burberry Spain ran two internal environment campaigns, 
one on water use and one on waste.
– Continued to share environmental best practice between 
our operating sites. We hope to extend this during the 
next year.
– Re-engineered some of our packaging in order to be more
environmentally efficient and reduce the amount of empty
space we store and ship around. For example,we reduced
the thickness of our polo shirt bags by 31%, saving an
estimated 40 tonnes of plastic.
In 2007/08 the Group’s objectives were:
– To have over 90% of our directly owned business
operations covered by the Environmental Management
System. This has been achieved.
– To develop an off-the-shelf environmental training pack for
managers, based on Group best practice, carried forward 
to 2008 following a review of our policy and strategy.
– To examine the opportunities for extending ISO 14001
certification, following its application at our major Spanish
wholesale site. A management briefing has been circulated 
to assess feasibility and implementation.
In 2008/09 the Group intends to:
– Introduce a new web-based system for tracking
environmental KPIs.
– Hold our first global staff environment day.
– Establish a network of environmental champions around
the business.
– Develop an off-the-shelf environment training pack for
managers based on Group best practice. 73

audited financial statements for the year to 31 March 2008. 
Principal activities 
The Group designs, sources, manufactures and distributes 
luxury mens, womens and childrenswear and non-apparel 
accessories globally through its own retail stores, 
concessions and wholesale customers. Burberry also 
licenses third parties to manufacture and distribute 
products using the ‘Burberry’ trademarks. 
Business review 
Burberry Group plc is required to set out in this report a  
fair view of the business of the Group during the year to  
31 March 2008 and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group. The Group Overview and 
Strategy sections on pages 10 to 47 and the Business  
and Financial Review on pages 50 to 65 report on the 
activities and results for the year and give an indication  
of the Company’s future developments. The Corporate 
Responsibility report on pages 69 to 73 and a description  
of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group  
is included on pages 66 to 68 which, when taken together 
with the sections of the Annual Report referred to above, 
fulfil the requirements of the Business Review and are 
incorporated by reference and shall be deemed to form  
part of this report. 
Revenue and profit 
Revenue during the period amounted to £995.4m  
(2007: £850.3m). The attributable profit for the year is 
£135.2m (2007: £110.2m) and has been transferred  
to reserves.  
Dividends 
The directors recommend a final dividend of 8.65p per 
ordinary share (2007: 7.625p) in respect of the year to  
31 March 2008 be paid on 31 July 2008 to those persons 
on the Register of Members as at 4 July 2008. 
An interim dividend of 3.35p per ordinary share was paid  
to shareholders on 31 January 2008. This will make a  
total dividend of 12.0p per ordinary share. The dividends 
paid and recommended in respect of the year to  
31 March 2008 total £37.4m. 
Directors 
The names and biographical details of the directors holding 
office at the date of this report are set out on page 75 and 
are incorporated by reference into this report. 
Rose Marie Bravo ceased to serve as a director of the 
Company with effect from 1 July 2007.  
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting, Philip Bowman and 
Stacey Cartwright will retire by rotation in accordance with 
Article 81 of the Articles of Association and, being eligible, 
will offer themselves for re-election.  
The separate circular to shareholders incorporating the 
Notice of this year’s Annual General Meeting sets out why 
the Board believes these directors should be re-elected. 
Details of the directors’ service agreements are given in the 
Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters on 
pages 84 to 93. 
Directors’ share interests 
Interests of the directors holding office at 31 March 2008  
in the shares of the Company are shown within the Report 
on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters on page 
92. There were no changes to these interests between  
the period 31 March 2008 and 27 May 2008.  
Capital structure 
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together 
with details of movements in the issued share capital of 
Burberry Group plc during the year are shown in note 22 
which is incorporated by reference and deemed to be part 
of this report.  
The Company has one class of ordinary share which 
carries no right to fixed income. Each share carries the 
right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. The 
ordinary shares are listed on the Official List and traded on 
the London Stock Exchange. 
It is proposed that the Company’s authorised but unissued 
preference shares will be cancelled, subject to the 
approval of shareholders at this year’s Annual General 
Meeting, as they are no longer required. 
During the financial year, the Company repurchased and 
subsequently cancelled 6,198,167 ordinary shares at an 
aggregate cost of £39.6m. This represented 1.4% of the 
shares in issue at the beginning of the year. These share 
buy backs form part of the Group’s ongoing policy of 
returning cash to shareholders where funds are not 
required for investment in the business. 
In order to retain maximum flexibility, the Company 
proposes to renew the authority granted by ordinary 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2007, to 
repurchase up to just under 10% of its issued share capital 
(as at 27 May 2008). Further details are provided in the 
separate circular to shareholders incorporating the Notice 
of this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
There are no specific restrictions on the size of holding  
nor on the transfer of shares which are both governed by 
the general provisions of the Articles of Association and 
prevailing legislation. The directors are not aware of any 
agreements between holders of the Company’s shares  
that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities  
or voting rights.  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08  
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED

Details of employee share schemes are set out in note

dividends payable by the Company in respect of the 
ordinary shares held by it. In addition the Burberry Group 
plc SIP Trust has waived all dividends payable by the 
Company in respect of the unappropriated ordinary  
shares held by it.  
The total dividends waived in the year to 31 March 2008 
were in aggregate £282,052 (2007: £385,196). 
No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are  
fully paid. 
With regard to the appointment and replacement of 
directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of 
Association, the Combined Code, the Companies Acts  
and related legislation. The Articles of Association may  
be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. 
Substantial shareholdings 
As at 27 May 2008, the Company had been notified of  
the following interests in the Company’s ordinary shares in 
accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules:

Interests in own shares 
Details of the Company’s interests in its own shares are set 
out in note 22 to the financial statements. 
Charitable and political donations 
During the year to 31 March 2008, the Group committed 
£1.0.m for the benefit of charitable causes, of which  
£0.4m (2007: £0.2m) was donated during the year.  
Further information regarding the charitable donations  
made during the year are contained in the Corporate 
Responsibility Report on pages 69 to 73. The Group will  
be focusing more closely on its charitable activity through 
the Burberry Foundation, a charitable trust which was 
established during the year. 
The Company made no political donations during the  
year in line with its policy. In keeping with the Company’s 
approach in prior years, shareholder approval is being 
sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, as  
a precautionary measure, for the Company and its 
subsidiaries, to make donations and/or incur expenditure 
which may be construed as ‘political’ by the wide definition 
of that term included in the relevant legislation. Further 
details are provided in the separate circular to shareholders 
incorporating the Notice of this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
Valuation of properties 
Based on a valuation report prepared by Colliers Conrad 
Ritblat Erdman, dated 16 May 2006, the existing use value 
of Burberry’s nine most significant freehold properties is 
£136.9m (based on closing exchange rates at 31 March 
2008). This valuation is higher than the net book value of 
these assets. 
Employment policies 
Equal opportunities 
The Group is committed to ensuring the consistent 
profitable growth of its business and a policy of equal 
opportunity in employment is integral to this commitment. 
The aims of the Group’s policy are to ensure that the  
most capable job applicants are recruited and the  
most competent employees in the Group progress. All 
employees will receive fair and equal treatment irrespective 
of sex, race, ethnic origin, nationality, marital status, age, 
religion, disability and sexual orientation. In the situation 
where an employee becomes disabled, the Group will 
endeavour to assist the employee by adapting the job  
or by offering a transfer to another position if appropriate. 
Health and safety 
The Group has a health and safety policy approved by  
the Board and a Worldwide Health and Safety Committee 
which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. 
In the year to 31 March 2008, there were 14 accidents  
in the UK reportable under the UK RIDDOR legislation  
(the ‘Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous 
Occurrences Regulations 1995’). Broadly, this covers  
those accidents resulting in more than three days absence 
from work: the RIDDOR accident rate for our UK business 
was 0.39 per 100,000 hours worked.  
Further information regarding the Group’s employment 
policies are provided in the Corporate Responsibility  
Report on pages 69 to 73. 
Employee involvement 
Employee communication 
The Group believes that employee communication is 
important in building strong relationships with, and in 
motivating, employees. The Group makes use of various   110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED  
 
78 
methods, all of which are implemented globally, including 
quarterly business updates, face-to-face briefings, open 
discussion forums with senior management, regular letters 
from the Chief Executive Officer to employees, email and  
a corporate intranet to ensure that matters of interest  
and importance are conveyed to employees quickly and 
effectively. In addition, an ‘Annual Review’ highlighting the 
Group’s performance and its ongoing strategic initiatives  
is sent to all operational managers worldwide. 
Employee share ownership 
The Group recognises the importance of good 
relationships with employees of all levels and runs incentive 
schemes and share ownership schemes for the benefit of 
employees. Further details of these schemes are set out in 
the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters 
on pages 84 to 93. Employees in the UK, Germany, Hong 
Kong, Italy, Korea, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan and the US 
have access to all-employee share plan arrangements.  
Further details on the Group’s approach to employee 
involvement and communications are provided in the 
Corporate Responsibility Report on pages 69 to 73. 
Financial Instruments 
The Group’s financial risk management objectives  
and policies are set out within note 26 to the financial 
statements on pages 127 to 129. Note 26 also details  
the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange, price,  
interest, credit and liquidity risks. 
Creditor payment policy 
For all trade creditors, it is policy to: 
− agree and confirm the terms of payment at the 
commencement of business with that supplier 
− pay in accordance with contractual and other legal 
obligations 
− continually review the payment procedures and liaise  
with suppliers as a means of eliminating difficulties  
and maintaining a good working relationship 
The Company had no trade creditors at 31 March 2008 
(2007: £nil). 
Change of control 
Pursuant to section 992 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
directors disclose that in the event of a change of control  
in the Company, the Group’s £200m Revolving Credit 
Facility (dated 30 March 2005) could become repayable. 
The remuneration and contractual arrangements for the 
executive directors and senior management do not contain 
any matters that are required to be disclosed under the EU 
Takeovers Directive other than the service agreement of  
Angela Ahrendts. In circumstances of change of control, 
Angela Ahrendts may terminate her employment. Her 
entitlement in respect of remuneration is set out on  
page 86 of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and 
related matters where Burberry terminates her service 
agreement in circumstances where the Remuneration 
Committee determines that Angela Ahrendts’ performance 
does not meet the financial expectations of the Board  
or shareholders. 
Copies of the executive directors’ service contracts are 
available for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s 
registered office and at the Annual General Meeting. 
Auditors 
In accordance with section 234ZA of the Companies Act 
1985, each of the Company’s directors in office as at the 
date of this report confirms that: 
− so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant  
audit information of which the Company’s auditors  
are unaware 
− he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought  
to have taken as a director in order to make himself or 
herself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of  
that information 
The Group’s auditors are PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  
as auditors to the Company will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Note 5 in the financial statements states the auditors’ fees 
both for audit and non-audit work. 
Annual General Meeting 
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
 
 
79
Combined Code Statement 
The Board is committed to high standards of Corporate 
Governance and has complied in full throughout the year 
with the applicable code provisions of the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in June 2006 (‘the Code’).  
The Board 
The Board is collectively responsible to shareholders for  
the success of the Group and concentrates its efforts on 
strategy, management performance, governance and 
internal control. As at the date of this report, the Board  
has seven members: the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and four independent 
non-executive directors. The names and biographical 
details of each of the directors and details of their 
membership of the Board’s committees are set out on  
page 75. The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision and approval which include,  
but are not limited to: 
− the approval of the interim and annual financial 
statements 
− any interim dividend and the recommendation of  
the final dividend 
− the Group’s business strategy 
− annual budget and operating plans 
− major capital expenditure, acquisitions or divestments 
− the systems of corporate governance, internal control 
and risk management 
The Chairman works closely with the Company Secretary  
to ensure that the Board is supplied in a timely manner with 
information in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable 
it to effectively discharge its duties. In addition, directors 
are also supplied with a monthly management report,  
 
which provides information on operational and financial 
performance and the Group’s business plans. Directors 
may obtain, in the furtherance of their duties, independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the Group’s expense. 
In addition, all directors have direct access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary. 
As an ongoing process, directors are briefed and provided 
with information concerning major developments affecting 
their roles and responsibilities. In particular, the directors’ 
knowledge of the Group’s worldwide operations is regularly 
updated by arranging presentations from local 
management and visits to key locations. 
The Board plans to meet at least five times a year and may 
meet more frequently as required. During the year under 
review the Board held five meetings, with one meeting 
being held in the US. The Board considers that it met 
sufficiently often to enable the directors to discharge  
their duties effectively. Where there are occasions where 
circumstances arise to prevent a director attending a 
meeting they will receive papers for consideration and  
have the opportunity to submit comments to the Chairman. 
At the request of any non-executive director, the Chairman 
will arrange meetings consisting of only the non-executive 
directors to allow the opportunity for any concerns to be 
expressed. During the year, the Chairman maintained 
regular contact and met with the Senior Independent 
Director and other non-executive directors.  
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary  
is a matter reserved for the Board as a whole. 
The table below gives details of directors’ attendance  
at meetings of the Board, Audit Committee, Nomination 
Committee and Remuneration Committee during the 
financial year ended 31 March 2008.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

There is a clear division of the roles and responsibilities  
of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer which are set 
out in writing and agreed by the Board. The Chairman is 
responsible for leading the Board in reviewing the Group’s 
strategy and monitoring high-level progress. The day to day 
management and performance of the Group’s business is 
the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer.  
The Board has appointed Philip Bowman as the Senior 
Independent Director. The principle role of the Senior 
Independent Director is to support the Chairman in his  
role and to lead the non-executive directors in the oversight 
of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Senior 
Independent Director is also available to the shareholders 
for concerns which the normal channels have failed to 
resolve or are inappropriate. 
Rose Marie Bravo ceased to serve as a director on  
1 July 2007. She had held the position of Vice-Chairman 
from 1 July 2006 and was previously Chief Executive 
between 1997 and 2006. 
The Group has operated independently since the IPO in 
2002 and fully demerged from its former shareholder  
GUS plc in 2005. The Board considers John Peace and 
David Tyler to be independent since the former shareholder 
relationship does not affect their judgement. If there  
are specific matters relating to the Group’s previous 
relationship with GUS plc that may cause a conflict of 
interest to arise, in accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association, the relevant director will not participate in 
the determination of the matter concerned. 
John Peace, Philip Bowman, Ian Carter, Stephanie  
George and David Tyler are, in the opinion of the Board, 
independent of management and free from any business 
relationship which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement. During the  
year under review the majority of the Board (excluding the 
Chairman) comprised independent non-executive directors.  
Board appointments 
Board nominations are recommended to the Board by  
the Nomination Committee under its terms of reference.  
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting following their appointment and 
thereafter to re-election at least once every three years  
in line with the Company’s Articles of Association and 
provision A.7.1. of the Code. The biographical details  
of those directors seeking re-election at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting can be found on page 75 of this 
Annual Report. 
Directors – development 
On appointment, directors are furnished with an induction 
pack of information, which includes key Group policies, 
guidance notes and information on corporate governance 
matters. In addition, visits to key locations, meetings  
with members of the management team and updates on 
particular issues are arranged for directors as appropriate. 
Board performance evaluation 
In 2007, a review of the Board and its committees was 
undertaken using an external facilitator. The findings  
of that review led to the appointment of an additional 
independent non-executive director and appointments  
to the Board’s committees. 
In 2008, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board,  
its committees and of the individual directors was carried 
out. The evaluation was led by the Chairman and involved 
holding a series of structured one-to-one interviews with 
each of the directors. The effectiveness of the changes 
made to the Board and its committees following the review 
in 2007 were considered and evaluated. The directors also 
considered the current composition and responsibilities of 
the Board and each of its committees, together with the 
frequency and structure of meetings. 
The directors concluded that the Board and its committees 
operate efficiently and effectively. As a result of this review, 
it was agreed that additional non-executive directors’ 
briefings would be held to further increase their knowledge 
and understanding of the business. 
The Audit and Remuneration committees each also 
undertook an evaluation of their performance and 
effectiveness during the year by way of a detailed 
questionnaire. The results of these evaluations were 
reported to the Board by the respective committee 
chairmen. The results of the reviews concluded that  
each of the committees was functioning appropriately. 
A formal meeting of the non-executive directors, without  
the Chairman present, was held during the year, led by  
the Senior Independent Director. 
Committees 
The Board is supported by a number of committees 
including the following principal committees: Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee and Nomination 
Committee. All the non-executive directors are members  
of each of the principal committees of the Board. 
The terms of reference of each of the principal committees 
are available on request and can be viewed on the 
Company’s website www.burberryplc.com.  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

The committees, if they consider it necessary, can engage 
with third-party consultants and independent professional 
advisors and can call upon other resources of the Group  
to assist them in developing their respective roles. In 
addition to the relevant committee members and the 
Company Secretary, external advisors and, on occasion, 
other directors attend committee meetings but only at  
the invitation of the chairmen of the committees. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises four independent  
non-executive directors: 
Philip Bowman (Chairman) 
Ian Carter (appointed 18 May 2007) 
Stephanie George 
David Tyler 
The main roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee 
are set out in written terms of reference. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for: 
− monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
statements and any formal announcements relating  
to the Group’s performance 
− reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls and  
risk management systems 
− monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the  
Group’s internal audit function 
− assessing the independence, objectivity and 
effectiveness of the external auditors 
− developing and implementing policies on the  
engagement of the external auditors for the supply  
of non-audit services 
− making recommendations for the appointment,  
re-appointment and removal of the external auditors and 
approving their remuneration and terms of engagement 
− reviewing arrangements by which employees may, in 
confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting and other matters 
The Board is satisfied, in accordance with the provisions  
of the Code, that at least one member of the Audit 
Committee has recent and relevant financial experience 
given the nature of the senior management positions held 
by Philip Bowman and David Tyler (see biographical details 
on page 75). 
The Committee met three times during the year. The 
attendance record of Committee members is recorded  
in the table on page 79. At the invitation of the Committee, 
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Financial Officer,  
the Director of Audit and Risk Assurance and the external 
auditors regularly attend meetings. In addition, the 
Committee met during the year with the external  
auditors without management present.  
The Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control procedures 
and risk management systems. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed the Group’s internal audit plan and 
approved the internal audit plan for the financial year to  
31 March 2009. In addition, the Committee reviewed the 
adequacy of the ‘whistle-blowing’ arrangements in place  
to enable employees to raise, in confidence, any concerns 
they may have. 
During the financial year, the Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the external audit process and the 
qualification, expertise, resources and independence  
of the external auditors. The Committee also reviewed  
the proposed audit fee and terms of engagement for the 
financial year to 31 March 2008 and has recommended  
to the Board that it propose to shareholders that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be re-appointed  
as the Group’s external auditor. 
The Committee recognises that the independence of the 
auditors is an essential part of the audit framework and the 
assurance that it provides. The Committee monitors the 
types of non-audit work that are undertaken by the external 
auditors to ensure that their objectivity and independence  
is not compromised. Any proposed non-audit assignments 
require prior approval and the Committee receives a report 
at each meeting providing details of non-audit assignments 
carried out by the external auditors in addition to their 
normal work. 
Details of the fees paid to the external auditors during  
the financial year can be found in note 5 in the financial 
statements. 
Remuneration Committee 
The report of the Remuneration Committee is set out on 
pages 84 to 93. 
Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee comprises: 
John Peace (Chairman) 
Angela Ahrendts  
Philip Bowman 
Rose Marie Bravo (resigned 1 July 2007) 
Ian Carter (appointed 18 May 2007) 
Stephanie George  
David Tyler 
The Nomination Committee met twice during the year  
under review. 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
balance and composition of the Board and its committees 
and for identifying and recommending appointments or 
renewal of appointments to the Board. These regular 
reviews ensure that the Group and the Board are able  
to draw from a complementary balance of skills and 
experience and that there is in place an appropriate plan   110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08 
 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED  
 
 
82 
for orderly succession to the Board. The procedure  
for appointments is set out in its terms of reference.  
Relations with shareholders 
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining  
good communications with its shareholders and does this 
through its Annual and Interim Reports, interim 
management statements, the Annual General Meeting and 
through the additional processes described below.  
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
make presentations to institutional shareholders and 
analysts immediately following the release of the preliminary 
and interim results; these presentations are made available 
on the Company’s website www.burberryplc.com.  
The Company communicates with its institutional investors 
frequently and regularly through a combination of formal 
and informal meetings, participation at investor 
conferences and ad-hoc briefings with management.  
The Board is kept abreast of the views of major 
shareholders by briefings from the Director of Investor 
Relations. During the year, the Board obtained an 
independent insight into the views of major shareholders 
through research commissioned with an external advisor. 
The outcomes of that research were presented and 
reviewed by the Board. In addition, analysts’ notes and 
brokers’ briefings are also used to achieve a wide 
understanding of investors’ views.  
The non-executive directors, including the Senior 
Independent Director, are available to meet with major 
shareholders to discuss issues of importance to them, 
should a meeting be requested. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, the  
Notice of the 2007 Annual General Meeting was sent  
to shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
Meeting. A poll vote was taken on each of the  
resolutions put before shareholders. 
Voting at the 2008 Annual General Meeting will be by  
way of poll. The results of the voting at the Annual General 
Meeting will be announced and details of the votes  
will be available to view on the Company’s website 
www.burberryplc.com as soon as possible after  
the meeting. 
It is the intention that all directors, including the chairmen  
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination committees will 
attend the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and will be 
available to answer shareholders’ questions.  
Corporate Responsibility 
Details on the Group’s approach to Corporate 
Responsibility are given on pages 69 to 73. 
Accountability and audit 
The Board acknowledges that it should present a balanced 
and understandable assessment of the Company’s position 
and prospects. In this context, reference should be made 
to the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 94, 
which includes a statement in compliance with the Code 
regarding the Group’s status as a going concern, and to 
the Report of the Auditors on page 95 which includes a 
statement by the auditors about their reporting responsibilities. 
The Board recognises that its responsibility to present a 
balanced and understandable assessment extends to 
interim and other price sensitive public reports and  
reports to regulators as well as information required  
to be presented by law. 
Internal control 
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage  
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of  
the key procedures, which have been established to 
provide internal control. As part of the process that the 
Group has in place to review the effectiveness of the 
internal control system there are procedures designed to 
capture and evaluate failings and weaknesses, and in the 
case of those categorised by the Board as ‘significant’, 
procedures exist to ensure that necessary action is taken  
to remedy the failings. 
In accordance with the revised guidance for directors  
on internal control (‘the Revised Turnbull Guidance’),  
the Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group. These include those relating to social, 
environmental and ethical matters. This process was in 
place throughout the year under review and up to the  
date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. The 
process is regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee  
which reports its findings for consideration by the Board, 
and is in accordance with the Revised Turnbull Guidance. 
  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED 
 
 
83
The key procedures operating within the Group are  
as follows: 
Risk assessment 
The Group’s business objectives are incorporated into  
the annual budgeting and planning cycle. Progress  
towards the achievement of such objectives is monitored 
by a variety of financial measures and non-financial 
performance indicators. 
The Risk Committee of executive management meets 
formally at least every six months to re-evaluate risk  
and to consider the work of the Internal Audit and Risk 
Assurance team. During the year the Committee met  
on three occasions. The Director of Audit and Risk 
Assurance attends these meetings. 
The Board has delegated responsibility for considering 
operational, financial, compliance and other risks to the 
Audit Committee.  
Control environment and control activities 
The Group consists of a number of business regions, each 
with its own management structure which forms part of the 
overall management structure of the Group. The senior 
executives of these units report to the executive directors. 
The Group has established procedures for the delegation  
of authorities for matters that are considered significant, 
either because of their value or the impact on the Group, to 
ensure that approval is considered at an appropriate level. 
The Group’s trading units operate within a framework of 
policies and procedures which are either already laid  
down or are being established in organisation or authority 
manuals. Policies and procedures cover key issues such  
as authorisation levels, compliance with legislation and 
physical security. 
The Group has implemented various strategies to deal with 
the risk factors that have been identified. Such strategies 
include a framework of internal control and the use of  
third-party services to assist in monitoring specific issues. 
In addition, other approaches are taken, such as insurance. 
Information and communication 
The Group has a comprehensive system of budgetary 
control, focused on monthly performance reporting which  
is at an appropriately detailed level. A summary of results 
supported by commentary and performance measures  
is provided to the Board each month. The performance 
measures are subject to review to ensure that they provide 
relevant and reliable indications of business performance. 
A summary of the key business risks and relevant control 
measures is submitted by the executive directors to the 
Audit Committee at the end of the financial year. The Audit 
Committee meets with both external and internal auditors. 
Monitoring 
A range of procedures is used to monitor the effective 
application of internal control within the Group. These 
include management review, management confirmations  
of compliance with standards and procedures as well as 
internal audit and other specialist reviews. The Internal  
Audit department is responsible for reporting to the Audit 
Committee on the effectiveness of internal control systems.  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08 
REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION  
AND RELATED MATTERS 
 
 
84 
This report sets out the Group’s policy and disclosure in relation to the remuneration and share interests of the directors of 
Burberry Group plc. It has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 
and the requirements of the applicable Listing Rules. 
Unaudited information 
The Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises: 
David Tyler (Chairman) 
Philip Bowman 
Ian Carter (appointed 18 May 2007) 
Stephanie George 
John Peace 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman and 
monitors the level and structure of senior management pay. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter  
for the Board as a whole. No director is involved in any discussions as to their own remuneration. The Remuneration 
Committee meets at least twice a year and holds additional meetings as necessary. During the year under review, the 
Committee met four times. Details of the number of meetings and attendance at those meetings during the year are set  
out in the table on page 79. 
The Remuneration Committee has been assisted in its considerations during the year by Kepler Associates who were 
appointed by the Committee following the IPO in June 2002. Kepler Associates do not provide any other services to  
the Company. In addition, data and benchmarking information have been provided during the year by Towers Perrin. 
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Group’s website www.burberryplc.com or  
upon request. 
Remuneration policy 
The Remuneration Committee believes the Group’s remuneration should be competitive and strongly linked to performance. 
It therefore has a remuneration policy based on the following two principles. 
First, in order to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent to enable the Group to compete effectively with the world’s 
leading luxury brands, the Remuneration Committee bases the quantum of total remuneration on competitive practice.  
For some roles the Group competes for talent in the same global marketplace as other luxury brands, many of which are 
based in the US. Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is benchmarked against Burberry’s 
main global competitors and UK companies of comparable size. The Remuneration Committee recognises that for each 
executive the relative importance of each of these benchmarks may be different. Benefits are based on competitive market 
practice for each executive, depending on individual circumstances. 
The second principle is to emphasise variable pay in order to establish a clear link between pay and performance, to  
align remuneration closely with shareholders’ interests and to incentivise and reward both very good performance and 
exceptional performance. For this reason, the Group’s current share incentive plans are subject to performance conditions. 
To provide a balanced focus between short and long term business objectives, variable pay for executive directors includes 
an annual cash bonus based on growth in EBIT and individual performance, and long-term share-based incentives linked 
primarily to increases in shareholder value and to continued employment over three to five years. 
Remuneration packages are established and regularly reviewed against the agreed policy to ensure that they meet the 
policy principles. When seeking to attract new executives the Remuneration Committee endeavours to incorporate these 
policy objectives into the remuneration package.  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

Elements of remuneration 
Remuneration is structured such that for executive directors and senior management, performance-related elements 
represent the majority of potential total remuneration. The Group implements its remuneration policy through the provision  
of the following elements: 
Base salary 
The Group aims to provide salaries which are competitive with those of comparable roles at companies of a similar size  
and global reach within the luxury goods sector (including those in the US and those which are privately-owned) and UK 
companies of similar size. These companies are representative of Burberry’s competitors for executive talent. When making 
salary determinations, the Remuneration Committee takes into account not only this competitive information but also each 
executive director’s contribution to the business during the year. On recruitment, the Remuneration Committee also 
considers the executive’s current remuneration and the overall package required to attract, incentivise and retain the 
relevant executive. 
Annual bonus 
Each year the Remuneration Committee sets bonus targets by reference to internal and external expectations. Bonuses  
are currently based on profit growth and individual performance. The Remuneration Committee believes that linking 
incentives to profit growth helps to reinforce the Group’s profitability and growth objectives. Targets are calibrated by Kepler 
Associates using benchmarks that include broker earnings estimates for Burberry, earnings estimates for competitors, 
targets for profit growth consistent with median/upper quartile shareholder returns, latest projections for the current year, 
budget, strategic plan, long-term financial goals, etc. Actual bonus awards are subject to the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
Share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements 
The Group has a number of share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements in place: 
− The Burberry Co-Investment Plan (the ‘Co-Investment Plan’) 
− The Burberry Exceptional Performance Share Plan (the ‘EPP’) 
− The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan (the ‘RSP’) 
− The Burberry Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 (the ‘Executive Share Option Scheme’) 
− The Burberry Group plc Share Incentive Plan (the ‘SIP’) 
− The Burberry Approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘SAYE’) 
Further information regarding these schemes can be found on pages 89 to 91 and also in note 27. 
Benefits 
Benefits for executive directors include private medical insurance, life assurance and long-term disability insurance. 
Executive directors also receive car allowances and pension contributions.

Service agreements 
Attracting the best talent in the global luxury goods business can require fixed contract terms which result in termination 
payments in excess of one year’s remuneration. Burberry does not offer such terms unless the Remuneration Committee 
considers it absolutely necessary in the particular circumstances to attract a highly talented individual and even in these 
circumstances will ensure that, after an initial period, termination payments will not exceed one year’s remuneration. Save 
for the service contract of Angela Ahrendts, there are no service contracts for any director which could result in termination 
payments of more than one year’s remuneration. 
Angela Ahrendts  
Angela Ahrendts relocated from the US to the UK and commenced her employment with Burberry as an executive director 
on 9 January 2006 under a service agreement dated 10 October 2005. She was appointed Chief Executive Officer on  
1 July 2006. 
Under the service agreement:  
− The Group agreed to pay Angela Ahrendts a special recruitment and retention bonus of US$4m payable in four  
tranches, the last two of which were paid on 9 July 2007 and 9 January 2008. 
− Angela Ahrendts is eligible for a personal achievement bonus subject to achievement of objectives set by the 
Remuneration Committee. US$1.5m was paid on 31 December 2007 and up to US$750,000 will be payable on  
31 December 2008. Following any payment on 31 December 2008 no further payments will be made in respect of  
this bonus. 
If Burberry terminates the service agreement in circumstances where there is not poor performance as described below, 
she would be entitled to two times her annual salary and two times maximum bonus opportunity and the balance of her 
personal achievement bonus. The one-off share award granted on 31 January 2006 and any unvested Matching Share 
awards under the Co-Investment Plan will vest on a time apportioned basis (subject to a minimum vesting of 50% for the 
one-off share award). She would also receive her pension and overseas allowances for a further 12 months together with 
relocation expenses. If Burberry terminates the service agreement after January 2009, where there is not poor performance 
as described below, then the entitlements in respect of salary and bonus would decline to 12 months’ salary and 12 months’ 
maximum bonus opportunity over the period from January 2009 to January 2010. 
If Burberry terminates the agreement without cause but in circumstances where the Remuneration Committee determines 
that Angela Ahrendts’ performance or that of the Group does not meet the financial expectations of the Board or 
shareholders, her entitlements in respect of salary and bonus will be reduced so that she will receive 12 months’ salary and 
half of her maximum bonus opportunity. Angela Ahrendts may terminate the service agreement on six months’ notice. 
Stacey Cartwright 
Stacey Cartwright is employed by Burberry as Chief Financial Officer under a service agreement dated 17 November 2003. 
Her term of appointment commenced on 1 March 2004. 
Burberry may terminate Stacey Cartwright’s appointment by giving 12 months’ written notice. Stacey Cartwright may 
terminate her employment by giving six months’ written notice. 
Rose Marie Bravo  
Rose Marie Bravo was employed by Burberry as Chief Executive under a service agreement dated 28 May 2002 which was 
amended in June 2004 and October 2005. Rose Marie Bravo ceased to be Chief Executive on 30 June 2006 and became 
Vice-Chairman on a part-time basis. Rose Marie Bravo ceased to be Vice-Chairman on 1 July 2007. Under the terms of her 
service agreement, Rose Marie Bravo will receive her base salary until 30 June 2008 and a bonus payment of $325,000 in 
lieu of her bonus for the year ended 31 March 2008 under the Group’s bonus arrangements. Rose Marie Bravo was eligible 
for allowances of $20,000 during the year to 30 June 2008. All pension arrangements ceased on 1 July 2007.  An award 
over 180,531 Matching Shares under the Co-Investment Plan vested on 1 July 2007; the remaining shares lapsed under 
that plan. The options over shares granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 were allowed to vest.  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

Share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements 
The Burberry Co-Investment Plan (the ‘Co-Investment Plan’) 
The Group encourages executive directors and other senior management to hold shares in Burberry Group plc. To facilitate 
this, executive directors may, at the invitation of the Remuneration Committee, defer receipt of all or part of their annual 
bonus and invest it in Burberry shares, with up to a 2:1 match based on individual and Group performance during the year. 
The Matching Share awards do not vest for three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves due to resignation within 
that period. To further link pay and performance and to align remuneration with shareholders’ interests, the vesting of 
Matching Share awards granted in respect of the current 2008/09 bonus year and future bonus years will be subject  
to the achievement of secondary performance conditions linked to growth in profit before tax. 
For the year ended 31 March 2007 Angela Ahrendts and Stacey Cartwright chose to defer and invest the whole of their 
bonus after the deduction of tax into Burberry shares via the Co-Investment Plan. The Invested Shares are included in the 
table below and in the table of directors’ interests appearing on page 92. The related Matching Share awards under these 
arrangements are also shown in the table below. The interests of the executive directors, who served during the financial 
year, in shares granted under this scheme as at 31 March 2008 were as follows.

The Burberry Group plc Exceptional Performance Share Plan (the ‘EPP’) 
Following shareholder approval at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, Burberry introduced a one-off long-term incentive 
plan, delivered in Burberry shares, the purpose of which is to incentivise senior management to achieve stretching goals 
and to help provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance. The EPP award is based 50% on relative Total 
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance and 50% on growth in profits over the three and four year performance periods to 
2010 and 2011. No awards would vest unless Burberry’s TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group or growth in 
profit before tax and amortisation of goodwill per share (‘PBT’) exceeds 50% over the four year performance period to 2010 
or 75% over the five year performance period to 2011. For the performance period to 2010, maximum vesting would require 
Burberry’s TSR to out-perform the median of our peers by at least 8% p.a. and would require PBT growth of at least 75%. 
For the performance period to 2011, maximum vesting would require Burberry’s TSR to out-perform the median of our 
peers by at least 7% p.a. and would require PBT growth of at least 100%. Of the shares which meet the performance 
criteria, 50% vest on the third anniversary of the award date and the remaining 50% vest on the fourth anniversary of the 
award date. 
The TSR group for this award comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financière Richemont, Estée Lauder, Fossil, Geox, 
Hermès International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, 
Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tod’s.  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan (the ‘RSP’) 
Under this plan, executives may be awarded shares up to a maximum value of one times base salary (up to two times base 
salary in exceptional circumstances). The vesting of RSP awards is based 50% on Burberry’s three-year Total Shareholder 
Return (‘TSR’) relative to peers and 50% on three year growth in Profit Before Tax (‘PBT’). Awards vest in full only if Burberry 
achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its global peers and at least 15% per annum PBT growth. A proportion of an 
award (12.5%) may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 5% per annum 
over three years. Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vest after three years. The remaining 50% vest in 
two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the award date. 
The Remuneration Committee chose TSR relative to a group of Burberry’s global peers because it felt that this is an 
objective measure of the Group’s success and aligns with shareholder interests. Growth in PBT was chosen as it continues 
to be the primary measure used by management and the Remuneration Committee believes strong pre-tax profit growth is 
key to delivering superior shareholder returns. 
The TSR group for the 2007 award comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financière Richemont, Estée Lauder, Fossil, 
Geox, Hermès International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, 
Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tod’s.

All employee share-based plans 
In order to encourage broad ownership of Burberry shares the Group offers two share-based plans to its employees; 
− A Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’). Adopted at the time of the IPO, this plan has been used to award free shares to all Group 
employees as determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
− A Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’). This was adopted at the time of the IPO and was implemented in 2006. This 
allows directors and eligible employees to save a portion of their salary which can be used to purchase Burberry shares 
after three years at a 20% discount to the market price at the date of invitation. 
SIP 
On 20 August 2004, all qualifying employees based in the UK were awarded shares under the SIP. The interests of the

Shareholding guidelines 
The Remuneration Committee believes that share ownership provides an effective way to align the interests of shareholders 
and executive directors. The Remuneration Committee implemented an Executive Shareholding Policy during 2007/08 
which requires that executive directors and certain senior management achieve a holding in Burberry shares equivalent to  
at least one times base salary over a period of five years (at least one and half times and three times base salary for the 
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer respectively). 
As part of the Group’s shareholding guidelines, non-executive directors are expected to acquire shares with a market value 
of a minimum of £6,000 worth of shares for each year of their appointment. The shares should be held for the longer of 
three years from date of purchase or the duration of a non-executive director’s term on the Board. 
Directors’ interests

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
94 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters 
and the Group and the parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.  
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as 
adopted by the European Union, and the parent Company financial statements and the Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
and related matters in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). The Group and parent Company financial statements are required by law to  
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for  
that period. 
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: 
− select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
− make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
− state that the Group financial statements comply with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, and with regard to the 
parent Company financial statements that applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
− prepare the Group and parent Company financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Group will continue in business, in which case there should be supporting assumptions or qualifications  
as necessary.  
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Group financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and the parent Company financial statements and the 
Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible  
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08  
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 
BURBERRY GROUP PLC 
 
95
We have audited the Group financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise 
the Group Income Statement, Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, Group Balance Sheet, Group Cash 
Flow Statement and the related notes. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies 
set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended  
31 March 2008 and on the information in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters that is described  
as having been audited.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out  
in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and  
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group 
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with  
the Group financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented  
in the Business and Financial Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for  
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
Combined Code (2006) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it 
does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls,  
or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group 
financial statements. The other information comprises only the Chief Executive Officer’s Letter, Chairman’s Letter, Financial 
Highlights, Business and Financial Review, Risks, Corporate Responsibility Statement, Directors’ Report, Corporate 
Governance Statement and the unaudited part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in  
the Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the 
directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to  
the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
− the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended; 
− the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article  
4 of the IAS Regulation; and 
− the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the Group financial statements.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group is a luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer in Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific. Licensing 
activity is also carried out, principally in Japan. All of the companies which comprise Burberry Group are owned by Burberry 
Group plc (‘the Company’) directly or indirectly.  
The consolidated financial statements of Burberry Group have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), IFRIC interpretations and parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
except as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
During the year ended 31 March 2008 the Company adopted the following Standard: 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and the complementary amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements - 
Capital disclosures 
Requires new disclosures relating to financial instruments and share capital. Also introduces new disclosures regarding the significance 
of financial instruments for an entity's financial position and performance and qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the nature and 
extent of risks. This has no impact on the classification and valuation of the Group's financial instruments. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet 
effective: 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments  
Requires a 'management approach', under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting 
purposes and regularly reviewed by the Board in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. It will take 
effect for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. No material financial impact is anticipated. 
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements  
Applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, financing, operation and 
maintenance of infrastructure for public sector services. It is not relevant to the Group’s operations because the Group does not  
provide public sector services. 
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes  
Clarifies that where goods or services are sold together with a customer loyalty incentive (for example loyalty points or free products),  
the arrangement is a multiple-element arrangement and the consideration receivable from the customer is allocated between the 
components of the arrangement using fair values. It is not relevant to the Group’s operations because no such loyalty programmes  
are offered by the Group. 
IFRIC 14 (IAS 19) – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction   
Provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset and explains how 
the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement. It will take effect for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. No material financial impact is anticipated. 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group’s annual financial statements comprise those of the parent Company and its subsidiaries, presented as a single 
economic entity. The results of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using 
consistent accounting policies.  
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Where there is a loss of control of a subsidiary, the consolidated 
financial statements include the results for the portion of the reporting period during which Burberry Group plc had control. 
The effects of intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements.  
Key sources of estimation and judgement  
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires that management make certain 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities. If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best 
judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimate and assumptions 
will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Such estimates include, but are 
not limited to impairment of trade and other receivables, goodwill and asset impairment, inventory provisioning, income and 
deferred taxes. These are discussed below: 
Impairment of trade and other receivables 
A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established where management estimate that the Group will not 
be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
101
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash generating 
units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future 
cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate the present value. 
Impairment of assets 
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a  
cash generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s 
assumptions and estimates. 
Inventory provisioning 
The Group manufactures and sells luxury goods and is subject to changing consumer demands and fashion trends. As  
a result, it is necessary to consider the recoverability of the cost of inventories and the associated provisioning required. 
Inventory provisioning is based on the age and condition of inventory, as well as anticipated saleability. 
Income and deferred taxes 
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the provision for 
income taxes in each territory. There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for 
which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on 
estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 
which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions and assets in the 
period in which such determination is made. 
2. Accounting policies 
The consolidated financial information of Burberry Group plc and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance  
with IFRS. The principal accounting policies of the Group are: 
a) Revenue 
Revenue, which is stated excluding Value Added Tax and other sales related taxes, is the amount receivable for goods 
supplied (less returns, trade discounts and allowances) and royalties receivable. 
Wholesale sales are recognised when goods are despatched to trade customers, as this reflects the transfer of risks and 
rewards of ownership, with provisions made for expected returns and allowances. Retail sales, returns and allowances are 
reflected at the dates of transactions with customers. Provisions for returns on retail and wholesale sales are calculated 
based on historical return levels. Royalties receivable from licensees are accrued as earned on the basis of the terms of  
the relevant royalty agreement, which is typically on the basis of production volumes. 
b) Share schemes 
The cost of the share incentives received by employees (including directors) is measured with reference to the fair value of 
the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to determine the fair 
value of the award made. The impact of performance conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date 
of grant, except for conditions linked to the price of Burberry Group plc shares i.e. market conditions. Vesting conditions 
which relate to non-market conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to vest. 
The estimate of the number of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.  
The cost of the share based incentives is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the awards, with a 
corresponding increase in equity. 
The proceeds received from the exercise of the equity instruments awarded, net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs, are credited to share capital and share premium.  
c) Operating leases 
Burberry Group is a lessee of property. Gross rental expenditure in respect of operating leases is recognised on a straight 
line basis over the period of the leases. Certain rental expense is determined on the basis of revenue achieved in specific 
retail locations and is accrued for on that basis. 
Amounts paid to acquire the rights to a lease (‘Lease premiums’) are written off in equal annual instalments over the life of 
the lease contract. Lease incentives, typically rent free periods and capital contributions, are recognised over the term of 
the lease.  
d) Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends 
are approved by the shareholders.  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED  
 
 
102 
e) Pension costs 
Defined benefit schemes 
Prior to the demerger of Burberry from GUS plc on 13 December 2005, it was agreed that Burberry Limited would continue 
to participate in the GUS defined benefit scheme (renamed the ‘Experian Pension Scheme’) in respect of existing employees 
who were members of the scheme until 31 December 2007 or such earlier date as required by HM Customs & Revenue or 
by Burberry. On 31 December 2007 Burberry Limited ceased to participate in the Experian Pension Scheme. Burberry was 
liable and in April 2008 has paid the debt of £1.25m due under Section 75 or 75A of the Pensions Act 1995.  
Eligible employees of Burberry Group also participate in defined benefit schemes in France and Taiwan.  
Where arrangements are funded, assets are held in independently administrated trusts. The cost of providing defined 
benefit schemes to participating Burberry employees is charged to the Income Statement over the anticipated period of 
employment. Net actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly to equity through the Group Statement of Recognised 
Income and Expense (‘SORIE’).  
The asset or liability recognised in the Balance Sheet, in respect of defined benefit schemes, represents Burberry’s share of 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets, together with 
adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service costs. 
Defined contribution schemes 
Burberry Group eligible employees also participate in defined contribution pension schemes, the principal one being in the 
UK with its assets held in an independently administered fund. The cost of providing these benefits to participating Burberry 
employees is recognised in the Income Statement and comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in 
respect of the year. 
f) Intangible fixed assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill on 
acquisition is recorded as an intangible fixed asset. Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date. Adjustments are also  
made to align the accounting policies of acquired businesses with those of Burberry Group.  
Goodwill is assigned an indefinite useful economic life. Impairment reviews are performed annually, or more frequently  
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Trademarks and trading licences 
The cost of securing and renewing trademarks and other intellectual property is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset  
and amortised by equal annual instalments over its useful economic life, typically ten years. The useful economic life of 
trademarks and other intellectual property is determined on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the terms of the 
underlying agreement. 
Computer software 
The cost of acquiring computer software (including licences and separately identifiable external development costs) is 
capitalised as an intangible asset at purchase price, plus any directly attributable cost of preparing that asset for its 
intended use. Software costs are amortised by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives,  
which are up to five years. 
g) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost, based on historical revalued amounts, less accumulated 
depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value.  
Depreciation 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost or deemed cost, less residual value, of  
the assets in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: 
Land Not depreciated
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years
Leaseholds – less than 50 years expired  Over the unexpired term of the lease
Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 3 – 8 years
Retail fixtures and fittings 2 – 5 years
Office equipment 5 years
Computer equipment Up to 5 years BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
103
Profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and  
net book value at the date of sale. Disposals are accounted for when the relevant transaction becomes unconditional. 
h) Impairment of assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount  
by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for 
which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units).  
i) Inventories 
Inventories and work in progress are valued on a first-in-first-out basis at the lower of cost (including an appropriate 
proportion of production overhead) and net realisable value. Provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable 
value having regard to the age and condition of inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability. 
j) Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items which are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates which have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the temporary difference 
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is exempt from deferred tax. Deferred tax is determined 
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not discounted. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.  
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. 
k) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, 
including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders 
until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any 
consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects,  
is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. 
l) Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet when the entity becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset is no longer recognised when the contractual rights to the cash 
flow expire or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred. A financial liability is no longer recognised 
when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.  
The Group’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, 
borrowings and derivative financial instruments, the accounting for which is explained below.  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED  
 
 
104 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less, 
held with banks, liquidity funds as well as bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are recorded under current liabilities on the 
Balance Sheet. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a third party with no 
intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after 
the balance sheet date. Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the Income Statement. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables arise when the Group acquires money, goods or services directly from a supplier. They are 
included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Payables are 
recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised costs and the difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised 
in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as 
current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after 
the balance sheet date. 
Derivative instruments 
Burberry Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising 
on certain trading transactions. The principal derivative instruments used are forward currency contracts taken out to hedge 
highly probable future sales and royalty receivables and product purchases.  
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged  
items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used  
in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The 
method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, 
and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair 
value of recognised assets and liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or (2) hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions (cash flow hedges); or (3) classified as held for trading. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income 
Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are 
deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the 
Income Statement. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item 
is recognised in the Income Statement. If it is expected that all or a portion of a loss deferred in equity will not be recovered 
in one or more future periods, or the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount that is not expected  
to be recovered will be reclassified to the Income Statement. If a derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the 
subsequent change to the fair value is recognised in the Income Statement. 
m) Foreign currency translation  
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). 
Transactions in foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies within each entity in the Group are translated into the functional currency  
at the exchange rate ruling at the monthly average exchange rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies, which are held at the year end, are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in 
which they arise, except where these exchange differences form part of a net investment in overseas subsidiaries of 
Burberry Group, in which case such differences are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve within equity.   BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
105
Translation of the results of overseas businesses 
The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into the Group’s presentation currency of Sterling each month at the 
weighted average exchange rate for the month according to the phasing of the Group’s trading results. The weighted 
average exchange rate is used, as it is considered to approximate the actual exchange rates on the date of the 
transactions. The assets and liabilities of such undertakings are translated at the year end exchange rates. Differences 
arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies, and on the translation of their results,  
are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve within equity.  
The principal exchange rates used were as follows: 
    Weighted average profit rate        Closing rate

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of 
the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. 
The average exchange rate achieved by Burberry Group on its Yen royalty income, taking into account its use of Yen 
forward sale contracts on a monthly basis approximately 12 months in advance of royalty receipts, was Yen 221.5: £1  
in the year to 31 March 2008 (2007: Yen 199.2: £1). 
n) Non-GAAP measures 
Non-GAAP measures are presented in order to provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance  
of the Group’s ongoing business.  
3. Segmental analysis 
Primary segment – analysis by origin

addition, account is taken of any awards made under the share incentive schemes, which will have a dilutive effect  
when exercised.  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

Korea. The carrying value of the goodwill allocated to these cash generating units is:

Other 8.0 7.7 
Total 130.1 116.9 
At 31 March 2008 no impairment was recognised (2007: nil), as the recoverable amount of the goodwill for each cash 
generating unit exceeded its carrying value. The recoverable amount has been determined based on value in use. The value 
in use calculation was performed using pre-tax cash flow projections for 2008/09 based on financial plans approved by 
management. No growth has been assumed in the cash flow projections beyond this period (2007: nil). These cash flows 
were discounted at a rate of 15.1% (2007: 13.6%) for Spain and 14.1% (2007: 12.5%) for Korea, being Burberry Group’s 
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country specific tax rates.   BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

During the year to 31 March 2008 a net impairment release of £0.5m (2007: £1m) was identified as part of the annual 
impairment review. This includes an impairment charge of £1.2m relating to certain retail stores in the USA where trading 
conditions are becoming more challenging. It is offset by a £1.7m release due to improved trading conditions on previously 
impaired stores in Europe. 
The impairment release was based on a review of the value of the assets in use and on pre-tax cash flows attributable to 
these assets in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Pre-tax cash flow projections are based on financial plans 
approved by management and extrapolated beyond the budget year to the anticipated lease exit dates using growth rates 
and inflation rates appropriate to each country’s economic conditions. The pre-tax discount rate used in these calculations 
was 13.8%.  
Based on a valuation report prepared by Colliers Conrad Ritblat Erdman, dated 16 May 2006, the existing use value of 
Burberry Group’s nine most significant freehold properties is £136.9m (based on closing exchange rates at 31 March 
2008). This valuation is higher than the net book value of these assets. The directors do not intend to incorporate this 
valuation into the accounts but set out the valuation for information purposes only.  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related benefit 
through the future taxable profits is probable. The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of £4.4m (2007: £6.7m)  
in respect of losses amounting to £14.3m (2007: £18.6m) that can be carried forward against the future taxable income. 
These losses have no set expiry date. Other deferred tax assets of £nil (2007: £0.1m) were not recognised in respect of 
temporary differences totalling £nil (2007: £0.1m), as it was not probable that there will be future taxable profits against 
which these assets can be offset. 
Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of temporary differences of £111.0m (2007: £85.1m) relating to the 
unremitted earnings of subsidiaries on the grounds that no remittance of profits retained at 31 March 2008 is required  
or intended in such a way that incremental tax would arise.   110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

Within the other classes of trade and other receivables there are £5.1m (2007: £4.6m) of fully impaired receivables.  
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date with respect to trade receivables is the carrying amount

15. Derivative financial instruments 
The Group Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency. To reduce exposure to currency 
fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward 
exchange contracts. These transactions are recorded as cash flow hedges. 
Cash flow hedges 
Burberry Group’s principal foreign currency denominated transactions arise principally from royalty income, sales and 
purchases. The Group manages these exposures by the use of forward exchange contracts.   110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

18. Retirement benefit obligations 
Burberry Group provides post-retirement arrangements for its employees in the UK and its overseas operations, which are 
both defined benefit and defined contribution in nature. Where arrangements are funded, assets are held in independently 
administered trusts.  
The Balance Sheet obligations in respect of Burberry Group’s post-retirement arrangements, assessed in accordance with 
IAS 19, were:

Experian Pension Plan 
Prior to the demerger of Burberry from GUS plc on 13 December 2005, it was agreed that Burberry Limited would continue 
to participate in the GUS defined benefit scheme (renamed the ‘Experian Pension Scheme’) in respect of existing employees 
who were members of the scheme until 31 December 2007 or such earlier date as required by HM Customs & Revenue or 
by Burberry. On 31 December 2007 Burberry Limited ceased to participate in the Experian Pension Scheme. Burberry was 
liable and in April 2008 has paid the debt of £1.25m due under Section 75 or 75A of the Pensions Act 1995. 
The following disclosures regarding the Experian defined benefit scheme have been included for completeness as required 
by IAS 19 and have been based on valuation assumptions at the beginning of the year and the cash flows for the nine 
months to 31 December 2007. A full actuarial valuation of the Experian Pension Scheme is carried out every three years  
by independent qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt Limited, with interim reviews in the intervening years. This valuation 
separately identified the underlying assets and liabilities which related to the Burberry Group. In previous years the assets 
were restricted in accordance with the standard as it was anticipated that Burberry would not be able to benefit from the 
surplus. The Group recognises all gains/losses immediately through the SORIE.  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

18. Retirement benefit obligations (continued) 
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation of the Burberry Group portion of the Experian Pension 
Scheme are the same as those used for the whole of the Experian Pension Scheme and are shown below: 
  
Years to 31 March 
2007 & 2008
% 
Discount rate  5.4% 
Rate of inflation  3.1% 
Rate of salary increases  4.9% 
Rate of increases for pensions in payment and deferred pensions  3.1% 
Expected return on plan assets   7.1% 
The IAS 19 valuation assumes mortality will be in line with standard tables known as PMA92C2004 for males and 
PFA92C2004 for females. An allowance is also made for anticipated future improvements in life expectancy, by assuming 
that the probability of death occurring at each age will decrease by 0.25% each year. Overall, the average expectation of 
life on retirement in normal health is assumed to be: 
− 19.1 years at age 65 for a male currently aged 65;  
− 22.2 years at age 65 for a female currently aged 65; 
− 19.8 years at age 65 for a male currently aged 50; and 
− 23.1 years at age 65 for a female currently aged 50. 
Based on the method and assumptions outlined above, the amount recognised in Burberry Group’s Balance Sheet is 
determined as follows:

On exit from the scheme on the 31 December 2007 the net assets attributable to the Burberry Group were £6.4m. These 
assets were restricted in accordance with the standard as the Group will not benefit from the surplus. The additional 
restriction of the assets of £0.7m in the current year has been recognised through the SORIE.

30 March 2005. At 31 March 2008, the amount drawn down was £109m (2007: £60m). This drawdown was made in 
Sterling. Interest is charged on this loan at LIBOR plus 0.325% per annum on drawings less than £100m and at LIBOR  
plus 0.375% per annum on drawings over £100m. The borrowing matures on 30 March 2010. The undrawn facility at  
31 March 2008 was £91m (2007: £140m). 
As part of the Group’s obligations under its revolving credit facility Burberry (Wholesale) Limited (US) and Burberry Limited

During the year to 31 March 2008, the Company repurchased and subsequently cancelled 6,198,167 ordinary shares, 
representing 1.4% of the issued share capital, at a total cost of £39.6m. The nominal value of the shares was £3,099  
which was transferred to a capital redemption reserve. Retained earnings were reduced by £39.6m. The share repurchase 
programme commenced in January 2005 and since then a total of 79,063,397 ordinary shares have been repurchased and 
subsequently cancelled. This represents 15.8% of the original issued share capital at a total cost of £351.8m. The nominal 
value of the shares was £39,532 and has been transferred to a capital redemption reserve and the retained earnings have 
been reduced by £351.8m since this date.  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

22. Share capital and reserves (continued) 
The cost of own shares held in the Burberry Group ESOP Trusts has been offset against the profit and loss account, as the 
amounts paid reduce the profits available for distribution by the Burberry Group and the Company. As at 31 March 2008 
the amount offset against this reserve are £4.9m (2007: £9.2m). In the year to 31 March 2008 the Burberry Group plc 
ESOP Trust has waived its entitlement to dividends of £0.3m (2007: £0.4m). 
During the year profits of £0.6m (2007: £0.2m) have been transferred to capital reserves due to statutory requirements  
of subsidiaries. 
23. Financial commitments 
Burberry Group has commitments relating to future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases

Total  319.1 0.4 319.5  218.0 3.3 221.3 
The financial commitments for operating lease amounts calculated as a percentage of revenue (“revenue leases”) have been 
based on the minimum payment that is required under the terms of the relevant lease. Under certain revenue leases, there 
are no minimums and therefore no financial commitment is included in the table above. As a result, the amounts charged to 
the Income Statement may be materially higher than the financial commitment at the prior year end.  
Where rental agreements include a contingent rental, this contingent rent is generally calculated as a percentage of 
revenue. Escalation clauses increase the rental to either open market rent, a stipulated amount in the rental agreement,  
or by an inflationary index percentage. There are no significant restrictions imposed by these lease agreements.  
The total of future minimum sublease payments to be received under non-cancellable subleases is as follows:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

25. Contingent liabilities 
Since 31 March 2007 the following changes to material contingent liabilities have occurred: 
Under the terms of a Demerger Agreement, entered into with GUS plc on 13 December 2005, Burberry continued  
to participate in the Experian Pension Scheme until 31 December 2007. Under this scheme Burberry was jointly and 
severally liable with the other participating GUS companies for the deficit in this scheme. Burberry was required to pay  
any debt due under Section 75 or 75A of the Pensions Act 1995. This debt has been determined to be £1.25m and  
was settled in April 2008.  
Other material contingent liabilities reported at 31 March 2007 remain unchanged and were: 
Under the GUS group UK tax payment arrangements, the Group was jointly and severally liable for any GUS liability 
attributable to the period of Burberry Group’s membership of this payment scheme. Burberry Group’s membership of  
this scheme was terminated with effect from 31 March 2002.  
Burberry (Spain) S.A. is liable for certain salary and social security contributions left unpaid by its sole contractors where  
the amounts are attributable to the period in which subcontracting activity is undertaken on behalf of Burberry (Spain) S.A.  
It is not feasible to estimate the amount of contingent liability, but such expense has been minimal in prior years. 
During the year ended 31 March 2008, Burberry Group has provided guarantee letters to certain raw material suppliers. The 
total value of these guarantees, which expire on 30 September 2008, amount to £0.4m at 31 March 2008 (2007: £1.1m). 
26. Financial risk management 
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise cash and short term deposits, external 
borrowings, deferred consideration, as well as trade debtors and creditors, arising directly from operations.  
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks (including foreign exchange risk, price risk and 
cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. 
Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury who seek to reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is 
available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest in cash assets safely and profitably. This is done in close co-operation 
with the Group’s operating units. Group Treasury does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the 
underlying business requirements. The policies of the Group Treasury department are reviewed and approved by the Board 
of Directors. The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. 
Market risk 
Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.  
Burberry Group’s Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency. To reduce exposure to 
currency fluctuations, Burberry Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into 
forward exchange contracts (see note 15). The Group’s accounting policy in relation to derivative instruments is set out in 
note 2. 
The Group’s Treasury risk management policy is to hedge anticipated cash flows in each major foreign currency that qualify 
as ‘highly probable’ forecast transactions for hedge accounting purposes. 
Burberry Group monitors the desirability of hedging the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries when translated into Sterling 
for reporting purposes. It has not entered into any specific transactions for this purpose. 
At 31 March 2008 we have performed sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of non-Sterling currencies 
strengthening/weakening by 5% against Sterling with all other variables held constant. The effect of translating foreign 
currency denominated net debt, receivables, payables and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss would have 
increased/decreased post-tax profit for the year by £1.1m (2007: £0.6m). The effect of translating Sterling denominated 
loans held in subsidiaries which have been classified as part of the net investment in these subsidiaries on consolidation 
would have decreased/increased equity by £6.4m (2007: £1.8m). 
The tables below show the extent to which Burberry Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the year end in currencies 
other than the local currency of operation, after accounting for the effect of any specific forward contracts used to manage 
currency exposure. Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and amounts to be received or paid 
in cash. Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are recognised in the Income Statement.  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

Total  (25.8) (56.1)
Price risk 
The Group is exposed to employer’s national insurance liability due to the implementation of various employee share 
incentive schemes. 
To reduce exposure to fluctuations in the employer’s national insurance liability due to movements in the Group’s share 
price, the Group has a policy of entering into equity swaps at the time of granting share options. The Group does not seek 
hedge accounting treatment for equity swaps. The Group monitors its exposure to fluctuations in the employer’s national 
insurance liability on an ongoing basis to ensure it remains immaterial. 
Cash flow interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash, short term deposits and  
external borrowings. 
The external borrowings are linked to the LIBOR rate, while cash and short term borrowings are affected by local market 
rates around the Group. The borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.

Euro 20.2 1.0 21.2 
Other currencies 37.4 0.7 38.1 
Total financial liabilities 134.2 20.4 154.6 
The floating rate financial liabilities at 31 March 2008 and 2007 include overdraft balances of £82.8m (2007: £74.2m). 
Currently, this risk is not hedged as the risk is not considered significant. This situation is monitored by Group Treasury. 
At 31 March 2008, if interest rates on Sterling denominated borrowings had been ten basis points higher/lower with all 
other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £0.1m (2007: £0.2m) lower/higher, as a result  
of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings. 
The Group has no significant foreign currency borrowings and therefore is not exposed to movements in foreign currency 
interest rates.  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08  
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

26. Financial risk management (continued) 
Credit risk 
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales of products 
are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit 
cards. In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to  
bad debts is not significant.  
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short term deposits and certain 
derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counter party with a maximum 
exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure 
to any financial institution.  
The Group has deposited €2.0m (2007: €0.5m), CHF 0.3m (2007: CHF 0.3m) and TWD nil (2007: TWD 5.0m) which is 
held as collateral at a number of European banks. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group financial risk management policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet foreseeable needs 
and close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain 
flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available. For further details of this, see note 20.  
All short term trade creditors, accruals and derivative financial liabilities mature within one year or less. The maturity profile

obligations £0.9m (2007: £0.1m), which are included in provisions. 
Capital risk 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital (defined as net debt plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s ability  
to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while 
maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom whilst optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance  
of debt and equity funding. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to 
economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

Share options granted to directors and employees 
The share option schemes have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Senior Executive 
Restricted Share Plan and the Exceptional Performance Share Plan, both of which have market based performance 
conditions attached, have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with a discount applied to this  
value, based on information obtained by running a Monte Carlo simulation model on the scheme.  
Where applicable, equity swaps have been entered into to cover future Employer’s National Insurance liability (or overseas 
equivalent) that may arise in respect of these schemes. 
SAYE share option scheme 
In the prior year a Save As You Earn (SAYE) share option scheme offering Burberry Group plc ordinary shares was 
introduced for employees. 
On 24 August 2007 and 28 September 2007 further options were granted under this scheme. These options are 
exercisable from 1 September 2010 and 1 October 2010 respectively and are dependent on continued employment, as 
well as a saving obligation over the vesting period. The exercise price for these options is calculated at a 20% discount to 
market price over the three dealing days preceding the invitation date. Three day averages are calculated by taking middle 
market quotations of a Burberry Group plc share from the London Stock Exchange. 
The fair value of the options granted in the year has been calculated using a risk-free rate of 5.3% (2007: 4.9%), expected 
volatility of 28.5% (2007: 25.2%) and an expected dividend yield of 2.4% (2007: between 1.6% and 2.1%). The fair values 
per option for these grants were determined as £1.68 and £1.77 respectively. The Burberry share price at the date of grant 
was £5.93 and £6.57 respectively. 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic annualised standard deviation of the continuously 
compounded rates of return on the shares over a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the life of the option.  
As share price information was only available for Burberry Group plc from July 2002 an average of a comparator group  
of companies was used prior to this date. The average expected volatility over the life of the option was used.  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

In June and November 2007 awards of 2,120,657 and 305,071 ordinary shares respectively were made to directors and 
senior management under the RSP (2007: 2,352,546).  
The options vest in three stages, 50% are exercisable after three years, 25% are exercisable after four years and 25% are 
exercisable after five years. The vesting of these share options is dependent on two performance conditions. Vesting of 
RSP shares is based 50% on Burberry’s three year Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) relative to peers and 50% on three year 
growth in profit before taxation (‘PBT’). Awards vest in full only if Burberry achieves at least upper quartile TSR compared to 
its global peers and at least 15% per annum profit growth (currency adjusted), and the executive remains in employment 
with Burberry for at least five years. A proportion of an award (12.5%) may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of 
the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 5% per annum over three years. The vesting of these share options is also 
dependent on continued employment over the vesting period. The exercise price of these share options is £nil. 
Obligations under this plan will be met by the issue of ordinary shares of the Company.

For the awards made on 21 November 2007, the fair value for those restricted shares with the PBT performance condition 
was determined as £5.54 by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. A discount was applied to the restricted 
shares with the TSR performance condition, by applying the Monte Carlo model. The fair value for these restricted shares 
was determined to be £2.39. 
As dividends accrue during the vesting period, expected dividends were not incorporated into the measurement of fair 
value. The key factors used in determining the fair value of the options were as follows:

Weighted average share price at grant date 6.34 5.54 
Exercise price – – 
Option life Equivalent to vesting period Equivalent to vesting period 
Expected volatility 28.5% 28.5% 
Risk free interest rate 5.7% 4.4% 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic annualised standard deviation of the continuously 
compounded rates of return on the shares over a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the life of the option.  
As share price information was only available for Burberry Group plc from July 2002 an average of a comparator group  
of companies was used prior to this date. The average expected volatility over the life of the option was used. 
Burberry Restricted Share Reinvestment Plan  
On 21 July 2005 awards in respect of a total of 782,500 Ordinary Shares were made to senior management under the 
Restricted Share Reinvestment Plan.  
The options vest in two stages, 50% are exercisable after three years and 50% are exercisable after four years. The vesting 
of these share options is dependent on the employee holding the original IPO RSP shares which were awarded and which 
vested on 11 July 2005. The vesting of these share options is also dependent on continued employment over the vesting 
period. The exercise price of these share options is £nil.

All Employee Share Plan 
In previous financial years all employees were offered options over ordinary shares in the Company at a nil exercise price 
under an all Employee Share Plan. All awards vest after three years and the vesting of these share options is dependent  
on continued employment over the vesting period. 
These ordinary shares are held in two trusts, being the Burberry Group Share Incentive Plan Trust and the Burberry Group 
plc ESOP Trust. The ordinary shares must be held in trust between three and five years.

Co-Investment Plan  
In previous financial years executive directors and certain senior management were able to defer receipt of all or part of  
their annual bonus and invest it in ordinary shares in the Company with up to a 2:1 match based on individual and Group 
performance during the year. The matching share awards do not vest for three years and are forfeited if the executive 
leaves due to resignation within that period. The exercise price of these share options is £nil. During the year to  
31 March 2008 1,227,414 options were awarded (2007: nil). 
The fair value of the options was determined as £7.01 by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The key factors 
used in determining the fair value of the options were as follows: 
 20 June 2007 
Weighted average share price at grant date £7.01 
Exercise price – 
Option life Equivalent to vesting period 
Expected volatility 28.5% 
Risk free interest rate 5.7% 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic annualised standard deviation of the continuously 
compounded rates of return on the shares over a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the life of the option.  
As share price information was only available for Burberry Group plc from July 2002 an average of a comparator group  
of companies was used prior to this date. The average expected volatility over the life of the option was used.  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

Exceptional Performance Share Plan  
On 26 July 2007 awards in respect of a total of 4,125,000 ordinary shares were made to directors and senior management 
under the Exceptional Performance Share Plan introduced as a one-off long-term incentive plan in the current year.  
The options vest in two stages, 50% are exercisable after three years and 50% are exercisable after four years. The vesting 
of these share options is dependent on two performance conditions. The award is based 50% on relative Total Shareholder 
Return (‘TSR’) performance and 50% on growth in profits over the three and four year performance periods to 2010 and 
2011. No awards vest unless Burberry’s TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group or growth in profit before tax 
and amortisation of goodwill per share (‘PBT’) exceeds 50% over the four year performance period to 2010 or 75% over the 
five year performance period to 2011. The vesting of these share options is also dependent on continued employment over 
the vesting period. The exercise price of these share options is £nil. 
On 21 November 2007 an additional grant in respect of 85,000 ordinary shares was made to senior management as a one-
off exceptional award. The rules applicable to the award are the same as for the Exceptional Performance Share Plan other 
than in respect of the time of vesting.

  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08  
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF BURBERRY GROUP PLC 
141
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2008 which 
comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes. These parent Company financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and 
related matters that is described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2008.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters 
and the parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
and related matters to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members 
as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this 
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether 
the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters to be 
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our 
opinion the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the parent Company financial statements. The 
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business and Financial Review 
that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent 
Company financial statements. The other information comprises only the Chief Executive Officer’s Letter, Chairman’s Letter, 
Financial Highlights, Business and Financial Review, Risks, Corporate Responsibility Statement, Directors’ Report, 
Corporate Governance Statement and the unaudited part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters.  
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the parent Company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in  
the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters to  
be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the 
preparation of the parent Company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent Company financial statements 
and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and Related Matters to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Report on 
Directors’ Remuneration and related matters to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
− the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2008; 
− the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and related matters  
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and  
− the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the parent Company financial statements.

Chairman  Chief Financial Officer  BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08  
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
143
A. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group plc (‘the Company’) is the parent Company of the Burberry Group. Burberry Group plc is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and its principal business is investment.  
Burberry Group is a luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer in Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific; licensing 
activity is also carried out, principally in Japan. All of the companies, which comprise Burberry Group, are owned by the 
Company directly or indirectly.  
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention with the 
exception of financial instruments which are included in the financial statements at fair value and in accordance with 
applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 1985.  
B. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. Changes to accounting policies and 
presentation are set out in note C. 
Share schemes 
Incentive plans 
Employees in Burberry Group (including directors) receive certain share incentives, relating to Burberry Group plc shares. 
The cost of the share incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date 
of grant. The Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to determine the fair value of the award made. The impact of 
performance conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant, except for conditions linked  
to the price of Burberry Group plc shares i.e. market conditions. Vesting conditions which relate to non-market conditions 
are allowed for in the assumptions about the number of options expected to vest. The estimate of the number of options 
expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date. 
The cost of the share based incentives are recharged and recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the awards 
in the entity employing the relevant employees receiving the share awards. A corresponding increase in equity is recognised 
in Burberry Group plc. 
The proceeds received from the exercise of the equity instruments awarded, net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs, are credited to share capital and share premium in Burberry Group plc. 
Full disclosures are presented in note 27 of the consolidated financial statements. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends 
are approved by the shareholders for the final dividend or paid in respect of the interim dividend. 
Investments in Group companies 
Investments in Group companies are stated at cost, less any provisions to reflect impairment in value. 
Loans to Group companies are considered to be part of the net investment in the subsidiary and any foreign exchange  
gain or losses made of these loans is recognised in the profit and loss account. 
Impairment of assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell  
and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).  
Taxation including deferred tax 
Deferred taxation is recognised as a liability or asset if transactions have occurred at the balance sheet date that give rise to 
an obligation to pay more taxation in future, or a right to pay less taxation in future. An asset is not recognised to the extent 
that the realisation of economic benefits in the future is uncertain. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08 
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
CONTINUED  
 
144 
B. Accounting policies (continued) 
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are 
cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net 
of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable 
to the Company’s equity holders. 
Financial instruments 
Financial instruments are reported and measured in accordance with FRS 25 and FRS 26 respectively. The Company used 
the exemption not to present FRS 25 disclosures in the notes to the entity financial statements as full equivalent disclosures 
are presented within the consolidated financial statements.  
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are held at the year end, are translated 
into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised 
in the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.  
Cash flow statement 
The Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement under FRS 1 (revised 1996) ‘Cash flow 
statements’, as it is a part of Burberry Group and the cash flow for the Group is included in the consolidated financial 
statements of Burberry Group. 
Related party transactions 
FRS 8, ‘Related Party Disclosures’ requires the disclosure of the details of material transactions and balances between the 
reporting entity and related parties. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under the terms of FRS 8, not to 
disclose details of transactions with entities that are part of Burberry Group. 
C. Changes in accounting policies and presentation 
The Accounting Standards Board has issued a new Financial Reporting Standard in the year to 31 March 2008, which 
impacted on the financial statements for the Company. 
The results for the year to 31 March 2008 have incorporated the impact of UITF 44, which provides guidance on applying 
FRS 20. The adoption of UITF 44 had no material impact on the reported results or net assets of the Company for  
31 March 2008 and 2007, however the overall impact is an increase in investments in Group companies and decrease in 
amounts receivable from Group companies of £55.9m (2007: £41.5m). Investments in Group companies as at 31 March 
2006 have been increased by £30.7m. The Company balance sheet as at 31 March 2007 and related notes D and E  
have been restated to include the impact of UITF 44. 
The aging profile of amounts receivable from Group companies after one year and loan balances payable to Group 
companies after one year at 31 March 2007 has been restated in notes E and H due to a review of payment terms.

Profit on ordinary activities, but before dividends payable, was £95.3m (2007: loss £14.8m). As permitted by section 230  
of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. The Company audit fee was 
£0.5m (2007: £0.3m). Dividend disclosures are provided in note nine of the Group accounts. 
During the year to 31 March 2008, the Company repurchased and subsequently cancelled 6,198,167 (2007: 12,281,000) 
ordinary shares, representing 1.4% (2007: 2.7%) of the issued share capital, at a total cost of £39.6m (2007: £62.2m). The 
nominal value of the shares was £3,099 (2007: £6,141) which was transferred to a capital redemption reserve. The profit 
and loss account was reduced by £39.6m (2007: £62.2m). 
The cost of own shares held in the Burberry Group ESOP Trusts has been offset against the profit and loss account, as the 
amounts paid reduce the profits available for distribution by the Burberry Group and the Company. As at 31 March 2008 
the amounts offset against this reserve are £4.9m (2007: £9.2m). 
The capital reserve consists of non-distributable reserves and the capital redemption reserve arising on the purchase of 
own shares. 
J. Contingent liabilities 
Burberry Group plc, together with Burberry Limited, Burberry Spain SA, Burberry Asia Limited, Burberry (Wholesale) Limited 
(US) and Burberry Limited (US) make up the Guarantor Group for a £200m five year multi currency revolving facility 
agreement which commenced on 30 March 2005. The facility was co-ordinated by HSBC Bank plc (Co-ordinator and Agent) 
and the mandated lead arrangers were Barclays Capital, HSBC Bank plc, Lloyds TSB Bank plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland 
plc and Societe General S.A.. All have an equal commitment of £40m each. Interest is charged on this loan at LIBOR plus 
0.325% per annum on drawings less than £100m and at LIBOR plus 0.375% per annum on drawings over £100m. 
A potential liability may arise in the future if one of the Group members defaults on the loan facility. Each guarantor, 
including Burberry Group plc would be liable to cover the amounts outstanding, including principal and interest elements. 
K. Employee costs 
No employees were employed by the Company during the year to 31 March 2008 (2007: nil).  110 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007/08

Unauthorised brokers (boiler room scams) 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports. These are typically from overseas based 
‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders offering to sell them 
what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in 
US or UK investments. 
More detailed information can be found on the FSA 
website, at www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk. 
If you receive unsolicited investment advice: 
− Make sure you get the correct name of the person  
and organisation. 
− Check that they are properly authorised by the  
FSA before getting involved. You can check this  
at www.fsa.gov.uk/register. 
− The FSA also maintains a list of unauthorised  
overseas firms who are targeting, or have  
targeted, UK investors. This list can be found at 
http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/ 
alerts/index.shtml 
− Any approach from such organisations should be 
reported to the FSA using the online form so that  
this list can be kept up to date and any other  
appropriate action can be considered. 
− Inform our Registrars. 
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be 
eligible to received payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme. 
Details of any sharedealing facilities that the Company 
endorses will only be included in Company mailings.

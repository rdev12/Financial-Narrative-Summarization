conditions in our nitrile business and 
our focus on innovation, increased 
capacity and tight cost control.”

4 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Performance
2015 has been an excellent year for 
Synthomer, reflecting favourable market 
conditions in our nitrile business in Asia 
and our ongoing strategic initiatives to 
invest in future growth through innovation, 
increased capacity and tight cost control. 
Sales volumes were 5.0% higher in the 
year rising to 1,251ktes in 2015 (2014: 
1,191ktes). The increase in volumes 
reflected growth across both the Europe 
and North America (ENA), and Asia and 
Rest of World (ARW) segments, as well 
as across all strategic business units. 
Total sales reduced by 9.7% to £894.0m 
(2014: £990.5m), with the impact of the 
rise in sales volumes being offset by 
both the depreciation in the Euro during 
2015, and as a result a fall in raw 
material prices. 
Underlying profit before tax increased by 
11% to a record level of £95.3m (2014: 
£86.0m). This improvement was despite 
the adverse impact of currency of £10.3m 
and the significant rise of employee 
bonuses of £12.5m given the strong 
operating performance.
Cash flow before financing at £84.4m 
(2014: £49.6m) was also a record high for 
Synthomer, mainly benefiting from higher 
earnings and lower working capital, partly 
as a result of the fall in raw material prices.
This year’s significant improvement in 
performance of our business was driven 
by our ARW segment where both our 
nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) business 
and our dispersions businesses have had 
a very strong year. ARW operating profit 
up 127.5% to £40.5m (2014: £17.8m). 
Equally important was the stability and 
resilience of our business in ENA where 
operating profit was flat once the adverse 
impact of the currency translation and the 
rise in employee bonuses are taken 
into account.
Safety, health and environment
The Board remains resolute in its view 
that the Group’s standards in relation to 
safety, health and environment are of the 
utmost importance to the profitability and 
well-being of our business, and that no 
compromise is acceptable in the drive for 
continuous improvement in our 
standards. Each day should end with 
employees returning home safely, with the 
chemical processes being well controlled 
throughout the day, and with no incidents 
giving rise to losses of containment and 
damage to our environment. We have 
made progress in all these areas and the 
Group’s reportable lost time accident rate 
improved in 2015 to give Synthomer its 
best ever performance as set out in our 
Resources and Relationships report on 
pages 20 to 27 of the Annual Report.
Governance 
The Board is committed to a focused and 
proportionate governance framework which 
supports, and is an integral part of, the 
investment and growth strategy of the 
Group. The Board sets the governance 
agenda, the composition, skills and 
diversity of the Board, and the evolution 
of the Group strategy under the new 
executive team. The Board considers its 
own effectiveness and the effectiveness of 
the governance structure in balancing the 
risks and rewards associated with the 
Group’s activities.
Further information on our corporate 
governance policies and procedures 
is set out in our Corporate governance 
report on pages 44 to 52 of this 
Annual Report.
Board changes
At the start of 2015, we welcomed 
Calum MacLean who took over from 
Adrian Whitfield as our new Chief 
Executive Officer. In May 2015, Stephen 
Bennett joined as Chief Financial Officer, 
replacing David Blackwood who 
announced his intention to retire from the 
Group in December 2014. Like Calum, 
Steve joined from INEOS, where he had 
held a number of senior finance positions 
in different businesses, and brings a 
wealth of chemicals, and merger & 
acquisitions experience to Synthomer. 
Jez Maiden, our Senior Independent 
Director and Chair of the Audit 
Committee, stood down from the Board 
this year after eight years with the 
Company. Brendan Connolly succeeded 
him as Senior Independent Director, and 
Caroline Johnstone, formerly a partner at 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, joined the 
Board as a non-executive director and 
Chair of the Audit Committee in April.
The solid foundations laid under Adrian’s 
leadership and the new impetus of the 
Group have been supported by selected 
recruitment of key personnel, which forms 
an experienced executive team capable 
of driving Synthomer to the next level in 
the medium term.

Our people
I commented last year on our Core Values 
programme that defines the qualities, 
characteristics and culture of our 
organisation. A key component of the 
Core Values programme is our people 
and we have appointed an experienced 
Group HR Director to lead our HR 
strategies in succession, recruitment, 
grade structure & rewards and training, 
and our investment in our current and 
future employees. Having an appropriate 
HR structure and policies is an integral 
part of our investment for growth, and will 
become increasingly important as we 
move our business forward both 
organically and through acquisitions.
In a year when the Group has reported 
a record set of results, I would like to 
thank our employees, across all our 
businesses, who have worked hard 
to deliver this excellent performance, 
for their significant contribution 
and commitment. 
Dividend
The Board has recommended an increase 
in the final dividend per share to 5.4p (2014: 
4.8p), with the total dividend per share 
declared in 2015 up 10.3% at 8.6p 
(2014: 7 .8p). The final dividend per share 
is subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting on 28 April 
2016 and will be distributed to 
shareholders on the register 
at 3 June 2016.
As provided for in the Capital 
Management Policy of the Group 
announced during 2014, the Board is 
committed to supporting the ambitious 
growth strategy of the Group, whilst 
maintaining an efficient, but flexible 
balance sheet. The Board will periodically 
assess the strength of the balance sheet 
and will continue to consider one off 
returns if the balance sheet becomes 
structurally below 1 times.
Outlook 
Synthomer has had an excellent year in 
terms of earnings and cash flows, and we 
remain confident that the Group is well 
placed to capture value through the 
strategies that we have put in place. 
However, we also recognise that there are 
a number of challenges currently facing 
the global economy, including the 
uncertainty surrounding China, and the 
consequent knock-on impact on both 
global oil and feedstock prices. 
Given the general economic environment, 
our outlook for the ENA businesses 
remains cautious with overall volumes 
and unit margins continuing at similar 
levels through 2016. In relation to ARW, 
which is heavily influenced by our Asian 
nitrile business, we are aware that a 
number of nitrile producers, including 
Synthomer, have announced plans to 
increase capacity during the latter part 
of 2016 and early 2017. Whilst we are 
confident of continued strong growth in 
demand from the nitrile glove 
manufacturers during 2016 and beyond, 
we expect this planned capacity increase 
to impact the supply/demand balance 
during the second half of 2016 leading to 
similar volumes and margins to 2015 for 
the year as a whole.

 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 7 Introduction
2015 has been a year of strong progress 
for Synthomer. The sound decisions 
made by the previous management 
to invest in innovation and capacity 
expansion, coupled with our ongoing 
focus on cost control and favourable 
market conditions in our nitrile business, 
have underpinned record earnings and 
cash flows. 
Underlying profit before tax at £95.3m 
(2014: £86.0m) is the highest recorded 
by the Group, surpassing the previous 
high of £94.6m in 2012. The underlying 
profit before tax is 11% higher than 2014, 
23% higher at constant currency and 
37% higher at constant currency and 
constant bonus.
Strong cash generation remains a key 
feature of our business and cash flow 
before financing was £84.4m (2014: 
£49.6m). This helped to fuel our continued 
investment in innovation and capacity 
expansion, a strategic initiative that has 
yielded good returns. As a speciality 
chemical company, continued investment, 
both organically and through selective 
acquisitions, is a priority to underpin our 
continued momentum.
On becoming Chief Executive Officer, my 
first priority was to develop a thorough 
understanding of the business, its people, 
and the opportunities available in order to 
set the strategy for growth. As a focused 
aqueous polymers business, with strong 
market positions in Europe and Asia and 
Rest of World, Synthomer can generate 
solid earnings growth of between 3% and 
4% over the cycle, supported by strong 
cash flow given modest underlying capital 
requirements. Our executive team will 
continue to ensure that our existing 
business is well run and that we focus on 
organic growth in the business, 
underpinned by global mega-trends. In 
addition, the planned development of the 
Group to become a more diversified, 
broad-based speciality chemicals 
company represents an evolution in the 
strategy and direction, and we are actively 
focused on finding the right acquisition 
opportunities at the right price.
A key metric for the Group, as a speciality 
chemicals business, is measuring its 
progress in research and development 
through reporting the progress on new 
products launched to the market. The 
proportion of sales generated in the year 
that related to new products launched in 
the previous five years was 18% (2014: 16%).
Safety, health and environment
As a business that has more than 2,000 
employees across 19 production sites, 
and that handles and consumes 
hazardous chemicals, Synthomer’s 
success is directly related to the Group 
conducting its business in a safe and 
responsible way. The Group’s standards in 
relation to safety, health and environment 
are of the utmost importance to the Board, 
and to the profitability and well-being of 
our business. We are committed to a 
programme of continuous improvement in 
our standards. Our progress in driving for 
continuous improvement is set out in our 
Resources and Relationships report on 
pages 20 to 27 of this report.
Segmental review
Europe and North America
Consistent with the trend in the overall 
level of economic activity in Europe, 
on a like-for-like basis adjusting for both 
currency and employee bonuses, our 
Europe and North America segment 
has had a relatively stable year in terms 
of underlying operating profits. Overall 
volumes in 2015 were a little higher 
than the prior year, excluding our paper 
volumes which continued to trend 
downwards in-line with the reduction in 
market demand for paper. Average Euro 
unit margins in 2015 were also higher 
than 2014, reflecting a number of factors 
including the raw material price reductions 
late in 2014, implementation of selective 
price increases and affirmative action to 
exit low margin business.
Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Asia and Rest of World
Our Asia and Rest of World business had 
a very successful year with underlying 
operating profits rising significantly. Whilst 
the very strong growth was underpinned 
by our health and protection business in 
Asia where volumes and margins 
increased by 11% and 5% respectively, 
our construction and coatings business in 
Malaysia, the Middle East and Africa also 
had a good year, albeit overshadowed by 
the exceptional growth in health and 
protection business. As commented 
earlier, the health and protection business 
benefited from the investments in both 
capacity and innovation made in the last 
few years which, coupled with the 
continued growth in demand for our nitrile 
butadiene rubber latex from the surgical 
glove manufacturers, resulted in the 
reported improvement in both volumes 
and margins. 
A full review of our ENA and ARW results 
is set out in our segmental review on 
pages 34 to 37.
New executive team and London HQ
In order to capture both the organic 
growth and acquisition opportunities, we 
have made a number of important 
changes to the way the business is run, 
including the streamlining of the executive 
management team, the recruitment of 
a small number of experienced senior 
personnel, and the opening of our new 
operational head office in London.
The new executive team of seven now 
comprises three executives leading our 
regional and specialities businesses, the 
Head of Group Operations and the Group 
General Counsel together with the Group 
Chief Financial Officer and myself. The 
new team benefits from the experience, 
knowledge and understanding of those 
who have been with the Group for some 
time, and from the fresh impetus and 
insight from the three of us who have 
joined in the last 12 months. In addition 
to the new Head of Group Operations, 
we have recruited a Global HR Director 
and Group Chief Information  
8 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Officer. All three have considerable 
experience in their respective fields and  
represent an investment in the human skills 
capital of the Group. I am confident they 
will add considerable value to the existing 
Group, and their expertise means that we 
are well positioned in the event we need 
to integrate new businesses.
We opened a new head office in London 
in September and, with the exception of 
our head of Asia who is based in Kuala 
Lumpur, all the members of the executive 
team, together with the key senior 
managers of the Group, are now based 
there. The new open plan office brings 
together the key commercial, operational, 
development and financial managers 
greatly enhancing the interaction and 
communication within our team.
Organic growth strategy
Our organic growth strategy is necessarily 
tailored to our specific market positions.
In our ENA segment, we are mainly 
focused on the styrene butadiene rubber 
and dispersions businesses. Our European 
styrene butadiene rubber business, which 
serves the paper, and carpet and foam 
manufacturers, operates in a market 
characterised by overcapacity among a 
few large producers, and accordingly our 
strategy centres on innovation, strong 
cost and cash controls, and asset 
rationalisation. Our dispersions business, 
which principally serves the construction 
and coatings, and adhesives and fibre 
bonding manufacturers, operates in a 
growth market that is fragmented, with 
well utilised capacity. Our strategy is to 
focus on innovation, cost and cash 
control, running the assets hard, and an 
evolving asset strategy that is aimed at 
cost effective debottlenecking of existing 
plant capacity and consolidation. We are 
progressing with our Synthomer 2015 
cost reduction programme and at the end 
of 2015, annualised cost savings of €7m 
had been delivered, with a further €6m 
expected in 2016.
In our ARW segment, our business is 
centred on the nitrile butadiene rubber 
and dispersions businesses. The nitrile 
butadiene rubber business is focused 
around a Malaysian asset base and 
principally serves the disposable glove 
manufacturers. The end market is 
relatively young and is growing rapidly. 
As market leader, our strategy is to 
invest both in innovation and capacity 
to maintain our leadership position 
and capture the strong market growth 
dynamics. We are actively progressing 
the expansion of our Pasir Gudang facility 
to add a further 120ktes of nitrile 
butadiene rubber capacity, capitalising on 
the value of the existing site infrastructure, 
with a view to this coming online during 
mid-2017. The dispersions manufacturing 
base is more evenly spread across 
Malaysia and the Middle East and Africa, 
and in these geographies serves mainly 
the construction and coatings producers. 
We have seen good growth in these 
markets in recent years underpinned by 
our strategy to invest in innovation and 
capacity, and expand our dispersions 
product offering.
Acquisition strategy 
Acquisitions are clearly highly dependent 
on finding the right opportunities at the 
right price. We have established an 
experienced and skilled team who are 
able to carry out comprehensive due 
diligence to ensure that every transaction 
opportunity is fully evaluated. This is a 
critical component of a successful 
acquisition strategy. Whilst we are fully 
committed and enthusiastic to acquire 
new businesses, we will only do so if the 
target offers growth potential, synergies 
and sustainable profitability. The existing 
Synthomer business is a strong market 
leader within its chosen markets, and any 
additions made through acquisition 
should be equally speciality in nature. 
Target transactions can include 
consolidation opportunities in our existing 
markets as well as speciality chemicals 
business in adjacent fields.
Our reference criteria for adjacent 
speciality chemicals businesses are those 
that have similar EBITDA margins to our 
existing businesses, include investment 
in research and development, have 
technical services teams working closely 
with customers to develop customer 
specific formulations, have proven 
products with market leading positions, 
and have good people/assets. We will 
be opportunistic in looking at potential 
targets and not limit the selection by 
reference to geography or chemistry.
Outlook
Synthomer has had an excellent year 
in terms of earnings and cash flows, and 
we remain confident that the Group is 
well placed to capture value through the 
strategies that we have put in place. 
However, we also recognise that there are 
a number of challenges currently facing 
the global economy, including the 
uncertainty surrounding China, and the 
consequent knock-on impact on both 
global oil and feedstock prices. 
Given the general economic environment, 
our outlook for the ENA businesses 
remains cautious with overall volumes 
and unit margins continuing at similar 
levels through 2016. In relation to ARW, 
which is heavily influenced by our Asian 
nitrile business, we are aware that a 
number of nitrile producers, including 
Synthomer, have announced plans to 
increase capacity during the latter part 
of 2016 and early 2017. Whilst we are 
confident of continued strong growth 
in demand from the nitrile glove 
manufacturers during 2016 and beyond, 
we expect this planned capacity increase 
to impact the supply/demand balance 
during the second half of 2016 leading to 
similar volumes and margins to 2015 for 
the year as a whole.

Sustainability at the heart of our business
We have completed our 
Synthomer Core Values roll out 
and their integration into our 
annual assessment process.
We have continued to focus 
on reducing accident rates in 
the past year. However, whilst 
we have reduced our over 
three day accident rates we 
have, disappointingly, seen 
an increase in our total 
recordable accident rate in 
Europe, Middle East and 
Africa. We are committed to 
achieving a zero accident rate.
We are working within all our 
communities as a valued 
member of the community.
Our people
Community
Safety, health and 
the environment
Sustainability highlights
 – Lost time accident rate best ever 
performance and now below UK 
Chemical Industries Association 
average levels
 – Success in our programme of 
energy efficiency work in our 
Malaysian businesses has helped 
to reduce overall energy levels 
per tonne of production
 – Focus on process safety and 
how it is monitored
Our approach
Whilst financial results remain an 
important measure of success, to be a 
truly successful global business, we are 
working hard to continually improve our 
safety, health and environment (SHE) 
performance and how we can positively 
impact our employees and the 
communities in which we operate. 
The Board, Chief Executive and Group 
Executive Committee are fully committed 
to improving our SHE performance and 
engaging and involving all our employees 
in these improvement programmes. 
The three long term goals that underpin 
all our SHE programmes are:
1.  To minimise any environmental burden 
created by our activities;
2. To have no accidents or incidents; and
3.  To have no adverse impact on the 
health of those who work in, or live 
near our operations, nor on the health 
of those who use our products.
Key practices and programmes
The Group have SHE management 
practices and systems throughout the 
Group with the aim of continuously 
improving SHE performance. Some 
of the key practices and systems are:
Key measures, SHE performance 
indicators and SHE audit results are 
reported to the Board, the Group 
Executive and to the regional management 
meetings on a monthly basis.
The Group ‘Core Values’ programme, 
introduced in 2014 has SHE performance 
as the foundation for all the other values.
Our key SHE actions for 2015 and our 
main areas of focus for 2016 are shown 
on the table on page 21.

Streamlined and focused incident 
reporting will be implemented.
SHE training and communication A programme of one to one and small 
group discussions on SHE issues and 
inspections and engineering performance 
has been carried out across the Group:  
‘Line of fire’ awareness meetings have 
been held for all staff to increase 
awareness of how actions can impact 
their own safety and the safety of others.
Process safety training was undertaken 
across all the plants.
Consolidation of process safety and 
line of fire work.
First line manager competence 
assurance framework and programme 
will be developed in 2016.
Alignment of staff incentives The Group 2016 bonus scheme has 
been changed to better reflect the 
importance of safety to our business 
and emphasize how all employees can 
influence safety performance.
The Group publishes an annual 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) report which is available online. 
It discusses a wider range of safety, 
health and environmental measures

 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 21 Our people
Our business is only as good as our 
people, so we must ensure that we 
have the right people with the right 
skills, in the right roles. In 2015, we 
continued to develop our human 
resources strategy with a focus of 
increasing the involvement and 
contribution of our employees across 
the globe. This included improving 
our recruitment processes and 
developing our organisational 
effectiveness through succession 
planning, performance management 
and staff development. Synthomer 
values its ethnic diversity and has many 
policies that nurture and develop this. 
We have an active policy to develop 
the capability in the countries where 
we operate and increase the focus 
on training and development. In 2015, we 
continued to roll out across many parts 
of the Group, both in Europe and Asia, 
operator, maintenance and supervisory 
training based on the European 
acclaimed Cogent Gold Standard 
programme. In the UK, where the training 
has already been implemented, it has 
substantially expanded abilities in 
business improvement, technical 
competence, compliance and life skills.
We have seen our focus on staff wellness, 
health and absence management 
programmes, in 2015, at selected sites in 
Europe help our employee attendance rates.
A large majority of our workforce has 
strong technical capability whether in 
operations, R&D or our commercial 
functions. There is a strong focus on 
meeting and exceeding the needs of 
our customers with active performance 
management objectives and local 
measures supporting this. The 
company is further aligning our staff 
focus and performance through our 
new 2016 revised bonus programme 
which has local site key performance 
measures at its heart.

The Group’s reportable lost time 
accident rate improved in 2015 to give 
Synthomer its best ever performance. 
There were eight over three day 
accidents during the year and as a 
consequence the frequency rate has 
dropped to 0.16 per 100,000 hours 
worked. This rate is more than five 
times better than we achieved in 2000 
and better than the average for the UK 
Chemical Industries Association (CIA) 
member companies.
On a broader basis we also monitor 
and track a recordable accident rate 
for accidents involving more than first 
aid treatment. Regrettably 
performance here worsened during 
2015, with our frequency rate for 
2015 of 0.55 per 100,000 hours 
worked, a 7% increase over 2014.
In line with our commitment to a zero 
accident target, 2015 saw a range of 
activities undertaken to reverse this 
trend. This included roll-out of “Line 
of Fire” training for all employees to 
build awareness and share lessons 
learned, and a three day workshop

Environmental performance
We are proud of the fact that since 
2000 we have reported significant 
reductions, year-on-year, in each of our 
main environmental targets: global 
warming burden; energy and water 
consumption per tonne of production.
The Group can report that, 
notwithstanding a 5% increase in sales 
volumes in the year, our total emissions 
of greenhouse gases (GHGs) reduced 
by 4.9% in 2015. However, despite 
significant progress being made on a 
number of sites in meeting sustainability 
targets, and at Group level a reduction 
being seen in specific energy and water 
consumption per tonne production, 
absolute usage increased slightly 
compared to 2014. The performance 
of each of the measures is discussed 
below. In 2014, we rebased our 10 year 
target to 2005 actual levels for 
reporting purposes.
The Company has set new targets for 
2020 covering reductions in energy, 
water, greenhouse gas emissions and 
waste to landfill.
Hazardous Waste Disposal to Land  
(Tonnes waste per production tonne)
Following a review of our assessment 
methodology some emissions data has 
been restated for 2013 and 2014 with a 
view to more accurately account for 
emissions associated with imported 
steam on several sites. Full details can 
be found on page 26.
Energy
Total net specific energy consumption 
(SEC, i.e. energy use per tonne of 
production) improved in 2015 by 0.6% 
compared with 2014, although absolute 
energy consumption in GJ rose 1.2%, 
relative to an increase in sales volumes 
of 5%.
The increase in consumption at Group 
level was mostly driven by changes to 
the product mix at one of the production 
plants in Marl, Germany, where there was 
an increase in the manufacture of more 
energy intensive high solids SBR latex. 
Against this, there was significant 
improvement seen on a number of sites 
as the benefits of energy benchmarking 
and resulting operational improvements 
were realised. This included reductions 
of around 12% at our NBR latex plant 
in Kluang, Malaysia and a 27% reduction 
in SEC at our dispersions plant in Durban, 
South Africa.

we work towards our 2020 targets.
Water use
Total water consumption per tonne of 
production decreased by 1.3% in 2015, 
improving on the picture from 2014. 
Taking out river water (used for once 
through cooling on a number of sites), 
water usage per tonne reduced by 4.5%. 
Whilst our products contain a significant 
quantity of water, we have managed to 
halve our specific water consumption in 
the past 10 years and the strategy is to 
continue reducing usage of raw water as 
far as practicable. Benchmarking and 
operational improvements saw large 
reductions in consumption at all 
Malaysian sites, including 30% at Kluang. 
A focus for 2016 will be to see 
improvements at our European sites.
Waste disposal
The overall amount of waste generated 
in 2015 fell by 4.5%, and on a per tonne 
production basis by 6.1%. The amount 
sent to landfill rose slightly however, in 
part due to work by sites to clear legacy 
waste. Despite this, we have been able to 
maintain the amount of hazardous waste 
going to landfill substantially below 1kg per 
tonne of production. 
Greenhouse gas emissions
The Company has reported environmental 
KPIs in the format recommended by the 
Department of Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs (Defra) since the annual 
report for 2007. The suggested format 
includes: energy, water waste and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This 
data is available for each year since 2005 
on a three year rolling basis. In 2013 the 
format was revised to comply with 
Defra’s guidance which took account of 
the greenhouse gas emission reporting 
requirements under the Companies Act 
2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013. Internal data 
collection was also revised for the 2013 
financial year to give improved 
compliance with the revised guidance.
Reporting parameters
The 2015 financial year reporting includes 
all manufacturing operations, all office 
locations co-located with manufacturing 
and those listed as contact locations in 
the annual report or on the Group’s 
website. It does not include some very 
small locations such as home offices. 
These locations will have no material 
effect on the Group’s overall GHG 
emissions, being estimated at considerably 
less than 0.1% of the Group total.
All known emissions from manufacturing 
processes have been included, specifically 
energy directly used and the indirect 
energy costs of heating, cooling and 
other site services where these are 
provided by a third party. They include 
estimates for the effects of the release of 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 
refrigerant gases. The only known 
emissions which have not been included 
are direct emissions of CO
2
 from on-site 
waste treatment that have not currently 
been quantified.
The Group has no known uses or 
releases of perfluorocarbons or sulphur 
hexafluoride. All releases of nitrous oxide 
or methane are associated with energy 
production and are not separately 
quantified. The Group continues to report 
scope 1 & 2 emissions. No estimate has 
been made of scope 3 emissions. The 
Group continues to use emissions per 
production tonne as its intensity ratio. 
The data source for all emissions factors 
(CO
2
e) are those from Defra: 2015 data 
is based on v2 of the dataset for 2015 
reporting published in June 2015.

Calculation methods
All direct energy production from fossil 
fuels has been aggregated on a group 
wide basis and converted to CO
2
e by 
using the appropriate Defra emissions 
factors. No allowance has been made 
for possible country to country variation 
in calorific value or CO
2
 emission factors. 
Electricity has been converted to CO
2
e 
on a country by country basis, using the 
conversion factors given by Defra for 
2015 and previous years. (It should be 
noted that these generally refer to actual 
country performance two years earlier 
than the quoted date, i.e. 2015 factors 
relate to 2013 performance.)
A number of sites within the Group now 
purchase certified “Green” electricity. 
Electricity for these locations has been 
given a CO
2
e emissions factor of 0.00 in 
calculating energy related emissions 
totals. Sites receiving green electricity for 
all of 2015 were Oss in the Netherlands, 
and Marl in Germany. The Ossett site in 
the UK received certified green energy 
as of March 2015. This proportion of the 
site’s energy use has also been given an 
emission factor of 0.00.
Synthomer’s site in Stallingborough, 
UK takes most of its electricity from an 
exclusive contract with an adjacent 
waste incinerator operated by Newlincs. 
This electricity is certified as “Green” 
by the UK government. As a consumer of a 
mixture of waste deemed both renewable 
and non-renewable, it does not have a zero 
emission factor. For 2015 the applied 
emission factor is based on that determined 
for the site’s Climate Change Agreement 
(CCA) reporting of around 0.50 kg CO
2
e per 
kWh, and this figure has been used for the 
proportion of Stallingborough’s electricity 
which comes from the incinerator – note 
that work is ongoing to validate the factors 
applied. The site is also provided with 
indirect heating in the form of hot water 
from Newlincs.
VOCs have been aggregated on a Group 
basis and converted to CO
2
e using a 
factor of 11. This figure has been used 
by UK CIA member companies since 
2005 and is at the upper end of the 
range for VOCs. Information on the 
release of refrigerant gases has been 
collected for 2011-2015. The releases for 
each individual gas has been aggregated 
in each year to give a group release 
and then converted to CO
2
e using 
the equivalence factors given by Defra 
for each gas. The emissions factors 
applicable to refrigerant release in 2015 
have been updated in line with Defra’s 
adoption of the Global Warming Potential 
(GWP) factors from the IPCC 4th 
assessment report.
Performance in 2015
Although we saw only small reductions 
in our specific energy and water 
consumption, the Group reduced its 
overall emissions of greenhouse gases by 
4.9% in 2015, and its emissions on a per 
tonne basis by 6.5%, to give the Group’s 
best ever performance. The inclusion of 
refrigerant gases and the calculation of 
CO
2
e for electricity on a country-by-
country basis from 2013 had a significant 
adverse impact on the Group’s calculated 
greenhouse gas emissions at that point. 
However, in 2015 the Group achieved a 
further significant reduction of 54% in the 
global warming impact of refrigerant gas 
losses through better plant management, 
and we look to continue this trend.
The changes in the emissions factors for 
electricity generation in different countries 
also have a significant adverse impact 
over which the Group has no control. 
This year, the emission factor for Malaysia 
increased by 11.4% compared to 2014, 
offsetting the reduction of 3.2% seen 
in Germany and 1.5% seen in the UK. 
Emissions factors in Malaysia are over 
50% higher per unit of electricity than in 
Europe. Following significant reductions 
in VOC emissions in 2013 and 2014 as 
new recovery systems and waste gas 
boilers came on-line, 2015 saw a slight 
worsening owing to operational problems 
at the Harlow site where a cryogenic VOC 
recovery unit is in place. However, GHG 
equivalent losses related to VOCs are still 
over 80% lower than in 2012. 
The combined effect of the Group’s 
efforts produced an absolute reduction 
of just over 10,000 tonnes (expressed 
as CO
2
 equivalent) in the Group’s 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, 
again relative to an increase in volumes 
produced which were up 5%.

26 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Environmental KPIs
The table present environmental KPIs for 2013-15, with a coverage and format in-line with Defra’s 2013 guidance, to comply with 
the reporting required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013.
Notes
1.  Data relates to site usage of all fuels, excluding transport of goods to and from site and the movement of these transport vehicles on site. 
Internal transport on site is included.
2.  Emissions to air have been calculated from the usage of all fuels, excluding transport fuel. They therefore include both direct emissions and indirect 
emissions related to bought-in electricity, steam, compressed air, cooling water etc., with the exception of transmission and distribution losses for 
electricity (These losses are in Scope 3, this report is for Scope 1 & 2). 
3.  C O
2
 equivalent emissions include contributions from CH
4
 and N
2
O associated with combustion.
4.  NOx emissions are predominantly those from combustion processes. The CO
2
 equivalent Global Warming Potential contribution from these releases 
is already included in the CO
2
 from energy figure above.
5.  The total CO
2
e figure is the total of the CO
2
 equivalent from energy + the VOC contribution (assuming an average factor of 11 kg CO
2
e per kg VOC) 
+ the refrigerant contribution.
6.  Percentage changes are calculated from the base data and may differ slightly from changes calculated from the data in the tables because of rounding.
7.  Gas consumption data has been restated to reflect previous incorrect inclusion of hot water in 2013 and 2014 – that energy is still included in the total 
consumption figures quoted.
8 .  C O
2
e emissions for energy have been revised to more accurately reflect emissions linked to steam usage – heat and steam emissions factors from 
Defra have been used for imported steam at our German and Finnish sites.

Risk management
Risk objectives 
The Board is responsible for determining 
the nature and extent of the risks it is 
willing to take in delivering Synthomer’s 
strategic objectives. Synthomer undertakes 
risk management to improve the 
resilience, performance, sustainability 
and success of its business, whilst in turn 
facilitating decisions and providing useful 
information to shareholders. 
Risk strategy 
The Board is responsible for creating 
the framework for the Group’s risk 
management to operate effectively. This 
risk management framework includes risk 
assessment, response, communication 
and governance. The Board is also 
responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
and proportionate resources are allocated 
to risk management activities.
Our risk management framework
We have a structured risk management 
framework throughout the Group. This 
includes a standard set of risk categories, 
generic risk descriptions and a scoring 
methodology, together with a process 
to analyse and manage risk. All our 
locations use this framework to identify 
and document their specific risks. 
We rank risks by combining their 
economic, operational or environmental 
impact and the likelihood that they may 
occur. We do this both before and after 
we identify the controls we have in place 
to mitigate each risk. Those risks that 
pose the greatest threat to our Business 
and score the highest, pre-mitigation, are 
identified as key risks. All our people are 
responsible for managing risk. By using a 
common framework, we are able to view 
risk from both a top-down and bottom-up 
perspective and so ensure it is 
considered and managed at every level  
of our Business. Our safety, health, and 
environmental (SHE) risks are reviewed 
and considered monthly by  
our Executive committee. 
Our key risks
Risks affect every area of our business. 
Their nature and potential impact changes 
constantly but through our regular reviews 
we identify risks that could impact our 
strategy and allow us to set up controls to 
mitigate their effects. We categorise our 
risks into the following areas: 
 – Strategic risks that could prevent us 
from achieving our strategic objectives. 
 – Operational risks which, if not 
successfully managed, would threaten 
our viability. These relate to our ability to 
operate a sustainable and safe business.
 – Financial risks relating to the funding 
and fiscal security of the Group.
 – Compliance risks which could affect 
our compliance with regulations and 
law, and/or our ‘licence to operate’ 
in society.
The table on pages 30 to 33 shows 
the key risks identified in 2015. Our Board 
and management carry out a robust 
assessment of these principle risks 
including those that would impact our 
business model, future performance, 
solvancy and liquidity. We do, of course, 
face other risks and uncertainties, but 
these have been assessed as lower risk, 
and so are not included here, or are 
beyond the direct control of the Group. All 
risks (current and emerging) are reviewed 
regularly by the Board and the Executive 
Committee: if their possible impact or 
likelihood increases, they will be reclassified 
as a key risk. Our risk management 
programme can only provide reasonable, 
not absolute, assurance that key risks are 
managed to an acceptable level.

Conditions in the global economy, economic fluctuations in 
customer industries and volatility and cyclicality of the global 
chemicals and polymers markets may adversely affect the 
results of the Group.
The Group maintains a balanced portfolio of products serving 
a wide range of end markets around the globe. Segment 
performance at business unit level is closely monitored and 
corrective actions are taken as necessary. 
The markets in which the Group operates are highly 
competitive and the Group may lose market share to other 
producers of speciality chemicals or to other products that 
can be substituted for the products of the Group.
The Group continues to invest in existing and new products 
through R&D. 
The Group continues to invest in new facilities to allow the 
Group to maintain its key market positions. 
All sites operate quality management systems, such as ISO, 
to ensure products meet customers’ agreed standards.
The Group’s strategic plan involves significant change 
management, including the identification and conversion of 
acquisition targets to enhance market positions and provide 
new technologies.
Strategic projects are managed in a structured framework 
which includes formal identification of risks. The Executive 
Committee has extensive experience of change management 
and making use of external specialist advice as required.
The ability of the Group to compete is highly dependent on  
its ability to develop technological innovations, to introduce 
new products and to protect its intellectual property, trade 
secrets and know-how.
The Group continues to invest in existing and new 
technologies through R&D. As part of the Group’s strategic 
planning process it identifies and converts acquisition 
targets to enhance its market positions and provide 
new technologies.
The Group protects its intellectual property through the use 
of patents.
The ongoing success of the Group is dependent on attracting 
and retaining high quality senior management and staff who 
can effectively manage the Group’s operations.
The Group offers competitive compensation packages with 
annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements for key 
employees. Appropriate notice periods and non-compete 
clauses are used to mitigate short-term risk for key positions. 
The Group maintains a succession plan for key positions.
As a substantial multi-national enterprise, the Group could 
suffer losses of intellectual property and other assets through 
theft or fraud which could be significant.
The Group maintains controls both to detect and prevent 
theft and fraud as appropriate to the nature of the risk.
The Group’s strategic objectives can only be achieved if certain risks are taken and 
managed effectively. We have listed below the key risks that may affect our business, 
although there are other risks that may occur and impact the Group’s performance
30 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Operational risk
Operational risks Strategy for risk management
The failure of the Group to procure key raw materials may 
lead to production interruptions, and volatility in the prices of 
such raw materials and energy prices may adversely affect 
the profitability of the Group and its working capital position.
Sourcing strategies are in place Group-wide to access 
multiple sources for key raw materials and the Group works 
closely with key suppliers to ensure availability. The Group  
looks to identify alternative raw materials where possible.
The Group actively manages margins and recovers input cost 
increases from customers.
The manufacture, storage and transportation of chemicals 
is inherently dangerous and any incidents relating to the 
hazards which the Group faces may adversely impact its 
financial condition, results of operations and reputation.
Robust maintenance programmes are undertaken in 
order to ensure that our facilities meet Group and local 
legal requirements.
Synthomer operates a central internal audit function 
dedicated to SHE issues and programmes for continuous 
improvement across all major SHE areas Group-wide.
The failure or loss of a key production asset, process, 
information or communication system, whether temporarily 
or permanently could occur, directly or otherwise, through 
natural disasters, epidemic, industrial action, sabotage or 
the like, and would have an adverse impact on operations.
Crisis management procedures are in place for all sites. 
These are reviewed and updated regularly.
The Group invests in its infrastructure to ensure appropriate  
levels of resilience in the event of temporary failures in IT 
systems. Backups and disaster recovery plans are in place 
for critical systems and processes.

The Group may be liable for damages based on 
product liability claims brought against its customers  
in end-use markets.
Technically qualified personnel and control systems 
are in place around the Group to ensure products meet  
certification standards.
Synthomer has Group-wide product liability insurance 
which provides £50 million of cover.
Compliance with extensive environmental, health and safety 
laws and regulations could require material expenditure, 
changes in the operations of the Group or site remediation.
Detailed safety, health and environmental processes are 
documented in operating guidance which is updated and 
communicated to staff on a regular basis.
The Group could suffer substantial penalties, damage to 
reputation and other sanctions for any failure to control 
anti-competitive behaviour, such as bribery and corruption, 
or ineffective compliance with local and national legislation.
All our key employees affirm their understanding of the code 
of business conduct covering corrupt and anti-competitive 
business practices. Malpractice reporting and whistleblowing 
protection are similarly covered in the Group policy on 
protecting our reputation. Training is provided regularly.
Financial risks Strategy for risk management
As a significant proportion of the Group’s turnover and assets 
are in currencies other than UK sterling and fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates may significantly impact the results 
of the Group and may significantly affect the comparability 
of financial results between financial periods.
The Group has a policy of hedging all significant foreign 
exchange transactional exposure at operating company level.
The impact of translation on the results of the business is  
clearly explained to stakeholders through the use of constant 
currency reporting.
The Group’s balance sheet and cash flow, and also credit 
market conditions and credit ratings, may restrict the ability  
of the Group to obtain credit facilities or to refinance its 
existing debt facilities in the longer term. In addition, 
interest rate fluctuations and increases in bank lending 
margins may increase the Group’s costs of borrowing.
The Group closely monitors its operating cash flow and 
capital expenditure on a monthly basis and regularly reviews 
covenant compliance. 
The Group has a policy on leverage limits and has adequate 
headroom on a twelve month forecast basis.
Interest rate risk is managed through the use of interest 
rate hedging.
Financial risk
32 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Financial risk continued
Financial risks Strategy for risk management
The Group has funding risks relating to defined benefit 
pension schemes. Any deterioration in the value of assets 
in which the pension schemes have invested as against the 
financial obligations of the schemes could have an adverse 
impact on the Group.
The UK scheme was closed to future accrual during 2009. 
The funding risks are mitigated by paying appropriate 
contributions into the funds and through balanced investment 
strategies designed to avoid a material deterioration in the 
funding of the schemes. 
Overseas pension schemes are reviewed annually by an 
actuary to ensure appropriate contributions are made and 
that liabilities are recognised appropriately.
The Group is placing greater emphasis on its merger and 
acquisition strategy to drive the growth in the performance of 
the Group, including expanding the target search to adjacent 
speciality chemical businesses. M&A activity exposes the 
Group to specific transaction risks including paying too high a 
price, failure to complete a successful integration or to secure 
the synergies offered by the transaction, performance issues 
or funding issues.
The Group has recruited a number of senior executives with 
significant Chemicals M&A experience to lead the M&A and 
integration activity.
The Group works with experienced M&A consultants and 
banks to perform appropriate due diligence on the target,  
and to coordinate appropriate financing facilities. 
Viability statement
In accordance with the provision of 
section C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a five-year period to 
December 2020, being the period 
covered by the Group’s approved 
strategic plan. The Group strategic plan, 
which is updated annually, includes 
analysis of product and profit performance, 
cash flow, investment programmes and 
returns to shareholders.
The Board considers five years to be an 
appropriate time horizon for our strategic 
plan, being the period over which the 
Group actively focuses on its product 
development and investment pipelines. 
Due to the nature of our business, a 
period greater than five years is 
considered too long given the inherent 
uncertainties involved.
In making their assessment, the Directors 
have considered the Group’s current 
strong financial position and undertaken 
a comprehensive sensitivity analysis over 
the key trading assumptions combined 
with the potential impact of crystallisation 
of one or more of the principal risks 
(detailed on pages 30 to 33) over the 
five year period. The risks have been 
assessed for their potential impact on the 
Group’s business model, future trading 
and funding structure. The range of 
scenarios tested was carefully considered 
by the Directors, balancing the potential 
impact with the probability of occurrence 
and the effectiveness of our business to 
take mitigating steps. 
Whilst each of the principal risks has a 
potential impact, the sensitivity analysis 
has been focused on the critical 
economic, operational and financial risks 
where risk mitigation plans will have less 
impact in the shorter term. In addition to 
the risk mitigation plans, the Group’s 
global footprint reduces the impact of 
specific regional economic issues.
In completing the viability assessment, 
the Directors considered the Group’s 
ability to refinance our current debt, raise 
new finance and complete our investment 
plans during the review period. 
Based on the results of this analysis, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation, 
predicated on the assumption that an 
unforeseen event outside of the Group’s 
control (for example, an event of nature or 
terror) does not inhibit the Group’s ability 
to manufacture for a sustained period, 
that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the five year period.

34 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Highlights
 – Resilient operating performance 
when taking into account adverse 
currency £6.0m and constant 
bonus charge £6.9m
 – Volumes increased by 3%  
with underlying paper volumes 
down by 4% whilst other markets 
grew by 1%
 – Synthomer 2015 programme 
delivered annualised cost  
savings of €7m per annum 
at December 2015
In overall terms, the operating profit of 
our Europe and North America segment 
at £73.3m (2014: £85.7m) has remained 
stable relative to 2014 taking into account 
the adverse translation impact caused by 
weakness in the Euro of £6.0m and the 
impact of higher group-wide employee 
bonuses which amounted to £6.9m 
in this record year for the Group. 
Our ENA segment has continued to 
experience flat market conditions – 
broadly in-line with the European 
economy. Reported volumes increased 
from 794.3ktes to 820.7ktes, an increase 
of 3.3%. The increase in volumes reflects 
our acquisition of the remaining 50% 
shares in Synthomer Finland Oy in 
October 2014, which contributed 
additional volumes of circa 35ktes during 
2015. With the exception of paper 
volumes which decreased by 4%, overall 
volumes in other markets have increased 
by 1%. We saw better volumes in the 
second half of the year relative to the 
weaker prior year period, which was 
impacted by the falling raw material price 
environment in Q4 2014. 
Sales fell 15.3% in 2015 to £582.1m 
(2014: £687.2m). Whilst total volumes 
have increased year-on-year, the sterling 
selling price per unit has fallen mainly 
reflecting the weakness in the Euro and 
lower raw material prices due to the 
reduced price of Brent crude oil.
As reported during the year, falling raw 
material prices generally have a modest 
favourable impact on our margins as 
there is a lag effect in our formulae-based 
pricing on passing the benefits of falling 
prices on to our customers. Similarly, 
when raw material prices are rising, there 
is a modest adverse impact on our 
margins. Whilst Q1 margins benefited 
from rapid decline in raw material prices 
at the end of 2014, raw material prices 
softened gradually during 2015 with no 
pronounced benefit or cost in subsequent 
quarters. Overall unit margins have been 
generally higher throughout the year, 
with the average unit margin up circa 2% 
relative to 2014, albeit margins in our 
paper business remain under pressure 
and were lower year-on-year, with higher 
unit margins being achieved across most 
other businesses. 
In 2015 we launched a cost review 
programme across our business in 
Europe. This initiative targeted the 
production costs in our main European 
plants with the aim of making our plants 
more efficient, and reducing raw material 
and energy usage. This resulted in 
annualised production cost savings 
in 2015 of €7m. We have a number 
of projects ongoing and we expect to 
achieve annualised savings of €13m 
by the end of 2016.

 – Volumes increased by 8.6%,  
with strong growth in health and 
protection, and construction and 
coatings markets
 – Exceptional operating 
performance up 127.5% at 
£40.5m, or up 175.8% at £49.1m 
when taking account of adverse 
currency £4.3m and constant 
bonus charge £4.3m
In overall terms, our ARW segment 
gained momentum during the course of 
the year, principally driven by our 
Malaysian nitrile butadiene rubber 
business. This business continued to 
benefit from the investment in innovation 
and capacity made in 2013 and 2014, 
enabling it to capture stronger margins as 
the supply demand balance tightened 
during the year, continuing the trend seen 
at the end of 2014. Our dispersions 
activities, which focus on the construction 
and coatings end markets, also had a 
good year in our geographical areas, 
Malaysia, Middle East and Africa. 
Underlying operating profit increased 
from £17.8m in 2014 to £40.5m, an 
increase of 128%, or 176% when adjusted 
for constant currency and the higher 
bonuses paid to our employees. 
Total segment sales volumes have 
increased from 396.5ktes in 2014 to 
430.5ktes in 2015, a rise of 9%. The rise 
in volumes was underpinned by a rise 
in our nitrile butadiene rubber volumes 
which increased by 11%, and a 5% rise 
in our dispersions volumes. These higher 
volumes underscore the importance to 
the Group in both investing in innovation 
and capacity in the emerging markets 
where global mega-trends are strongest. 
Demand remained high throughout the 
year and volumes in both businesses 
were ahead of the prior year in all 
quarters. The only exception was in our 
nitrile butadiene rubber business which 
was slightly down in Q4 as a result of an 
interruption in the gas supply to our Pasir 
Gudang site, causing a temporary 
production outage. 
Margins in the ARW segment also 
strengthened, heavily influenced by the 
supply demand dynamics in our 
Malaysian nitrile butadiene rubber 
business supplying the health and 
protection markets. The tightness of the 
market supply demand balance, together 
with falling raw material prices, provided a 
positive business environment in which to 
grow our unit margins. 
We launched the Synthomer 6330 and 
6338 products in Malaysia in 2015. These 
new products are designed for the 
manufacture of ultra-thin protective gloves 
that provide maximum sensitivity and 
reduced nitrile butadiene rubber weight 
per glove. This gives Malaysian glove 
manufacturers – representing more than 
two-thirds of the global market in surgical 
gloves – access to the latest advances in 
our nitrile butadiene rubber technology 
and thus a competitive advantage. We 
are expecting continued growth in the 
health and protection market with 
demand for nitrile butadiene rubber 
therefore growing. Synthomer is investing 
further in innovation and capacity in this 
market to continue to maintain our 
position as a market leader. Our 
investment in innovation is looking 
to create the next generation of nitrile 
butadiene rubber through the introduction 
of enhanced medical properties into the 
latex mix. Our investment in capacity in 
Pasir Gudang will result in a further 2 
world scale reactors being placed on the 
site, expanding the production capacity 
by approximately 40% whilst driving 
efficient capital expenditure through 
utilising the existing site infrastructure 
in steam, power and logistics. 
In March 2015, we announced the 
expansion of our Kluang plant to produce 
a range of speciality polymer products for 
foam and construction applications. We 
began shipping products to customers 
during Q3 2015 and sales are in-line with 
expectations. 
In our Saudi Arabian joint venture facility 
in Dammam, we made good progress 
during the first half of the year and started 
to fill the additional capacity created 
following the 2014 expansion of the plant 
to 100ktes. However, the continued fall in 
the oil price over 2015, together with war 
and political tensions in the region, has 
slowed the rate of economic growth and 
accordingly has caused a modest 
softening in demand during the last 
quarter of the year. We are expecting a 
lower level of economic activity in the 
region in the near term, but we remain 
confident of further opportunities for 
business development in the region and 
we are working with our Saudi Arabian 
partner to develop our Middle East 
specialist chemical market both 
organically and through acquisitions.
We took the opportunity during the year 
to strengthen our team and systems in 
Malaysia with the recruitment of an 
experienced Operations Director and a 
new Technical Director to support both 
our customer requirements and our 
continued R&D development in the 
region. Also, during 2015, we invested in 
our IT systems with the successful 
implementation of our Group SAP system 
across our Malaysian business. 
Looking ahead, the ARW segment results 
will be influenced by our Malaysian nitrile 
butadiene rubber business. Whilst we are 
confident in our strategy to capture the 
strong growth in demand from the nitrile 
glove manufacturers in 2016 and beyond, 
we are aware of planned nitrile capacity 
expansion in 2016 and 2017, including the 
Synthomer expansion of 120ktes 
expected on line in Q2 2017. We expect 
this planned increase in capacity to 
impact the supply/demand balance 
during the second half of 2016, leading to 
similar overall volumes and margins in our 
nitrile butadiene rubber business to those 
achieved in 2015.

 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 37 Financial review
2015 financial performance
Stephen Bennett
Chief Financial Officer
 “ A record set of results, both in terms  
of profitability and cash flow, and a 
sound foundation from which to  
invest and grow our business.”
38 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Overview
Synthomer has delivered a record set of 
results in 2015, with underlying profit 
before tax at £95.3m the highest reported 
by the Group, and an increase of 10.8% 
on the prior year. 
The increase over the prior year is 
higher still at constant currency. The 
depreciation of the Euro and Malaysian 
Ringgit, had the impact of reducing profit 
before tax by £10.3m. The significantly 
higher £12.5m employee bonus accruals 
in this record year also had an effect. 
Adjusting the reported underlying profit 
before tax of £95.3m for both constant 
currency and the differential in year-on-
year employee bonus accruals, would 
result in a like-for-like profit before tax 
of £118.1m, an increase of 37.3% on 
the prior year.
Cash flow before financing at £84.4m 
(2014: £49.6m) was also a record high for 
Synthomer, mainly benefiting from higher 
earnings and lower working capital, partly 
as a result of lower raw material prices.
Income statement
Sales, operating profit and profit  
before tax – underlying performance
Sales volumes were 5.0% higher in the 
year rising from 1,191ktes in 2014 to 
1,251ktes in 2015. The increase in volumes 
reflected growth across both the Europe 
and North America (ENA) and Asia and 
Rest of World (ARW) segments, and also 
across all strategic business units. The 
ENA segment (and the paper business 
unit) benefited from the inclusion of 100% 
of the volumes of Synthomer Finland Oy in 
2015 (2014: 50% to September 2014), 
contributing circa 35ktes of growth 
year-on-year. 
Total sales value reduced by 9.7% to 
£894.0m (2014: £990.5m), with the 
impact of the rise in sales volumes being 
offset by both the depreciation in the 
Euro during 2015 and a fall in raw 
material prices. 
Group operating profit was 6.6% higher 
at £102.9m (2014: £96.5m). The rise in 
operating profit was underpinned by the 
excellent performance of our ARW 
segment, where both our nitrile butadiene 
rubber (NBR) and our dispersions 
business had very good results, more 
than offsetting the adverse impact of the 
weaker Euro on the translation of the 
performance of our ENA segment, and 
the higher employee bonus costs referred 
to above.
With finance costs lower at £7.6m (2014: 
£10.5m), benefiting from the strong cash 
generation and lower interest rate in the 
year, partly reflecting the repayment of 
$70m private placement borrowings in 
September 2014, the Group profit before 
tax was £95.3m (2014: £86.0m).
Tax and Earnings per Share –  
underlying performance
The Group’s underlying tax rate of 22.0% 
(2014: 21.4%) remains low. The low rate 
relative to the blended statutory tax rates 
in our principal operating territories of the 
UK, Germany and Malaysia reflects the 
specific tax attributes of the Group in 
Malaysia, where the benefits of pioneer 
status (extended tax holiday) on one of 
our businesses mitigates the tax cost, 
and in the UK where our businesses 
benefit from a zero tax rate as a 
consequence of brought forward tax 
losses, and the ongoing cash contributions 
to the defined benefit pension scheme 
which are deductible for tax.
Underlying profit attributable to non-
controlling interests, principally relating to 
minority interests in Malaysia, was £1.2m 
(2014: £1.4m).
The underlying earnings per share for the 
year was 21.5p an increase of 10.3% over 
2014’s figure of 19.5p per share.
Special items and IFRS
The Group reports its financial results 
according to International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, to 
provide a clearer indication of the Group’s 
underlying performance, a number of 
special items are split out and shown in 
a separate column of the consolidated 
income statement due to their one-off or 
non-economic nature, and are excluded 
from the comments on underlying 
performance above and throughout 
the Chief Executive Officer’s Report 
and Segmental Reports of business 
performance. 
For the purposes of defining underlying 
performance, the special items split 
out comprise:
 – Restructuring costs of £5.4m (2014: 
£4.5m) are mainly associated with the 
‘Synthomer 2015’ European Project. 
There will be some additional costs 
associated with this Project during 
2016 with the total cost for the project 
expected to be £10m. The Malaysian 
land sales profit of £6.5m (2014: £nil) 
is also included in special items.
 – Various cross-currency and interest 
rate swaps for hedging purposes. 
IFRS requires that where the strict 
requirements of IAS 39 are not met, 
changes in the market value should 
be recognised annually in the income 
statement. However, such financial 
instruments are maintained by the 
Group for the length of the contract 
and  over their lifetime have a fair 
value of nil. Hence the notional annual 
adjustment, a loss of £0.2m (2014: 
£0.8m loss) has been segregated 
from the underlying performance.

Other information
 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 39 Financial review continued
 – Amortisation of intangibles of £23.7m 
(2014: £27.0m). IFRS acquisition 
accounting requires an explicit number 
to be placed on certain intangibles and 
amortised through the consolidated 
income statement, with the balance of 
the excess of the purchase price over the 
physical assets being carried as goodwill, 
which is subject to annual impairment 
testing. The amortisation expense arising 
from this has been treated as a special 
item and will continue to be so treated 
until the associated intangible assets 
have been fully amortised. 
After deducting special items from 
underlying performance, the IFRS profit 
before tax was £72.5m (2014: £53.8m) 
and earnings per share was 17.8p 
(2014: 13.3p).
Dividend
The Board has recommended an 
increased final ordinary dividend per 
share of 5.4p which, with the interim 
ordinary dividend per share of 3.2p, 
brings the total ordinary dividend per 
share to 8.6p. This is 2.5 times covered 
(2014: 2.5 times).
The Board is committed to supporting 
the investing for growth strategy and 
accordingly is not proposing a further 
return of capital to the shareholders at 
the current time (2014 special dividend: 
7.8p per share).
Balance sheet
Goodwill decreased to £222.4m at the 
end of 2015 from £232.8m at the end 
of 2014 due to the foreign currency 
depreciation of both the Euro and 
Malaysian Ringgit and the consequent 
impact on the translation of the goodwill.
Acquired intangible assets decreased to 
£50.9m at 31 December 2015 compared 
to £80.7m at the prior year end. This 
reduction reflected the annual amortisation 
charge of £23.7m reported in special 
items, and also currency depreciation 
impact on translation referred to above.
The net book value of property, plant 
and equipment reduced to £186.4m 
at 31 December 2015 compared to 
£205.4m at 31 December 2014. The 
reduction, mainly reflected the net effect 
of capital additions and the depreciation 
charge during the year, amounting to 
£22. 1m and £21.8m respectively, and the 
currency depreciation impact on the 
translation of the property, plant and 
equipment.
In relation to the Malaysian land sales, 
the Group received further payments 
during the year of £6.8m. The remaining 
net proceeds amounting to approximately 
MYR180m is expected during the first half 
of 2016. These proceeds have been 
hedged at rates varying between 
MYR6.06-6.25 resulting in expected 
sterling proceeds of approximately £30m. 
We continue to seek a buyer for the 
remaining 440 acres, approximately one 
quarter of the total land originally offered 
for sale.
The deferred tax liability has decreased 
to £30m at December 2015 from £35.5m 
at December 2014, mainly due to the 
amortisation of intangible assets and also 
as a result of currency depreciation. 
Provisions for other liabilities and charges 
has increased to £10.7m (2014: £6.5m).
Pensions 
The UK defined benefit pension scheme 
was closed to future accrual during 2009 
and there are no active members in the 
scheme. At 31 December 2015, the 
scheme had assets and liabilities of 
£279.4m and £356.5m respectively 
resulting in an overall pension deficit of 
£77.1m (2014: £83.8m). There has been 
no substantive change in the investment 
strategy of the scheme assets with 
approximately 50% of the assets 
continuing to be held in equities. The 
reduction in the pension deficit is mainly 
driven by the cash contributions paid to 
the scheme during the year. 
The Group agreed a UK defined benefit 
scheme deficit recovery plan with the 
Trustees at the time of the 2012 scheme 
valuation. The recovery plan, which 
required the Group to pay cash 
contributions to the scheme, was 
designed to eliminate the scheme deficit 
over a 10 year period. In accordance with 
the agreed deficit recovery plan, the 
Group paid cash contributions of £10.8m 
to the scheme during 2015 (2014: £9.2m), 
and under the current recovery plan is 
expected to pay a further £13.9m during 
2016. The scheme triennial valuation 
effective 5 April 2015 is currently in 
progress and changes to the deficit 
recovery plan, if any, must be agreed with 
the scheme Trustees before July 2016. 
Overseas net pension liabilities decreased 
to £62.1m (2014: £66.9m).
40 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Cash flow
The cash flow statement is set out on 
page 79. The Group has had a record 
year generating a cash flow before 
financing of £84.4m (2014: £49.6m).
Cash generated from operations was 
£115.6m, some £26.5m higher than the 
prior year. The significant rise in cash 
from operations mainly reflected the 
higher operating profit up £15.5m and 
lower cash flows invested in working 
capital of £18.9m. 
Although the net cash outflow from 
investing activities at £12.4m (2014: 
£14.6m) was relatively stable, there were 
a number of different and offsetting 
features in 2015 in comparison to 2014. 
In 2015, the level of cash invested in 
purchasing plant was £0.8m higher at 
£22.8m, but this was offset by £6.8m the 
Group received from the sale of the 
Malaysian land. Capital expenditure in 
2016 is expected to rise by approximately 
£10m. In 2014, the Group purchased 
the remaining 50% of the shares of 
Synthomer Finland Oy, and paid £3.9m, 
but also received the £6.1m ($10m) final 
balance due from the sale of the Pharma 
Chemicals business.
The Group paid dividends totaling £53.7m 
during 2015 (2014: £22.4m) comprising 
the 2014 Final Ordinary Dividend of 4.8p 
per share (£16.3m), the 2014 Special 
Ordinary Dividend of 7.8p per share 
(£26.5m) and the 2015 Interim Ordinary 
Dividend of 3.2p per share (£10.9m).
Financing and liquidity
The underlying net borrowing position of 
the Group at 31 December 2015 was 
£77.4m and comprised net borrowing of 
£85.9m and net cash balances of £8.5m. 
The Group’s £210m committed loan 
facility maturing July 2019 had £135m 
undrawn at the end of the year.
The US private placements £14.9m 
($22.0m) is repayable on 2 September 
2016. Net of derivatives associated with 
this, and maturing at the same time, this 
is equivalent to a repayment of £12.2m.
The Group’s underlying net borrowings to 
EBITDA, the Group’s key leverage metric, 
at 31 December 2015 was 0.6 times 
(2014: 1.0 times). 
The Board remains committed to the 
Capital Policy introduced during 2014. 
In the event that the key leverage metric 
remains sustainably below 1.0 times, 
and there is no significant growth capital 
expenditure or acquisition to fund, the 
Board will look to maintain an efficient 
balance sheet and return surplus capital 
to shareholders. The Board is mindful of 
the ambitious growth strategy of the 
Group, and accordingly is not proposing 
a further return of capital to shareholders 
at the current time.

Letter from the Chairman
Neil Johnson
Chairman
 “ Our commitment to a focused and 
proportionate governance framework 
underpins the way the Board operates 
and is integral to the success of 
the Group.”
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the report on the 
corporate governance work undertaken 
by your Board and its Committees in 
2015. As noted in my statement at the 
front of this Annual Report, your Board 
is committed to a focused and 
proportionate governance framework 
which underpins and is an integral part of 
the way we operate and grow the Group. 
We started 2015 and continued 
throughout the year in full compliance 
with the September 2014 revision of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. During 
the year we were pleased to expand the 
experience and diversity of your Board 
with the appointment of Caroline 
Johnstone as an independent non-
executive director and Chair of the Audit 
Committee. Following the externally 
facilitated Board and Committee 
evaluation process carried out in 2014, 
I have overseen the implementation of 
improvements in boardroom dynamics 
and culture, the effectiveness of which 
has been confirmed by the internal 
evaluation carried out for 2015. 
The work of the Nomination Committee, 
which I also chair, in successfully 
completing the recruitment required to fill 
the vacancies arising during the year from 
the retirement from the Board of David 
Blackwood as Chief Financial Officer and 
Jez Maiden as our Senior Independent 
director and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, has been reported on in my 
Chairman’s statement. The Nomination 
Committee has also overseen the 
significant strengthening of the Group’s 
succession planning processes in 
recognition of their vital role in 
contributing to the long-term success 
of the Company. 
Our full compliance report for 2015 
which sets out in detail our corporate 
governance arrangements and how they 
operated during the year is set out on the 
following pages.
Neil Johnson
Chairman
1 March 2016
44 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Statement of compliance
The Company considers that it has 
complied throughout the financial year 
ended 31 December 2015 with the 
provisions set out in the September 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
(‘the Code’)*.
Application of the Code
The main principles of the Code were 
applied as follows:
Leadership and effectiveness
Operation of the Board
The activities of the Company are 
controlled by the Board which, during 
2015, comprised two executive directors 
and seven non-executive directors. The 
roles of Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer are clearly divided between 
Mr N A Johnson who heads the Board 
in his capacity as non-executive 
Chairman and Mr C G MacLean who 
has responsibility for the running of the 
Company’s business as Chief Executive 
Officer. The non-executive directors all 
have wide business and boardroom 
experience gained in a broad range 
of business sectors.
The Board has reserved to itself a 
schedule of matters which includes 
setting long-term objectives for the 
Group and the strategies to be employed 
in achieving them, setting policies in the 
areas of safety, health and the environment, 
recruitment and employment, risk 
management and treasury and, subject 
to materiality thresholds, decisions on the 
raising of capital, financial commitments, 
capital expenditure, acquisitions and 
disposals and the prosecution, defence 
and settlement of litigation.
During 2015 the Board held six scheduled 
meetings to review current and projected 
performance and to determine strategic 
issues with a half day dedicated to an 
annual strategy development review. 
The directors receive in advance full 
information on all matters to be discussed 
at Board meetings as well as a detailed 
review of performance prepared by the 
Chief Executive Officer. The Board has 
established Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees which are 
discussed on page 46.
In addition, arrangements are made each 
year for the Board to visit up to two of the 
Group’s operational sites and meet local 
management. Ad hoc site visits are 
facilitated for individual non-executive 
directors on request. During 2015, the 
Board held a meeting in Worms, Germany 
at the offices of its business. In conjunction 
with that Board meeting, presentations 
were given by local senior management 
and the directors were given the 
opportunity to visit the Group’s plant.
The Board has delegated to the Chief 
Executive Officer responsibility for the 
development and preparation of the 
business plan for the Group and the 
annual Group budget for recommendation 
to the Board. As the senior executive 
director, the Chief Executive Officer is 
responsible for all aspects of day-to-day 
operational control of the Group and 
execution of the Group strategy. The 
Chief Executive Officer has established 
and chairs an Executive Committee 
(whose other members are the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Chief Counsel and 
Company Secretary, and the operational 
vice presidents for the Group) to assist 
him in the performance of his duties 
and which meets once a month. The 
Chairman has available to him the 
minutes of the Executive Committee and 
all directors receive a monthly trading 
summary and commentary from the 
Chief Financial Officer.
Board membership and balance
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer 
and Senior Independent Director together 
with Chairmen and members of the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees 
are identified on page 42 to 43. The 
Board considers Mrs C A Johnstone, 
Dr J J C Jansz, Mr J Chen and 
Mr B W D Connolly are independent 
in accordance with the provisions of 
the Code.
The Board held a total of six meetings 
in 2015. In addition the non-executive 
directors also met once without the 
Chairman to appraise his performance.
The table on page 46 shows the number 
of meetings of the Board, Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees 
held during the year and the number 
of meetings attended by each director. 
Where a director is unable to attend a 
Board or Committee meeting his views on 
agenda items are canvassed in advance 
of the meeting and incorporated into 
the discussions.
Induction and training
Induction arrangements are in place 
in order to ensure new directors receive 
a full formal and tailored induction on 
appointment. The Chairman reviews and 
agrees the training and development 
needs of the directors and the skills and 
knowledge of the Board as a whole are 
updated by briefings provided by the 
Company’s internal resources and 
materials and seminars offered by 
external advisers.

 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 45 Corporate Governance continued
Performance evaluation
Performance evaluations of the Board, its 
committees and its directors were carried 
out in the last year by the following internal 
and external processes:
 – an assessment of the performance 
of individual non-executive directors 
is carried out by the Chairman through 
a rolling programme of one-to-one 
discussions using performance 
evaluation questions as the centrepiece 
for those discussions. Every non-
executive director is assessed in this 
way once a year;
 – the performance of the executive 
directors was reviewed against their 
personal objectives for 2015;
 – a meeting of the non-executive 
directors (in the absence of the 
Chairman) chaired by the Senior 
Independent Director was held to 
evaluate the performance of the 
Chairman, taking into account the 
views of the executive directors; and
 – the effectiveness of the Board and 
its Committees (Audit, Nomination, 
Remuneration) was evaluated by way 
of an internal self-assessment process.
Non-executive directors are appointed 
for one-year terms. All directors submit 
themselves for annual election at each 
Annual General Meeting.
Board committees
The Board has formally established 
Nomination, Audit, and Remuneration 
Committees, each with their own terms 
of reference which set out their respective 
roles and the authority delegated to them 
by the Board. Copies of the terms of 
reference are available upon request from 
the Company Secretary and can also be 
downloaded from the Company’s website. 
All non-executive directors have a standing 
invitation to attend Committee meetings 
unless they are notified otherwise.
The Board Committee reports are set 
out at the end of this Corporate 
Governance report.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional investors is 
conducted on a regular basis by the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer and meetings take place following 
the announcement of interim and full 
year results and at other times according 
to circumstances.
The Board has adopted a set of shareholder 
communication principles in order to 
ensure that Board members develop an 
understanding of the views of the Group’s 
major shareholders. These principles 
require the Chairman to be present with 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer at sufficient shareholder 
Committees

presentations and meetings that he fully 
understands the issues and concerns 
of major shareholders. Alternatively, the 
Chairman is also available for meetings 
with major shareholders at their request.
The Chief Executive Officer reports 
on shareholder relations at each 
Board meeting. Communications with 
shareholders relating to corporate 
governance matters are conducted by 
the Chairman with the assistance of the 
Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. Written reports on all 
meetings between non-executive 
directors and institutional shareholders 
and their representative bodies are 
presented to the Board at the first 
opportunity following such meetings 
as is all correspondence with them.
The Senior Independent Director is 
available to shareholders if they have 
concerns which contact through the 
normal channels of the Chairman or the 
Chief Executive Officer has failed to resolve 
or for which such contact is inappropriate.
The Board seeks to encourage 
participation of all shareholders, and 
in particular private investors, at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting 
and endeavours to ensure all Board 
members are in attendance. In particular, 
the Chairs of the Remuneration, Audit 
and Nomination Committees are available 
to answer questions.
The Company makes use of its 
website www.synthomer.com to 
communicate with its shareholders 
and also publishes interim and full year 
results, Company announcements, 
share price and corporate governance 
and other investor information there.
46 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Accountability
An explanation of the directors’ 
responsibility for preparing the financial 
statements, their report that the business 
is a going concern, a viability statement, 
a responsibility statement and their 
statement as to disclosure of information 
to the auditor are set out on pages 68 to 
69 and 70 respectively. Statements by the 
auditor about its reporting responsibilities 
are set out on pages 71 to 75 and 116 to 
117 respectively. 
A report on the approach to internal 
control is set out below. The Directors 
endeavour to make the Annual Report 
and financial statements as informative 
and understandable as possible.
Risk management and 
internal control
The Board of Directors has ultimate 
responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and sets appropriate 
policies to ensure that the Code 
requirements on internal control are 
met. The system of internal control 
deployed within the Group is designed 
to reduce the risks of failure to meet 
business objectives, but these risks 
cannot be eliminated. The internal 
control system adopted can therefore 
only provide reasonable, not absolute, 
assurance about meeting such business 
objectives or against material mis-statement 
or loss.
The Group’s internal controls over the 
financial reporting and consolidation 
processes are designed under the 
supervision of the Chief Financial Officer 
to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation and fair 
presentation of the Group’s published 
financial statements for external reporting 
purposes in accordance with IFRS.
An ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant 
business risks faced by the Group has 
been in place since 2000. This has since 
been built upon so as to embed further 
the process into the businesses and to 
enhance the usefulness of the relevant 
processes and information, and has 
been operated throughout 2015 and up 
to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and accounts, and accords with 
the Financial Reporting Council Guidance 
on internal control.
The system is applied across the Group 
on a functional and regional basis and 
a ‘bottom up’ risk profile is created 
by evaluating the information at an 
operational and Group level. Individual 
senior managers within Synthomer’s 
businesses identify and assess key risks 
associated within their area of responsibility 
based on formal management information 
and interaction with colleagues, 
customers, suppliers and other parties.
The individual submissions are 
consolidated, reviewed and agreed by 
the Executive Committee. A business risk 
report is prepared that is closely linked to 
business strategy and takes account of 
key internal and external factors. Risks 
are prioritised using a common risk 
matrix, which forms the basis of a single 
corporate risk report that is reviewed and 
discussed by the Audit Committee.
The individual business risk reports are 
formally reviewed every six months, out of 
which a revised report is submitted which 
identifies changes in the risk environment.
The process was last reviewed by the 
Synthomer Board of Directors in February 
2016. The nature of the risks identified 
as a result of this process during the 
year primarily relate to matters of an 
operational and financial nature and the 
most significant of those which faced 
the Group in 2015 are reviewed in the 
Strategic report.
Risks associated with safety, health and 
the environment are, by the nature of the 
Group’s business, always of the utmost 
concern and the Resources and 
Relationships report on pages 20 to 27 
reviews the Group’s performance in this 
connection in 2015.
The processes which are used by the 
Board either directly or, where appropriate, 
through the Audit Committee to review 
the effectiveness of the internal control 
and risk management systems (including 
in relation to the financial reporting 
process and the process for preparing 
consolidated accounts) include 
the following:
 – a review of the external audit work plan;
 – consideration of reports from 
management and external parties, 
including the internal and external 
auditor, on the system of internal 
financial control and any material 
control weaknesses;
 – a quarterly review of safety, health and 
environmental performance; 
 – discussion with management of the 
actions taken on any possible problem 
areas for the business identified by 
Board members or in the audit report;
 – consideration of a consolidated risk 
management report setting out the 
main conclusions from the internal 
control process; and a biannual report 
from the internal audit function.
In addition, the Board:
 – receives copies of the minutes from 
all Audit Committee meetings;
 – considers the role of the Group 
insurance programme;
 – receives regular written and oral reports 
from management on all aspects of 
production, operations, financial and 
risk management matters; and
 – in compliance with Provision C.2.1 
of the Combined Code, the Board 
regularly reviews and approves the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal controls.

Strategic report
Governance
Group financial statements
Company financial statements
Other information The Board confirms that a review of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems 
was carried out in 2015.
Environmental matters
The maintenance of high standards 
of environmental (together with health 
and safety) protection is central to the 
Company’s business. A separate statement 
on safety, health and environmental (SHE) 
matters has been a feature of the Annual 
Report for a number of years. The 
Resources and Relationships report on 
pages 20 to 27 includes a report on the 
initiatives the Company has adopted 
regarding sustainable development.
Social, community and human 
rights matters
The Board takes account of social and 
ethical matters as part of its review of 
internal control which, by virtue of its 
approach to risk identification, covers 
areas which encompass social and 
ethical matters.
The Board is conscious of its responsibility 
to the communities in which the Group’s 
businesses operate and encourages local 
engagement by management which 
includes supporting environmental, health 
and education initiatives.
Corporate Governance continued
The Board is also aware of the 
reputational and legal risks associated 
with social and ethical issues and has a 
Group-wide code of business conduct on 
corruption and anti-competitive activities, 
which is available on the Company’s 
website and upon request from the 
Company Secretary. The purpose of this 
code is to ensure that the Group’s 
employees have a clear understanding of 
the principles that are important in these 
areas when conducting the Group’s 
business. The application of the code is 
explained to senior management at 
regular intervals and they are charged 
with its communication throughout their 
businesses supported by internal and 
external training. A compliance procedure 
involving annual certification by senior 
management and a procedure for 
maintaining a register of, and where 
appropriate gaining prior approval for, 
gifts, entertainment and corporate 
hospitality operates throughout the 
Group. A report is made to the Audit 
Committee annually on the code and the 
Company’s whistleblowing procedure.
The Group’s operating activities are highly 
regulated in all territories and largely carried 
out in countries that have established 
legislation on human rights issues. As such, 
information on human rights issues is not 
considered to be necessary for an 
understanding of the development, 
performance or position of the Group’s 
business. The Group has nonetheless 
adopted a policy on equal opportunities, 
diversity and human rights which is 
available at www.synthomer.com.
The Company is a member of the 
FTSE4Good Index.
48 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Audit Committee
The role of the Audit Committee
In 2015 the Audit Committee was 
chaired by Mr J K Maiden until 30 April 
when Mrs C A Johnstone was appointed 
in his place and throughout 2015 
comprised three independent non-
executive directors. Mrs Johnstone is 
considered by the Board to have ‘recent 
and relevant financial experience’ for 
the purposes of Provision C.3.1 of the 
Code as a chartered accountant and 
due to her previous position as a 
partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
The Committee has established a 
detailed remit regarding the application 
of financial reporting and internal control 
principles, which covers:
 – monitoring the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Group and any 
formal announcements relating to 
the Group’s financial performance, 
particularly with regard to the interim 
and full year results, and reviewing 
significant financial reporting 
judgements contained in them;
 – reviewing the Group’s internal financial 
controls and the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems;
 – monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
audit function;
 – making recommendations to the 
Board regarding the selection and 
appointment of the external auditor 
and approving their remuneration 
and terms of engagement;
 – reviewing and monitoring the external 
auditor’s independence and 
objectivity and the effectiveness of 
the audit process; 
 – developing and implementing policy 
on the engagement of the external 
auditor to supply non-audit services;
 – advising the Board, in connection 
with its obligation under Section C.1.1 
of the Code, on whether the Annual 
Report and accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the performance of the 
Group, along with its business model 
and strategy;
 – ensuring that the external audit 
services contract is put out to tender 
at least once every ten years; and

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present my first report 
as Chair of the Audit Committee. I was 
appointed on 30 April 2015 at which date 
Jez Maiden stood down from the Board 
and his role as Chair of the Committee. 
I would like to thank Jez for his support 
and for overseeing a solid base from which 
to continue the work of the Committee.
The Committee welcomed Stephen 
Bennett to Synthomer in May as Chief 
Financial Officer and we monitored the 
effective handover to him from the 
outgoing Chief Financial Officer, David 
Blackwood. Thanks also to David for his 
support during this process. Steve and 
I have worked together to review and 
refresh the work of finance and audit in 
Synthomer as well as the overview role 
of the Committee.
The Committee fulfilled its primary 
responsibilities during the year and in 
addition we have reviewed and agreed 
policies and procedures on external audit 
rotation and tendering; overseen the 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
internal and external audit processes; and 
overseen a review of our approach to 
hedging of foreign exchange exposures. 
Detailed reports were also received from 
the Chief Financial Officer and senior 
members of his department on the IT 
control environment and IT systems security.
The Committee has supported and 
advised the Board in relation to the 
processes and procedures required for 
the changes introduced by the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code concerning 
a longer term viability statement and risk 
assessment and disclosure. In addition 
the Committee has ensured that the 
provisions of the Competition and Market 
Authority Audit Order relating to competitive 
tender processes and audit committee 
responsibilities were complied with 
throughout 2015. The current auditor was 
appointed following a competitive tender 
process held in 2012 and the Committee 
intends to carry out a competitive 
re-tendering process during 2016.
As noted last year, the Financial 
Reporting Council conducted a periodic 
routine review of the 2013 reported 
accounts and this was brought to a 
satisfactory conclusion in June 2015.
During 2016, your Committee will be paying 
particular attention to cyber security and 
the Company’s risk management review 
processes as well as refreshing our 
training programme.

The Chief Financial Officer and senior 
members of his department attend 
meetings of the Committee as part of the 
review of the Group’s interim and annual 
financial statements prior to their 
submission to the Board and as part of 
the internal audit process. The Committee 
meets periodically with the Company’s 
auditor without management present to 
discuss the adequacy of the Group’s 
financial management, internal controls 
and information systems and to review 
the terms of the auditor’s engagement, 
effectiveness, independence and objectivity.
Activities during the year
The Committee met formally four times 
during 2015 and carried out the following 
main activities in addition to the items 
mentioned in the Chairman’s overview:
 – Reviewed the financial statements in 
the 2014 Annual Report and the 2015 
interim statement in conjunction with 
papers prepared by the Chief Financial 
Officer regarding accounting policies 
and basis of preparation and a number 
of disclosure considerations;

regular dialogue with the external auditor, 
Chief Financial Officer and other senior 
members of the head office finance team 
and met with local finance and operations 
teams during site visits during the course 
of the year.
Auditor objectivity and independence
With regard to seeking to ensure the 
independence and objectivity of the 
auditor, the Audit Committee’s policy 
is to ensure that the auditor’s integrity 
is not compromised by restricting their 
involvement in the provision of non-audit 
services where a conflict of interest, real 
or perceived, may exist. The policy splits 
the approval of non-audit work into 
three categories:
 – services which are prohibited;
 – services which are pre-approved 
subject to limits; and
 – services which require specific 
approval on a case-by-case basis.
Prohibited services include:
 – maintaining or preparing accounting 
records and financial statements;
 – the design and implementation of 
financial information systems or 
financial controls;
 – secondments to the Group;
 – recruitment and remuneration related 
services for key management positions;
 – appraisal, valuation and actuarial 
services;
 – tax services which require interpretation 
of tax law or reliance on accounting 
treatments;
 – legal services unrelated to the audit.
A full copy of the policy on the provision 
of non-audit services by the external auditor 
is available on the Company website.
In addition the auditor has been requested 
not to provide services to executive 
directors or senior executives except 
where approved by the Audit Committee. 
Non-executive directors are required to 
disclose any relationship they have with 
the auditor. Prior to appointment in July 
2012 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were 
providing and continued to provide during 
2015 expatriate tax services to the Group’s 
senior managers who are required to 
work outside their home country. The 
Committee does not consider that the 
provision of these services creates any 
conflict of interest as they are of a minor 
nature and are provided by individuals 
and teams who are not involved in the 
audit, and accordingly have approved 
their continuation.
Details of audit and non-audit fees 
paid to the auditor in 2015 are set out in 
note 6 to the Group financial statements. 
Non-audit fees principally relate to 
financial, IT and pensions due diligence 
in connection with a potential acquisition, 
tax compliance and other tax advisory 
services and relate to services 
which were approved within the 
terms of the Committee’s policy. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers were awarded 
the acquisition-related due diligence work 
following a competitive tender process.
Assessment of effectiveness of the 
external audit
During the year, the Committee evaluated 
the performance, independence and 
effectiveness of the external auditors. 
As part of this process, feedback was 
obtained from head office and operating 
company staff involved with the external 
audit and from the Committee’s meetings 
with the external auditors. A review 
of performance against an evaluation 
50 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 checklist was also conducted by the 
Audit Committee Chair and the Chief 
Financial Officer. The Committee 
assessed the robustness of the audit, 
the quality of delivery of the audit against 
the agreed plan and the competence with 
which the auditors handled key 
accounting and audit adjustments. 
Considering all of these factors the 
Committee concluded that the external 
auditors were effective.
Re-appointment of the auditor
As a result of an external 
audit tender process in 2012, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was 
appointed in July that year. Following the 
assessment of the effectiveness of the 
external audit referred to above, the 
Committee is pleased to recommend the 
re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP at the 2016 Annual General Meeting. As 
noted above, however, a competitive tender 
process, the outcome of which will take 
effect for the 2016 audit, will be carried 
out during the first half of 2016.
Financial reporting and 
significant judgements
As part of their monitoring of the integrity 
of the financial statements, the Committee 
reviews whether suitable accounting 
policies have been adopted, and whether 
management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements and also 
seeks support from the external auditors 
to assess these outcomes.
The main issues reviewed in the year ended 
31 December 2015 are set out below:
 – Impairment of goodwill and 
intangibles:
The Group holds £273.3 million of 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
as set out in notes 13 and 14. Annually, 
management performs impairment 
assessments on these balances to 
ensure there is no evidence of 
impairment. The review is done using 
management’s specialised knowledge 
of the underlying businesses and the 
markets in which they operate. As part 
of their audit the external auditor 
reviewed the impairment assessment 
calculation for reasonableness of the 
growth rate assumptions and discount 
rates used and compared the 
assumptions with related external 
market data. The Committee reviewed 
the assessments by management and 
the external auditors and considered 
the related disclosure.
 – Provisions for uncertain 
taxation positions:
Significant judgement is exercised 
by management, with advice from 
appropriate tax advisers, to arrive at the 
amounts provided for tax as the final 
tax outcome of several transactions is 
uncertain and may not be known for 
several years. As part of their audit, 
the external auditor reviewed the 
judgements that had been made, 
using tax specialists as appropriate, 
and provided the Committee with an 
assessment of the appropriateness 
of management judgements. The 
Committee reviewed the provisions 
and judgements taken by management 
and also the auditor’s conclusions.
 – Defined benefit pension 
accounting:
The Group operates a number of 
defined benefit schemes which have 
significant liabilities as outlined in note 
24 to the Group financial statements. 
Although the UK schemes are closed 
to future accrual, they are sensitive 
to changes in actuarial assumptions. 
During their audit, the external auditor 
evaluated the assumptions and 
methodologies used by the Group’s 
actuarial advisers and management 
and assessed whether the assumptions 
made were appropriate and not materially 
different from external benchmarks. 
The external auditors reported to 
us that they were satisfied with the 
assumptions used and with the 
way that the schemes had been 
accounted for.

The Committee is responsible for: the 
regular review of the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and the making 
of recommendations with regard to any 
changes; leading the process for Board 
appointments and nominating candidates 
for non-executive positions; and 
considering succession planning.
The Committee led the processes 
for nominating Stephen Bennett and 
Caroline Johnstone for appointment 
as Chief Financial Officer and as a 
non-executive director and chair of the 
Audit Committee respectively. These 
processes involved a thorough review 
of a range of candidates put forward by 
an independent recruitment consultancy, 
Russell Reynolds Associates, (with which 
the Company has no other connection), 
which conducted extensive search 
processes. The diversity (including 
gender) of the Board was taken into 
account by the Committee when 
making these nominations.
The Committee also reviewed senior 
management succession planning within 
the Group during the course of the year.
The Nomination Committee held 
one formal meeting during 2015 and 
a number of informal meetings and 
telephone calls as well as several 
interviews in connection with the 
nomination processes referred to above.
The Board adopted a policy on diversity 
in March 2013. This policy seeks to 
ensure that diversity in its broadest sense 
is taken into account in the process of 
making appointments on merit against 
objective selection criteria. 
A copy of the diversity policy is available 
at www.synthomer.com. Further details 
on the Company’s approach to diversity 
are contained within the Strategic report.

52 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee
 – setting the remuneration terms for 
Stephen Bennett who joined as Chief 
Financial Officer in May 2015;
 – reviewing the Company-wide bonus 
plan, and aligning it within the Group 
and to the Group Strategy;
 – reviewing the performance of the 
Executive Directors and the Chairman
 – agreeing the participants for, and setting 
the targets for both the annual bonus 
plan and the Performance Share Plan 
(PSP); and
 – reviewing the Terms of Reference and 
the Committee’s own performance
During our Committee meetings we 
discussed a number of topics, including; 
the PSP structure and targets; participants 
in the PSP; the implementation of the 
Group bonus plan and the targets thereof; 
alignment of targets to the Group strategy; 
shareholding requirements for the 
executives; shorter notice periods; 
potential service contract changes; malus 
& clawback; market positioning of salaries 
and total remuneration; simplification of 
the remuneration structure; motivation 
and retention of the executives; and other 
administrative matters. I believe that there 
was sufficient debate and relevant input 
from our independent adviser on the 
different topics to ensure that our 
governance obligations were met and 
that issues were discussed in full. 
The highlights from 2015 were:
 – base salaries have been increased 
by 2% in line with the UK Group 
employee population.
 – under the annual bonus plan the 
outcome for 2015 was well above 
expectations and budget, primarily due 
to successful growth in Asia, with Europe 
relatively stable as predicted. This meant 
that despite increasing the annual bonus 
target at the start of the year by an 
additional £2 million of PBT over and 
above the budgeted target, this target 
was met and exceeded, giving rise to full 
payout for the financial portion of the 
annual bonus. The SHE goals were set to 
deliver an improvement on the previous 
year in all three categories of personal 
safety, process safety and behavioural 
training. Two out of the three goals were 
met and exceeded, with the third falling 
just short, and as such two-thirds of 
bonuses linked to SHE were paid out. 
Lastly the personal objectives were 
broadly met as one would expect in such 
a successful year, with a detailed strategy 
now embedded, a restructuring of the

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Company 
Directors’ Remuneration report for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2015, 
and take this opportunity to thank the 
Committee and Board members for their 
valuable input and debate. 
Our Policy
Our current Remuneration Policy, in force 
since 1 May 2014, will remain in place until 
next year as the Committee considers 
that the policy remains relevant and fit for 
purpose for 2016. We will review the policy 
in its entirety during 2016, taking into 
account current guidance, trends and best 
practice from a number of sources, and 
put the policy to a shareholder vote at the 
AGM in 2017 in accordance with legislative 
requirements. In my statement last year, 
we highlighted that work had already begun 
on the policy review, and we re-confirm that 
we will be incorporating an additional two 
year holding period for vested awards 
under the Performance Share Plan 
following the three year performance period 
from 2017 onwards. For convenience, the 
policy principles and a table summarising 
the main elements of the current policy 
have been produced on pages 54 to 58. 
Activities and outcomes in 2015
During 2015 the Committee worked 
closely with the Board in:
Executive team completed and a current 
and ongoing focus on M&A evident. Both 
Executives therefore received a full pay 
out against these measurable non-financial 
objectives. In summary, it has been a 
very successful year and this sets a high 
bar for 2016 for this new Executive team.
 – the 2013 PSP will pay out 28.8% based 
on partially achieving the Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) target. The 
Earnings Per Share (EPS) three year 
growth target, which was a multiplier on 
the 2012 EPS result, was not achieved 
despite the growth in 2015.
Linkage to strategy
Linking performance to strategy is an 
important part of any Remuneration 
Committee’s role, and again this year we 
have sought to ensure such alignment. 
The bonus plan focuses on in year 
profitability as a stepping stone to longer 
term growth. Safety and health and 
focused strategic goals make up the rest 
of the bonus plan. The strategic targets 
look at growth engines for the Group 
which reflect our geographic positioning. 
All of these targets are an integral part of 
the strategy to drive growth within a safe 
working environment. The PSP focuses on 
growth through innovation and acquisitions, 
as well as delivering a growing EPS and 
‘out performing’ (TSR) against our peers 
in the market. We believe that the strategy 
and these goals also deliver value to our 
shareholders. 
Remuneration Report
The Directors’ Remuneration report will 
not require a binding vote for the policy at 
the 2016 Annual General Meeting; however 
the Annual Report on Remuneration will 
be subject to an advisory vote. We hope 
that we will have the support of our 
shareholders for the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. 
Finally, we believe the remuneration of 
the executive directors to be balanced, 
appropriate and broadly in-line with best 
practice, and importantly, motivational 
for the executives and aligned with 
shareholders’ interests without driving 
inappropriate risk taking. We continue 
to monitor current best practice and 
guidelines and remain open to review the 
output of various consultations and discuss 
the ideas and opinions of our shareholders 
as we review our policy in 2016.

Directors’ Remuneration  
– Policy principles
The key principles for executive directors’ 
remuneration at Synthomer are as follows:
 – Sufficient to attract and retain executive 
directors of the ability and expertise 
necessary to achieve the strategic 
goals of the Company.
 – Incentivise executive directors by 
rewarding performance and driving 
the right behaviours.
 – Align executive director reward with the 
experience of shareholders. 
In setting executive directors’ remuneration, 
the Committee takes account of pay and 
conditions throughout the Company. 
The Committee also considers corporate 
governance requirements and best 
practice in terms of remuneration 
structures and the process of setting 
executive remuneration. 
The Committee reviews performance 
targets regularly to ensure that they do 
not encourage or motivate inappropriate 
risk taking. Furthermore, the Committee, 
when necessary, will take into account 
any environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) events and the Audit 
Committee’s risk assessment when 
assessing performance.
The following diagram provides an 
overview of the key elements of reward 
for executive directors and the performance 
measures used.
Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy Summary
Set out in the table below is a summary 
of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(the ‘Policy’) as it applies to executive

with section 439A of the Companies 
Act 2006. The Policy has been effective

Annual bonus
2015 award
For 2015 the Company operated a cash bonus plan for the executive directors related to the achievement of profit before tax 
targets, health and safety targets and individual strategic and operational goals. 
The achievement of the profit before tax target represented up to 80% of the maximum bonus opportunity achievable of 100% of 
annual basic salary other than for Mr Blackwood as noted below. 
The health and safety targets were given a 10% weighting of the maximum achievable with the balance of 10% relating to 
individual strategic and operational goals.
As Mr Blackwood served notice of his intention to leave the Company in December 2014 he was not set any individual goals for 
2015 and the profit before tax measure was therefore increased to 90% of his maximum bonus opportunity. 
Overall bonuses for the year ended 31 December 2015.

1. Targets are set by reference to the Board approved internal budget for the Group and measured on a constant currency basis.
2. Health & Safety
Targets with an aggregate weighting of 10% related to improvements in personal and process safety and as a result of the 
performance in these areas, with completion of the Group process safety plan and the number of behavioural audits exceeding 
target but the level of recordable accidents being adverse to target, 6.7% of the maximum bonus opportunity for this measure was 
achieved.
3. Individual strategic and operational goals
C G MacLean
Individual goals with an aggregate weighting of 10% included:
 – identification of evaluated possible acquisition opportunities, 
 – restructuring of the senior leadership team and the corporate headquarters 
 – developing excellent Board relationships.

In addition, an award of 100,000 shares was made to S G Bennett on 1 May 2015, which is subject to continued employment until 
31/12/2017. The award was made on recruitment in order to ‘buy out’ remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving his previous 
employment. The awards which were forfeited were not subject to performance conditions but only to continued employment, and 
only a portion of the award was bought out. The Committee was satisfied that the award was substantially less valuable than the 
entitlement forfeited.

2.  Executive directors are required to hold 100% of their annual salary in the Company’s shares. Until this requirement is met no sales of shares that vest 
under long-term incentive plans are permitted other than to satisfy tax liabilities that arise on the exercise of share awards under such plans. The Committee 
considers that unfettered unexercised vested nil-cost awards are economically equivalent to shares and as such that they should count (on a net of tax 
basis) toward compliance with the 100% salary guideline. The Committee will keep the guideline level of share interest under review.

Payments to past directors
A M Whitfield
On 1 July 2014, Adrian Whitfield announced his intention to step down from his role as Chief Executive Officer and director of the 
Company. He agreed to give 12 months’ notice and to continue as Chief Executive Officer to allow sufficient time for a replacement 
to be found and an orderly transition to take place. 
As a result of the appointment of Calum MacLean as Mr Whitfield’s successor on 22 January 2015, Mr Whitfield agreed with the 
Board to step down as Chief Executive Officer, but to remain an employee of the Company until the end of his notice period on 
30 June 2015. During his notice period, Mr Whitfield continued to be paid in line with the terms of his service agreement and was 
entitled to receive his normal salary, benefits and pension arrangements. 
It was agreed, at the time of his giving notice, that he would receive neither a bonus nor an award under the Performance Share 
Plan in 2015. He remained eligible for a bonus in respect of performance in 2014 as detailed on page 59.
The Remuneration Committee determined that, taking into account the circumstances of the departure, the transition between 
the leadership of the Company and Mr Whitfield’s contribution to the business during his tenure, his unvested awards under the 
Performance Share Plan would continue. In line with the approved policy, the awards will be reduced on a time-apportioned basis, 
which will be calculated to 31 March 2015 (i.e. prior to ceasing employment). Awards will be subject to the relevant performance 
conditions which will be measured at the normal time. Vesting of awards will also be subject to mitigation, to the extent that 
Mr Whitfield subsequently takes up employment with a competitor of the Company. Details of the vesting of the award made 
to Mr Whitfield in 2013 together with all other remuneration paid to Mr Whitfield in 2015 are contained in this report. 
D C Blackwood
David Blackwood gave notice of his intention to retire from his role as Chief Financial Officer on 18 December 2014, and agreed to 
remain with the Company until 31 December 2015 in order for his successor to be recruited and a handover to take place. As a 
result of the appointment of Stephen Bennett as Mr Blackwood’s successor on 1 May 2015, Mr Blackwood agreed with the Board 
to step down as Chief Financial Officer, but to remain an employee of the Company until 31 December 2015. During 2015, 
Mr Blackwood continued to be paid in line with the terms of his service agreement and was entitled to receive his normal salary, 
benefits and pension arrangements. 
Mr Blackwood participated in the 2015 annual bonus scheme and received an award under the Performance Share Plan in 2015. 
Following retirement, in line with the approved policy, Mr Blackwood’s unvested awards under the Performance Share Plan will 
continue but will be reduced on a time-apportioned basis calculated to 31 December 2015. Awards will be subject to the relevant 
performance conditions which will be measured at the normal time. Details of the vesting of the award made to Mr Blackwood in 
2013 together with all the remuneration paid to Mr Blackwood in 2015 is contained in this report.

Key duties of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for determining, in agreement with the Board, the Company’s policy on executive remuneration and 
the specific remuneration for the chairman and each of the executive directors, including pension rights, within the terms of the 
agreed policy. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration of senior executives throughout the Group. 
Advisers
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Company Secretary and the Group HR Director are invited to attend Committee 
meetings to contribute to the Committee in its deliberations. However, no individual is involved in discussions, or is part of any 
decisions, relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee received independent advice from Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) who were appointed as the Committee’s independent 
remuneration advisers in April 2013. 
During the year, Deloitte provided advice on governance and market trends and other remuneration matters that materially 
assisted the Committee. The fees paid to Deloitte in respect of this work were charged on a time and expenses basis and totalled 
£8,625 for advice in 2015. Deloitte also provided tax services to the Company in the year. The Committee was satisfied that this 
did not compromise the independence of the advice received.
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, and adheres to its code of conduct. Deloitte was 
appointed directly by the Committee, and the Committee is satisfied that the advice received was objective and independent.

provision which provides that they shall be indemnified by the Company against certain liabilities as permitted by Sections 232 
and 234 of the Companies Act 2006 and against costs incurred by them in relation to any liability for which they are indemnified. 
The Company has purchased and maintains insurance against directors’ and officers’ liabilities in relation to the Company.
Share capital and control
During 2015 no shares were issued or repurchased. A total of 141,795 shares were purchased on the open market on behalf of the 
shareholders who elected to participate in the dividend reinvestment plan.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, being the only class of issued share capital, as well as the 
powers of the Company’s directors, are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from 
Companies House or can be downloaded from the Company’s website. There are no restrictions on the voting rights attaching 
to the Company’s ordinary shares or on the transfer of securities in the Company. No person holds securities in the Company 
carrying special rights with regard to the control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders 
of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. Unless expressly specified to the 
contrary in the Articles of Association of the Company, the Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by special 
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Other than in relation to its borrowings which, unless certain conditions are satisfied, become repayable on a takeover, the Company 
is not party to any significant agreements that would take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover 
bid. The Company does not have agreements with any director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office 
or employment resulting from a takeover.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding options and awards would

Report of the Directors continued
68 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Going concern
The Directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on going concern and in reaching their conclusions have taken into account 
factors including:
 – the refinancing of the Group’s main credit facility in July 2014 which involved the putting in place of a new committed £210 million 
multicurrency revolving loan for a term of five years. 
 – the final repayment under the 2004 series private placement notes of US$22 million due in September 2016.
After making enquiries and taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, the Directors have concluded 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and financial statements.

 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 69 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Financial statements, including adoption of going concern basis
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101: “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable 
law (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Other matters
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
 – the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
 – As required by the UK Corporate Governance Code: The Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
provides the information necessary to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy and is fair, 
balanced and understandable.

70 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Synthomer plc’s Group financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise:
 – the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Analysis of Net Borrowings as at 31 December 2015;
 – the Consolidated Income Statement and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;
 – the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended;
 – the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and
 – the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union.
Our audit approach
Context
Our 2015 audit was planned and executed having regard to the fact that the operations of Synthomer plc were largely unchanged 
from the prior year. In addition we had regard to the continued tough trading environment in Central Europe with stronger market 
conditions in Malaysia. In light of this our overall audit approach was largely unchanged, with the exception of the removal of the 
area of focus in relation to impairment of goodwill and intangibles, owing to a reduced level of risk as a result of the upturn in 
performance in the Asia and Rest of the World segment. 
Overview
Materiality – Overall Group materiality: £4.3 million which represents 4.5% of underlying profit before tax.
Audit scope – Our Group audit focused on five key reporting units which were all subject to audits of their 
complete financial information.
 – The reporting units where we performed audit procedures accounted for 86% of the Group’s 
revenue, 77% of the Group’s operating profit and 79% of Group’s underlying operating profit. 
Areas of focus – Provisions for uncertain tax positions
 – Defined benefit pension accounting
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we 
also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by 
the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, 
are identified as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas 
in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our 
procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Company financial statements
Other information
Independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Synthomer plc Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Defined benefit pension accounting
A set out in note 24 on page 108 the Group has significant 
defined benefit pension schemes. These primarily represent 
the Yule Catto Group retirement benefits scheme in the UK 
and an unfunded scheme in Germany, which account for 
£136.1 million of the net pension deficit of £139.2 million 
recorded on the Group balance sheet at the year end. 
We focused on the pension liabilities in particular, as the 
amounts reflected in the financial statements for defined 
benefits schemes are sensitive to relatively small changes in 
a few key assumptions such as the inflation rate, mortality 
tables and most notably, the discount rate applied
The Group uses third party actuaries to calculate the amounts 
to reflect in the financial statements in respect of these 
schemes and it is accordingly important for us to assess the 
work they perform and their competency to undertake the 
work in order to conclude on the results of their work.
We obtained external actuarial reports of the UK and German 
schemes dated January 2016 which set out the detailed 
calculations and assumptions underpinning the year end pension 
scheme valuation. We read these reports and were satisfied that 
the scope of their work was such that we could use this work to 
provide evidence for the purpose of our audit. 
We assessed the competency and objectivity of the external 
actuaries commissioned by the Group to perform the year end 
calculations by considering their technical expertise and 
independence from the Group. We identified no concerns over 
their competency or objectivity. 
We used our own specialist actuarial knowledge to evaluate all 
the key assumptions used in each of the two schemes by 
comparing these assumptions to our expectations for similar 
schemes as at the year end. We found management’s 
assumptions to be consistent with our expectations and within 
an acceptable range.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions
The Group has a wide geographic footprint and is subject to 
a range of tax laws in a number of different tax jurisdictions. 
In determining the amount to record at the year-end for tax 
liabilities there is an element of judgement as to what amounts 
will ultimately be payable for assessed tax exposures.
As set out in note 8 at 31 December 2015, the Group has 
recorded current tax liabilities totalling £30.6 million. A 
significant element of this tax liability relates to uncertain 
tax positions.
We focused on this area due to the size of the amounts 
involved and level of judgement needed to determine the 
estimated provisions.
We used our specialised tax knowledge to assess the level of 
provisions held against various tax exposures and to consider 
the appropriateness of any provisions. In our assessment we had 
regard to the nature of the individual exposures, including their 
origin, and any developments in the year to assess the rationale 
for their continued validity at the current year end.
As part of this work we inspected correspondence with tax 
authorities and the Group’s tax advisors. We challenged the 
judgements made by assessing individual provisions against our 
expectations of potential exposures, having regard to the facts of 
each case and, where deemed necessary, we involved PwC 
component auditors in the relevant overseas territory. 
No significant issues arose from this work to suggest that the 
judgements made and amounts recorded were inappropriate.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which the Group operates. 
As set out on page 3 the Group reports its results as two businesses: ‘Europe and North America’ and ‘Asia and the Rest of the 
World’. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of reporting units, being holding companies, intermediate holding 
companies and nineteen operating companies, across thirteen countries. Three countries the UK, Germany and Malaysia account 
for the majority for the Group’s results. We accordingly focused our work on the five key reporting units in these countries which 
were subject to audits of their complete financial information. These components accounted for 86% of the Group’s revenue, 77% 
of the Group’s operating profit and 79% of the Group’s underlying operating profit. In addition to the work at the five key reporting 
units we performed local statutory audit work in relation to the year ended 31 December 2015 at a number of other operating 
companies accounting for a further 13% of the Group’s underlying profit with these teams reporting to the Group team any issues 
of note from their work which was substantially completed as at the date of this opinion.
Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work 
at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. The Group team also attended the closing audit meeting in the largest of 
the overseas territories.
72 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015
Independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Synthomer plc continued Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £4.3 million (2014: £3.8 million).
How we determined it 4.5% of underlying profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
We have used underlying profit, being profit before tax adjusted for special items, because it is the 
principal metric against which the Group’s financial performance is measured in the Chairman’s and 
CEO’s statements within the financial statements.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £200,000 
(2014: £200,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page page 70, in relation to going concern. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to 
the directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in 
operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As 
part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all 
future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge 
of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
 – the statement given by the directors on page 70, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole 
to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
 – the section of the Annual Report on page 49, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions 
to report.

Other information The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 – the directors’ confirmation on page 29 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 
of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to.
 – the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to.
 – the directors’ explanation on page 69 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether 
the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review.
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further 
provisions of the Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
74 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015
Independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Synthomer plc continued What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
 – whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
 – the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 – the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Synthomer plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities  
to movement in net borrowings 1 General information
Synthomer plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the registered office is 
given on page 132.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
No new standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2015.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 
1 January 2016, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. None of these is expected to 
have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, except for the following:
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ is a converged standard from the IASB and FASB on revenue recognition. The 
standard will improve the financial reporting of revenue and improve comparability of the top line in financial statements globally. 
This new standard is not expected to impact on the accounting of revenue in the Group, however increased disclosure 
requirements are expected. It is effective for accounting periods starting 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’, this standard replaces the guidance in IAS 39. It includes requirements on the classification and 
measurement of financial assets and liabilities; it also includes an expected credit losses model that replaces the current incurred 
loss impairment model. This new standard is not expected to impact on the accounting, however an increase in disclosure is 
expected. It is effective for accounting periods starting 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, this standard replaces IAS 17. It removes the distinction between finance leases and operating leases and 
requires all leases to be capitalised by recognising the present value of the lease payments. This new standard is expected 
to have an impact on both the Group’s Income Statement and Balance Sheet. It is effective for accounting periods starting 
1 January 2019.
2 Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of 
financial instruments. As discussed in the Report of the Directors on page 69, the financial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to 
the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using equity accounting.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. 
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination (page 81) 
and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of combination. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
80 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015
Notes to the consolidated financial statements  
31 December 2015 Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an 
asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually at the cash generating unit level. Any impairment is recognised immediately in 
the consolidated income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Should the fair value of the identifiable assets exceed the cost of acquisition, a ‘Bargain purchase’, the excess is credited to the 
income statement immediately on acquisition.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, 
or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit 
is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 
profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, 
and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in 
profit or loss as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3(2008) 
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
 – deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured 
in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively; and
 – assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts 
are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new 
information obtained about facts and circumstance that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the 
amounts as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts 
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held investment is 
re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses from such re-measurement are recognised in the income 
statement.
Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured at their fair value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Customer relationships between 5 and 8 years
Technology 10 years
Where necessary the fair value at acquisition and estimated useful lives for these intangible assets are based on independent 
valuation reports.

Other intangible assets
Software development resulting in development of a long-term intangible asset are measured initially at cost and are amortised on 
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between 3-5 years.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions in IAS 38 are met:
 – an asset is created that can be separately identified (such as software and new processes);
 – it is technically feasible to complete the asset;
 – management intends to complete the development;
 – there is an ability to use or sell the asset once development has been completed;
 – it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;
 – adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development are available; and
 – the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
No research or development costs met the criteria required for capitalisation under IAS 38 during the year. Where no internally-
generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is 
incurred. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost (original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its 
working condition for its intended use), net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Except for freehold 
land, which is not depreciated, the cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected 
useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings – the lesser of 50 years and the period of the lease
Plant and equipment – between 3 and 10 years
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.  Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are 
initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and 
movements in other comprehensive income.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its plant, property and equipment and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis to the income statement over the term of the relevant lease. Any 
benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
82 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct 
labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost 
is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or 
defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss where 
there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are done so on a non-recourse basis. At the point of factoring, the Group 
forfeits the right to future cash flows from these receivables and those amounts are derecognised. The cost of factoring 
receivables is recognised as a finance cost in the period in which the receivable is factored.
Amortised costs
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the 
income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method.
Impairment of financial assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its financial assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at an effective interest rate on the 
carrying amount. Finance costs that are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised 
as part of the cost of those assets in accordance with IAS 23.
Foreign currencies 
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates 
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options (see below 
for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments). 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates 
fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation 
reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 83
Strategic report
Governance
Group financial statements
Company financial statements
Other information 2 Significant accounting policies continued
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions 
before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 21.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate 
risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency options.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a 
derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as 
either hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges), 
or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in 
respect of foreign currency risk, as either cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. 
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging 
relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in 
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the 
same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results 
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are 
transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time 
remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. The gain 
or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the ‘other gains and losses’ 
line of the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, restricted cash balances which become fully 
liquid within three months or less and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
84 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly 
to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Retirement benefit costs 
The costs of defined benefit contributions to the Group’s pension schemes and of augmenting existing pensions are charged to 
the consolidated income statement on a systematic basis over the expected period of benefits from employees’ service.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are recognised in full in each period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside of the consolidated income statement and are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually 
using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the 
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which 
the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. 
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate 
trustee-administered funds. For the German schemes, the assets are included within the assets of the respective companies, as 
permitted under local laws. The assets of the other overseas schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Provisions
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been 
communicated to affected parties.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed, where delivery is defined in accordance with 
Incoterms 2010.

Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments 
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Group will on occasion, at its own discretion, settle the share-
based payments in cash rather than equity.
Definitions
Total sales
Total sales represents the total of revenue from the Company, its subsidiaries, and its share of the revenue of joint ventures.
Operating profit
Operating profit represents profit from continuing activities before financing costs and taxation. 
EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and special items (as defined below).
Special items
The following are disclosed separately in order to provide a clearer indication of the Group’s underlying performance:
 – Amortisation of acquired intangible assets;
 – Impairment of non-current assets;
 – Costs of business combinations;
 – Re-structuring and site closure costs;
 – Fair value adjustment – mark to market adjustments in respect of cross currency and interest rate derivatives used for hedging 
purposes where IAS 39 hedge accounting is not applied;
 – Other non-recurring and non-operating items; and
 – Tax impact of the above items.
Underlying performance 
Underlying performance represents the performance of the Group under IFRS, excluding special items.
Net borrowings
Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of 
related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting, non-recourse factoring arrangements.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that the Group has made in the 
process of applying the accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The Group activities give rise to significant potential deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of the UK pension liability, tax 
losses and accelerated capital allowances. Determination of whether these assets should be recognised requires a high degree 
of management judgement and is dependent on management’s ability to project future earnings from activities that may apply 
loss positions carried forward against future income taxes.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which 
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis taking the current and expected future market conditions into consideration.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
86 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 Impairment/reversal of impairment
The Group has significant investments in property, plant and equipment, acquired intangibles and goodwill. Changes in the 
circumstances or expectations of future performance of an individual asset may be an indicator that the asset is impaired requiring 
the book value to be written down to its recoverable amount. Impairments, excluding goodwill, are reversed if the conditions for 
impairment are no longer present. Evaluating whether an asset is impaired or if an impairment should be reversed requires a high 
degree of judgement and may depend to a large extent on the selection of key assumptions about the future.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The growth rates used within the forecast 
future cash flows are developed with reference to external sources but are subject to estimation uncertainty. See note 13 for 
more details.
Post retirement benefit obligations
Included in the actuaries’ calculation of the post retirement benefit obligations are a number of assumptions. Any changes in these 
assumption will impact the carrying value of the obligations. These are shown in detail in note 24.
Current tax liability and deferred tax
The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes payable to various jurisdictions around the world, and it also 
recognises significant changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based on management’s 
interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant court decisions. The quality of these estimates is highly dependent upon 
management’s ability to properly apply what can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise changes in applicable rules.

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, based upon discounted cash flows. The key 
assumptions for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate. The discount rate 
is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the 
particular CGU’s activities and geography of operation. Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined 
with management’s expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic 
growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
Discount rates of 11% (2014: 11%) and 12% (2014: 12%) have been used in the above calculations for Europe & North America 
and Asia & Rest of World respectively. 
The profit used in the cash flows for the first year is derived from management forecasts; for years 2 to 10 a growth rate is applied. 
The profit for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity. Growth rates of 2% (2014: 2%) and 5% 
(2014: 5%) have been used for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively, representing management’s 
best estimate of each CGU’s circumstances, and these do not exceed the long-term growth rates for the markets concerned.
There is no reasonably possible change in key assumptions that would lead to an impairment.
Of the net book value of goodwill at 31 December 2015, £70.5 million (2014: £70.5 million) is located in the UK.

Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate. Where market values are not available, fair values 
of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates 
and by applying year end exchange rates. The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair value of the Group’s financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly 
observable, Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies 
for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.
Market risk
The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The policies adopted to address 
these risks are as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings. The Group borrows at 
both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to manage the 
Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Foreign currency risk
The Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are 
predominantly denominated in Euros and Malaysian Ringitt. Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts. The 
Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. Consequently, there are no material 
currency exposures to disclose (2014 none).
Impact on income statement
Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to £0.2 million have been debited to the income statement in the 
year (2014 debit of £0.8 million). These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting
The Group has a number of cross currency swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address. The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary to 
permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39. It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these requirements 
cannot be justified and therefore IAS 39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
104 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 In addition, the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the sterling value of its net investments in certain 
foreign operations, which have a Malaysian Ringgit functional currency. These contracts have been accounted for as net 
investment hedges as permitted by IAS 39.
Interest rate risk profile
Financial liabilities
After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate 
exposure of the Group as at 31 December 2015 was:

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and 
non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the 
amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts 
their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans 
as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the 
functional currency of the lender or borrower.
Liquidity risk
The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due. The Board closely monitors liquidity through 
monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Synthomer plc had the following principal facilities:
 – A 5 year, £210 million committed revolving credit facility. 
 – Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately £14.9 million raised from the US private placement market in 2004 with a maturity 
date of September 2016. Please see note 20 for further details.

Freehold Land 1.0 1.1 
The Group owns agricultural land in Malaysia, which is operated as a palm oil and natural rubber plantation.
The land is owned by Kind Action Sdn Bhd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Revertex Malaysia Sdn Bhd, which has a 30% 
non-controlling interest.
The directors decided in 2013 to dispose of this land, excluding the 300 acres immediately surrounding the manufacturing 
facilities, on the open market.
At 31 December 2015, the status of the disposal programme was as follows: 
Acres
Consideration

Sale completed 200 6.8
Contracts exchanged 900 30.3
To be sold 400
The consideration is shown before deduction of disposal costs, taxation and the non-controlling interest share.
These disposals are subject to regulatory approval which may take up to 2 years. The disposal is only recognised in the accounts 
and the profit taken when this process has been completed and the consideration received
During the year, the Group sold 200 acres of land for a consideration of £6.8m and a profit on sale, included in special items,

UK pension schemes
The Group’s UK defined benefit scheme was closed to future accrual in 2009. All pension benefits since that time are provided 
by way of a defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Defined benefit scheme
The defined benefit scheme is administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company.
The trustees of the pension fund are required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the 
scheme. The trustees of the pension are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2012 and updated to 31 December 2015 by a qualified actuary.
The Group is committed to a funding deficit recovery plan entered into following the 2012 valuation. The triennial valuation of the 
scheme has been performed during 2015. The company and trustees are in the process of agreeing a new deficit recovery plan.
The scheme is exposed to a number of risks the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset return risk  The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; 
if plan assets underperform this yield, this will increase the deficit. The scheme holds a significant 
proportion of equities which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while 
providing volatility and risk in the short term.
Interest rate risk  A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset 
by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings. 
Longevity risk  The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases 
in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.
The risk relating to benefits to be paid to the dependants of scheme members (widow and orphan benefits) is reinsured by an 
external insurance company.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
108 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 The major assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
2015 2014
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.10% 3.00%
Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 2.00% 2.00%
Discount rate 3.80% 3.65%
Inflation assumption 3.00% 3.00%
Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics. These assumptions 
translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at 65 as follows:
2015 2014
Retiring today:
Males 87.6 87.5
Females 90.1 90.0
Retiring in 20 years:
Males 89.4 89.3
Females 92.1 92.0
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate and mortality. The sensitivity 
analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting 
period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 1% Decrease/increase by £54 million 
Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by £12 million
The above sensitivities are based on a change of assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may have some correlation. When calculating the sensitivity of the 
defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation 
calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the 
pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.

Contributions from the sponsoring companies are expected to be £14 million in 2016.
Overseas pension schemes
The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and post-retirement schemes. The assets of these schemes are 
held separately from those of the Group, with the exception of the unfunded German schemes (net liability £61.5 million, 
2014: £66.2 million) were in line with common practice, the assets are held within the respective companies.
Defined benefit schemes
The aggregated pension disclosure below for the overseas defined benefit schemes has been compiled from a number of actuarial 
valuations at 31 December 2015.
The largest of these schemes accounts for £59.0 million (2014: £45.4 million) of the deficit at 31 December 2015. The major 
assumption used in the actuarial valuation of this scheme are:
2015 2014
Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 3.00%
Rate of increase in pensions 2.00% 2.00%
Discount rate 2.35% 2.20%
Mortality assumptions
Investigations have been carried out within the past three years into the mortality experience of the Group’s defined benefit scheme. 
These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in 
mortality rates. The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are:
2015 2014
Retiring today:
Males 84.0 83.9
Females 88.1 87.9
Retiring in 20 years:
Males 86.6 86.5
Females 90.6 90.5
The major assumption used in the valuation of the other overseas schemes do not differ significantly from the above.

The Group underwent a significant restructuring following the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 2011. A further restructuring exercise 
was commenced in 2014. The cost of these restructuring programmes is charged to special items in the income statement when 
permitted by IAS37. The provision reflects the amount that has been charged but not yet spent.
Liability arising on a business combination
As part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex in 2011, the Group acquired a leasehold interest in an empty property. The provision

The Company established a trust, the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust, on 17 July 1996 to distribute shares to employees enabling 
the obligations under the Yule Catto Longer-Term Performance Share Plan and the Yule Catto Longer-Term Deferred Bonus Plan to 
be met. The Trust is managed by the RBC Trustees (Guernsey) Limited, an independent company located in Guernsey.
At 31 December 2015, the Trust held 82,425 (2014: 82,425) ordinary shares in the Company with a market value of £0.3 million 
(2014: £0.2 million).
The dividends on these shares have been waived. All of the shares are under option. Costs are amortised over the life of the plans.
There were no exercises in 2015. In 2014, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was £2.62.
The weighted average fair value of the options at the measurement date granted during the year was £1.36 (2014: £0.32). 
The valuation was based on the following inputs and assumptions:
2015 2014
Weighted average share price (£) 2.89 2.65
Option price (£) – – 
Value of optionality nil nil
Vesting assumption 47% 12%
Given the option price is £nil, the only circumstance in which a vested option will not be exercised is if the current share price 
is £nil. There is some value associated with the timing of when the exercise would be made but this is considered to be minimal 
and therefore this has not been modelled.
The vesting assumption is the estimate at the measurement date of the percentage of the options that will ultimately vest and 
is based on management’s assessment of the likelihood of achievement of the performance criteria.
33 Share price information
The middle market value of the listed ordinary shares at 31 December 2015 was 318.1 pence. During the year, the market price 
ranged between 230.1 pence and 361.3 pence. The latest ordinary share price is available on the Financial Times Cityline service,

We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 – whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
 – the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 – the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Synthomer plc for the year ended 31 December 2015.

Company statement of changes in equity  
31 December 2015 1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements of Synthomer plc have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified 
by the revaluation of land and buildings and derivative financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through the 
income statement, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the company’s accounting policies. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on industry experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances.
The directors have reviewed the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements. The directors do 
not believe that there is a significant risk which would lead to material adjustments to the carrying value of any assets and liabilities 
in the next financial year due to changes on estimates or assumptions.
The following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, 
in accordance with FRS 101:
 – IAS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows’
 – The requirements in IAS24, ‘Related party disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group.
 – IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’.
 – IFRS 13, Paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ (disclosure of valuation techniques and inouts used for fair 
value measurement of assets and liabilites).
 – Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment’ (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices 
of share options, and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined).
Going concern
The Company meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its cash reserves and borrowings. After making 
enquiries and taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance the Directors have concluded that the 
company should be able to operate within the level of its current cash reserves and borrowings and continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. The Company therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its 
financial statements.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Company operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial statements are presented in ‘Pounds Sterling’ (£), which is 
also the Company’s functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of 
such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow 
hedges. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within ‘Other operating income’.
Property, plant and equipment
Properties are shown at professional valuation from 1985. All other plant and equipment are stated at cost. Cost includes the 
original purchase price of the asset plus the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of land and buildings are credited to other comprehensive income and 
shown as Revaluation reserve in shareholders’ funds. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged in 
other comprehensive income and debited against Revaluation reserve; all other decreases are charged to the income statement. 
Each year the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset charged to the income 
statement, and depreciation based on the asset’s original cost is transferred from ‘Revaluation reserve’ to ‘Retained earnings’.
120 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015
Notes to the Company financial statements  
31 December 2015 Except for freehold land, which is not depreciated, the cost or valuation of property, plant and equipment is depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Intercompany
Intercompany balances are shown gross unless a right of set off exists. Balances are valued at fair value at inception and are 
repayable on demand.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in shareholders’ funds. In this case, the tax 
is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in shareholders’ funds, respectively. The current income tax charge 
is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the 
Company operates and generates taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect 
to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis 
of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred taxation 
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial 
recognition of goodwill; or arise from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination 
that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax 
rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the 
related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Financial instruments
All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price (including transaction costs), except for those financial 
assets classified as at fair value through the income statement, which are initially measured at fair value. Financial assets and 
financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) are recognised on the Company statement of financial position when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are only offset in the balance sheet when, and only when there exists a legally enforceable right 
to set off the recognised amounts and the Company intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.
Financial assets are derecognised when and only when a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or 
are settled, b) the Company transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, 
or c) the Company. despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the asset 
to another party and the other party has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to 
exercise that ability unilaterally and without needing to impose additional restrictions on the transfer.
Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.

Other information
 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 121 1 Accounting policies continued
Trade and other receivables
Trade debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. 
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income 
statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not 
settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade and other payables
Trade creditors are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, 
including cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company does not hold or issue 
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at each statement of financial position date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a 
derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the 
income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Company designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Fair value hedge accounting
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The Company 
only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exposure associated with the underlying hedged item. The gain or 
loss relating to the ineffective portion is also recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash held at banks and cash in hand.
Borrowings
Borrowings represents short-and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments irrespective 
of whether they qualify for hedge accounting.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are capitalised as pre-payment for liquidity service and amortised over the term 
of the facility.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Financial guarantees
The Company issues guarantees in respect of bank and other facilities of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
2 Auditors’ remuneration
The audit fee of Synthomer plc amounted to £10,000 (2014: £4,000).

At the start of the year the Company had designated its Euro denominated multi currency Revolving Credit Facility and a forward 
contract totalling Euro 200.0m (2014: Euro 200.0m) as a FRS 101 fair value hedge against the designated Euro portion of its 
investment in Ennismore Limited of Euro 200.0m (2014: Euro 200.0m).
On 24th March 2015 the Company paid back it’s Euro denominated multi currency Revolving Credit Facility of Euro 147.0m 
(2014: Euro 160.0m), closed out it’s forward contract of Euro 53.0m (2014: 40.0m) and drew down on the Revolving Credit Facility 
in Sterling £90.0m (2014: £0.0m). On the same day the Company closed out the FRS 101 fair value hedge against the designated 
Euro portion of its investment in Ennismore Limited of Euro 200.0m (2014: Euro 200.0m) with the resulting loss being taken to the 
income statement, where it is fully offset by the exchange gain resulting from the re-translation of the Revolving Credit Facility and 
the forward contract at the same date.
Directors consider the value of investments to be supported by underlying assets.

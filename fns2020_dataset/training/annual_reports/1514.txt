Jim Meredith
Non-executive Chairman
2013 was a year of signiﬁcant change for the Group, 
during which the business delivered improved revenues 
and proﬁt from continuing operations, whilst continuing to 
grow in key markets. 
Net revenue for the year, excluding landﬁll tax and inter-
segment trading, increased by 10% to £40.3m (2012: 
£36.8m). The total proﬁt attributable to our shareholders 
before exceptional items (including impairment charges 
for the write off of assets and goodwill associated with 
the closed Waste Network division) was £2.4m (2012: 
£1.7m). Operating cash ﬂows of £5.9m (2012: £5.8m) 
supported an enhanced level of capital investment and an 
increase to our stake in the Augean North Sea Services 
business, taking our holding to 81%.
The year began with the departure of Paul Blackler and 
the appointment of Dr Stewart Davies as Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer. Stewart is now well established within the 
business and has brought the fresh thinking and insight 
the Board hoped for at the time of his appointment. The 
new strategy for the Group, developed by Stewart and his 
management team with input from the Board, is outlined 
below, conﬁrming our belief that Augean has numerous 
realisable opportunities to support growth of the business 
in the coming months and years.
During the year the Group continued to be restructured 
and reshaped to ensure that the business was fully 
focused on our key markets in hazardous waste, Air 
Pollution Control Residues (APCR) management, 
radioactive waste disposal and North Sea oil and gas. 
These changes included the decision to close the Waste 
Network division and offer certain sites and assets for 
sale, a process which is now complete. 
As in the previous year there were improvements to health 
and safety performance during 2013. Health and safety 
continues to be the number one priority of the Board and 
management across the Group and we were pleased to 
note a second consecutive year with a 25% decline in 
accidents. The Augean North Sea Services business led 
the way in safety standards, recording eight years without 
a lost time incident in offshore operations. The Board is 
well aware of the dangers for our staff working in offshore 
environments as well as those onshore associated 
with the handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous 
wastes. This commitment to high standards of safety was 
underlined by the activities of the Health & Safety scrutiny 
committee, led by a non-executive director and reporting 
directly to the Board, which further enhanced health and 
safety leadership within the business during the year. 
I was pleased to note the addition of new shareholders to 
our register during the year and continued support from 
many of our longer-holding investors. The improvement in 
share price represented another step forward in ensuring 
that the Group provides growth in the returns for all 
investors, whilst the Board remains focused on improving 
the returns from capital employed. 
I believe that Augean is stronger now than at any point 
during the past ﬁve years. Reﬂecting that conﬁdence, 
the Board has proposed a 40% increase in the dividend 
payment to 0.35p per share and has agreed to 
progressively increase the dividend in the coming years, 
in line with improvements to business performance. 
With improving economic conditions in the UK, a 
refreshed strategy and several new opportunities under 
development I look forward to another year of growth and 
enhanced returns for shareholders during 2014.

Overview
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement Q What will Augean do to increase proﬁtability?
A Building our position in the growth markets and targeting 
further proﬁtable revenue growth from added value 
services are key drivers of proﬁtability improvement. Further 
margin growth will come from operational efﬁciencies as 
we progress initiatives to realise lower cost end-to-end 
processing including accessing optimum energy-from-waste 
capacity.
Q What has changed in the strategy? What will stop? 
What will remain and what will be new?
A The strategy, which is summarised in the Strategic Report, 
represents a further emphasis on getting closer to clients to 
deliver specialist services based on Augean’s hazardous and 
radioactive waste management capabilities. As a matter of 
principle we intend to stop lower margin value destroying 
activities, thus reducing our dependence on broker trade 
and exiting national coverage of transfer stations. The sale 
of our Waste Networks business exempliﬁes this, as this 
business was based on broker trade, and one-removed 
from the waste producer, thus preventing the client-focused 
service strategy. We remain committed to maintaining and 
developing the key assets in treatment and landﬁll that make 
Augean a ‘go-to’ company for specialist waste management 
capability. What will be new is a focus on securing more 
long-term contracts where Augean is providing direct clients 
with innovative solutions in which support services are a key 
component, supported by a wider ‘Integrator’ capability. In 
addition, we will be offering a broader array of North Sea 
services and intensifying our radioactive waste focus.
Q What are the key market trends in waste management 
from Augean’s perspective?
A The latest Environment Agency data shows broadly 
ﬂat overall volumes of hazardous waste consigned by 
producers. Augean is growing revenues in this market 
because, ﬁrstly, we are focused on growth sectors, 
particularly hazardous and radioactive wastes arising from 
oil & gas, nuclear decommissioning and energy from waste 
and, secondly, we are progressing our strategy of carrying 
out more added value treatment and services.
Q How is Augean organised to address its preferred 
sectors?
A We have carried out some reorganisation to align our 
business with the key markets conﬁrmed by our recent 
strategy work. The Oil & Gas sector is served by Augean 
North Sea Services, the subsidiary company in which the 
Group now owns 81%. The division previously titled Oil & 
Gas Services will be renamed to conﬁrm its focus on the 
reﬁnery, chemicals and manufacturing sectors. The creation 
of the new Radioactive Waste Services division provides a 
direct face to the nuclear and radioactives markets, with a 
remit to grow added-value services. Land Resources will 
continue to sharpen our focus on the fast growing energy 
from waste sector, as well as the continuing importance of 
the soils and demolition waste market. Our new Integrated 
Services division will accelerate the development of our 
services to total waste management customers. 
IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT 
SINCE HIS APPOINTMENT AS CEO, 
DR STEWART DAVIES SHARES HIS 
VIEWS ON THE AUGEAN BUSINESS 
AND THE FUTURE FOR THE GROUP.

www.augeanplc.com Stock code: AUG
Q&A with Stewart Davies, Chief Executive Q Where is Augean strong, and where must Augean build 
capability?
A Augean has strong positions in UK hazardous waste, owning 
approximately half of the forward landﬁll capacity in the UK 
with planning and permitting secured. We have an excellent 
reputation for our rigorous approach to technical issues and 
compliance, including being the only waste management 
operator to have a UKAS-accredited laboratory which 
ensures that our decisions are based on the highest 
standards of testing. We are proud of the expertise of 
our people, be they front-line employees carrying out our 
stringent waste management procedures, front-ofﬁce staff 
interfacing with our customers or directors meeting with 
regulators and policy makers to discuss the most effective 
way to deliver the UK’s strategy and policies for hazardous 
waste management.
 We will build on our expertise in our key markets so that 
we can fulﬁl a more innovative partnering role with our 
customers as we address together the developing waste 
management needs of their sector. Our capability in 
delivering solutions for customers that include services 
and client-site facilities will be developed, learning from the 
successes of the North Sea Services business and the ﬁrst 
contracts of Augean Integrated Services.
Q How will you approach investment and dividend 
payments?
A With a three year track record in improving proﬁtability, 
a commitment to taking this further and a strong list of 
opportunities for the Group to invest for growth, Augean is 
well-positioned to pursue a strategy which will grow returns 
from investments. We do not see this as tightly linked to 
the UK macro-economic cycle as the Group’s key markets 
are more strongly inﬂuenced by investment in infrastructure 
in sectors that have different drivers, for example North 
Sea decommissioning. As a growth company, Augean 
will continue to have opportunities to provide returns on 
investment projects that exceed the return required by 
shareholders – our project hurdle rate is >15% Internal 
Rate of Return pre-tax. Thus to progress the strategy most 
effectively, investment for growth will be required, whilst 
seeking to progressively increase dividend payments year 
on year. 
Q How will you utilise the Group’s debt facilities?
A Our strategy is to increase cash from operations, providing 
funds for growth, supported by appropriate debt facilities. 
As long as there continue to be investment opportunities 
that advance the Group’s strategy and deliver returns 
over the hurdle rate, investing in these opportunities will 
use a combination of operating cash and debt. The new 
debt ﬁnancing arrangements with HSBC conﬁrm that the 
business is in shape to carry up to the £15m debt facility. 
Q What principles guide Augean’s approach to 
acquisitions?
A Buying our way into new markets risks destroying 
shareholder value unless there are operational and market 
synergies that we are conﬁdent can be delivered. Our most 
recent experience, buying into North Sea Services, has 
beneﬁted from the ability to process materials internally 
within the Group and sell the combined capabilities to the 
market successfully. We will apply this learning in the future 
as we consider potential acquisitions that would accelerate 
the Group’s strategy and enhance shareholder returns.
Q Where will the Group be in three years time?
A We expect to be more proﬁtable, larger scale and more 
strongly positioned as a leader in our target market sectors. 
More of our business will be in long term contracts with 
Tier 1 waste-producing customers who value the solutions 
we provide on their sites as well as in our own facilities. 
The Group will generate a higher proportion of its proﬁts 
coming from services and treatment, and will be recycling 
and recovering resources from more of the waste it is 
managing. Recognised as an expert and innovative player 
in the industry, we will be at the top-table discussing the 
development of the UK’s hazardous waste management 
strategy. The increased resilience of our businesses 
will support shareholder conﬁdence and should sustain 
improved shareholder returns.

Our Organisation AT AUGEAN WE AIM TO 
ALIGN OUR ACTIVITIES 
WITH KEY MARKETS 
AND REGULATIONS
The Waste Hierarchy
Waste management practices are based on a hierarchy 
of activities deﬁned by environmental law and regulations. 
This Waste Hierarchy assumes that the most favoured 
outcome is prevention, where no waste is generated and 
no management is required. At Augean we operate in 
markets where waste is produced, is usually hazardous in 
nature and does require active management to avoid any 
adverse impact on society and the environment.
Each of our ﬁve operating divisions are aligned with 
well deﬁned waste markets, each requiring a different 
blend of knowledge, expertise, treatment and disposal 
assets to successfully manage each customer’s critical 
waste needs. Our focus is to ensure that the services we 
provide deliver the best overall environmental outcome, 
irrespective of where that places the activity on the  
Waste Hierarchy.

Strategic Report
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Our Business & Strategy
Strategic Report The Group operates in three major UK-based markets, 
being the broad hazardous waste market, waste from 
nuclear decommissioning and waste from North Sea oil 
and gas exploration and production. 
The market for hazardous waste in the UK is based 
on a legislative environment underpinned by the 
implementation of the European Union’s Waste 
Framework Directive and the UK’s own hazardous waste 
National Policy Statement (NPS), which encourage 
sustainable methods of managing waste and the 
development of treatment, recycling and recovery facilities 
as the key focus of future waste management activities. 
Within this the Waste Hierarchy provides a framework for 
waste management and implementation of infrastructure 
which will allow sustainable waste management solutions. 
The adoption of the NPS in June 2013 conﬁrmed the 
need for the portfolio of facilities and services developed 
by Augean over the past ﬁve years. Importantly, the Group 
plays an active part in ﬁve of the seven sectors identiﬁed 
as essential for the management of hazardous wastes in 
the UK.
The hazardous waste market is highly segmented with a 
total volume of approximately 4 million tonnes of waste 
handled in the UK each year. Within this arena Augean 
continues to focus on the treatment and disposal of 
waste from construction and demolition activities, energy 
from waste operators, specialist manufacturers and 
other industrial producers. The Group’s high temperature 
incinerator at East Kent operates within the narrower 
segment of clinical and pharmaceutical wastes. 
Data published by the Environment Agency during 2013 
on the production of hazardous waste indicated that 
approximately 1 million tonnes are disposed to hazardous 
landﬁll sites per annum (the most recent data available) 
(Source: Environment Agency; www.environmentagency.
gov.uk) and the total UK capacity for hazardous landﬁll 
was approximately 16 million tonnes. Augean’s Land 
Resources division continues to be a leading provider 
within this market, holding approximately 50% of the UK’s 
remaining hazardous landﬁll capacity. 
Augean’s treatment and disposal to landﬁll includes the 
management of certain by-products from energy from 
waste incinerators (EfW). These facilities produce air 
pollution control residues (APCR) and also a heavier 
bottom ash. The Group has developed the capability to 
treat and dispose of APCR at our sites at Port Clarence 
and East Northants Resource Management Facility 
(ENRMF), handling approximately 40% of the total traded 
volume during 2013. This market, of approximately 
200,000 tonnes per annum, is expected to double over 
the next three years as the number of EfW facilities 
increases. 
The landﬁll market is underpinned by legislation 
derived from the Landﬁll Directive, within which certain 
exemptions (known as ‘derogations’) were originally 
allowed for the disposal of wastes to landﬁll with elevated 
levels of lead and/or chlorides. These derogations were 
to be progressively removed as the waste industry 
developed new treatment methods for the control of 
these substances prior to landﬁlling, or indeed their 
complete diversion from landﬁll disposal. As the body 
responsible for the implementation of the Directive in the 
UK, the Environment Agency (EA) began a consultation 
process for the removal of the derogations in February 
12
www.augeanplc.com Stock code: AUG
Marketplace 2014. The EA has indicated that the current derogations 
will be phased out over a two year period. Augean has 
anticipated removal of derogations and invested in new 
treatment facilities at the ENRMF and Port Clarence sites, 
meaning that the business is well placed to deal with the 
impact of future derogations removals and, with further 
investment under review, to provide a comprehensive 
hazardous waste treatment service for the growing EfW 
market. 
The nuclear decommissioning market relates to the 
closure and dismantling of the UK’s redundant nuclear 
power and research facilities, managed on behalf of 
the UK government by the Nuclear Decommissioning 
Authority (NDA). In addition to this, the disposal of 
naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) generated 
in the exploration for and production of oil and gas is also 
a key radioactive waste market for the Group. The NDA 
publishes regular updates on the inventory of radioactive 
wastes requiring disposal, whilst reliable statistics on 
the scale of the NORM market remain limited. Augean 
has planning permission and environmental permits in 
place to dispose of low activity low level waste (LLW), 
very low level waste (VLLW) and NORM. Based on public 
information and our own estimates we believe that up to 
6,000 tonnes of LLW/VLLW are generated in the UK each 
year. We also estimate that up to 2,000 tonnes of NORM 
may be released per annum.
The markets for waste produced in the exploration for 
North Sea oil and gas are centred on Aberdeen and 
extend to the Shetland Isles for the northern sector, and 
for the southern sector are centred on Great Yarmouth, 
Norfolk. The Group provides services for a range of 
offshore wastes, including the cuttings from drilling of oil 
and gas wells, oil-contaminated water (known as Slops) 
and a more general range of industrial hazardous wastes. 
Information published by the UK government indicates 
that the market for drill cuttings represents 36,000 
tonnes per annum and for Slops a further 56,000 tonnes 
per annum. The Group’s market share in each of these 
markets is estimated as 40% and 20% respectively.

Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Our Business & Strategy
Strategic Report Following his appointment as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, 
Dr Stewart Davies has undertaken a strategy review to 
further develop the Group’s strategy and provide the 
necessary direction to position the Group for successful 
growth. The review is now complete and the conclusions 
are summarised in this Report.
Core strategy
The core strategy of the Group is to grow shareholder 
value by building market share and developing sustainable 
market positions. To do this we will increasingly work with 
customers to provide solutions whereby Augean delivers 
specialist services focused on hazardous waste.
Develop sustainable market positions
The strategy is to focus on attractive markets for specialist 
waste, selected based on objective criteria that have been 
revisited in the business strategy review. This exercise has 
been undertaken with the expertise within the Group and 
also made use of independent facilitation and challenge. 
The decision to exit from the Waste Network division was 
made early in the process due to the limited prospects for 
proﬁtable growth in the medium term.
A key target of the business is enhancing returns and 
Augean is well positioned in attractive markets, both 
sectoral and regional, where we have expertise and 
assets, including treatment technologies that differentiate 
our service and build entry barriers. Understanding 
these markets enables us to progressively develop the 
capabilities required to maintain and build our position 
often against the background of changing environmental 
or client requirements. These require timely investments 
that are included in the business planning process.
Moving more of the Group’s revenues from the prevalent 
‘spot’ or short term contracts to long term contracts 
and frameworks is vital to improve the forward visibility 
of the order book. The current position represents an 
opportunity to increase our mutual commitment with 
customers, with attendant beneﬁts of creating more value. 
Vital to sustaining our market positions is further 
developing Augean’s strong reputation and relationships, 
built by management with ‘outside-in’ understanding 
of each sector. Recent Director-level appointments 
conﬁrm the Group’s progress in building a top team with 
outstanding knowledge of the key market sectors.
Grow through client-focused solutions
As noted above, the Group has further opportunities to 
work more closely with customers (organisations whose 
operations produce the hazardous waste) rather than 
intermediaries and on a longer-term contracted basis.
Working to understand the client’s need, and then 
developing a solution by leveraging the knowledge of 
sector experts, has been identiﬁed as a fundamentally 
important new focus for the Group. This is an area 
where we have already seen considerable success with 
North Sea oil and gas operators and with high value 
manufacturing companies. We are taking steps to ensure 
that innovation opportunities arising from customer 
interfaces are identiﬁed and managed effectively.

Our Strategy The business strategy review has highlighted the beneﬁts 
of combining our hazardous waste management 
capability with expertise in offering associated support 
services. Targeting the critical but non-core needs of 
clients requiring hazardous waste management is where 
the potential for value-creating support services is highest 
for the Group. Half of the Management Board directors 
have signiﬁcant support service experience, enabling the 
Group to develop by offering solutions that are supported 
by integrated service and management capabilities. 
Selling and delivering one complete Augean capability 
brings consequent beneﬁts to the client of working with a 
uniquely capable partner and to the Group of accessing 
its share of value created through this longer-term, more 
integrated relationship with customers.
Increase shareholder value
Along with important continuing contributions from the 
Group’s traditional markets in construction and industrial 
hazardous waste, we see proﬁtable revenue growth from 
investments which increase our capabilities in our key 
markets, notably nuclear decommissioning, North Sea oil 
and gas and ash from Energy from Waste incinerators. 
Growing the proportion of our revenues that come from 
service offerings to our hazardous waste customers 
should further drive proﬁtable revenue growth. 
The business strategy review has highlighted the next 
phase of reduction in end-to-end processing costs, 
particularly in the processing of oil-contaminated water, 
drill cuttings and industrial wastes. As these are delivered 
they will contribute to margin improvement.
The Group is well-positioned to identify potential 
corporate investments associated with its key market 
sectors that would accelerate the strategy and provide 
clear operational and market synergies. We will bring 
these forward as and when suitable opportunities are 
identiﬁed.

The right knowledge and experience
At Augean our staff are essential to the success of our 
business. Working with hazardous waste introduces 
a number of risks, which are dealt with every day by 
competent operators with the appropriate knowledge and 
skills to deliver to high standards. Dealing with difﬁcult 
waste streams may require expertise in chemistry, in 
use of complex technology, or in the most appropriate 
working practices. It also requires a strong understanding 
of health, safety and environmental compliance, from 
using the right assets and tools to wearing the right

Strategic Report “FOR THE CONTINUING 
OPERATIONS ADJUSTED 
PROFIT BEFORE TAX WAS 
£4.4M, AN INCREASE OF 
£0.5M FROM 2012.”
Stewart Davies
Chief Executive Officer
Introduction
The Group delivered improved revenues and earnings 
during the year, with revenue from the combined 
continuing and discontinued operations rising by 11% 
from the previous period. This improvement was driven 
by strong second half performances in the continuing 
operations of the Group, in particular Land Resources 
and Augean North Sea Services (ANSS). Exceptional 
impairment and project charges of £4.0m were required 
against discontinued operations following the closure and 
offer for sale of the Waste Network division. Performance 
improvements were delivered from each of the continuing 
operations of the Group.
During 2013 the Group operated through three divisions 
and the North Sea Services subsidiary. The ﬁnancial 
results included in this report are based on that structure. 
The majority of the disposed Waste Network division 
is included as a discontinued operation, whilst the 
continuing operations refer to Land Resources, Oil & Gas 
Services, Augean North Sea Services and the East Kent 
Waste Recovery Facility and the newly formed Augean 
Integrated Services. 
The Board reported in September 2013 that it had 
taken the decision to sell or close the underperforming 
Waste Network division. This business had been formed 
from waste management facilities purchased by the 
Group during the period from 2006 to 2008. Despite 
restructuring, investment in sales resources and latterly 
cost reduction initiatives, the division and its precursors 
had sustained consistent losses over the previous ﬁve 
years as waste transfer markets were squeezed during 
the economic downturn. The assets of the division were 
offered for sale during the ﬁnal quarter of 2013 and 
numerous enquiries were received from prospective 
buyers. This led to two separate transactions, one 
involving the sale of the business and site at Hinckley to 
Greenway Environmental Limited and the other based 
on the sale of the business at Rochdale and the site at 
Worcester to Cleansing Service Group Limited. These 
transactions were completed in March 2014, with 
combined consideration received of £1.2m.
Adjusted proﬁt before tax (PBT) for the combined 
continuing and discontinued operations increased to 
£3.2m in the year, a 22% growth over 2012. For the 
continuing operations adjusted PBT was £4.4m, an 
increase of £0.5m from 2012.
During the year an opportunity arose to increase Augean’s 
stake in ANSS, through the purchase of 11% of the equity 
from our joint-venture partner Scomi Oiltools (Europe) 
Limited. The purchase was completed during July for a 
consideration of £0.3m, resulting in Augean owning 81% 
of the total equity. With the ANSS business continuing 
to grow and with future opportunities for further 
development the increased shareholding is expected to 
improve the returns from the capital employed available 
from the business.

Operating Review The operating cash ﬂow generated by the Group during 
the year was reinvested in new assets and facilities to 
support generation of future revenues and cash ﬂows. 
Capital investment of £6.3m included strengthening the 
Group’s capabilities in the growing markets of Energy 
from Waste and North Sea oil and gas exploration. In 
addition, two new landﬁll cells were constructed at the 
ENRMF and Port Clarence sites, adding 340,000 m
3
 of 
void space to the constructed landﬁll capacity. With the 
addition of 1.6 million m
3
 potential future void space 
following the successful planning permission applications 
at ENRMF and Thornhaugh, the Group now holds an 
estimated 9.5 million m
3
 of potential landﬁll void. To 
support working capital and these investments the 
£10.0m banking facility with HSBC remained in place 
throughout the year. In March 2014 those facilities were 
reﬁnanced through to July 2017, extending the available 
debt funding to £15.0m (see below).
The Group employed an average of 292 staff (2012: 268) 
over the course of the year. This included 218 staff in 
the core business and a further 74 in Augean North Sea 
Services. At the end of the year 293 staff were employed 
by the Group, but this number fell to 280 in January 2014 
following redundancies associated with the sale of the 
Waste Network division. 
Planning and permitting
The securing of planning permission and maintenance 
of appropriate environmental permits at the Group’s 
sites is an essential part of the ongoing operations 
and future development of the business. On 10 July 
2013 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local 
Government granted a Development Consent Order 
(DCO) for the extension of the landﬁll site at ENRMF. This 
site provides treatment and disposal services for a range 
of remediated soils and building rubble, APCR and low 
activity radioactive wastes and is the principal hazardous 
waste landﬁll site in the South of England. The planning 
permission granted through the DCO allows the life of 
the site to be extended to 31 December 2026, which 
will result in an increase in the capacity of the existing 
treatment facility and construction of in excess of  
1 million m
3
 of new hazardous landﬁll void space. 
ENRMF was the ﬁrst hazardous landﬁll site in the UK 
to dispose of LLW from former nuclear power stations 
and research facilities under the control of the Nuclear 
Decommissioning Authority (NDA). The site will continue 
to treat and dispose remediated soils, APCR and low 
activity radioactive wastes, making a major contribution 
to the national infrastructure required to manage these 
specialist waste types (as set out in the UK’s Hazardous 
Waste National Policy Statement, published in June 
2013). It is expected to continue to be the largest 
contributor to the Group’s revenue and operating proﬁt, 
providing a solid platform for the future development 
of the business with positive returns from the capital 
employed. 
Performance 
The Group operated through three divisions (Land 
Resources, Waste Network and Oil & Gas Services) 
and a subsidiary company, Augean North Sea Services. 
Waste Network included continuing and discontinued 
operations. The performance of each of these is reported 
below.

Our Performance
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013 “THE DIVISION 
DELIVERED 
IMPROVEMENTS TO 
THE MIX OF WASTES 
TREATED AND 
DISPOSED AT THE SITES, 
ENHANCING MARGINS...”
In the Land Resources division (renamed Energy & 
Construction during 2014) revenues excluding landﬁll 
tax and inter-segment trading were £15.2m, a reduction 
from the previous year (2012: £15.7m). Volumes of waste 
disposed fell to 295,472 tonnes during the year, from 
320,392 tonnes in 2012, reﬂecting a stable landﬁll market 
for hazardous waste disposal but compared against a 
very strong ﬁrst quarter during 2012. 
The division delivered improvements to the mix of wastes 
treated and disposed at the sites, enhancing margins 
as decreased volume of lower value soil remediation 
work was replaced by APCR ash from incinerators and 
low level radioactive wastes. The average price for pre-
treatment and disposal services also increased, to £50.4/
tonne (2012: £44.9/tonne) as the mix of waste continued 
to move away from traditional hazardous and non-
hazardous direct disposal landﬁll activities towards pre-
treatment solutions. Hazardous landﬁll activities continued 
to be the largest revenue driver for the business, 
delivering £8.5m, although this did represent a reduction 
from 2012 (£10.4m).
The volume of APCR handled by the division rose by 
47%, to 86,000 tonnes, as new treatment facilities were 
commissioned at the ENRMF site. The contribution from 
APCR sales to the divisional revenues increased by £1.4m 
over the previous year and with the investment made 
the division now has the capacity to treat, recycle and 
dispose of approximately 90,000 tonnes of APCR each 
year. Market opportunities exist to support further growth 
of this capacity during 2014.
www.augeanplc.com Stock code: AUG
Augean Land Resources
Disposal of low activity radioactive wastes also increased 
from the previous year, with £1.6m of revenue generated, 
an increase of £1.0m over 2012 (£0.6m). The division has 
continued to work within the NDA-sponsored national 
supply chain for disposal of VLLW and LLW from the UK’s 
nuclear estate and has also increased its presence as 
a provider of disposal services to producers of NORM. 
In November the Group announced the creation of a 
new Radioactive Waste Services unit, headed by a new 
director with signiﬁcant nuclear industry experience. 
This change is expected to build upon Augean’s well 
established position as a major provider of low level waste 
disposal solutions to the nuclear and oil and gas sectors.
Other revenue streams, from energy generation using 
landﬁll gas and minerals extracted under a royalty 
agreement at the Cooks Hole site, contributed £0.3m to 
operating proﬁt, performing in line with expectations.
In total the division delivered improved operating proﬁt 
before exceptional items of £7.1m during 2013 (2012: 
£6.7m), driven by increasing volumes of APCR and low 
level radioactive wastes.
In support of the division’s status as the primary proﬁt unit 
of the Group, investment continued in assets which will 
provide a medium term return, spending £3.3m, including 
the construction of two new hazardous landﬁll cells at Port 
Clarence and ENRMF. The cells will provide a combined 
additional 340,000 m
3
 of landﬁll void space (capacity 
for approx. 475,000 tonnes of waste) for use over the 
next two to three years. Investment also allowed the 
completion of a new tank farm and treatment plant at Port 
Clarence, supporting the growth of the APCR business 
and backed by new contracts for APCR disposal. 
24 “...THE DIVISION 
ACHIEVED ITS TARGET 
OF DELIVERING 
POSITIVE EBITDA 
DURING THE YEAR.”
Sales revenues in the Oil & Gas Services division (O&GS), 
excluding inter-segment trading, fell from £11.1m in 2012 
to £9.6m in 2013, but this was driven by the impact of 
growing inter-company transactions within the Group 
between O&GS and ANSS, totalling £1.9m in the year. 
O&GS operates the Port Clarence Waste Recovery Park 
and provides treatment and disposal services to ANSS 
for drill cuttings received from offshore oil and gas drilling 
operators. This pre-existing relationship was internalised 
following the acquisition of ANSS by the Group in May 
2012 and the services provided by O&GS continue to be 
a core component of the Group’s ambition to develop a 
strong presence in North Sea waste markets. 
At Port Clarence Waste Recovery Park the division 
continued to develop its capabilities during the year for 
the treatment and disposal of waste from North Sea oil 
and gas exploration. The Indirect Thermal Desorption 
unit at the site was upgraded with a new rotating drum, 
extending the life of the facility by ten years. In addition 
a new lagoon was built as a storage facility for drill 
cutting wastes, enhancing the site’s ability to deal with 
increasing volumes of drill cuttings secured by ANSS. The 
quality of the assets at Port Clarence and the continuous 
improvement of the procedures required to operate them 
were recognised in positive feedback from customer 
audits undertaken during the year.
Underlying sales for the division, excluding all inter-
segment trading, were stable year on year, supported 
by activity at the Avonmouth and Paisley sites. Paisley 
beneﬁted from restructuring undertaken during 2012 
and a sharper focus on its key markets and customers. 
The industrial cleaning services provided from the site 
continued to develop and lower margin transfer work was 
reduced. At Avonmouth the business was focused on 
oil and solvent recovery and supported by the addition 
of transfer station capacity. New disposal routes for oil 
sludges were sourced and opened, which began to 
reduce the operating costs of the facility. These beneﬁts 
are expected to continue into 2014.
Reductions to operating costs and a focus on margin-
enhancing activities reduced the operating losses (before 
exceptional items) of the division by £0.1m to £1.0m. 
With depreciation costs of £1.0m the division achieved 
its target of delivering positive EBITDA during the year, 
at £0.05m. Although small, the positive EBITDA provides 
a platform for continuing improvements during 2014, 
particularly through the reduction of waste disposal costs 
with disposal routes secured under contracts.
The division will be renamed Industry & Infrastructure 
during 2014.

Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Augean Oil & Gas Services “REVENUES...
INCREASED TO £9.3M...
ACTIVITY GREW IN ALL 
THE KEY REVENUE 
STREAMS OF THE 
BUSINESS...”
In its ﬁrst full year of trading ANSS exceeded expectations 
for revenues, operating proﬁt and EBITDA. The business 
became well established as a provider of waste 
management services to North Sea oil and gas operators, 
with a strengthening presence in the Aberdeen-based 
market. Revenues, excluding inter-segment sales, 
increased to £9.3m, from £3.4m during 2012. The volume 
of activity grew in all the key revenue streams of the 
business, including the volume of drill cuttings and slops 
managed on behalf of customers and the presence of 
ANSS personnel and equipment on drilling rigs to provide 
offshore waste management services.
To ensure that ANSS had the infrastructure in place to 
grow its presence in North Sea waste management 
markets the Board took a decision during the year 
to allow the majority of the EBITDA generated by the 
business in 2013 to be reinvested in new facilities and 
assets. EBITDA of £1.0m was generated during 2013 
and capital expenditure of £1.0m matched this result. The 
business invested in new facilities and also equipment to 
support its offshore waste management activities.
Augean North Sea Services
New facilities included the purchase of a long term lease 
for a permitted waste management site at Tullos in 
Aberdeen, which was completed during the ﬁrst quarter, 
at a cost of £0.1m, and subsequent work to develop 
the assets into an effective waste transfer station and 
treatment centre. During the second half of the year the 
business also purchased a site at Blackdog in Aberdeen, 
costing £0.2m, providing facilities for the management 
of drill cuttings prior to transport to Port Clarence and 
also for development of slops treatment. With an existing 
slops tank farm at Pocra Quay and access to treatment 
capabilities within the broader Augean Group, ANSS 
now has the capability to offer a comprehensive range of 
waste management services to its customers. 
During the year the Board reiterated its conﬁdence in the 
future potential of ANSS by authorising the purchase of a 
further 11% of the share capital of the business, by way 
of a debt to equity swap with our partners Scomi Oiltools 
(Europe) Ltd (Scomi). Augean cancelled debts owed by 
Scomi valued at £0.3m to acquire an additional £0.4m 
of the net assets of ANSS. This has increased Augean’s 
ownership to 81%, with Scomi retaining the remaining 
19%, and generated a £0.1m credit to the Group’s 
retained earnings.
For the full year ANSS delivered operating proﬁt before 
exceptional items of £0.7m.
26 26
www.augeanplc.com Stock code: AUG “THE CONTINUING 
ACTIVITIES...ARE BASED 
ON CONTRACTS WITH 
A SMALL NUMBERS OF 
KEY CUSTOMERS...”
The performance of the Waste Network division is 
presented in the ﬁnancial statements contained in 
this report split between continuing operations and 
discontinued operations. Continuing operations relate 
to the East Kent Waste Recovery Facility (EKWRF) 
and certain waste management activities based at the 
Cannock site now included in the new Augean Integrated 
Services business. The discontinued operations relate 
to former waste transfer stations at Hinckley, Worcester 
and Rochdale and the associated assets, vehicles and 
sales and support activities which are no longer owned or 
operated by the Group.
The continuing operation of the high temperature 
incinerator at EKWRF experienced breakdowns during 
the ﬁrst half of the year, causing signiﬁcant outages 
and resulting in throughput of waste for incineration 
below the levels required to generate positive ﬁnancial 
results. Further downtime was incurred while the solid 
feed handling systems of the plant were refurbished 
during the third quarter, along with other essential plant 
modiﬁcations and upgrades. The extended period of 
limited throughput had a signiﬁcant impact on the results 
for the year. Revenues for the site were below plan at 
£1.5m (2012: £1.1m) and resulted in operating losses 
(before overhead allocations) of £0.9m. Capital investment 
of £0.4m was required to upgrade the plant during the 
year and the beneﬁt of this is expected to support delivery 
of a positive operating proﬁt performance during 2014. 
The investment allowed throughput to be stabilised by the 
end of the year and an acceptable level of throughput to 
be re-established, in line with that planned, during the ﬁrst 
quarter of 2014.
The continuing activities retained by the Group from 
the former Waste Network transfer stations are based 
on contracts with a small number of key customers to 
whom the new AIS business will provide a range of waste 
management services. These customers and activities 
generated £1.2m of revenue during 2013 at a gross 
margin of approximately 60%. This margin is signiﬁcantly 
higher than the average for the former waste transfer 
stations and provides a sound platform for the new 
business.
The discontinued operations of the division generated 
revenues after inter-segment sales of £3.6m, with an 
operating loss before exceptional items of £1.3m. The 
losses included the overhead costs associated with 
operating the waste transfer sites, including sales, 
technical and support activities. As part of the sale 
process for the business based at the sites at Hinckley, 
Worcester and Rochdale a signiﬁcant reduction was 
also made to the overhead costs carried by the Group. 
This led to a review of support costs across the Group 
to establish a lower cost base and also resulted in 11 
redundancies for those employees associated with the 
activities of the Waste Network division who did not 
transfer to new employers. Cost savings of up to £1.0m 
per annum have been enabled through the overhead 
reductions. 
Augean Integrated Services and East Kent Waste 
Recovery Facility will be managed as a single operating 
division during 2014.

Corporate Social Responsibility  
(CSR) Performance
The Group continues to deliver the objectives of 
BAT through its operations and works closely with 
the regulators to ensure that Augean is a leader in 
compliance in the sector. Activities are delivered subject 
to well developed environmental controls and compliance 
systems (as deﬁned in the Integrated Management 
System), involving suitably competent people in 
the management of all aspects of its operations. 
Environmental reporting is prepared and monitored 
within the Group and supplemented by information from 
regulators. This includes the Environment Agency’s own 
review of companies operating in the waste sector which 
are subject to their account management regime, of 
which Augean is one. The information available for 2013 
indicates that the Group’s operations do not result in a 
signiﬁcant impact on the local environment and in general 
our environmental performance has improved signiﬁcantly 
over the past ﬁve years. The KPI table below includes the 
scores from the Environment Agency (EA) in England and 
the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) in 
Scotland and demonstrate a year on year improvement. 
The Board recognises the important role played by the 
Group in the environment and communities within which 
it operates. The health and safety of our employees 
and compliance with regulations are two of the top 
three business priorities (proﬁt performance being the 
third). Augean is committed to conducting its business 
operations in an open and responsible manner and we 
recognise the need to continually improve our operations 
where practical to do so in order to reduce our impact 
on the environment, to continuously improve assets 
and processes to ensure the safety and welfare of our 
employees and to act as a good neighbour, minimising 
the impact of our operations on the wider community.
The Group has a commitment to mitigating any adverse 
effects of its operations and this is explained further in the 
detailed CSR report published alongside this Report.
The environment
All operating sites and activities are strictly regulated by 
environmental authorities through a range of regulations 
set out in the permits for each site. In the context of 
hazardous waste the principal instruments driving 
standards are the Waste Framework Directive and the 
Industrial Emissions Directive which provide an integrated 
approach to pollution control to prevent emissions into air, 
land or water. The standards expect the techniques and 
procedures adopted by the Group to represent the Best 
Available Technique (BAT). BAT requires a review of each 
activity and the implementation of the highest standards 
to minimise emissions, be energy efﬁcient, reduce waste 
and consumption of raw materials, manage noise, 
vibration and heat loss and ensure accident prevention is 
in place. 29
Strategic Report Strategic Report
Our Performance
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
As part of our commitment to implement the elements of 
the waste hierarchy relevant to the hazardous sector the 
Group continues to take a strong role in the development 
of regulation and policy for hazardous waste. By engaging 
with Government departments, local authorities and the 
regulators, we promote the industry and modernisation 
of the sector, seeking to establish a positive regulatory 
and policy framework for the business. In previous years 
representatives from the Group took a high proﬁle role in 
the development of the National Policy Statement (NPS) 
for hazardous waste, directly engaging with Government 
departments and giving evidence at the Parliamentary 
Select Committee inquiry. The publication of the NPS 
shows Augean to be strongly aligned with the direction of 
national policy. The Company continues to engage on key 
policy development and is currently taking an active role in 
the forthcoming NORM strategy.
Employees
The Group’s employees are vital to its success and 
during the year made a signiﬁcant contribution to the 
performance improvements outlined in this report. In 
recognition of their commitment and effort the Board 
approved a 2.0% pay award for all management and staff 
from 1 January 2014. This award seeks to balance the 
inﬂationary pressures on costs of living with the need for 
the Group to maintain discipline on cost management, but 
also recognises the progress made by the business over 
the past year which would not have been possible without 
the commitment and hard work of every employee. 30

Corporate Social Responsibility  
(CSR) Performance continued
The Group is committed to the principle of equal 
opportunity in employment and to creating a harmonious 
working environment which is free from harassment and 
bullying and in which every employee is treated with 
respect and dignity. Accordingly, well established policies 
are in place to ensure that recruitment, selection, training, 
development and promotion procedures result in no job 
applicant or employee receiving less favourable treatment 
on the grounds of race, colour, nationality, ethnic or 
national origin, religion or belief, disability, trade union 
membership or non-membership, sex, sexual orientation, 
marital status, age or status as a part-time or ﬁxed-
term employee. The Group’s objective is to ensure that 
individuals are selected, promoted and otherwise treated 
solely on the basis of their relevant aptitudes, skills and 
abilities. 
These equal opportunity policies are set out in the Group’s 
Employee Handbook, a of copy of which is provided to 
each employee on joining the Group and made available 
electronically. The Handbook is updated periodically 
for changes in policy and regulations. The Group also 
operates a clear whistle-blowing policy, providing every 
employee the opportunity to raise concerns directly with 
a nominated director, without the intervention of line 
management. Once an issue is reported the nominated 
director is required to undertake a thorough investigation 
and make recommendations. 
In order to provide a formal, recorded, regular  
review of an individual’s performance, and a plan for 
future development, all staff undertake an annual or 
bi-annual Performance Appraisal with their line manager. 
Appraisals assist in the development of individuals and 
establish individual training needs, improve organisational 
performance, and feed into business planning. Where 
appropriate the appraisal process establishes speciﬁc 
training plans for each individual.
Training and development activity during the year built 
on the progress made during 2012 and investment was 
made to ensure that all employees had the knowledge, 
qualiﬁcations and skills to operate safely and compliantly 
within their speciﬁc role and in the broader waste 
management sector. A competency framework developed 
for each role is now used in the recruitment of new 
employees and also as the basis of a rolling training 
programme.  31
Strategic Report Strategic Report
Our Performance
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
To support commitment to health and safety 
improvements reporting of near miss incidents continued 
to be a key part of the health and safety programme 
during the year, supplemented with safe act reporting 
designed to applaud and encourage safe working 
practice. Over 2,200 near misses and 250 safe acts were 
reported during 2013 (achieving the target of one report 
per employee per month) and at the same time there was 
a 25% reduction from the previous year in the number 
of accidents causing injury to a person or damage to 
property. 
The community
Augean recognises the important role that it has within 
local communities and aims to maintain an open dialogue 
with its neighbours about its activities and plans. This is 
achieved through regular liaison committees, newsletters 
and open days. The establishment of new businesses, 
changes in the waste streams managed and active 
planning processes during the year led to a high level of 
interaction with local communities in some areas. As in 
previous years the Group maintained a programme of 
consultation in these localities to ensure that its plans 
were well known and understood. This included attending 
liaison meetings and hosting open days at sites, in 
addition to the more formal submissions to planning 
authorities. 
The Group continued to contribute to the communities 
around its landﬁll sites through the Landﬁll Tax Credit 
Scheme. A total of £359,000 was contributed through this 
scheme during the year, providing funds for community 
projects, including a sports centre and a wildlife reserve.
Charitable donations made during the year included 
ongoing support for the Underground Youth Club at 
Kings Cliffe, the Cannock Chase Community Centre, 
local sports teams and the John Clare Cottage project in 
Helpston, near Peterborough. “THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS 
DELIVERED A 19% INCREASE TO 
REVENUE OF £43.5M...”
Richard Allen
Finance Director
The review of ﬁnancial performance includes the results 
from the continuing and discontinued operations of the 
Group. Where appropriate, these have been combined to 
indicate the results for the entire business and as such are 
therefore consistent with Full Year Results for 2012 and 
the Interim Results for 2013.
Trading
For the combined continuing and discontinued operations 
net revenue, excluding landﬁll tax and inter-segment 
trading, for the year ended 31 December 2013 increased 
by 10% to £40.3m (2012: £36.8m). With the inclusion 
of landﬁll tax charged to customers, on which the Group 
makes no margin, of £6.8m (2012: £5.7m), combined 
Group revenues rose by 11% to £47.1m (2012: £42.4m). 
The continuing operations delivered a 19% increase to 
revenue of £43.5m (2012: £36.7m).
Operating profit and exceptional items
Operating proﬁt before exceptional items from continuing 
operations increased to £5.1m (2012: £4.6m) and proﬁt 
before tax and exceptional items to £4.4m (2012: £3.9m). 
For the discontinued operations an operating loss of 
£1.3m was recorded. Before charges for exceptional 
items the adjusted proﬁt before tax for the combined 
Group was £3.2m (2012: £2.6m). 
Exceptional items included legal and professional fees 
relating to the sale of the Waste Network assets of £0.1m 
(2012: £nil), redundancy costs associated with the sale 
of £0.1m (2012: £nil) and an impairment charge of £3.9m 
(2012: £nil) representing the difference between the 
carrying value of the Waste Network assets and goodwill 
sold and the consideration expected to be received from 
the sale at 31 December 2013. Total exceptional charges 
of £4.2m were made during the year. 
Finance costs
Total ﬁnance charges reﬂected the payment of interest 
on bank debt and ﬁnance leases, totalling £0.7m (2012: 
£0.6m). This also included a £0.1m (2012: £0.1m) 
unwinding of discounts on provisions. 
Jointly controlled entity
There was no trading during the year in the Group’s 
Terramundo joint venture with DEC NV. As a result 
Terramundo delivered a minor loss of £0.01m (2012: 
£0.02m), relating to loan interest and depreciation 
charges. The joint venture parties remain in discussions 
around the future of the venture.
Corporation tax
The Group paid tax of £0.3m during the year, £0.1m in 
respect of 2013 liabilities and £0.2m in respect of previous 
years. A deferred tax asset of £1.1m (2012: £1.2m) 
was recognised in the statement of ﬁnancial position, 
the Board believing that future proﬁts are probable and 
future tax liabilities will be incurred. A current tax liability 
of £0.3m (2012: £0.2m) was also recognised. A total 
corporation tax charge of £0.6m was included in the 
income statement, split between a charge for continuing 
operations of £1.0m and a credit for discontinued 
operations of £0.4m (total 2012: £0.8m).

Financial Review Profit for the year
Including exceptional charges the combined Group made 
a total loss attributable to equity shareholders of £1.8m. 
This was a reduction from the previous year (2012: 
£2.0m), driven by the losses and impairment charges from 
the discontinued operations. The continuing operations 
of the Group delivered improved year on year trading, but 
this was impacted by movements in exceptional costs 
(2013: £0.2m charge; 2012: £0.3m credit), resulting in 
the proﬁt from continuing operations remaining stable at 
£3.2m (2012: £3.2m).
Dividend
The Board has recommended a dividend of 0.35p per 
share (2012: 0.25p), payable on or after 13 June 2014 
subject to shareholder approval at the annual general 
meeting. The dividend per share has increased by 40% 
from the previous year, reﬂecting increased conﬁdence 
over future prospects and maintaining the Board’s 
commitment to pay an annual dividend to shareholders.
Earnings per share
For the continuing operations the basic earnings per share 
(EPS), adjusted to exclude the impact of exceptional 
costs, were 3.29p (2012: 2.86p) and unadjusted EPS 
were 3.13p (2012: 3.20p). For the combined continuing 
and discontinued Group the adjusted EPS was 2.38p 
(2012: 1.72p) and unadjusted (1.79)p (2012: 1.97p). 
The number of shares in issue at 31 December 2013 
was unchanged from 31 December 2012, at 99.7m. 
There were 184,864 outstanding share options at the end 
of the year (2012: 32,823), but these were considered 
anti-dilutive for the purpose of calculating EPS and were 
therefore not included.
Cash flow
The Group experienced a small decrease (£0.035m) 
in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and 
Amortisation (EBITDA) at £6.2m (2012: £6.3m) and an 
increase in net cash generated from operations of £4.9m 
(2012: £4.6m). Net cash used in investing activities 
increased to £7.0m (2012: £5.7m), based on purchases 
of property, plant and equipment, including new landﬁll 
cells, waste treatment assets, planning and development 
activities.
Net debt increased to £8.5m at 31 December 2013 
(2012: £6.1m), which reﬂected positive underlying 
trading offset by investment in new assets and the 
underperformance of the discontinued operations. As a 
result gearing (net debt/shareholders’ equity) increased to 
18% (2012: 13%). 
The capital investment in property, plant and equipment 
made by the Group (excluding acquisition activities) 
is shown in the table below. This is split between 
Maintenance investment, focused on upgrading existing 
facilities, Development investment on new activities and 
Planning investment to secure permissions to operate.

Impairment reviews
Under IFRS, IAS36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, an annual 
impairment review must be performed for each cash-
generating unit (CGU) to which signiﬁcant goodwill is 
allocated and also any assets where management believe 
there may be indications of impairment to the carrying 
values. For the continuing operations of the Group this 
exercise has been completed and determined that no 
change is required to the carrying value of the goodwill at 
the year end date for the Land Resources and Oil & Gas 
Services CGUs. 
For the Waste Network CGU, which is reported as a 
discontinued operation, impairment did result from 
the difference between the goodwill and asset values 
recorded in the statement of ﬁnancial position and the 
expected sale proceeds at 31 December 2013. The 
Group held £2.1m of goodwill for this CGU and, having 
determined that this was impaired, the entire value was 
charged to the income statement as an exceptional item.
Note 9 below contains further details of the reviews 
performed and the results for each CGU.
Financing
The Group continued to use a revolving loan facility of 
£10.0m, supplemented by ﬁnance leases secured on 
certain plant, as the sources of ﬁnancing its activities.  
The facility was subject to covenants on the ratio of 
Net Debt to EBITDA and the ratio of Net Debt costs to 
Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT). These covenants 
were tested at the end of each trading quarter and each 
test was achieved at the relevant dates throughout the 
year. At 31 December 2013, the undrawn loan facilities 
available to the Group were £1.5m. 
Key performance indicators
The PLC Board, Management Board and local 
management teams regularly review the performance 
of the Group as a whole and the individual divisions. 
Management uses a balanced scorecard of key 
performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor progress 
towards delivery of the Group’s principle targets. 
As in previous years management focused on three 
priority areas in the performance of the Group, these 
being proﬁt generation (through revenue delivery and 
asset utilisation), compliance with regulations (speciﬁcally 
Environment Agency and Scottish Environmental 
Protection Agency audit results) and health & safety 
(monitored through near miss incidents and the number of 
accidents incurred). Certain KPIs are set out in the table 
below, each relating to these priorities and showing the 
equivalent result for the previous year. Please note that 
this table excludes all Waste Network sites, which were 
offered for sale during the year.

Financial Review continued Events since the end of the financial year
During the ﬁrst quarter of 2014 two signiﬁcant events 
have taken place which are expected to impact on the 
ﬁnancial condition of the Group during the coming year:
 Sale of assets previously operated by the  
Waste Network division 
The business and assets based at Hinckley, Worcester 
and Rochdale were sold in two separate transactions 
during quarter one. The overheads associated with 
these activities are no longer used by the Group 
and those employees employed in each business 
transferred to new employers under TUPE regulations 
at the completion of each sale.
 Reﬁnancing of the Group’s loan facilities 
During March 2014 the Group undertook reﬁnancing 
of the loan facilities used during 2013. The Group now 
has access to £15.0m of loan facilities with HSBC 
bank plc, which is expected to provide the required 
funds to support further growth of the business over 
the next four years.

How the Business Manages Risk
Risk description
Environmental legislation
Regulation is a key driver of the hazardous waste market. Changes in legislation (including tax legislation with environmental 
goals) or its interpretation can have a signiﬁcant and far reaching impact on waste markets.
The application of the waste hierarchy to the markets in which the Group operates, with its focus on reducing the 
volume of waste disposed to landﬁll, could be perceived as a threat to the business in the long term.
Environmental compliance
All operating sites and activities are regulated by environmental authorities in line with the requirements set out within 
licences and permits. These licences and permits are required to carry on the business of the Group and compliance 
with their terms is essential to its success. Withdrawal or temporary suspension could have a signiﬁcant impact on 
the Group’s ability to operate. Adherence to the highest environmental standards is also important to ensure the 
maintenance of good relations with local communities and to satisfy customers that the techniques, practices and 
procedures adopted by the Group are consistent with those of a responsible business.
Health and safety
The activities of the Group involve a range of health and safety risks, from offshore operations to the handling of 
hazardous wastes. Health and safety is the ﬁrst priority for all directors, managers and employees across the Group 
and investments in relevant assets and resources are made on an ongoing basis to ensure that the highest health and 
safety standards are applied.
Price risk
Price pressure remains a key feature of the hazardous waste market, where customers often have a range of options 
for the ultimate disposal of their wastes and access to several companies competing to service their needs.
The performance of the business is linked to economic 
activity in the waste markets it serves, including the 
manufacturing, construction, nuclear decommissioning, 
energy from waste and oil & gas sectors. Fluctuations in 
the UK economy in general and these sectors in particular 
affect Group performance, as do inﬂationary and other 
cost pressures. Risks are mitigated by diversifying 
the customer base and by linking gate fees, wherever 
possible, to prevailing operating costs and commodity 
prices, including the costs of waste disposal outside of 
the Group. In addition to this general economic risk there 
are a number of risks speciﬁc to the markets served by 
the Group which may have a material impact on activities 
and results.
The Group uses a range of resources to manage and 
mitigate its risks, including the adoption of a broad  
range of internal controls, the use of risk registers and 
regular reporting, monitoring and feedback of risks 
through the business.  LOREM IPSUM DOLOR SIT AMET,

Strategic Report Strategic Report
Our Performance
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Mitigation Change in year
The Group endeavours to mitigate this risk by employing high 
quality technical management to interpret the evolving legislative 
framework and its potential and current impact on the Group’s 
operations. In addition, the Group maintains a presence on a 
number of industry groups to inﬂuence the shaping of policy and 
liaises regularly with relevant regulators and legislative bodies, 
including DEFRA, DECC, the EA and SEPA.
Declining landﬁll volumes can be addressed by developing 
treatment solutions for customers which utilise landﬁll when this 
is the most appropriate commercial and environmental solution, 
but provide alternative approaches whenever they are suitable. 
Investment in new waste treatment capacity at ENRMF and 
Port Clarence sites broadened the Group’s range of waste 
treatment solutions. 
The mix of activities is progressively being rebalanced away 
from landﬁll disposal by using the same assets to provide 
secure disposal solutions for customers producing air control 
pollution residues and low level radioactive wastes. 
 
The Group mitigates this risk through the employment of 
technical experts, by working to well-established policies and 
procedures described in its Integrated Management System 
(IMS), through the provision of training to develop the knowledge 
and competence of its staff and through regular monitoring and 
review of compliance performance. 
Further details of how the Group monitors and controls 
environmental compliance are given in the Group’s corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) report.
The IMS was rolled out to sites not previously included in 
framework during 2013, including North Sea and Industrial 
Services activities.
The competence of all staff was assessed against a new 
competency framework and training was provided to ensure 
every employee achieved the required standards.
Health and safety performance is constantly monitored and 
reviewed, including formal reviews at each PLC Board meeting 
and monthly reviews by the Group’s Management Board. This 
allows the lessons learnt from incidents to be fed back to local 
teams to avoid repeat situations. 
The total number of accidents (including those involving 
damage to property and plant) fell by 25% from the previous 
year.
A new Scrutiny Committee was established by the Board 
to provide regular independent reviews of health and safety 
performance by a non-executive director.
The Group reviews its pricing policies on an ongoing basis 
aimingto stabilise the market, whilst responding to emerging 
trends and customer needs. As part of the Group’s established 
sales infrastructure specialist roles exist to assess and price 
waste consignments in line with market rates and available 
disposal solutions. All services are kept under review to ensure 
that price changes in the market do not lead to uneconomic 
activities being undertaken by the Group.
At a macro level prices were stable across the hazardous 
waste market during 2013.
The Group reduced its exposure to pricing movements 
through the closure of the Waste Network division, which was 
reliant on ‘spot market’ trading.   38

How the Business Manages Risk
Risk description
Economic growth
The Group relies on economic activity in the UK, which in turn leads to production of the hazardous wastes which 
form the basis of its sales revenues. Downturns in the UK economy have restricted the quantum of hazardous wastes 
produced and therefore constrained the Group’s revenues.
North Sea oil and gas investment
With a well-established business focused on providing waste management services to North Sea oil and gas 
operators the Group has some exposure to any fall in investment for oil and gas exploration activity in the North Sea. 
This may in turn reduce the quantum of waste available for management by ANSS.
Transport disruption
The Group relies on the delivery of wastes to its sites to secure revenues and any disruption to local or national 
networks, for example in severe weather conditions, can cause delays or lost revenue for the Group.
Tax legislation
The use of tax legislation to drive environmental objectives, particularly the diversion of wastes away from landﬁll 
disposal and towards greater treatment and recycling, represents a long term risk. The escalation of landﬁll tax by  
£8/tonne in each year up to 2014 may encourage some customers to divert volumes away from our sites. The full rate 
of landﬁll tax will rise to £80/tonne on 1 April 2014. Whilst European and national legislation encourages ‘zero landﬁl’ 
solutions for a range of waste streams, disposal in properly engineered and permitted landﬁlls continues to be the 
most appropriate waste management solution for many hazardous wastes. 39
Strategic Report Strategic Report
Our Performance
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Mitigation Change in year
These macro-economic conditions are mitigated in part by 
following a strategy of developing positions in a range of 
markets requiring specialist waste management capabilities and 
which have high barriers to entry. The Group also continues to 
identify and invest in the techniques, assets and resources to 
provide a broad range of services to customers, diversifying the 
revenue base of the Group.
The Group is well established in a number of growing 
sectors within the broader hazardous waste market, 
including air pollution control residues from energy from 
waste incinerators and low level radioactive waste disposal.
Improving economic conditions in the UK have contributed 
to a stabilisation of hazardous waste markets, with waste 
arisings remaining at approximately 4 million tonnes per 
annum.
To mitigate this risk our North Sea activities are diversiﬁed 
across a number of revenue-generating streams, with services 
provided to customers offshore and onshore. The future growth 
of North Sea decommissioning volumes will provide new market 
opportunities for ANSS that will be a further mitigation.
Investment in the North Sea reached record levels during 
2013, at £14 billion. Government support for the sector 
remains strong.
The decommissioning market remains small-scale, but 
several projects are known to be at the planning stages.
Mitigation is provided as far as possible through the use of its 
own ﬂeet of vehicles and the ability to accept wastes into sites 
in different geographical locations before onward transfer to their 
ﬁnal treatment or disposal destinations.
There were no new developments during the year.
To mitigate the risk that the Group will suffer a decline of landﬁll 
volumes as environmental taxes rise the Group has developed 
a range of waste treatment solutions for customers and also 
broadened its capabilities to ensure its landﬁll sites are able to 
accept all those wastes which do require landﬁll disposal.
The UK government announced in the Budget 2014 that 
the tax rates would not be reduced in the medium term and 
near term future increases will be based on the retail price 
index.
Outlook
Following the changes made during 2013 the Board 
believes that the Group is well placed to beneﬁt 
from the signiﬁcant investment it has undertaken in 
new businesses and assets, the sale and closure of 
underperforming activities and any increase in the volume 
of waste management activity, backed by a general UK 
economic recovery. The Group is well positioned in a 
number of key waste markets, including hazardous waste 
treatment and disposal, APCR management, low level 
radioactive waste disposal and North Sea oil and gas. 
With improving underlying performance across the entire 
Group and the beneﬁts of lower overhead costs 
the Board expects further growth in underlying EBITDA, 
operating proﬁt and cash ﬂows during the year. The newly 
developed strategy for the business, focused on key 
markets and a more service-led approach to customers, 
is expected to provide opportunities to deliver a material 
improvement to adjusted proﬁt before tax over the 
previous year.

statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Principal activity and business review
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of 
hazardous waste management services. These services 
include waste treatment, recovery, recycling and secure 
disposal. The Group operates solely within the United 
Kingdom.
The Strategic Report provides a review of the business of 
the Group together with an indication of future prospects. 
Results and dividends
The combined continuing and discontinued operations 
loss after tax for the year was £1.7m (2012: £2.0m proﬁt) 
from turnover of £47.1m (2012: £42.4m). The proﬁt 
included exceptional non-recurring items of £4.2m (2012: 
credit of £0.2m), the majority of which was attributed to 
discontinued operations, which are now disposed.
The Board has recommended a dividend for the year of 
0.35p per ordinary share, to be paid on or after 12 June 
2014 for shareholders on the register at 5 June 2014 
(2012: 0.25p).
Environmental policy
The quality of the environment is at the core of the 
Group’s operations and the Board recognises its 
importance to employees, customers, suppliers and 
the communities in which the Group operates. Augean 
continues to adopt high standards of environmental 
practice and aims to minimise its impact on the 
environment wherever possible and to support this 
publishes a clear Environmental Policy, which is updated 
every twelve months. Further details of the Group’s 
actions in this area can be found in the separately 
published CSR report.
Management of risks
The Group has developed procedures for the 
management of risks relating to price, credit, liquidity and 
cash ﬂow. Further details of these are included in note 26 
to the ﬁnancial statements.
Employees
The Group’s policy is to ensure the adequate provision 
for the health, safety and welfare of its employees and of 
other people who may be affected by its activities. Health 
and safety is the ﬁrst priority of the Group and to support 
this all accidents are reported and thoroughly investigated 
and all employees are encouraged to contribute to 
reporting of ‘near miss’ incidents and ‘safe acts’ to 
promote greater awareness and therefore accident 
reduction. 
The success of the Group depends on the skill and 
motivation of its workforce and it is the Group’s policy 
to ensure close consultation with employees on matters 
of concern to them. Regular newsletters and brieﬁngs 
are provided to employees and announcements and 
notices are provided on the Group’s intranet website 
and also directly through regular team brieﬁngs. The 
Group produces a monthly ‘Augean Update’ newsletter, 
available to all employees, which sets out a summary of 
the performance of the Group and the key activities taking 
place at each site.
The Group aims to recruit and retain people with the 
appropriate skills and behaviours to fully contribute to 
the future success of the business. All new employees 
are provided with an appropriate induction, ensuring that 
they have the knowledge required to perform their role, 
and ongoing training is provided to ensure that skills and 
experience are kept up to date.
The Group encourages the employment of disabled 
persons wherever this is practicable. The Group has a 
clear policy on employment of disabled persons and 
ensures that disabled employees, and those who become 
disabled whilst in the Group’s employment, beneﬁt from 
training and career development programmes in common 
with all employees (please see the CSR section for more 
details).

Corporate governance
A separate corporate governance report follows this 
directors’ report.
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions (as deﬁned 
in Companies Act 2006) have been entered into by the 
Company for the beneﬁt of all directors, which indemnify 
the directors against third party claims brought against

extent permitted by law and such provisions continue in 
force at the date of this report.
Contact with investors
All shareholders have access to the interim and annual 
reports and are invited to attend the annual general 
meeting at which all board directors are present. The 
Group periodically hosts presentations at its sites for the 
investor community and provides detailed information for 
shareholders and the general public on its website  
www.augeanplc.com.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Strategic Report. Details of the 
Group’s ﬁnancial position, cash ﬂows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are included in the ﬁnancial review 
section. And further information on the Group’s ﬁnancial 
risks and their management is given in note 26 to the 
ﬁnancial statements, on page 97.
As highlighted in note 26 the Group met its short term 
working capital requirements during 2013 through an 
overdraft and revolving loan facility with HSBC bank plc 
(the Facility), which was due for renewal on 2 March 2015. 
This Facility was renewed and increased with HSBC on 
7th March 2014, providing access to a new overdraft, 
term loan and revolving loan facility for an extended period 
to July 2017 (the New Facility). The New Facility provides 
debt funding to the Group of up to £15.0m, an increase 
from the £10.0m previously available and is subject to

Directors’ Report continued certain covenants, focused on the cover of interest costs 
and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. Cash ﬂow forecasts 
for the twelve months from the date of approval of the 
ﬁnancial statements indicate the Group’s ability to operate 
within these covenants.
During 2013 the Group continued to demonstrate its ability 
to generate cash ﬂow from operating activities. The single 
greatest inﬂuence on free cash ﬂow over recent years has 
been the level of capital investment required to maintain 
and develop the Group’s asset base. The Group retains 
some discretion over the nature and timing of signiﬁcant 
capital expenditure, allowing future liquidity to be managed, 
with the only exception to this being the need to engineer 
new landﬁll cells as available void space nears exhaustion. 
Cell engineering is aligned with cash ﬂows through a 
comprehensive capital planning processes. Other capital 
expenditure includes that needed to maintain the existing 
asset base and that deployed in the development of 
the Group’s businesses (the table on page 54 shows 
expenditure during 2013 in each of these categories). 
Given the discretion available the Board remains conﬁdent 
that capital expenditure can be controlled and cash 
generation can be expected in the future.
Impairment reviews have been performed for each of 
the Group’s cash-generating units, the details of which 
are disclosed in note 10 to the ﬁnancial statements. In 
addition the tangible asset base of the Group has been 
reviewed for impairment. The results of these reviews 
indicate that no impairment is required and demonstrate 
the Group’s ability to continue operating in its current 
structure and form for the foreseeable future.
Financial forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance 
and the market value of the Group’s assets, have been 
prepared and show that the Group is expected to be 
able to operate within the level of the New Facility, both 
for ongoing working capital funding and any capital 
investment expenditure, during the life of the facility. 
Having considered the items set out above and after 
making further enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. The directors are conﬁdent that
the Company will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the next twelve months. As a result, the ﬁnancial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the 
directors have prepared Group ﬁnancial statements, 
and elected to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements, in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs). Under company law the directors must 
not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they are 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs and proﬁt or loss of the Company and Group for 
that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the 
directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to assume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and 
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position 
of the Company and Group and enable them to ensure 
that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

Strategic Report Strategic Report
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Directors’ Report In so far as each of the directors is aware: 
 there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 the directors have taken all steps that they ought to 
have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the auditor is 
aware of that information. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Audit partner rotation
The external auditor is required to rotate the lead 
partner responsible for the Group audit every ﬁve 
years in accordance with Ethical Standard 3 (ES3) 
“Long association with the audit engagement” issued 
by the Auditing Practices Board. However, in certain 
circumstances it is permissible to extend that time. The 
current lead partner, Andrew Wood, had been responsible 
for the audit for six years but the Board believed that it 
was not a suitable time to change to a new audit partner. 
With the resignation of the Group Finance director and 
the appointment of a new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer within 
the past twelve months, as well as the sale of a business 
division, signiﬁcant changes have only recently occurred 
in the Group.
With the Group in a transitional phase the incumbent 
partner’s experience and understanding of the business 
was essential to ensure that appropriate robust challenge 
was made of management’s estimates and judgements 
in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements from a 
position of knowledge. As a result, the Board and Audit 
Committee believed that a rotation should not be made 
during the ﬁnancial year and the Company agreed to 
extend the term of the lead audit partner for one year, in 
accordance with ES3. This will be the ﬁnal year that the 
current lead audit partner will remain eligible for the role 
and he will be replaced prior to the publication of the 
Interim Results in September 2014.
Auditor
Grant Thornton UK LLP has expressed willingness to 
continue in ofﬁce. In accordance with Section 489(4) of 
the Companies Act 2006, a resolution to reappoint Grant 
Thornton UK LLP will be proposed at the annual general 
meeting.
Annual general meeting
At the annual general meeting (AGM) on 5 June 2014, 
Jim Meredith will retire by rotation in accordance with the 
articles of association. Being eligible, he will offer himself 
for re-election as a non-executive director and chairman 
of the Board. Dr Stewart Davies joined the Company and 
was appointed to the Board on 12 August 2013. Being 
eligible, he will offer himself for election as an executive 
director at the AGM. Richard Allen will resign from the 
Board and not seek re-election at the AGM in order to 
take up a new role outside of the Company. No director 
has a contract with an unexpired notice period of more 
than twelve months.

Directors’ Report
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Our Governance “THE BOARD REMAINS FOCUSED ON 
...CORPORATE GOVERNANCE WHICH 
DELIVERS COMPLIANCE...WHILST 
ENHANCING PERFORMANCE...”
Jim Meredith
Non-executive Chairman
I am pleased to introduce the corporate governance 
section of our report.
Augean is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance in all its activities. The Company does not 
comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
However, the Board recognises the value of the Code and 
has regard to its requirements as far as is practicable and 
appropriate for a public company of its size and nature. 
The Board regularly reviews guidance from regulatory 
bodies, supported by its Nominated Advisor, and 
responds as appropriate.
As a business listed on the London Stock Exchange and 
operating in markets based on regulatory frameworks 
the Group is familiar with the beneﬁts and challenges 
associated with maintaining strong and effective 
governance. In this regard the Board remains focused 
on the need for a system of corporate governance which 
delivers compliance with regulation whilst enhancing the 
performance of the Group. This includes recognising 
the need to manage and mitigate the risks faced by the 
business across all of its activities. 
Each of the Board’s standing committees (Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination) were active during the 
year. A report from each committee chairman follows, 
and I am grateful to each for their diligence and skill in 
continuing to ensure that the Board plays an effective role 
in the proper management of the Company and the wider 
Group. 
As Chairman one of my principal concerns is to maintain 
excellent relationships with our shareholders and 
during the year I made myself available to shareholders 
to discuss strategy and governance matters, as well 
as attending meetings during March to support the 
presentation of the 2012 Results. The Board has an active 
investor relations programme and believes in maintaining 
good communication with all stakeholders including 
institutional and private shareholders, analysts and the 
press. This includes making the executive directors 
available to meet with institutional shareholders and 
analysts following the announcement of interim and ﬁnal 
results. The Board receives feedback from these meetings 
and uses this to reﬁne its approach to investor relations. 
I look forward to meeting shareholders and other 
stakeholders during the year ahead. In the meantime 
further information is available from the Group’s website at 
www.augeanplc.com.

Chairman’s Governance Introduction Letter THE BOARD MEETS  
AT LEAST EIGHT TIMES  
A YEAR.
The Board currently comprises a non-executive chairman, 
three further independent non-executive directors, chief 
executive ofﬁcer and a group ﬁnance director. A senior 
independent director has not been appointed, as given 
the size and nature of the Company, the directors do 
not believe that such an appointment is necessary. The 
chairman has primary responsibility for running the Board 
and its effectiveness and the chief executive ofﬁcer is 
responsible for developing strategic plans and initiatives 
for consideration by the Board and for their operational 
delivery. The non-executive directors bring a variety of 
different experience to the Board, are considered to be 
independent of management and ensure that rigour is 
applied to board decisions. 
The composition of the Board is reviewed regularly. 
Appropriate training, brieﬁngs and inductions are available 
to all directors on appointment and subsequently as 
necessary, taking into account existing qualiﬁcations 
and experience. All directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Group’s company secretarial partner, 
Addleshaw Goddard LLP and any director may take 
independent professional advice, if necessary, at the 
Company’s expense. The Board meets formally at least 
eight times a year but additional meetings are held to 
review and approve special matters if necessary. 
Each director is provided with sufﬁcient timely information 
to enable full consideration of matters in advance of 
meetings and proper discharge of duties. There is a 
formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board 
which includes published ﬁnancial statements, strategy, 
acquisitions and disposals, signiﬁcant capital projects, 
annual budgets and loan facilities. Under the Company’s 
Articles of Association one third of all directors is required 
to retire from ofﬁce at each Annual General Meeting (AGM)
and may stand for re-appointment by shareholders each 
year. Additionally, each director is required to retire in the 
third calendar year following his last appointment and may 
stand for re-election. Any director appointed to the Board 
during the year is subject to election by shareholders at 
the following AGM. 
Key topics of board business during 2013
Reserved matter Key considerations
Financial statements The Board reviewed and 
apporved the Report and 
Accounts for 2012, the 
Interim Report for 2013 and 
asscoiated trading updates 
prior to publication.
Strategy &  
Management
Regular updates were provided 
during the early stages of the 
review of strategy by the chief 
executive ofﬁcer.
Acquisitions and dispposals The closure and sale of the 
Waste Network division 
was apporved by the Board 
prior to announcement, with 
regular updates provided 
thereafter. Each subsequent 
sale transaction received Board 
approval. 
Annual budgets and 
forecasts
The budget for 2014 was 
approved by the Board in 
December 2013. Throughout 
the year the forecast outturn 
and outlook was debated and 
challenged at each meeting.
Loan facilities The Board considered a 
proposal to renew and extend 
the Group’s loan facilties at its 
meeting in December, approving 
the new facilities provided by 
HSBC bank plc.
Investor relations The board actively engaged with 
major shareholders during the 
year, in particualar prior to the 
appointment of the new chief 
executive ofﬁcer and following 
results annoucements.

Directors’ Report
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Our Governance
Corporate Governance With effect from 1 October 2008, the Companies Act 
2006 introduced a statutory duty on directors to avoid 
conﬂicts of interest. Shareholders approved new Articles 
of Association at the 2008 AGM giving directors authority 
to approve situations involving any such conﬂicts and to 
allow conﬂicts of interest to be dealt with by the Board. 
All directors are required to notify the Company on an 
ongoing basis of their other commitments and these are 
held by the Company Secretary and reviewed annually by 
the company’s auditors. The Company has established 
procedures for ensuring that the Board’s powers for 
authorising director’s conﬂicts of interest are operated 
effectively. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness, while the role of management, through the 
Management Board, is to implement Board policies on 
risk management and control. The day to day activities 
of the Group are managed by the chief executive ofﬁcer 
through the Management Board, whose membership 
includes the chief executive, group ﬁnance director and 
every director of the Group’s subsidiary companies. The 
Management Board meets formally three times each 
month and maintains regular dialogue between these 
meetings. 
The Management Board regularly reviews the control 
environment of the Group and is responsible for 
managing and mitigating commercial, operational, safety, 
compliance and ﬁnancial risks. This system is designed 
to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The Group operates a series of controls to meet its 
needs. Key features of the control system include the 
following: 
 maintenance of an operational risk register, covering 
the key health and safety, regulatory and operating 
risks faced by the Group; 
 maintenance of a register of the major ﬁnancial risks 
faced by the Group; 
 monthly reviews of business risks affecting the Group, 
identifying procedures and action required to manage 
and mitigate those risks; 
 reports provided to the Board at every meeting setting 
out the key risks and their management; 
 a clearly deﬁned organisational structure with terms of 
reference for Board committees and responsibilities 
and authorisation limits for executive and senior

programme, agreed with insurers following a detailed 
annual review of the risks faced by the Group’s 
businesses.
To provide an overview of the risks faced by the Group 
the Audit Committee undertakes a six-monthly review of a 
comprehensive corporate risk register, which considers a 
broad range of risk items. This takes account of the entire 
control environment and may lead to recommendations 
which are implemented through the Management Board.

Corporate Governance Summary The Audit Committee comprises the non-executive 
directors and is chaired by Rory Macnamara. The external 
auditor and the executive directors are regularly invited to 
attend the meetings but the Committee also has access 
to the external auditor’s advice without the presence of 
the executive directors. The Committee met on three 
separate occasions during the year.
During the year the Committee considered the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the risk management and control 
systems of the Group and requested updates to the 
Group’s corporate risk register. It also reviewed the 
scope and results of the annual external audit, its cost 
effectiveness and the objectivity and independence of 
the external auditor. This review included a report from 
executive management and the auditor concerning the 
system of internal control and any control weaknesses, 
which the committee found to be satisfactory.
Prior to publication the interim report, the preliminary 
results announcement, the annual ﬁnancial statements 
for 2012 and other information included in the Annual 
Report 2012 were reviewed. The Committee made 
recommendations on the content of each of these 
documents before recommending them to the Board for 
publication. 
The Committee also considered, and approved, an 
extension of the tenure of the lead audit partner, 
accepting that it was in the best interests of the Group for 
Mr Andrew Wood of Grant Thornton to retain that role for 
another year.
The Board does not believe it is currently appropriate 
to establish a separate, independent internal audit 
function given the size of the Group and the Committee 
considered this subject during the year, agreeing that no 
change was required. 
“The introduction of a new corporate risk register during 
the year provided renewed focus on the key risks faced 
by the business”

Nomination Committee Report The Remuneration Committee comprises the non-
executive directors and is chaired by Roger McDowell. 
The principal objective of the Committee is to 
attract, retain and motivate talented people with a 
competitive package of incentives and awards linked 
to Group performance and aligned with the interests 
of shareholders. The Committee uses the services of 
independent external advisers as required. 
The Committee met on six occasions during 2013, with 
business including reviews of the remuneration for the 
new chief executive ofﬁcer, granting of share options to 
the chief executive ofﬁcer and decisions relating to the 
salary of the interim chief executive and decisions relating 
to bonus awards. The Directors’ Remuneration Report 
includes the outcome of these considerations.
During quarter 4 the Committee engaged Deloitte LLP as 
external advisors to assist in the development of the new 
LTIP . This work continued into quarter 1 of 2014 and has 
resulted in a scheme with the following attributes:
 A company share options plan, allowing annual 
awards of shares in the Company to be made to 
participants
 A three vesting year period, with annual performance 
conditions based on Group performance
 Performance conditions for executives based on 
targets for Total Shareholder Returns and EPS growth 
 Awards ranging from 75% of salary, for certain senior 
managers, to 200% of salary, for the chief executive 
ofﬁcer.
The Committee will undertake a consultation exercise with 
shareholders prior to ﬁnalising the details of the scheme. 
The ﬁrst awards are expected to be granted under the 
new scheme during quarter 2 of 2014. 
“The new LTIP will provide a scheme which ensures that 
management incentives are closely linked to improving 
shareholder returns.”

Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Remuneration Committee Report
Directors’ Report Our Governance Our Governance Non-executive directors
Remuneration of the non-executive directors, including 
the chairman, is determined by the Board as a whole. 
Current remuneration package
The current remuneration package of the executive 
directors comprises:
(i) Basic salaries
Basic salaries for executive directors take into account 
the performance, experience and responsibilities of the 
individuals concerned, as well as the salaries of those 
with similar positions and responsibilities. External advice 
is taken as appropriate and basic salaries are reviewed 
annually. 
During 2013 no inﬂationary pay award was made to 
the executive directors. The salary of the group ﬁnance 
director was amended during the period he acted 
as interim chief executive, reﬂecting the increased 
responsibilities assumed as part of that role. Once the 
new chief executive ofﬁcer joined the Group the group 
ﬁnance director’s salary returned to the same base value 
as at the start of the year.
(ii) Performance related bonus
The executive directors participate in a bonus scheme 
based on the achievement of annual proﬁt targets 
approved by the remuneration committee. The 
achievement of these targets would result in a bonus of 
up to 50% of basic salary. No bonus was awarded in 
respect of 2013.
(iii) Pension provision and other benefits
Pension provision is made at a rate of 10% of basic 
salary for each executive director, payable directly into 
a nominated pension fund. Other beneﬁts include a car 
allowance, life assurance and private healthcare.
(iv) Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) senior 
employees may be granted an annual award of up to 
100% of basic salary, with the chief executive ofﬁcer 
eligible for an award up to 200% of salary. The award 
vests in the form of shares in the Company and is 
subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance 
conditions over a three year period. The expected 
costs of the scheme are given in note 21 to the ﬁnancial 
statements.
No LTIP award was made during the year. The 
remuneration committee resolved to consider making new 
awards once a renewed scheme had been developed 
(as set out in the Remuneration Committee Report), the 
new chief executive ofﬁcer had become established within 
his role and the revised strategy for the Group had been 
published.
(v) Share options
Under the share options scheme the remuneration 
committee may annually grant options of up to 100% 
of basic salary, allowing participants to purchase shares 
in the Company at a future date. These options may be 
subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance 
conditions but this is not an absolute requirement. 
The remuneration committee reviewed the use of share 
options during the year and concluded that the scheme 
remained a suitable mechanism to incentivise future 
performance. One award was made during 2013, being 
the award of 1 million shares to the chief executive ofﬁcer 
following his appointment to the role in August 2013. This 
award is shown in the tables below.
(vi) Service contracts
Executive directors have rolling service contracts with 
notice periods of not more than twelve months.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the

a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 43, the directors are responsible for

(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.

A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.

 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2013
1 Accounting policies
(a) Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations endorsed by the European Union 
and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that remain applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial 
statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of certain items which are measured at 
fair value as disclosed in the principal accounting policies set out below. These policies have been consistently applied 
to all years presented unless otherwise stated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from these estimates.
The Company has taken advantage of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its individual 
statement of comprehensive income in these financial statements. The Company’s overall result for the year is given in 
the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity.
(i) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by 
the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or sold during the year are consolidated from or to the date on which 
control passes. The trading results of companies acquired during the year are accounted for under the acquisition 
method of accounting.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
(ii) Jointly controlled entities
A joint control is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject 
to joint control. Joint control exists where the strategic, financial and operating decisions relating to the activity require 
the unanimous consent of the parties. Jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method under which 
the carrying value of the Group’s investment is made up of the cost plus the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits 
and less equivalent losses as recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Should a jointly controlled entity 
result in losses in excess of the Group’s interest they will be recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive 
obligation to fund those losses.
Unrealised gains on transactions with jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
jointly controlled entity. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transactions provide evidence of impairment of 
the asset transferred. 
The Group ceases to use the equity method of accounting on the date from which it no longer has joint control in the 
jointly controlled entity or when the interest becomes held for sale.
(iii) Business combinations
The acquisition method is used to account for all acquisitions. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair values 
on the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The consideration is calculated 
as the sum of fair value of assets transferred and liabilities incurred. In assessing control, the Group takes into 
consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable.  65
Our Financials
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Our Financials
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
 the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; less
 the net recognised amount of the identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, measured at their fair value.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such  
amounts generally are recognised in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in  
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and 
therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do 
not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference 
between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or 
received is recognised directly in equity.
(iv) Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the 
Financial Review on page 32.
(b) Revenue recognition
The Group’s responsibility for waste arises as soon as the waste is accepted into one of its facilities. Revenue is 
therefore recognised at the point of acceptance, except when contractual agreements provide for specific services 
in which case revenue is recognised at point of delivery of each separate service. Revenue shown in the statement 
of comprehensive income represents charges for all waste accepted, inclusive of landfill tax where appropriate, but 
exclusive of value added tax.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The related assets 
are recorded as plant and machinery within property, plant and equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the useful lives of the assets.
(c) Exceptional items
Items that are material in size and non-recurring in nature are presented as exceptional items in the statement of 
comprehensive income. The directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of the exceptional items provides 
helpful information about the Group’s underlying business performance. Examples of events which may give rise to the 
classification of items as exceptional include restructuring of the business, compensation for loss of office, impairment 
of goodwill and non-recurring income or expenditure.
(d) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the fair 
value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised as 
an intangible asset. On capitalisation the goodwill is allocated to the specific Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which it 
relates. It is tested for impairment at least annually by reference to this CGU and is carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. 66

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2013
1 Accounting policies continued
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date and on an annual basis going forward. 
(e) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets purchased separately, such as software licences that do not form an integral part of related hardware, 
are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis. This is charged to operating expenses over the asset’s 
useful economic life of three years.
Intangible assets acquired through a business combination such as customer contracts are initially measured at fair 
value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives to the profit and loss account which are 
taken to be the length of the contract. An intangible asset is considered identifiable only if it is separable or if it arises 
from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or 
from other rights and obligations. After initial recognition assets acquired as part of a business combination are carried 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Methods of amortisation, residual value and useful lives are reviewed, and if necessary adjusted, at each statement of 
financial position date.
(f) Investments
Investments are in respect of subsidiaries and a jointly controlled entity. Investments held as non-current assets are 
stated at historic cost less any provision for impairment. 
(g) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable 
to bringing the asset into use. Borrowing costs related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are capitalised 
where the cost is directly attributable to the property, plant or equipment being purchased.
Subsequent costs are included in an asset’s carrying value or recognised as a separate asset, when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the additional expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can 
be measured reliably. All other costs are charged to profit or loss when incurred.
The acquisition, commissioning and site infrastructure costs for each landfill site are capitalised when incurred. These 
costs are then depreciated over the useful life of the site, which is assessed with reference to the usage of the void 
space available.
Cell engineering costs are capitalised when incurred. The depreciation charged to profit or loss is calculated with 
reference to actual costs to date and expected future costs for each cell including the cost of the future cap, the total 
of which is spread over the useful life of the cell. Useful life is assessed by reference to the usage of the void space 
available and the rate at which the void space is filled. 
Freehold land which is not part of a landfill site is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided evenly on all other property, 
plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its useful 
life as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Plant and machinery – two to ten years 67
Our Financials
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Our Financials
Methods of depreciation, residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of 
financial position date.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful lives or, where there is no 
reasonable certainty that title will be obtained at the end of the lease term, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising from the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item and is included in profit or loss.
Finance leases and hire purchase arrangements 
Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking on substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of 
an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease and the asset is capitalised. Future instalments under such leases, net 
of finance charges, are recognised as a liability. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which 
is charged to profit or loss so as to give an approximate constant rate of charge on the outstanding obligation and the 
capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments. 
The asset and associated liability are recorded in the statement of financial position within property, plant and 
equipment and financial liabilities respectively at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, both determined at the inception of the lease.
Depreciation is calculated in accordance with the above depreciation policies.
Other leases are treated as operating leases, the rentals for which are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
Restoration, capping and after-care provisions
The anticipated total cost of restoration, capping, post-closure monitoring and after-care is charged to profit or loss 
over the expected useful life of the sites in proportion to the amount of void consumed at the sites during the period. 
The costs of restoration and post-closure monitoring are charged against the provision when incurred. The provision 
has been estimated using current costs and is discounted. When the effect is material, the expected future cash flows 
required to settle the obligation are discounted at the pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
(h) Impairment of non-current assets
At each statement of financial position date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that its assets have 
been impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment, if any. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the 
recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs is determined.
The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use at the date the 
impairment review is undertaken. Value in use represents the present value of expected future cash flows discounted 
on a pre-tax basis, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. That reduction is recognised as an impairment loss.
An impairment loss relating to assets carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation or amortisation is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. 68
www.augeanplc.com Stock code: AUG
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2013
1 Accounting policies continued
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. An impairment loss is recognised for CGUs if the recoverable 
amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit. The impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying 
amount of the assets of the unit by first reducing the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then 
reducing the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
If an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount but limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any impairments of goodwill 
cannot be subsequently reversed.
(i) Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial 
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased 
asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(j) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (measured on a first-in first-out basis) and net realisable value and, where 
appropriate, are stated net of provisions for impairment.
(k) Tax
Current tax
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date. The tax currently payable is based on taxable 
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because 
it excludes items of income that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax on temporary differences at the statement of financial position date between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes is accounted for using the statement of financial 
position liability method.
Using the liability method, deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. However, if the deferred tax asset or liability arises from the 
initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business 
combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, it is not recognised.
Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities is not 
provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the reversal 
will not occur in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the asset is 
realised, or the liability settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of 
financial position date. 69
Our Financials
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Our Financials
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except when they relate to items recognised in other 
comprehensive income or equity, where they are similarly recognised in other comprehensive income or equity.
(l) Retirement benefits 
Contributions made by the Group to individual money purchase pension schemes are charged to profit or loss during 
the period to which they relate.
(m) Equity-settled share based payments
IFRS 2 ‘Share based Payments’ requires that an expense for equity instruments granted is recognised in the financial 
statements based on their fair values at the date of the grant. This expense, which is in relation to employee share 
options and executive LTIP schemes, is recognised over the vesting period of the scheme based on the number of 
instruments expected to vest. The fair value of employee services is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
awarded grant calculated using the Black Scholes model or Binomial Lattice model, excluding the impact of any non-
market vesting conditions.
At the statement of financial position date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of share incentives that 
are expected to vest. The impact of the revisions of original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity, over the remaining vesting period.
(n) Assets held for sale
Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily 
through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held 
for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are re-measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policies. Thereafter, generally the assets, or disposal group, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains and losses on 
revaluation are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or 
depreciated.
(o) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise demand deposits and cash in hand together with short term highly liquid deposits 
with a maturity of three months or less, from the date of acquisition, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change 
in value.
(p) Financial instruments
(i) Financial assets
Financial assets are categorised as other loans and receivables. The Group’s trade and other receivables fall in the 
‘loans and receivables’ category. Financial assets are assigned to this category on initial recognition, depending on the 
characteristics of the instrument and its purpose. A financial instrument’s category is relevant for the way it is measured 
and whether any resulting income and expenses is recognised in profit or loss or other comprehensive income. 
Augean recognises all financial assets when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs. An annual assessment is made to ascertain 
whether there is objective evidence that the financial assets are impaired. All income and expense relating to financial 
assets are recognised in profit or loss.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market. After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
any provision for impairment. Any change in their value is recognised in profit or loss. Discounting, however, is omitted 
where the effect is immaterial. 70
www.augeanplc.com Stock code: AUG
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2013
1 Accounting policies continued
Significant receivables are considered for impairment on a case-by-case basis when they are past due at the statement 
of financial position date or when objective evidence is received that a specific counterparty will default. Provision 
against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the impairment is determined as the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the 
original effective interest rate.
(ii) Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, debt and finance liabilities. Trade payables are not interest 
bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and carried at amortised cost. Debt is initially recognised at fair value 
less transaction costs and carried at amortised cost. The Group’s policy is that no trading in financial instruments or 
derivatives shall be undertaken.
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All 
interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument’s fair value that are reported in profit or loss are 
included in the statement of comprehensive income under ‘finance charges’.
(iii) Free cash flow
This is a measure used by the Group to assess capital management performance. It is defined as net operating cash 
flow less purchase of property, plant and equipment and finance lease repayments. It is determined as part of the 
capital management assessment and is reconciled in note 26.
(iv) EBITDA
EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure used by management as a tool for assessing operating cash flows. It represents 
Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortisation, impairment and capping provision. It is determined as part of 
the cash flow reconciliation shown in note 23.
(q) Equity
Equity comprises share capital, share premium, special profit reserve and retained profit and (losses). Share capital 
represents the nominal value of equity shares. Share premium account represents the excess over nominal value of 
the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses of the share issue. Special profit reserve 
represents the residual value of the cancellation of the share premium account over and above the total retained losses 
for the Company. This was created on 4 July 2012 when the capital reduction was approved. The amounts recognised 
in the special profit reserve are not distributable without permission of persisting creditors from this date. Profit and loss 
realised within the group before this date is retained in the Special profit reserve. Retained profit and (losses) represent 
retained profit and (losses) and equity-settled share based payment employee remuneration.
(r) Significant judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and 
related disclosures. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience, the best available 
information and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. This forms the basis 
of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 71
Our Financials
Augean PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2013
Our Financials
Actual results may however differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on 
which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information or further information. Such changes are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised. Certain accounting policies are particularly important to the preparation 
and explanation of the Group’s financial information. Key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities over the next 
twelve months are set out below.
Impairment of goodwill and fixed assets
The Group has property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of £40,192,000 (note 13) and goodwill with a 
carrying value of £19,602,000 (note 10). These assets are reviewed annually for impairment as described on pages 
83 to 84 to ensure that goodwill and property, plant and equipment are not carried above their estimated recoverable 
amounts. To assess if any impairment exists, estimates are made of the future cash flows expected to result from the 
use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Actual outcomes could vary from such estimates of discounted future cash 
flows. Factors such as changes in expected use of property, plant and equipment, closure of facilities, or lower than 
anticipated revenues could result in impairment. For further details of assumptions see note 10.
Site development and cell engineering/capping
Total anticipated site development and cell engineering/capping costs are charged to profit or loss as void usage 
progresses. Costs of site development and cell engineering/capping are estimated using either the work of external 
consultants or internal experts. Management uses its judgement and experience to provide for these estimated costs 
over the life of the site and cell.
See note 18 for further details of calculation methodology, assumptions used and potential sensitivities to these 
calculations.
After-care costs
Provision is made for after-care costs as soon as the obligation arises and is charged to profit or loss as void 
usage progresses. After-care costs are estimated using either the work of external consultants or internal experts. 
Management uses its judgement and experience to provide for these estimated costs over the life of the site. See note 
17 for further details of calculation methodology, assumptions used and potential sensitivities to these calculations.
Other provisions
Other provisions are made where management judges that a probable future outflow of resources will occur, which 
can be reliably estimated, arising from a past event. Estimates are based on the work of internal experts and previous 
operational and commercial experience. See note 18 for further details of calculation methodology, assumptions used 
and potential sensitivities to these calculations.
Income taxes
At 31 December 2013, the net liability relating to current income tax is £345,000 (2012: £197,000). A deferred tax 
asset of £1,143,000 (2012: £1,231,000) has also been recognised. Estimates may be required in determining the level 
of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which the directors believe are reasonable and adequately 
recognise any income tax related uncertainties. Various factors may have favourable or adverse effects on the income 
tax assets or liabilities. These include changes in tax legislation, tax rates and allowances, future levels of spending and 
the Group’s level of future earnings. 72

2 Operating segments
The Group has four operating segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic operating divisions. 
These operating divisions are monitored and strategic decisions are made on the basis of the division’s operating 
performance. 
The Group’s operating divisions provide different services to their customers, and are managed separately as they are 
subject to different risks and returns. The Group’s internal organisation and management structure and its system of 
internal financial reporting are based primarily on these operating divisions. For each of the operating divisions, the 
Group’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (the chief operating decision maker) reviews internal management reports on at 
least a monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations of each of the Group’s reportable segments, 
with further details provided in the business review:
 – Land Resources division (renamed Energy and Waste Services post year end): Augean operates three modern 
hazardous and non-hazardous landﬁll operating sites based at East Northants Resource Management Facility 
(ENRMF), Thornhaugh in Northamptonshire and Port Clarence in Teesside, providing waste remediation and 
disposal services to its customers. The division includes a site at Cooks Hole in Northamptonshire where minerals 
are extracted and also generates energy from closed landﬁll cells.
 – Waste Network division: In 2013, Augean operated waste transfer sites across the UK, transporting, recovering, 
recycling and disposing of hazardous wastes on behalf of its customers. During 2013 the intention to close this 
division was announced. The sites at Hinckley, Rochdale and Worcester were sold in March 2013. The site at 
Cannock, along with certain customers serviced by the division has been retained. This has been used as the 
basis of a new and distinct business unit, Augean Integrated Services (“AIS”), focused on Total Waste Management 
solutions. 
In the analysis below, cost relating to the Cannock site which is expected to continue after the divisional change, the 
trading result from customers Augean expects to service with the AIS division and the trading result for the East Kent 
incinerator are disclosed as continuing operations. The closed Waste Networks business is disclosed as Discontinued. 
 – Oil & Gas Services division (renamed Industrial Waste Services post year end): Augean operates three waste 
treatment sites across the UK, with activities focused on the management of oil-contaminated waste. The division 
also provides specialist industrial cleaning services. 
 – Augean North Sea Services Limited: Through an 81%/19% owned subsidiary Company with Scomi Oiltools (Europe) 
Limited Augean provides waste management and waste processing services to offshore oil and gas operators in the 
North Sea.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on 
the segment profit before tax and exceptional items, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed 
by the Group’s CEO. This profit measure for each operating division is used to measure performance as management 
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of each of the divisions relative to other 
entities that operate within these sectors. Central costs for the proper governance and resources required to operate 
the plc board and listing have been separately reported.
All activities arise solely within the United Kingdom. Inter-segment trading is undertaken on normal commercial terms. 74

All deferred tax assets and liabilities have arisen on the temporary timing differences between the tax base of the assets 
and their carrying value in the statement of financial position as detailed within note 13, Property, Plant and Equipment. 
IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ permits the offsetting of tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction and which the 
Company has the intention to realise and settle simultaneously. All of the deferred tax assets were available for offset 
against deferred tax liabilities and as such have been presented net in the statement of financial position.

The reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was substantively 
enacted on 2 July 2013. Since the date that legislation was enacted, it has been confirmed the rate of 23% from 1 April 
2013 will be further reduced to 21% as of 1 April 2014, with a further reduction to 20% from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, 
deferred tax balances have been revalued to the lower rate of 20% in these accounts to the extent that timing 
differences are expected to reverse after this date.
No further reductions to the main rate of corporation tax from 20% have been proposed.
No deferred tax has been recognised during the year in respect of certain temporary differences of £145,000 (2012: 
£173,000) which arise in Augean PLC as there is uncertainty over the extent and timing of their recovery. The potential 
deferred tax assets in respect of the temporary differences are analysed as follows:

financial statements.
8 Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share at 31 December 2013 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary 
shareholders of £1,787,000 (2012: £1,966,000) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding of 
99,699,414 (2012: 99,699,414), calculated as follows:
 
2013
Number
2012
Number
Profit after tax for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share (1,787) 1,966
Exceptional items 4,159 (249)
Profit after tax for the purposes of basic and diluted adjusted earnings per share 2,372 1,717
The exceptional items (note 3) have been adjusted, in the adjusted earnings per share, to better reflect the underlying 
performance of the business, without the impact of one-off distorting factors, when presenting the basic and diluted 
earnings per share. The exercise of the outstanding share options at 31 December 2013 would decrease the loss per 
share reported. They are therefore antidilutive and not included for the purposes of calculating diluted EPS.

9 Investment in jointly controlled entity
Terramundo Limited (‘Terramundo’) is a 50:50 jointly controlled entity between Augean PLC and DEC NV. Terramundo 
is a ground remediation facility which uses various proven techniques to clean contaminated soils of both organic and 
inorganic contaminant leading to a by-product which can be used in composting. No trading has taken place during the 
current or previous periods, however both parties have agreed to maintain their interest in the entity and believe that the 
future trading will support the net liabilities owed to its parent companies.
The cost of investment held by Augean PLC, in its 50% interest at 31 December 2013 was £100 (2012: £100).
During the period ended 31 December 2013 the jointly controlled entity generated the following revenue and costs:

The goodwill arose on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, and represents the excess of the fair 
value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The goodwill which 
arose before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts.
Goodwill has been allocated to the Group’s Cash Generating Units (CGU’s) which are defined as the Group’s reportable 
segments, in note 2 and are the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. No 
goodwill arose as a result of the acquisition of North Sea Services. The goodwill previously held against the Waste 
Network has been written down as a result of the closure of this division (note 15). The allocation of goodwill by CGU is 
as follows:
 
2013
£’000
2012
£’000
Land Resources division 12,420 12,420
Waste Network division — 2,103
Oil and Gas Services division 7,182 7,182
Total 19,602 21,705
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the balance sheet date and as and when other events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The goodwill impairment test is 
performed by comparing the net book value of the goodwill and other non-current assets for a particular CGU to its 
value in use estimated on a discounted cash flow basis.
The discounted cash flows have been prepared separately for the Land Resources, and Oil and Gas Services divisions. 
The key assumptions for the Land Resources division’s cash flows are:
 based on approved budgets and plans for 2014 and, beyond this period, have been forecast until expected site 
closure;
 revenue streams, based on anticipated waste volumes, are expected to remain ﬂat with no change to average price, 
as the competitive nature of the landﬁll market leads to ongoing pricing pressures; 
 forecast gross margin (GM) has been based upon past performance and the approved budgets and plans. Gross 
margin has been forecast to improve on a compound basis by 1% of GM per annum from years 1 to 5, where it will 
become ﬁxed as management focus on maintaining efﬁcient operations. The GM improvements are expected to be 
delivered through improved and innovative waste treatment processes, continued targeting of margin enhancing 
waste streams and focus on cost control; 84

 using the discount rate below there is no indication of impairment with headroom of £7.5m (2012: £12.8m); and
 sensitivity analysis has been performed over the key assumptions which indicate the following impact, meaning 
reduction or increase in headroom:
Sensitivity
Impact in 
2013
Impact in 
2012
Discount factor 1% £3.4m £4.2m
Gross margin 1% £0.3m £1.2m
Revenue growth rate 1% £1.2m £7.1m
The key assumptions for the Oil and Gas Services division’s cash flows are:
 based on approved budgets and plans for 2014; 
 revenue growth over the period to 2016 is expected to achieve 3% per annum, consistent with the current 
underlying growth rate of the division. This reﬂects the impact of improvements to pricing and increasing volumes 
through the ITD and further increases in volumes from trading with the North Sea Services division. Revenue growth 
of 2% per annum from 2016 is expected;
 a 1% compound growth in gross margin per annum is assumed from years 1 to 5. This represents the improved 
waste acceptance procedures which focus on higher margin waste and improved treatment techniques. From 
2016 gross margin is assumed to remain constant as increased process efﬁciencies are offset by inﬂationary cost 
increases;
 ﬁxed costs are anticipated to rise at 0.5% per annum for the life of the site reﬂecting the impact of cost inﬂation 
offset by effective underlying cost control;
 using the discount rate below there is no indication of impairment with headroom of £2.7m (2012: £6.6m); and
 sensitivity analysis has been performed over the key assumptions which indicate the following impact, meaning 
reduction or increase in headroom:
Sensitivity
Impact in 
2013
Impact in 
2012
Discount factor 1% £1.8m £2.6m
Gross margin 1% £2.0m £2.4m
Revenue growth rate 1% £5.5m £6.0m
The cash flows for all CGUs have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 13.0% (2012: 11.0%), which 
reflects management’s best estimate of the current market’s assessment of the time value of money and the business, 
operational and financial risks specific to the CGUs. 
Based on the assumptions above and consideration of appropriate sensitivity analysis, management is satisfied that no 
impairment of goodwill exists at the date of these financial statements. 
The principal risks which will apply to future reviews of goodwill continue to include the changes in rate of waste 
production in the markets in which the Group operates; significant increases to price competition beyond that 
experienced to date or anticipated and the impact of changes in legislation on operations. 85

There were no outstanding contractual commitments for acquisitions of property, plant or equipment at 31 December 
2013 (2012: £nil). Plant and machinery includes assets held under finance lease agreements with a carrying value at  
31 December 2013 of £876,000 (2012: £1,062,000).
The movement in Engineered Cells relating to the revision of the cell capping provision has occurred as the company 
has revised the cost expected to be incurred in capping landfill cells at the end of their useful life. An equal reduction in 
cost and accumulated depreciation has been recognised.
Assets pledged as security for loans is disclosed in note 17. 88

15 Discontinued operations
On 24 September 2013 the Company announced the intention to dispose of the Waste Network division. The company 
subsequently entered into sale arrangement(s) to dispose of the sites at Worcester, Hinckley and Rochdale. The 
disposals were completed in March 2014 on which date the control of the sites passed to the acquirers.
The site at Cannock, which previously formed part of the Waste Network division has been retained within the Group. 
This site has been used from 1 January 2014 as the base for the newly-formed Augean Integrated Services division, 
distinct from the transfer operation which previously existed. 
The Company retained a small number of existing customers which were previously served by the divested sites. The 
analysis below includes the closed site and the trading result for the customers who were not retained.

The provision for restoration and after-care relates to closure and post-closure costs for all landfill sites, charged over 
the estimated active life of the sites. The expenditure is incurred partially on completion of the landfill sites (restoration) 
and in part after the closure of the landfill sites (after-care) over a period up to 60 years from the site closure dates. 
After-care expenditure relates to items such as monitoring, gas and leachate management and may be influenced 
by changes in legislation and technology. The provision is based on management’s best estimate of the annual costs 
associated with these activities over the 60 year period, using current costs and discounted using a discount rate of 
3%.
The capping provision reflects the expected costs of capping established and active landfill cells. Capping is required 
following the end of a cell’s useful economic life and the build up of the provision is based on the rate of use of the 
available void space within each cell. During the year £601,000 has been released (2012: £222,000 provided) to reflect 
the latest cost of capping the cell volumes consumed. This provision is not discounted as the costs are expected to be 
incurred shortly after consumption of the void.
The other provisions relate to a tyre provision which is anticipated to be utilised during the next landfill cell construction 
cycle.

At the Annual General Meeting on 8 June 2012, the shareholders approved the capital reduction of Augean PLC (the 
Company). This was subsequently confirmed by the High Court on 4 July 2012. To effect this reduction, the share 
premium account of the Company was be cancelled creating a Special profit reserve in the Company and Group 
balance sheets. This reduction was transferred to retained earnings to the extent to which it cancelled existing losses. 
The remaining share premium was transferred to a Special profit reserve. In addition, profits of the Company which 
were realised prior to 4 July 2012 were transferred to the Special profit reserve.
During 2013 the group undertook an exercise to strike off dormant subsidiary entities. As part of that reorganisation, 
dividends or £4,374,000 were paid up from these subsidiaries to Augean PLC. In line with the terms of the High Court 
order, these amounts have been transferred to the Special profit reserve. 94

On 12 August 2013, the Group established a share option programme that entitled the Group’s Chief Executive to 
purchase shares in the Company. These options were granted on similar terms to the 12 May 2011 and 21 December 
2009 grants, except for the exercise price.
The fair value of remaining share options has been calculated using the Black Scholes model. The assumptions used in 
the calculation of the fair value of the share options outstanding during the year were: 95

Fair value per option £0.30 £0.09 £0.14
Expected volatility was determined by reviewing the historical volatility of the Company’s share price since its formation 
by comparison to the average volatility of comparable listed companies.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK Government bonds of a term equal to the expected term of 
the options.
The share options have a vesting period of three years but no market or non-market performance criteria attached to 
them. Rights under the share option scheme are usually forfeited if the employee leaves the Group of his or her own 
accord before the rights vest.
For options outstanding at 31 December 2013, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 6.46 years (2012: 
6.66 years).

Financial risk management objectives and policies
Overview
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
 liquidity risk;
 credit risk; and
 interest rate risk.
The majority of the Group’s transactions take place in sterling. One contract is transacted in dollars and this small 
currency risk is managed using spot transactions.
The management of the Group’s financial risks and the related objectives and policies are the responsibility of the 
executive directors. The directors regularly review the Group’s financial risk management policies and procedures to 
ensure that they appropriately reflect the changing nature of the market and business. The Group, through its training 
and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in 
which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The Group has maintained its policy that no trading in 
financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Group’s principal financial instruments during the period comprised bank loans, cash and cash equivalents and 
finance leases. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group’s other 
financial instruments include short term receivables and payables which arise directly from its operations. There was no 
material difference between the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities and their book value. 100

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group seeks to maintain a balance between 
continuity of funding and flexibility. The objective is to maintain sufficient resources to meet the Group’s funding needs 
for the foreseeable future. At 31 December 2013 the Group carried debt of £9,032,000 (2012: £6,296,000) and short 
term flexibility is achieved through bank facilities comprising a £10m revolving credit and overdraft facility. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
The Group has a robust customer credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on a daily basis. 
The Group’s standard credit terms are 30 days from date of invoice. Invoices greater than 30 days old are assessed as 
overdue. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of each financial asset included on the statement of 
financial position as summarised below:

At 31 December 2013 £4.6m (2012: £4.3m) of the Group’s trade receivables were past due. A provision of £0.1m 
(2012: £0.1m) is held to mitigate the exposure to potential bad and doubtful debts.
The ageing of the Group’s trade receivables past their due date but not impaired is as follows:

reporting dates under review are of good quality.
The Company has no trade receivables. 101

Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of free cash flow, overdraft facilities, bank borrowings and hire 
purchase leasing. Due to the relatively low level of the Group’s borrowings no interest rate swaps or other forms of 
interest risk management have been undertaken. The Group regularly reviews its exposure to fluctuations in underlying 
interest rates and will take appropriate action if required to minimise any impact on the performance and financial 
position of the Group.
The interest rate profile of the Group and Company’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2013 was:

Finance leases ——
At 31 December 2013 8,909 8,909
At 31 December 2012 5,175 5,175
The interest rate on the floating rate borrowings was 2.7% (2013: 2.7%) above LIBOR. In March 2014 the Group 
renegotiated its overdraft and loan facilities with HSBC until 7 March 2017. The facility is structured as a £5m term loan 
which attracts an interest rate of 2.25% above LIBOR and a £10m revolving credit facility which attracts an interest 
charge which varies between 1.95% and 2.75% above LIBOR. A change in interest rate of 0.5% affects the annual 
interest cost for both the Group and Company by approximately £40,000 (2012: £25,000). 
The hire purchase agreements of the Group under a floating rate contract have a weighted average interest rate of 
3.5% (2013: 2.4%) and a weighted average duration of 1 (2012: 4) years. The Group no longer has any hire purchase 
agreements under a fixed rate contract. 
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities is shown in note 16.
The Board recognises that there is continuing debate as to how to deal with the European sovereign debt and banking 
crisis and this is borne in mind throughout all key strategic decision making processes. The board feels that the current 
risk management policies described above continue to be appropriate but they will be regularly assessed to ensure this 
remains the case. 102

Capital management policies and procedures
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s share capital and financial liabilities, as shown in the table 
below:
Note
2013
£’000
2012
£’000
Share capital 18 9,970 9,970
Financial liabilities 16 9,033 6,121
19,003 16,091
The Group’s capital management objectives which have remained unchanged during the year are:
 to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
 to provide a strong ﬁnancial base to deliver growth and adequate return to shareholders.
The Group’s primary sources of capital are equity (statement of changes in shareholders’ equity), bank debt and finance 
leases (note 23) secured against certain assets. By pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk 
and focusing on the effective collection of cash from customers the Group aims to maximise revenues and operating 
cash flows. Cash flow is further controlled by ongoing justification, monitoring and reporting of capital investment 
expenditures and regular monitoring and reporting of operating costs. Working capital fluctuations are managed 
through employing the overdraft facility available, which at the year end was nil (2012: £549,000).
In 2012 the capital structure of the Group was altered by way of a capital reduction. The capital reduction has reduced 
retained losses in the Group by eliminating the share premium account. This has allowed the Group to be in a position 
to pay dividends from distributable reserves (note 8). 
The Group considers that the current capital structure will provide sufficient flexibility to ensure that appropriate 
investment can be made, if required, to implement and achieve the longer term growth strategy of the Group. The 
primary source of funding would be achieved through drawing on the recently renewed loan facility, which has £1.5m of 
headroom at 31 December 2013 (2012: £4.7m). Under the facility in place with HSBC from 7 March 2014 this would be 
£6.1m of headroom.
Management sets targets against the following measures and monitors the Group’s performance against each 
throughout the year:
 bank facility covenants, which include net debt to EBITDA and EBIT to net debt costs;
 net debt to equity ratio; and
 free cash ﬂow generated.
The performance against each of these capital measures is shown in the table below:
2013
Actual
2013
Target
2012
£’000
Net debt to EBITDA 1.3 <2.5 0.9
EBIT to net debt costs 12.3 >2.5 13.3
Net debt to equity (%) 18.0% — 12.5%
Free cash flow (£’000s) (2,253) — 674 103

The level of free cash flow for 2013 reflects a number of one off investments in the business which were required during 
the year. These included investment in cell construction at ENRMF and Port Clarence and in the development of the ITD 
plant.
The value of net debt and free cash flow is monitored on a daily basis and balances of finance leases are reviewed 
monthly as repayments are made and balances reduce.
Free cash flow represents net operating cash flows adjusted for capital investment and finance lease repayments. This 
is reconciled to the statement of cash flows as follows.

2012
£’000
Net operating cash flow (note 22) 4,917 4,595
Purchase of property, plant and equipment (6,898) (3,585)
Repayments of obligations under finance leases (272) (336)
Free cash flow (2,253) 674
27 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees. The assets of the 
schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. Where there are employees 
who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by 
the amount of forfeited contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £392,000 (2012: £280,000) represents contributions payable to these schemes 
by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes. As at 31 December 2013, contributions of £11,000 (2012: 
£30,000) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
28 Contingent liabilities and cross guarantees
In accordance with Pollution, Prevention and Control (PPC) permitting, the Group has to make such financial provision 
as is deemed adequate by the Environment Agency to discharge its obligations under the relevant site permits for 
its landfill sites. Consequently guarantees have been provided in favour of the Environment Agency in respect of the 
Group’s landfill sites. Total guarantees outstanding at the year end were £8.1m (2012: £7.3m). Future site restoration 
costs for each landfill site have been provided as disclosed in note 18.
The Group suffered an incident at its Cannock site in November 2010, which resulted in an explosion in one of the 
on site treatment processes. After investigation by the Environment Agency and Health and Safety Executive, both 
agencies have confirmed that they will take no further action as a result of their investigations. 
The Group is involved in litigation with the previous owners of HiTech Limited, a business that Augean acquired 
during 2008. Augean has lodged a claim of up to £2.5m against the previous owners, based on breach of warranties 
contained in the sale and purchase agreement for the HiTech transaction. The defendants have lodged a counterclaim 
relating to non-payment of an earn-out of up to £0.7m following the transfer of the business.
Based on legal advice we remain confident in the strength of Augean’s claim and defence, and on this basis no 
provision has been made in these accounts. 104

29 Related party disclosures 
IAS 24 ‘Related Party Transactions’ requires the disclosure of the details of material transactions between reporting 
entities and related parties. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IAS 24 not to disclose transactions 
between subsidiaries which are eliminated on consolidation. 
Related party transactions of the Group which are not eliminated on consolidation and related party transactions of the 
Company are both as follows:

The balance owed by Terramundo Limited to Augean is classified as a non-current asset. This reflects Augean’s 
investment in the long term future of the venture and the expectation that this balance will be recovered in more than 
12 months from the balance sheet date. When Terramundo starts to trade generating profits from which it can repay its 
liabilities to its parent companies, this classification will be re-assessed. Further details regarding Terramundo Limited 
are disclosed in note 9.

Included within current trade and other payables (note 16) are amounts owed to 100% subsidiary undertakings of 
£0.4m (2013: £8.9m). These amounts are repayable on demand.
The movement in the Company’s balances with its subsidiaries reflects the Group’s banking facilities and arrangements 
operating during the year.
30 Post balance sheet events
On 7 March 2014, the sale of the site at Hinckley was completed, realising total proceeds of £400,000. On 21 March 
2014, the sale of the sites at Rochdale and Worcester were completed, realising total proceeds of £800,000. There was 
no profit or loss on disposal subsequent to the impairment recognised in these financial statements.
On 7 March 2014, the Group’s debt facility was renewed and increased, as described in note 26. 105

Notice of Annual General Meeting
We are pleased to write to you with details of our 2014 Annual General Meeting (AGM) which will be held at the offices 
of FTI Consulting, 9th Floor, 200 Aldersgate, Aldersgate Street, London, EC1A 4HD on Thursday 5 June 2014 at 
10.00am. The formal notice of Annual General Meeting is set out on pages 107 to 108 of this document.
In addition to the routine business of the AGM, there are two items of special business to be transacted, as summarised 
and explained below:
Authority to allot shares (Resolution 7)
Article 4.6(a) of the Company’s Articles of Association contains a general authority for the Directors to allot shares in the 
Company for a period (not exceeding five years) (the Section 551 prescribed period) and up to a maximum aggregate 
nominal amount (the Section 551 amount) approved by a special or ordinary resolution of the Company. 
The existing authority to allot shares granted at the Company’s last annual general meeting is due to expire at the AGM.
Resolution 7, which will be proposed as an ordinary resolution, seeks to renew the allotment authority so that the 
Section 551 amount shall be £3,323,313.80 (being an amount equal to one third of the issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company at the date of this document) and the Section 551 prescribed period shall be the period from the date 
Resolution 7 is passed to 30 June 2015 or the conclusion of the Company’s next annual general meeting, whichever is 
earlier. 
Disapplication of pre-emption rights (Resolution 8)
Article 4.6(b) of the Company’s Articles of Association empowers the Directors for a period (not exceeding five years) 
(the Section 561 prescribed period) to allot shares for cash in connection with a rights issue and also to allot shares 
in any other circumstances up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount approved by a special resolution of the 
Company (the Section 561 amount) without having to comply with statutory pre-emption rights.
The existing authority to disapply pre-emption rights granted at the Company’s last annual general meeting is due to 
expire at the AGM.
Resolution 8, which will be proposed as a special resolution and which will only be effective if Resolution 7 is 
passed, seeks to renew the disapplication authority so that the Section 561 amount shall be £498,497 (representing 
approximately 5% of the Company’s issued share capital at the date of this document) and the Section 561 prescribed 
period shall be the period from the date Resolution 8 is passed to 30 June 2015 or the conclusion of the Company’s 
next annual general meeting, whichever is earlier.
Action to be taken by Shareholders
Whether or not you intend to be present at the AGM you are requested to complete and submit a proxy appointment 
in accordance with the notes to the Notice of AGM set out on page 108. To be valid, the proxy appointment must 
be received at the address for delivery specified in the notes by no later than 10.00am on Tuesday 3 June 2014. The 
completion and return of a proxy appointment form will not preclude you from attending and voting at the meeting, 
should you so wish. A hard copy proxy appointment form is enclosed for your use. 
Recommendation
The Directors consider that the proposals set out above are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders 
as a whole. They recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions set out in the notice of meeting as they intend to 
do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.

NOTES:
(a)  Only those shareholders entered on the relevant register of members (the “Register”) for certificated or uncertificated shares of the 
Company (as the case may be) at 6.00pm on Tuesday 3 June 2014 (the “Specified Time”) will be entitled to attend and vote at the 
AGM in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at the time. Changes to entries on the Register after the Specified 
Time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the AGM.  
(b)  Any member may appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote on his/her behalf. A member may appoint more than one proxy in 
relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares of the 
member, but must attend the meeting in person. A proxy need not be a member. Completion of a proxy appointment form does not 
prevent a member from attending and voting in person if he/she is entitled to do so and so wishes.
(c)  Hard copy appointment of proxies: A hard copy proxy appointment form is enclosed for use at the AGM. To be valid, it must 
be completed in accordance with the instructions that accompany it and delivered, together with any authority under which it is 
executed or a copy of the authority certified notarially, by post or (during normal business hours only) by hand to Computershare 
Investor Services Plc, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZY so as to be received no later than 10.00am on Tuesday  
3 June 2014. 
  To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy the hard copy proxy form. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and the 
number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number 
of shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be 
signed and should be returned together in the same envelope.  
(d)  Electronic appointment of proxies: As an alternative to completing the hard-copy proxy form, you can appoint a proxy electronically 
by going to www.eproxyappointment.com. You will be asked to enter the Control Number, the Shareholder Reference Number 
and PIN all found on the front sheet your hard copy proxy form. For an electronic proxy appointment to be valid, your electronic 
message confirming the details of the appointment in accordance the relevant instructions must be transmitted so as to be received 
by Computershare Investor Services plc no later than 10.00am on Tuesday 3 June 2014.
(e)  Appointment of proxies through CREST: CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic 
proxy appointment service may do so for the AGM and any adjournment(s) of it by using the procedures described in the CREST 
Manual (available from https://www.euroclear.com/site/public/EUI). CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored 
members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy 
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (“EUI”) specifications and must 
contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as 
to be received by Computershare Investor Services plc as the issuer’s agent (ID Reference: 3RA50) by 10.00am on Tuesday 4 June 
2013. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message 
by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make 
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in 
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST 
member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical 
limitations of the CREST system and timings.
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
(f)  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares. Any such representative should bring to the 
meeting written evidence of his appointment, such as a certified copy of a Board resolution of, or a letter from, the corporation 
concerned confirming the appointment.
(g)  Website giving information regarding the AGM is available from www.augeanplc.com. A member may not use any electronic 
address provided by the Company in this document or with any Proxy Form or in any website for communicating with the Company 
for any purpose in relation to the AGM other than as expressly stated in it. 
(h)  As at 24 March 2014 (being the last business day prior to the publication of this document) the Company’s issued share capital 
consisted of 99,699,414 Ordinary Shares of £0.10 each, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company 
as at 24 March 2014 are 99,699,414.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT | SKILLTHOUGHTVISION
The Company has achieved another year
of strong performance.We have made
excellent progress in implementing our
strategic plans and have demonstrated
good performance in terms of like-for-like
sales, margins, return on capital and free
cash flow.
Leslie Porter, Company Secretary, meeting with 
David Thompson, Chairman.
Results
Turnover of £490.5m was £15.1m below
last year as a consequence of transferring
managed pubs to lease and completing
the rationalisation of WDB Brands.
Underlying operating margins increased 
by 0.5% to 22.1% and return on capital
was maintained at 12.6%. Against a
background of intense competition and
price discounting, this strong performance
contributed to a 10.1% increase in
underlying earnings per share to 68.9p
per share.
Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend of
21.2p per share, which brings the total net
dividend for the year to 32.1p per share.
The year-on-year increase in dividend is
10.1%, reflecting our underlying growth in
earnings per share and our recognition
that cash dividends are an important part
of the overall return achieved by investors.
Our approach to dividends has been
consistent over a 30 year period.
The final dividend, if approved, will be 
paid on 30 January 2004 to those
shareholders on the register at the close
of business on 5 January 2004.
People
The continuing improvement in the
performance of the Company is due 
to the enthusiasm, commitment and
ability of our employees.The management
style within the business continues to
develop as one in which decision-making
is delegated and spread throughout the
business, and our people are responding
with vigour. I would like to thank all of
them for the tremendous contributions
they are making. In particular, it is a matter
of record that last year saw the highest
ever number of long service awards, 45,
and this highlights the way we seek to
combine experience with new ideas. W&DB Annual Report 2003    5
David Thompson presenting Diane Sinclair
with her 25-year long service award.
Outlook
We believe that this good result is the
product of a clear, well thought-through
strategy, correctly positioned businesses
and strong operational management.
Our strategy, which is set out in detail in
the Chief Executive’s review, includes a
continuing focus on freehold community
pubs and high quality ale brands. Ours is 
a cash-generative business, enabling us 
to operate an ongoing share buy-back
programme.We bought back and
cancelled 1.2m shares at a cost of £7.5m
in this financial year and a further 0.7m
shares at a cost of £4.7m since the year
end.We have now returned £138m to
shareholders in the last two years.
The market remains competitive and is
mature.These factors are likely to ensure
that consolidation of pubs, breweries and
beer brands will continue.We believe 
that consumer trends and the need to
comply with more stringent legislation
will, in the long run, favour good quality,
well-positioned businesses such as ours.
In the meantime, we are encouraged 
by the robustness of our trading platform,
as demonstrated by these results.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW | CAREPRODUCTPEOPLE
Ralph Findlay with the operating
divisional managing directors.
Business structure and strategy
Our philosophy is straightforward: we 
aim to develop and operate good quality
community-based pubs and to market and
sell high quality ale brands.This market
positioning is deliberately mainstream,
focusing on venues and products with 
a broad consumer appeal.
Whether our pubs are managed, tenanted
or leased will depend upon their individual
characteristics, allowing us to take a 
pub-by-pub approach in deciding which is
the most suitable and profitable means of
operation. Pathfinder Pubs,The Union Pub
Company and WDB Brands are managed
independently, but within a corporate
structure that gives us flexibility in our
approach both to existing operations and
potential acquisitions and also reduces risk.
Such flexibility is particularly helpful in 
a period of rising regulatory and other
operating costs, for example enabling us to
reduce overheads and increase profit by
transferring 104 smaller managed pubs to
lease in September 2002.We have also
made savings in brewing and logistics through
restructuring and improved procurement.
This year we are again able to report good progress
towards our basic objectives: continuous
improvement in the quality of our pub and brands
businesses, increased margins and growing earnings
per share.At the same time, the increases in like-for-
like sales in Pathfinder Pubs and The Union Pub
Company were amongst the best in the industry. W&DB Annual Report 2003    7
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adi
piscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod.
Our community-based business has
intrinsic strengths.Whereas the high street
sector has suffered as a consequence of
low barriers to entry, over-investment and
lack of differentiation, community pubs
enjoy a degree of protection through
licensing and planning laws. On balance,
we believe that our relative competitive
position should be enhanced by
forthcoming licensing reform.
We have a long-held preference for
freehold pubs.The fact that 97% by value
of our estate is freehold or long leasehold
means that future capital appreciation 
will accrue to our shareholders and
minimise exposure to rent increases.
Investment in pubs, brands and people is
a vital part of our approach.This year,
capital expenditure was £47.9m, of which
£37.3m was invested in pubs.The high
returns we are achieving demonstrate that
there continue to be good opportunities
to create real value from our pub
investment programmes.
Our strategy is to use the strong cash
flow of the business to enhance returns.
We aim to do so by ensuring that our
existing pubs are well maintained and by
considering acquisition opportunities as
they arise.We also aim to maintain an
efficient balance sheet and to operate 
an ongoing share buy-back programme,
in addition to our progressive dividend
policy.
Trading environment
The steady increase in margins and
returns from our businesses has been
achieved against a background of
industry-wide rises in National Insurance
contributions, pension fund payments and
other employment costs, primarily as a
result of legislation. Looking forward, we
anticipate that the implementation of
licensing reform will require additional
expenditure of around £1m during 2004
to ensure that we, our tenants and
leaseholders are all prepared for the
changes.The burden placed on the industry
by legislation and regulation continues 
to increase. Our ability to make progress
and increase margins despite these
pressures provides evidence that the
business is strongly positioned and in
good health.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW | PATHFINDER PUBS | LOCATIONCOMMUNITYPERSONALITY
Pathfinder Pubs
Our managed pub business comprised 477
pubs at the year end, compared to 488
last year.Total like-for-like sales across the
entire estate increased by 3.6%, and by
0.1% on an un-invested basis.This strong
performance in a competitive market was
helped by good summer weather and pub
investment and is against comparatives which
include the benefit of the Golden Jubilee
and football World Cup in June 2002.
During the year, we refurbished 33 pubs 
in either the “Bostin’ Local” or “Service
That Suits Me” formats. Both these
operating styles are based upon a simple
proposition: well-sited pubs developed in
a contemporary format with a strong
emphasis on food and service.
We now have 86 “Bostin’ Locals”, with a
further 75 targeted over the next two
years as refurbishments from our existing
estate.These modern community pubs
offer top drinks brands and have a good,
straightforward food menu, all with a
value-for-money price platform.This offer,
combined with a programme of events
and promotions, has contributed to
average turnover doubling compared 
to the pre-investment period. Food sales
represent approximately 30% of turnover.
We have 20 “Service That Suits Me” pubs,
and will target a further 20 over the next
two years from our existing estate.
“Service That Suits Me” pubs have a higher
price platform and higher food sales,
representing 60% of turnover on average.
They are sited in more affluent areas and
are generally “drive-to” community outlets,
which give customers the option of ordering
at the bar or enjoying full table service.
Investment in these two formats averages
approximately £300,000, a significant
reduction from the £450,000 per pub being
invested at the start of the programme
three years ago.The cost of conversions is
continuing to fall as we learn more about
the specific elements of refurbishment
contributing to improved performance.
In addition to boosting turnover this
investment has generated an average cash
return comfortably in excess of 20% to date.
Pitcher & Piano, whose 28 sites represent
6% of our total managed estate, has
benefited from investment in new menus
and improvements in operating standards,
reflected in like-for-like food sales growth.
More recently, three sites are trading
successfully after a combined £1.2m
refurbishment programme, which will 
be extended to a further seven sites
during 2004.

Director, Pathfinder Pubs, enjoying

Overall the division’s underlying operating
margin increased from 20.5% to 21.0%,
and return on capital from 12.6% to
12.8%.This was achieved through the
transfer of 104 smaller managed pubs to
lease in September 2002, the completion
of a £6m investment in electronic point of
sale (EPOS) systems in March 2003, the
negotiation of better buying terms, pricing,
and the increasing quality of our pubs.
Looking forward, the division faces
significant cost increases as a consequence
of the Government’s decision to increase
the national minimum wage by 7.1% to
£4.50 per hour from 1 October 2003.
We aim to offset this increase through
continued development of the estate,
by maximising the benefits from our
investment in EPOS and by continuing to
improve productivity.We will also benefit
from our decision to improve the choice
of top brand lagers sold in our pubs, as a
consequence of which Heineken and
Harp Irish Lager have been replaced by
either Foster’s or Carlsberg.
In addition to pub refurbishment, we are
acquiring new sites for development as
“Bostin’ Locals” or “Service That Suits Me”.
This offers the opportunity to extend our
existing geographical boundaries through
the roll-out of our proven formats and we
currently have sites under, or earmarked
for, development both within our existing
trading area and in Kent and East Anglia.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW | THE UNION PUB COMPANY | INDEPENDENCECHARACTERAPPEAL

The Union Pub Company
The tenanted and leased pub division
comprised 1,131 pubs at the year end,
compared to 1,142 last year.
Like-for-like turnover increased by 2.7%.
This growth was achieved with the benefit
of good summer weather, but also reflects
the success of our drive to extend 21-year
Open House leases across the business.

by 350 licensees attracted by the security
of tenure and the high discounts offered. W&DB Annual Report 2003    11

Underlying operating margins were 1.5%
lower than last year at 42.3%, as a result
of the one-off operational costs arising 
in 2003 from transferring 104 smaller
managed pubs to lease in September 2002.
Return on capital was maintained at 14.2%.
The pub market is polarising as a result 
of evolving consumer tastes, demographic
changes and the over-supply of pubs in
the market.These changes are felt most
keenly in weaker pubs and so we have
sought to focus on improving the quality
of our estate. Over the last four years 
we have sold 700 tenanted pubs and
integrated 500 managed house transfers.
We invested £12.2m last year in
refurbishments undertaken jointly with
tenants and lessees and aim to maintain
that investment this year. As a
consequence, we have a high quality,
freehold estate with sustainable income.
The Union Pub Company prides itself on
taking the initiative to improve business
for tenants, lessees and the Group.
A recent survey highlighted the positive
impact of some of the things we do
differently, including our pioneering “Plain
English” approach to tenant and lease
agreements.The discounts available to
tenants are amongst the highest in the
industry and we were the first to
introduce a rent panel to ensure that 
the rent setting process is fair and
transparent.This year we introduced 
a new package of “Skill Pool” training
support for tenants and lessees,
developed to ensure that they are fully
equipped with the necessary expertise 
to succeed in the pub business.
The relationship between licensees and
Business Development Managers is
becoming more constructive, with
licensees rightly expecting more advice
about how to grow their trade. A “£10k
challenge” initiative, which involved our
managers analysing individual pubs in
detail to target increased profit for the
licensee, has produced dividends. Another
example is the introduction of a facility 
to take advantage of Group buying terms
for a wide range of products and services
which has enabled licensees to reduce
significantly their purchasing costs, in 
some cases by thousands of pounds.
In this new financial year,The Union Pub
Company has indicated its intention to
provide financial support to enable
tenants to prepare for implementation of
the new licensing regime in early 2005.
We will also provide advice to help
licensees through the process and
maximise opportunities that the reform
may provide to them individually.
The Union Pub Company aims to grow
through the extension of the Open House
lease to around 50% of pubs in the current
estate, selective investment in partnership
with tenants and lessees and the acquisition
of pubs either singly or in packages. 12 W&DB Annual Report 2003

WDB Brands
Our strategy has been to reduce the
amount of capital employed in WDB
Brands and focus on a sustainable, quality
business with a high return on capital.
This strategy has been successful, with
underlying operating margin up 0.5% to
17.4% and return on capital increasing 
to 25.5% from 22.7% last year.
The re-focusing of this business on high
quality ale brands is now complete.
The task now is to grow the business
profitably and to build on the strong
market positions held by Marston’s
Pedigree, Banks’s and Mansfield.
There is a market opportunity for dedicated
brewers of high quality ales. Although the
beer market is mature and has been in
overall decline at a rate of 2% to 3% per
annum for many years, industry consolidation
offers opportunities to target real growth.
There is also greater scope to compete
for supply to the “pubco” sector of the
market, historically tied to parent brewers.
The keys to achieving that growth are
brand development, innovation, customer
relationships and service.
This year, we strengthened our beer
portfolio with the introduction of Marston’s
Old Empire, a 5.7% abv classic India Pale
Ale (IPA).We introduced a new marketing
campaign for Marston’s Pedigree based
around our “Uncompromising” and “Zero
T olerance” approach to the quality of the
brand.The Pedigree campaign, together
with the launch of keg Pedigree last year,
helped to increase market share from
8.5% to 10.3% in the on-trade. In the
latest quarter, the market share of
Pedigree overtook Bass in the on-trade 
to become the number two premium 
ale in the country.We are in the process
of reinforcing the Banks’s brand with new
fonts and pump clip designs to provide 
a more contemporary image.
This coming year, we plan to make 
a £2m investment in the brewhouse and
refrigeration plant at the Burton brewery,
which will help to increase operating
efficiency further.We have already
strengthened the management team with
key appointments in sales, marketing and
finance and believe that WDB Brands is
well positioned to benefit from future
opportunities in the beer market. W&DB Annual Report 2003    13

Prospects
We have had a good start to the new
financial year. In the eight weeks to 
22 November 2003 total like-for-like sales
in The Union Pub Company increased 
by 5.0% and across the entire Pathfinder
Pubs managed estate were 3.1% ahead 
of last year for the same period. Despite
the cost pressures on our industry, we 
aim to maintain the improved margins 
we achieved last year through further
investment in our pubs and beer brands,
and through increased efficiencies.
Our structure, community focus and largely
freehold estate all clearly differentiate us
from many of our competitors. Having
established a strong position in our core
businesses, we now aim to invest more in
new pubs, sites and refurbishments that 
fit our business model. Our objective is 
to continue to improve the quality of our
pubs and brands and our return on capital,
thereby delivering value for shareholders.

*Member of the Remuneration and Audit Committees Like-for-like sales were strong in both 
pub divisions, although Group turnover
declined by 3.0% to £490.5m as a result
of the loss of retail turnover from the 104
smaller managed pubs which transferred
to lease in September 2002, and a net
reduction in the number of pubs by 22 
in 2003, and by 73 in 2002. Underlying
operating profit fell by 0.8% (operating
profit after goodwill and exceptionals
£96.5m, 2002: £91.4m) as a result of this
net reduction and a significant increase 
in central costs due to unavoidable 
higher insurance, pension and National
Insurance costs.
Margins
Underlying operating margins increased in
both Pathfinder Pubs and WDB Brands,
and excluding the impact of the managed
to lease transfers, were marginally ahead
in The Union Pub Company, with the
Group’s operating margin increasing from
21.6% to 22.1%.This margin enhancement
has been achieved despite the anticipated
significant increases in central costs noted
above.
Return on capital
Underlying return on capital improved in
both Pathfinder Pubs and WDB Brands,
and was maintained in The Union Pub
Company, despite absorbing £1.2m of
one-off costs relating to the transfer of
104 smaller pubs to lease during the year.
The Group pre-tax return on capital was
flat due to the impact of the increased
central costs. Return on capital remains
high on the agenda and we will continue
to review the need to dispose of
underperforming assets and transfer
smaller managed pubs to lease.
Increasing cash returns 
to shareholders 
Underlying earnings per share increased by
10.1% to 68.9p per share, notwithstanding
a higher tax charge (basic eps 53.0p,
up 5.6%).This earnings growth and the
underlying strong and stable cash flow
have supported the dividend increase of
10.1% to 32.1p per share.
Our intention remains to increase
dividends broadly in line with our earnings
growth, whilst maintaining appropriate
dividend cover.
We bought back 1.2m shares at a cost 
of £7.5m in the market during the year.
Since the year end we have bought back
a further 0.7m shares at a cost of £4.7m.
Strong cash flow
During the year we generated £76.9m of
free cash flow (after interest and tax). In
addition, there were further cash inflows
of £21.0m from the disposal of 24 pubs
and unlicensed property and a further
reduction of £5.4m in the free trade loan
book and other investments.

After capital expenditure of £47.9m, net
debt was reduced in the year by £28.2m
to £468.7m at the year end – despite 
having bought back a further £7.5m of
shares. Balance sheet gearing reduced
from 110% last year end to 102% as at
September 2003.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure of £47.9m was similar
to last year, with £25.1m invested in
Pathfinder Pubs, £12.2m in The Union Pub
Company, £7.4m in WDB Brands and
£3.2m in IT systems and the unlicensed
estate. Of this £47.9m, £17.4m was 
spent on major refurbishments of over
£100,000 and £4.3m on new sites and
acquisitions.
We expect our full year investment in
2004 to be around £56m, including 
£11m identified for new site acquisition
and development.
Treasury
Interest cover was maintained at around
3.1 times, whilst the full year dividends are
2.1 times covered based on underlying
earnings.
The Group’s policy for interest rate
management continues to be to reduce
exposure to changes in interest rates
through the use of hedging instruments.
We currently have £185m of interest rate
swaps in place, which expire between
now and 2008.
In addition, the Group has debentures with
a nominal value of £220m. As a result,
at the year end over 86% of the Group’s
net debt was either fixed or hedged.
At the year end there were £63m of
unutilised banking facilities, providing
headroom to take advantage of
appropriate investment opportunities.
We plan to replace our existing five year
banking facilities, which expire in December
2004, by the end of March 2004.
Property portfolio
The value of our freehold and long
leasehold properties strongly underpins
our balance sheet.Total tangible fixed
assets of £889.9m covered our net debt
of £468.7m, 1.9 times.
T axation
The underlying rate of taxation (before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items) in the year increased from 29.7%
in 2002 to 31.5% in 2003.
Pensions
Following a recent actuarial valuation,
Company contributions to the pension
scheme, and the related charge to the
profit and loss account, were increased 
by £2.5m per year with effect from 
1 September 2003.
Measured on a FRS 17 basis, the
Company’s pension scheme has a net
deficit after tax of £56.6m at the year
end, compared to £64.1m last year end.
Exceptional items and goodwill
Goodwill impairment and amortisation 
in the year amounted to £8.5m. Net
exceptional costs excluding goodwill
impairment amounted to £3.1m.This
comprised a loss of £1.8m on the sale 
of fixed assets, which largely relate to 
the disposal of a number of high street
leasehold managed pubs; a £3.2m
payment to settle contractual obligations
in respect of Harp Irish Lager, following
the rationalisation of our lager brands;
and a tax credit of £1.9m.
Accounting policies
There have been no changes to our
accounting policies since last year’s 
annual report.
Summary
Despite significant cost increases outside
our control we have increased underlying
margins.This improvement, together with
the continued strong underlying cash flow
of our business, reinforces our confidence
in the future. Our objectives are to
continue to deliver sustained growth in
earnings per share and a progressive
dividend policy.

FIVE-YEAR RECORD W&DB Annual Report 2003    19
W&DB is committed to contributing
positively to the success of the
communities it serves, and where its
employees often reside, in a way which
will make them proud to be associated
with W&DB.
A responsible attitude towards
alcohol
We are convinced that the provision of
quality products served in well-maintained
pubs, with industry leading standards 
of customer service, creates a favourable
experience for customers and contributes
to the overall quality of life within local
communities. However we are also 
aware that public attitudes towards the
consumption of alcohol are changing,
and therefore we seek to avoid any kind
of promotional or marketing activity
designed to encourage consumption 
of excessive amounts of alcohol.
Our ongoing training programmes include
significant elements designed to help pub
staff to recognise circumstances when it
would be inappropriate to serve a
customer, and to handle difficult situations 
in a calm, safe and considerate manner.
We aim to provide all our customers 
with a high quality experience, where
food and drink can be consumed in a well
maintained, safe and friendly environment.
Advertising and marketing of
alcoholic products
We support the guidelines of The Portman
Group, an industry body set up to monitor
and advise on the responsible marketing
and selling of alcoholic products. Both
Pathfinder Pubs and The Union Pub
Company have recently become associate
members of this group.
Support for community Education
Action Zones
We also support a wide range of
community activities, including Education
Action Zones, in the Wolverhampton 
and Mansfield areas.This has provided
additional speech therapy resources,
and opportunities for local unemployed
people to train for a career in education.
Charitable donations
Each year our licensed retail managers,
pub staff and tenants raise very large
amounts of money for a wide variety 
of charitable causes.
Pathfinder Pubs has raised over £250,000
through locally run pub-based activities,
and almost £40,000 from employees within
its central support functions, all of which will
be used to support local charitable events.
In addition to providing support for the
charitable activities of their tenants and
lessees,The Union Pub Company
supports the Queen’s Hospital, Burton
Cancer Appeal and other similar charities.
WDB Brands has raised over £15,000
from a number of initiatives across our
trading estate.
Our employees also run their own charity
fund which has raised over £120,000 for
local causes.
Working with The Prince’s Trust
We are pleased to be involved with 
The Prince’s Trust. Placements with this
Trust form an integral part of our
Graduate T raining Programme, offering
our managers of the future a chance to
contribute to their wider community and
to develop vital people and project
management skills.
Listening to our employees
W&DB is a people-focused business and
it is vital that we keep our employees
informed of what our aims are, and how
we intend to achieve them. More
importantly, we listen to what our
employees have to say, and respond in 
a positive and timely manner.
In addition to regular briefing sessions,
we publish a range of in-house magazines
designed to keep employees updated 
on Group events, and also to record and
celebrate employee achievements.Well
attended roadshows and conference
presentations are increasingly seen as 
an integral part of how each of our
trading divisions operate. Many of the
management and support teams are also
involved in an ongoing programme of
“back to the floor” exercises, allowing
them to make substantial improvements
from the direct feedback of employees 
at all levels within the business.
Employee consultation
As well as Group-led activities we also
have an excellent relationship with a
number of trade unions. In many areas
employee representatives play an
important and positive part in developing
our business, and we intend to continue
with and improve these relationships.
Acting on employee feedback
The overall results and trends revealed 
by the confidential employee attitude
surveys which we run are fed back to 
our employees. Significant positive 
changes to both employee benefits and
communication processes have been
made, demonstrating our commitment 
to listen.The most significant this year has
been the introduction of an Employee
Assistance Programme; this provides
confidential support 24 hours a day,
365 days a year for employees.
We continue to explore opportunities to
improve current practices and, where
appropriate, to introduce new initiatives.
CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 20 W&DB Annual Report 2003
CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Diversity and the work/life balance
Having predominantly community-based
pubs means that the vast majority of
employees are recruited from the
communities around them.The majority
of our pub staff are also part-time,
and work hours to suit their personal
circumstances.As part of our development
programmes, we offer recruitment and
selection modules which identify the
benefits of having a diverse workforce.
We are aware of our responsibilities 
in respect of the provisions of the
forthcoming Disability Discrimination 
Act and, as well as setting up audit
programmes, Pathfinder Pubs has become
a member of the Employers’ Forum on
Disability.
We recruit locally and offer a working
environment and benefits package which
promotes employee retention.This year
has seen significant improvements in
maternity and paternity arrangements
well above the new legal statutory
requirements.
Developing all our employees
Structured and focused training and
development programmes are available 
to all employees, and everyone with the
desire and enthusiasm to progress within
W&DB has the opportunity to do so.
We have achieved the prestigious Investor
in People standard, and have been
continuously accredited since 1995.We
were re-accredited earlier this year using
the most rigorous of assessment
methods.
The Board and health and safety
The health and safety of our employees
and members of the communities we
serve is a key priority.The Group has 
a Health and Safety Policy which is
endorsed by the Board and used
throughout the Group. A bi-annual report
is prepared for the Board which gives
detailed statistics relating to health and
safety issues and progress made in
improving health and safety matters.These
reports are actively discussed, debated
and challenged at all management levels.
Health and safety – practical
application and employee
involvement
Relevant health and safety information
and guidance forms a part of every
employee’s induction process, and many
managers have been trained in risk
assessment techniques.The health and
safety issues in the workplace are
reviewed regularly.
All our production and head office
locations have active health and safety
committees which meet regularly 
under the co-ordination of the Group
Health and Safety Manager.These
committees include members of the
management team and trained employee
representatives who review local 
health and safety issues and make
recommendations for improvement.
Within Pathfinder Pubs, all pubs undergo
health and safety audits by external
contractors.The measures by which a
satisfactory outcome is determined are
regularly reviewed. Each pub has its own
copy of a comprehensive health and
safety manual for use as a source of
information, guidance and training. In
addition a health and safety committee
has recently been established in order 
to increase the profile of health and 
safety issues.
Tenants and lessees within The Union 
Pub Company are provided with the
opportunity to receive health and safety
training, and can also obtain examples of
best practice for use within their pubs. W&DB Annual Report 2003    21
The Board determines the Group
environmental policy. A sub committee 
of the Board, chaired by the Finance
Director, meets twice a year to review 
the performance of the Group against
that policy.

the Group have recycling containers for
glass.We aim to reduce the amount of
waste destined for landfill by the use of
reclamation/recycling and other means.
Grease. We continue to improve grease
management. Contracts are in place 
to ensure regular equipment maintenance,
and responsible waste disposal.
Biotechnology trials at a number of sites
will be monitored with the aim of
extending these across the estate, thus
reducing the amount of waste produced.
Cooking oil. Used cooking oil is collected
by waste contractors who dispose of 
it in the most responsible manner
commercially available.

to comply with the Control of Asbestos
at Work Regulations 2004. Detailed
surveys have been undertaken at over
300 sites across the Group.

Resolution number 7 – to approve the Directors’ remuneration report.
Resolution number 8 – to approve the Executive Share Option Scheme 2004.
Resolution number 9 – to approve the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 (LTIP).

Company authority to exercise this power, within certain limits, to enable it to purchase its own shares in the market.We undertake that the authority
will only be exercised if we are satisfied that the purchase will result in an increase in earnings per share and is in the best interests of shareholders
generally. Subject to the passing of Resolution number 12 and to the extent that the Company exercises such power, the Company may decide either
to cancel the shares it purchases pursuant to such power and/or hold such shares in treasury for resale.

having an aggregate nominal value of £3,232,067, being 14.99% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 27 September 2003.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Composition and T erms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and comprises Peter Lipscomb (Chairman), Miles Emley and Lord Hodgson, all of whom
are independent Non-executive Directors.The Committee is responsible for:
  setting the framework and policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors; and
  determining the specific elements of the Executive Directors’ compensation arrangements and contractual terms.
In setting policy and compensation levels, the Remuneration Committee has due regard to the Combined Code.
The Committee took advice on specific issues during the year from the Chief Executive, Ralph Findlay, however, Ralph Findlay did not provide any
advice in relation to his own remuneration.
Following the year end, the Board, with the approval of the Remuneration Committee, appointed consultants, Deloitte, to undertake a full review 
of Executive Director remuneration to ensure that the policy is in line with best practice and that remuneration is competitive.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s remuneration policy for the current financial year and for the future is to ensure that the remuneration of Executive Directors 
is competitive, to enable the Company to retain and motivate existing Directors and attract high quality performers in the future.The Company 
aims to incentivise and reward its senior executives in a way that is consistent with the Company’s commercial objectives and to align the interests
of the Directors with those of shareholders.
To achieve this, the Executive Directors’ total remuneration comprises both fixed remuneration and variable reward which is linked to Company
performance and individual achievement.
The main fixed and performance-related (“variable”) elements for Executive Directors in 2003 were as follows:
Fixed
  basic salary;
  benefits in kind (detailed in the notes to the Directors’ emoluments table below); and
  pension benefits.
Variable
  annual award of share options vesting after three years, subject to long-term performance conditions being met; and
  annual bonus related to Company performance and personal objectives.
The Company’s remuneration policy in respect of Non-executive Directors is to pay annual fees which reflect the responsibilities and duties placed
upon them, also having regard to market practice. 26 W&DB Annual Report 2003
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Service contracts
The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors’ contracts are for a duration of 12 months and are subject to 12 months’ notice when terminated
by the Company and six months’ notice when terminated by the Executive Director. However, Derek Andrew has had a two-year rolling contract
since 1987 and David Thompson has had a six-month rolling contract since July 2003. All service contracts expire on the Director reaching age 60
unless the Company subsequently agrees that the Director may continue to work beyond the age of 60.The following table details the Directors’
service contracts.
Date of Notice period Notice period
contract (Company) (Director)
Derek Andrew 15 Aug 01 24 months 6 months
Alistair Darby 16 May 03 12 months 6 months
Ralph Findlay 15 Aug 01 12 months 6 months
Paul Inglett 22 Mar 02 12 months 6 months
Stephen Oliver 15 Aug 01 12 months 6 months
David Thompson 24 Jan 02 6 months 6 months
Payments to Directors upon termination of their contracts will be equal to the Director’s basic salary for the duration of the notice period.There 
is no reduction for mitigation or for early payment.
With the exception of David Thompson, the Non-executive Directors do not have a service contract and their appointments may be terminated
without compensation at any time.
The Committee has reviewed these arrangements in the light of current market practice and of the relevant provisions of the Combined Code and
considers that they are appropriate and in the interests of shareholders, the Company and the individuals concerned.
Salaries
Salaries for Executive Directors were reviewed as at 1 October 2002.The aim of the Company is to provide a competitive remuneration package 
and salary levels are determined by considering them against practice in an appropriate peer group and in the context of other pay awards made 
in the Group.
Bonuses
Bonus objectives for Executive Directors for 2003 were set based on a combination of Group profit achievement and personal objectives.
There is a maximum possible bonus of 50% of basic salary, payable in December 2003 where 35% is allocated on the basis of profit achievement
and 15% based on personal objectives. All such bonuses are non-pensionable.
Bonus objectives and level of awards for 2004 are currently under review.
Share incentive schemes
The Company operates three executive share option schemes.The 1985 and the 1994 Executive Share Option Schemes are Inland Revenue
approved schemes and the 1997 Executive Share Option Scheme is a non-Inland Revenue approved scheme used to make awards to Executive
Directors and other selected employees above their £30,000 tax efficient limit.The 1985 scheme expired in January 1994.
Executive share options are awarded by the Remuneration Committee at the prevailing market rate on the date of grant to selected employees 
as a means of long term incentive. Options are exercisable upon the achievement of stated performance criteria. W&DB Annual Report 2003    27
The exercise of executive share options granted under the 1994 and 1997 Schemes is subject to the Group achieving growth in earnings per share
in excess of the growth in the retail price index by an average of 2.0% per year over a three-year performance period.
The Committee believes the EPS performance condition to be appropriate and provides relative alignment with the Group’s economic performance.
The 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme will expire in January 2004 and it is proposed that the Company will adopt a new Executive Share
Option Scheme to replace both the 1994 and 1997 Schemes.The new scheme will comprise an Inland Revenue approved scheme with the ability
to grant unapproved options over and above the individual £30,000 limit. Shareholder approval for the new Executive Share Option Scheme is
currently being sought.

The graph below represents the comparative total shareholder return (TSR) performance of the Company against the FTSE All Share Index during
the previous five financial years.The FTSE All Share Index has been selected as a comparator because this is a broad market index of which the
Company is a member.The Company believes it would have been less meaningful to use a narrower index such as the Leisure and Hotels index for
comparison purposes.The TSR indices used in the chart have been calculated in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations
2002 relative to a base date at the end of September 1998.

The following additional information relates to Directors’ pensions:
(a) Normal retirement age: 60.
(b) On death before retirement a lump sum is payable, equal to the Director’s contributions. However, some or all of this lump sum may be used to
provide a statutory minimum spouse’s pension. On death after retirement the spouse’s pension payable is two-thirds of the pension which the
member was receiving at the date of death.
(c) Early retirement can be taken from age 50 provided the Company gives its consent.The accrued pension will then be reduced to take account
of its early payment.
(d) Pension increases for Derek Andrew, Ralph Findlay, David Thompson, Paul Inglett and Alistair Darby will be in line with statutory requirements
before and after retirement. Stephen Oliver will receive statutory increases before retirement, post retirement increases on pension earned prior
to 6 April 1997 at the rate of 3% per annum and post retirement increases on pension earned after 5 April 1997 at the increase in the retail
prices index, subject to a maximum of 5% and a minimum of 3%.The Trustees have the discretion to grant pension increases above these rates.
(e) There are no discretionary benefits.
Ralph Findlay participated in an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (UURBS) from 13 January 1998 to 15 August 2001.The amount
charged in the profit and loss account in respect of the UURBS has been included within contributions to the pension schemes above.The UURBS was
replaced by a funded unapproved scheme (FURBS) from 15 August 2001 with past service UURBS being bought out by contributions to the FURBS
spread over five years from 1 October 2001.The second such payment of £93,750 was made on 1 October 2002, together with £62,500 to meet 
the tax liability created.The total commitment of £468,750 was charged to the profit and loss account in the year ended 28 September 2002.The
Company contribution to the FURBS for the period ended 27 September 2003 was £76,500. 32 W&DB Annual Report 2003

Paul Inglett has participated in a FURBS since 11 March 2002.The Company contribution to the FURBS for the period ending 27 September 2003
was £28,560.
Pension arrangements
During the year the Group operated a final salary pension scheme and a Group Personal Pension Plan (GPPP).
During the year, for the final salary scheme the Group contributed 16.5% of the pensionable payroll for all members to 1 April 2003, 18.5% of
pensionable payroll from 1 April 2003 to 1 September 2003 and 32.0% of pensionable payroll from 1 September 2003. Members contributed in
accordance with the Rules. All employees in the Group final salary pension schemes have death-in-service life assurance cover to the value of
four times pensionable salary.
The Group introduced the GPPP for new entrants with effect from 29 September 1997 to which it contributes 7.0% of pensionable salary and
members contribute a minimum of 3.5% of their pensionable salary. Membership of the GPPP includes death-in-service life assurance cover to the
value of between two and four times pensionable salary.
During the year, the Group operated a final salary pension scheme for employees who joined the Scheme prior to 29 September 1997.The funds 
of the Scheme are administered by Trustees and are separate from the Group. A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 1 September 2003.
This resulted in a long-term Group contribution rate of 32.0% of members’ total earnings.The increase from 16.5% in the 1 October 2000 valuation
was mainly due to falling equity markets.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the funding position of the Scheme are those relating to the differences between the 
long-term rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in earnings.The 1 September 2003 valuation for the Scheme assumed that the
long-term investment return pre-retirement would exceed salary increases by 3.9% per annum and price inflation by 4.9% per annum. It assumed
that the long-term investment return after retirement would exceed salary increases by 2.1% per annum and price inflation by 3.1% per annum.
The market value of the Scheme assets was £135.3m, which was sufficient to cover 78.5% of members’ accrued benefits, after allowing for future
increases in earnings at the long-term rate.
A provision of £3.0m (2002: £3.1m) is included in creditors representing the cumulative excess of pension costs charged to the profit and loss
account over the Group contributions paid.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT W&DB Annual Report 2003    33
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statement of compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code
W&DB is committed to achieving high standards of corporate governance and to integrity and high ethical standards in all its business activities.The
Board considers that it has complied with Section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the period, and to the date of the report, with the following
exceptions:
  The Nomination Committee is formed on an ad hoc basis whenever required.
  Derek Andrew has a two-year rolling service contract. David Thompson’s two-year rolling service contract has been replaced by a new contract
settling at six months’ notice on 25 July 2003. Both are described in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Structure
The Board comprises four Non-executive Directors, one of whom is Chairman and five Executive Directors.The Non-executive Directors all
possess a wide range of skills and experience and all exercise independent judgement with the exception of David Thompson who, because of his
past experience as a long-serving Executive Director, cannot be considered independent. Peter Lipscomb, Deputy Chairman, has been appointed the
senior independent Non-executive Director. His experience and business interests ensure his independence from management.
The Board meets 12 times each year in the normal course of business and additionally as required. It has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it 
for approval ensuring that it considers strategic, financial, organisational and compliance matters with timely information provided in advance of each
meeting. All Directors receive within their Board papers details of the Group’s performance against budget and individual reports from the Chief
Executive, Finance Director and divisional managing directors.The Board also receives presentations from senior executives on a regular basis, which
provides an opportunity for formal discussions with senior managers.There is a clear division of roles and responsibilities between the Chairman and
the Chief Executive.
The Executive Committee, which comprises the five Executive Directors, meets weekly.The Board is briefed on the decisions reached by the
Committee including those involving risk management and health and safety issues.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and also to independent legal advice. On appointment to the Board 
all Executive Directors receive appropriate training; all Directors receive a full induction programme covering briefings and meetings with divisional
directors and senior management. All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity following appointment and to 
re-election at intervals not exceeding three years. Non-executive Directors are appointed for terms of three years.The Board considers that all
Directors bring an individual judgement to the Board’s deliberations in respect of strategy, performance, resources, key appointments and standards
of conduct. All Non-executive Directors are considered by the Board to be free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with
the exercise of their judgement.
All Board Committees have agreed terms of reference.
The Audit Committee comprises Miles Emley (Chairman), Lord Hodgson and Peter Lipscomb. It monitors the relationship with the Auditors, agrees
their scope of work and fees and reviews the results of the full year audit and the interim results each year. It also assesses annually the cost
effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the Auditors.
Board appointments are considered by the Nomination Committee which comprises David Thompson (Chairman), Miles Emley, Ralph Findlay and
Peter Lipscomb. It met once during the year for the appointment of Alistair Darby.
The Remuneration Committee comprises Peter Lipscomb (Chairman), Miles Emley and Lord Hodgson with Ralph Findlay in attendance if required.
It is responsible for agreeing contract terms, remuneration and benefits, including bonuses, for Executive Directors and, where appropriate, senior
executives. It is also responsible for the granting of share options under the Company’s share option schemes. 34 W&DB Annual Report 2003
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Communication
W&DB recognises the importance of maintaining a strong relationship with its shareholders as a key priority, with the annual report and interim
report as the principal media used, as well as regular institutional presentations, covering reports on trading, market conditions and strategy.W&DB
also maintains a website to provide up-to-date information on its operations and brands. All Company announcements are available on this 
site together with slides for analysts’ presentations.The annual general meeting, which is regularly attended by approximately 300 shareholders,
provides an important forum for communicating directly with shareholders and the opportunity for shareholders to raise questions with the Board.
At the annual general meeting the Chairman announces the results of proxy voting on each resolution after it has been dealt with on a show of hands.
Internal control
W&DB, as required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, has complied with the Combined Code provisions on internal control.
The Executive Directors examine, and report to the Board as necessary, the procedures required to implement in full the guidance on internal
control produced by the Turnbull Committee. In addition, the Board has taken account of the Association of British Insurers guidelines on socially
responsible investment and in this respect has been registered on the FTSE4Good index.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and for ensuring that information supplied to shareholders presents a balanced
assessment of the Group’s position. It has carried out these responsibilities throughout the year.
There is a weekly review by the Executive Directors and an annual review by the Board, of the risks faced by the Group.These cover financial,
operational and risk management issues – day-to-day control is implemented by divisional management teams which report to divisional managing
directors. In addition a workshop facilitated by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP took place in March 2003 at which all senior managers and Executive
Directors considered the potential risks which could threaten achievement of the Group’s strategic plans and budgets. Specifically, the objectives of
the workshop were to:
  identify the range of risks faced and prioritise them;
  identify and assess the internal controls in place to manage the key risks; and
  develop action plans, where appropriate, to improve the response to the key risks identified.
The action plans were subsequently considered by Divisional Boards and by the Audit Committee and were reviewed by the Board.The plans
provide the basis of the Group’s response to all risks to which the Group is exposed and are reviewed on an ongoing basis.There is a continuous
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks facing the Group at the weekly Executive Directors’ meetings and at monthly briefing
meetings with the senior executive management group. Risk and litigation issues are also reviewed regularly by the Chief Executive and the Company
Secretary.
The principal elements of the system of internal control, which is designed to ensure there is an ongoing process to identify, evaluate and manage
the risks to which the Group is exposed, include:
  a management structure which clearly defines authority levels, responsibility and accountability;
  a detailed formal budgeting process for all Group activities with the annual Group budget being formally approved by the Board; and
  a process to ensure Board approval is given to all major investment and strategic plans including capital expenditure and development programmes.
Significant treasury, cash management and investment matters are reviewed and approved by the Board.
The Group’s system of internal controls can only manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can, therefore,
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material mis-statement or loss. W&DB Annual Report 2003    35
Health and safety
The management of health and safety matters is based on the Health and Safety Executive’s management system HSG 65. All areas of the Group 
have been risk assessed and appropriate control measures implemented. Regular Safety Committee meetings are held throughout the Group and
independent experts such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and insurers are used.
Going concern
The Directors are confident, having reviewed the Group’s budget for the 53 weeks to 2 October 2004 and relevant plans beyond that date, that the
Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.This review included an analysis of business
operating plans, proposed capital expenditure and associated cash flow projections. It also included a comparison of results and ratios within the
Group’s committed borrowing facilities. It is therefore considered appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
By Order of the Board
Leslie Porter Secretary
3 December 2003 36 W&DB Annual Report 2003
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.
The Directors consider that they have complied fully with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements on pages 38 to 62.
The Directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group, and to enable them to ensure that financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the Auditors does not involve
consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the Auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial
statements, since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’
remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent mis-statements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements.The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, the
Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the Financial review, the Corporate and social responsibility report, the Environmental policy report and the Corporate

the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all
risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report are free from material mis-statement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

Group for the year then ended;
  the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and

1  Accounting policies
(a) Accounting convention
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain freehold and leasehold properties,
in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The Group continues to follow the transitional arrangements permitted by FRS 17,“Post retirement benefits” and the additional disclosures are
presented in note 5 to these accounts.
(b) Basis of consolidation 
The Group accounts include the assets, liabilities and results for the period of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
(c) Turnover and other operating income
Turnover comprises sales, rents receivable from licensed properties and other trading income of the Group, exclusive of intra-Group transactions
and VAT. Other operating income comprises mainly rents from unlicensed properties.
(d) Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes direct materials and a proportion of appropriate overheads.
(e) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the period-end balance sheet date which 
give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and profits 
as stated in the accounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and assets are only recognised where probable.
(f) T angible fixed assets
(i) Freehold and leasehold properties are stated at valuation or at cost. Plant, furnishings, equipment and other similar items are stated at cost.
(ii) Freehold buildings are depreciated to residual value on a straight line basis over 50 years.
(iii) Other tangible fixed assets are depreciated to residual value on a straight line basis at rates calculated to provide for the cost of the assets over
their anticipated useful lives. Leasehold properties are depreciated over the lower of the lease period and 50 years and other tangible assets over
periods ranging from three to 15 years.
(iv) Own labour directly attributable to capital projects is capitalised.
Valuation of properties
Trading properties are revalued professionally by independent valuers on a five-year rolling basis.When a valuation or expected proceeds are below
current carrying value the asset concerned is reviewed for impairment. Impairment losses are charged either to the revaluation reserve to the extent
that a previous gain has been recorded, or to the profit and loss account.
(g) Fixed asset disposals
Profit on fixed asset disposals is net sale proceeds less carrying value of the assets.
(h) Pensions
Pension costs for the Group’s final salary pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the
average working life of employees, in accordance with the recommendations of independent qualified actuaries.Variations from the regular cost are
spread over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
Pension costs for the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account in the period incurred.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS W&DB Annual Report 2003    43
1  Accounting policies continued
(i) Investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost.
(j) Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
The assets of the trust are recognised as fixed asset investments until the shares have been vested unconditionally to specific employees.
Any permanent diminution in the value of the shares is recognised immediately as a charge to the profit and loss account.
(k) T rade loans
Trade loans provided to publicans who purchase from the Group are recorded as fixed asset investments.They are linked to supply terms and 
are of a long-term nature.Trade loans are held at the lower of the amount advanced and the recoverable amount.
(l) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets acquired. Goodwill is capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over its useful economic life up 
to a presumed maximum of 20 years.The Directors consider the carrying value of goodwill and make appropriate adjustments to reflect the
disposal of certain assets to which it relates.Where goodwill is impaired, the charge is taken to the profit and loss account.
(m) Leases
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease.
The cost of assets held under finance leases is included within tangible fixed assets and depreciation is provided in accordance with the policy for the
class of asset concerned.The corresponding obligations under these leases are shown as creditors.The finance charge element of rentals is charged
to the profit and loss account as incurred.
(n) Financial instruments
The financial costs of debt instruments are held at cost and are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate
on the carrying amount.

Final Salary Pension Scheme
During the year, the Group operated a Final Salary Pension Scheme (defined benefit scheme) for employees who joined the scheme prior to 
29 September 1997.The funds of the final salary scheme are administered by trustees and are separate from the Group.The Group contribution
rate increased from 16.5% to 18.5% of pensionable salaries in April 2003. In September 2003, the Group contribution rate rose to 32.0% 
of pensionable salaries, following the recommendations of an independent qualified actuary.
The Final Salary Pension Scheme was closed to new entrants on 29 September 1997. A Group Personal Pension Plan has been made available 
to eligible employees since that date.
The latest scheme valuation of the Final Salary Pension Scheme conducted by an independent actuary for the Group was as at 1 September 2003.
The actuarial valuation was carried out using the projected unit method.The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the funding position
of the scheme are those relating to the differences between the long-term rate of investment return and the rates of increase in earnings.The
valuation as at 1 September 2003 assumed that the long-term investment return pre-retirement would exceed salary increases by 3.9% per annum
and price inflation by 4.9% per annum. It assumed that the long-term investment return after retirement would exceed salary increases by 2.1% per
annum and price inflation by 3.1% per annum.The market value of scheme assets was £135.3m, which was sufficient to cover 78.5% of members’
accrued benefits.The Group increased its contribution rate with effect from September 2003, in response to this shortfall.
The Group paid total contributions of £3.6m (2002: £3.6m) to the scheme during the period. As the scheme is closed to new entrants, it is
expected that the costs of benefits will steadily rise in the future, as the average age of members increases.
A provision of £3.0m (2002: £3.1m) is included in creditors representing the cumulative excess of pension costs charged to the profit and loss
account over the Group’s contributions paid.
Group Personal Pension Plan
The Group paid contributions of £0.3m (2002: £0.2m) to the Group Personal Pension Plan (defined contribution scheme) during the period.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits disclosure
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme. An actuarial valuation for the purposes of FRS 17 was carried out at 27 September 2003 and

Deferred tax has been calculated at the tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws
enacted at the balance sheet date.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing properties to their market value or on the sale of properties where
potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets. Such tax would only become payable if the properties were sold without it
being possible to claim rollover relief. The total amount unprovided for, after offsetting available capital losses, is estimated at £40.7m. At present, it is
not envisaged that any such tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.

As permitted by the Companies Act 1985 a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been prepared.The profit after taxation dealt

11 Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary
shares in issue during the period, excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP , see note 14) which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential
ordinary shares.These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the weighted average market price of the
Company’s shares during the period.
Supplementary earnings per share figures are presented.These exclude the effects of exceptionals and goodwill amortisation.The Directors consider
that the supplementary figures provide a useful additional indication of performance.

19  Financial instruments
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise debentures, preference shares, bank borrowings (loans and overdrafts), other
loans, finance leases and cash.The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.The Group has various
other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations, which have not been included in the
following disclosures.
The only derivatives that the Group enters into are interest rate swaps and other interest rate hedging instruments.The purpose of these
transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies
for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, debentures and bank borrowings.The Group borrows at both fixed and
floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Group’s exposure to interest
rate fluctuations.
The Group’s aim is to reduce the risk of exposure to market rate fluctuations in interest movements in the medium term.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure continuity of funding and in particular to ensure that debt requirements for the medium term are available 
through committed facilities. In addition, having regard to the longevity of the Group’s assets, secured debentures are regarded as being suitable 
debt instruments.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities and other uncommitted facilities.
Currency risk
The Group has no material exposure to currency rate risk. W&DB Annual Report 2003    57

The fair value of the interest rate swaps, which has no book value, has been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which
the instruments involved are traded.Trade loans are excluded from the fair value table as they are linked to customer supply terms. All other fair
values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Hedges
As explained above, the Group’s policy is to hedge interest rate risk using interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are
not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are as follows:

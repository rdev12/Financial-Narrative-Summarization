Listening to our customers
At Wolseley we continue to focus on improving 
customer service. We passionately believe that 
excellent customer service is at the heart of our 
business and we can always ﬁnd ways to improve.
The pace of change of today’s world is creating tremendous challenges and opportunities 
for our customers’ businesses. New technology and innovation are redrawing traditional 
ways of doing business. This is creating new and emerging opportunities for Wolseley 
and we are continuing to ﬁnd ways to help our customers do business more efﬁciently. 
From new channels which enable customers to trade with us 24/7 , to more ﬂexible ways 
of doing business, to better trained, more knowledgeable staff. 
While you’ll see in this year’s annual report and accounts that we’ve come a long way, 
we will keep listening to our customers; which gives us conﬁdence we can keep improving 
our business.

Listening to our customers
I want to do business with you on the move
The demands on our customers’ 
time are ever increasing which 
means that contractors aren’t 
always able to contact a branch. 
Our Swiss plumbing and heating 
business has operated an E-Shop for 
over 10 years and it now represents 
25 per cent of its revenue. The E-Shop 
and other electronic order channels 
allow customers to order 24/7 from a 
range of over 20,000 stock-keeping 
units (“SKUs”), and orders taken 
before 6pm are delivered the next day 
anywhere in Switzerland. With the 
use of mobile devices increasing, 
customers can now also order on the 
move, or from the jobsite. They can 
see up-to-date product availability and 
trade prices and can also access their 
current and historic orders, delivery 
notes and invoices – all on the device 
of their choice, be it PC, laptop, phone 
or tablet. I don’t have time to be kept on hold!
This year in the USA we 
have piloted a new business 
approach in Fort Myers, Florida. 
We centralised the inside sales team 
which looks after larger account 
customers, from four branches in 
the region to a single integrated 
operation. All inside sales associates 
are now located together. Using a new 
telephony system, a receptionist takes 
the calls on behalf of the branches 
and directs the requests to the right 
person. In the ﬁrst three months 
Fort Myers signiﬁcantly increased its 
revenue and gained new customers 
and is now providing a faster, more 
efﬁcient service to existing customers. 
Most importantly, we now never miss 
a call!

Our investment case
Many customers 
The customer base is very fragmented. 
Wolseley services approximately 
1 million customers across the Group.
Customers’ needs are local 
Professional contractors typically 
operate within about 20 miles of a 
local branch and may visit it several 
times per week. In addition to visiting 
branches they are now using emerging 
channels such as e-commerce which 
complement their working patterns. 
Large vendor base 
The vendor base is large. 
Wolseley distributes the products 
of approximately 70,000 vendors 
across the world.
Population growth 
Growth of one per cent per year 
is expected in the USA in the next 
decade. Population is expected to grow 
in almost all the countries we operate in.
Source: United Nations Department of Economic 
and Social Affairs
Ageing housing stock
The median age of homes in the USA 
is 39 years. As housing stock ages 
there is increased demand for repairs, 
maintenance and improvement work.
Source: US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development
Clear need for distributors 
in the supply chain 
Distributors bridge the gap between 
the large vendor base and the large and 
geographically dispersed professional 
customer base.
Increased comfort levels 
in homes 
85 per cent of new homes in the 
USA have two or more bathrooms. 
There is a trend towards increasing 
levels of comfort in homes.
Source: US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development
Highly fragmented industry 
with no market dominated 
by a single player 
Our markets are typically highly 
fragmented, with few large players 
in the industry.
Sustainable development
The EU plans for all new public 
buildings to be ‘nearly zero energy’ 
by 2019. Environmental concerns will drive 
demand for renovation of existing buildings.
Source: European Council for an Energy 
Efﬁcient Economy
Beneﬁts of scale 
Due to scale beneﬁts leaders 
can perform better through the 
economic cycle.
Growing markets 
Demand for our products is cyclical and inﬂuenced by 
macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic product 
(“GDP”), unemployment and consumer conﬁdence. 
Other key factors supporting long-term growth in the 
markets are as follows:
Large aftermarket 
The size of the building repair 
market in Western Europe is 
forecast to be €543 billion in 2013. 
There is a very large aftermarket with 
renovation spend often in excess of 
new construction spend.
Source: Euroconstruct Our business
We hold leading positions in many of the markets in which 
we operate. Our knowledge, coverage and scale enable us 
to operate efﬁciently and provide a high level of service to 
our customers.
Overview
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 7
Our strategy
Our goal is to deliver 
long-term sustainable 
and proﬁtable growth 
ahead of the market. 
We will continue to 
extend our leading 
positions in plumbing 
and heating, and building 
materials distribution.
A large proportion of our businesses are market 
leaders in their local markets, and 83 per cent of 
the Group’s revenue is generated by businesses 
which are number one or two in their markets.
Wolseley achieved a return on capital employed 
in the year ended 31 July 2013 of 32.2 per cent.

181.8 pence, 8.0% ahead of last year.
 Increased total ordinary dividend 
to 66 pence (2011/12: 60 pence).

Results and strategy
I am delighted to report another good 
year for Wolseley with like-for-like revenue 
growth of 2.9 per cent and a strong 
performance in trading proﬁt, up nearly 
11 per cent. The trading margin of 5.6 per 
cent was 0.3 per cent ahead of last year 
(2011/12: 5.3 per cent). 
Our US business is generating excellent 
growth and we continue to outperform 
the market in our principal businesses. 
The gains from ongoing efﬁciencies have 
been reinvested to drive future growth. 
We have delivered a further improvement 
in the trading margin to 7.3 per cent in the 
USA which has taken us above the historic 
peak margin achieved in 2007. In Canada, 
whilst residential markets have cooled in 
the past 12 months, we have still delivered 
proﬁt growth in the year. 
The fundamentals of our businesses in 
Europe are broadly solid; however in some 
regions economic conditions have become 
increasingly challenging through the year. 
At the start of the year we announced a 
series of measures to improve operational 
efﬁciency with a particular focus on 
lowering operating costs to make our 
businesses more competitive for the 
future. This included action to improve the 
competitiveness of our building materials 
business in France and lowering its cost to 
serve, which we are conﬁdent will deliver 
improved returns in the long term. You can 
read about these actions in the Chief 
Executive’s review.
Finally, we have delivered another year 
of strong cash ﬂow, which is enabling 
us to invest in the business and reward 
shareholders. During the year we have 
also made a number of value-creating 
in-ﬁll acquisitions, which are making a 
good contribution to the Group.
Progress on strategy
Our strategy is unchanged and our core 
focus remains on delivering shareholder 
value from the signiﬁcant opportunity in 
construction distribution. The structural 
growth opportunity in our geographical 
markets is large and whilst organic growth 
remains the priority, we will continue to 
supplement this with in-ﬁll acquisitions. 
At the same time we also continue to 
drive cost efﬁciency, which underpins our 
expectation of further improvement in the 
operating margin over the medium term.
“We remain very positive 
about our ability to grow 
the business, capitalising 
on the signiﬁcant 
opportunities to 
outperform our markets 
over the long term, while 
at the same time 
improving returns.” Overview
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 9
Executing our strategy has been an 
important theme in 2012/13. I am 
particularly proud of the work undertaken 
by Ian Meakins, our Chief Executive, 
and his team on evolving our business 
models to drive beneﬁts of scale and to 
address customer needs. We have made 
great strides this year in sharpening our 
customer segmentation and continuing to 
invest in a full multi-channel approach while 
moving to a more systematically managed 
branch network. In particular this year we 
continue to develop our e-business offering 
both to our traditional trade segments but 
also expanding our business into reaching 
consumers online. Overall we remain 
very positive about our ability to grow the 
business, capitalising on the signiﬁcant 
opportunities to outperform our markets 
over the long term, while at the same time 
as improving returns.
Commitment to corporate 
responsibility
Corporate responsibility underpins the 
sustainability of our business and, as 
such, is an integral part of achieving our 
overall strategy. The Board believes that 
the integration of corporate responsibility 
across the Group and the inclusion of 
broader social and environmental issues 
into our decision-making processes will 
help Wolseley to achieve our business 
goals, act as a building block for growth 
in shareholder value and beneﬁt the 
communities in which we operate. As such, 
the Board remains fully committed to this 
important aspect of how we operate. 
We are now in our fourth year of measuring 
our progress and our drive for continuous 
improvement is set out in the Corporate 
Responsibility section of this report on 
pages 48 to 63.
Shareholder returns 
Our commitment to creating shareholder 
value remains strong. In line with our 
progressive dividend policy, this year the 
Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend of 
44 pence per share (2011/12: 40 pence 
per share) for payment on 2 December 
2013 to shareholders on the register on 
11 October 2013. This brings the total 
ordinary dividend for the year to 66 pence 
per share (2011/12: 60 pence per share), 
which is a year-on-year increase of 
10 per cent.
With the conﬁdence we have in our 
future performance and our current 
investment requirements, we remain 
committed to returning surplus cash ﬂow 
to shareholders above and beyond that 
required to fund organic growth and in-ﬁll 
acquisitions. Early in the year we took 
the decision to drive greater efﬁciency 
into the balance sheet through a return of 
capital and associated share consolidation 
of 122 pence per share or £348 million, 
by way of a special dividend paid on 
31 December 2012.
We are proposing a further special 
dividend to shareholders of 
£300 million, which is expected to be 
paid in December. The special dividend 
and share consolidation will be subject 
to shareholder approval at the AGM on 
26 November 2013.
Our balance sheet remains very strong and 
the Group will continue to target net debt 
in the range of 1x to 2x EBITDA, consistent 
with investment grade credit metrics.
The Board
As Chairman, I seek to ensure that the 
Board is as effective as possible and 
I believe strongly that this is the case. 
Over the past two years I, alongside 
my colleagues on the Nominations 
Committee, have sought to ensure that 
the right balance of skills, experience, 
capabilities, independence, diversity 
and knowledge of the Company are 
reﬂected on the Board. During the year 
we have further strengthened the Board 
and on 1 January 2013 Pilar López and 
Alan Murray joined the Company as Non 
Executive Directors. Pilar is Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer of Telefónica Europe. Alan was 
Chief Executive of Hanson plc between 
2002 and 2007. Both Directors have joined 
the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees of the Board.
In July we announced that Andrew Duff, 
Wolseley’s Senior Independent Director, 
would be stepping down at the 2013 
Annual General Meeting after nine years 
of service with the Company. I would 
like to thank Andrew for his outstanding 
contribution to Wolseley and wish him 
the very best for the future. Andrew’s 
responsibilities as Remuneration 
Committee Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director have now been 
assumed by Alan Murray. We are fortunate 
to have a Non Executive Director of the 
calibre of Alan Murray to succeed Andrew.
Leadership and people
Looking to the future, as well as an 
experienced and diverse Board, we place 
a great deal of emphasis on the quality 
and diversity of our leadership teams 
across the Group. We have worked 
hard to put in place effective succession 
and development programmes and 
the excellent results we continue to 
achieve are a testament to this effort. 
Talent management continues to be 
a key area of focus for both the Board 
and myself, given my strong belief that 
the stability and effectiveness of our 
management teams across the Group 
is a key ingredient of our success.
Our strong results this year are of course a 
reﬂection of the quality of our people across 
the world from the senior management to 
our teams in the business units. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank all of my 
Wolseley colleagues for their continued 
contribution and commitment to our 
customers and our values.
In the longer term, we remain very 
positive about the opportunities to grow 
the business and we are well positioned 
to capitalise on the signiﬁcant structural 
growth potential in our markets.

Listening to our customers
I want great service every time I deal with you
Having the best people is key to 
giving our customers exceptional 
service every day. The UK is 
continuing to work hard to boost 
employee engagement levels. This is 
achieved through measuring staff 
engagement on a regular basis and 
making improvements to working 
environments and training to ensure 
our front line staff are engaged and 
deliver the best possible service to 
customers. In 2013, Wolseley UK’s 
average employee engagement score 
is now at the highest level since the 
survey started in 2005, despite a 
challenging trading environment. 
This score ranks in the top quartile 
of the Employee Engagement Index 
Benchmark according to Harris 
Interactive, one of the world’s largest 
market research ﬁrms who carry 
out the surveys for the UK business. 
Their engagement benchmark 
is compiled from more than 100 
organisations surveyed. I want a broad range of expertise that is always available
Facilities Maintenance (“FM”) 
is a large and attractive segment 
for our US business and has 
tremendous opportunities for 
growth. The addressable FM market 
is estimated at about £13 billion and is 
fragmented. Our strategy is to target 
purchasing and facility managers 
in a variety of sectors with a unique 
blend of call centre support and 
e-business solutions with a broad 
SKU range. The business operates 
a unique business model using call 
centres staffed with highly-trained 
experts who have knowledge of the 
major categories to suit the needs 
of FM customers including: heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning 
(“HVAC”); lighting; electrical; pipes, 
valves and ﬁttings (“PVF”); and 
plumbing. Customers are also able to 
order online, see up-to-date product 
availability and use web tools to 
automate frequent purchases and 
review their account information.

Chief Executive’s review
In summary
 Strong ﬁnancial results and cash 
generation.
 Further progress in reﬁning strategy 
and business models.
 France strategy being executed 
as set out at the half year.
 Several small in-ﬁll acquisitions 
completed in the year.
“The Group delivered a 
strong overall result 
against a backdrop of 
good market conditions 
in the USA, improving 
conditions in the UK and 
continued weak demand 
in Continental Europe.”
 Focus on performance 
and growth
The Group generated revenue of 
£12,854 million (2011/12: £12,345 million) 
4.1 per cent ahead of last year with like-for-
like growth of 2.9 per cent. Gross margin 
in the ongoing business improved to 27.8 
per cent (2011/12: 27.5 per cent) despite 
very competitive market conditions and 
underlying margins were 0.1 per cent 
ahead. Trading proﬁt of £725 million 
(2011/12: £655 million) was 10.7 per cent 
higher than last year. The trading margin 
was 30 basis points higher at 5.6 per cent. 
This year Ferguson achieved a record 
trading margin of 7.3 per cent in its 60th 
anniversary year since incorporation. 
We continue to see excellent opportunities 
to make incremental improvements to the 
business in the next few years as long as 
markets remain reasonable.
During the year we managed the balance 
sheet conservatively. Working capital 
was tightly controlled and capital 
expenditure increased to £140 million 
(2011/12: £135 million) as we funded 
organic expansion of the business. 
We continue to place a great deal 
of emphasis on driving strong cash 
generation. Operating cash ﬂow was strong 
at £633 million (2011/12: £747 million). 
Group strategy and  
business model
Our strategy remains unchanged. Our  
process of top down resource allocation 
to those businesses which have, or are 
capable of, market leadership will give 
us the best returns. In addition, through 
bottom-up detailed business unit strategies 
we will make sure we grow our best 
businesses faster than the competition. 
This parallel path of resource allocation 
and performance management is outlined 
in our value creation model. We operate 
in fragmented markets and the structural 
growth opportunity is signiﬁcant. Overview

Proﬁtable 
growth
“This year Ferguson 
achieved a record trading 
margin of 7.3 per cent 
in its 60th anniversary 
year since incorporation.”
We want to drive proﬁtable growth in each 
business unit and during the monthly 
performance reviews we review like-for-
like revenue growth, balancing this with 
a relentless focus on improving gross 
margins and keeping costs under control. 
Given the tough economic backdrop in 
some of our markets we are keeping a 
keen eye on operating costs, particularly 
where we have experienced volume 
declines. However, even where markets 
are growing and we are increasing our 
investment, we still want to ensure that 
we convert revenue growth strongly to 
trading proﬁt. 
During the year we have continued to 
reﬁne the portfolio to focus on attractive 
market positions where we believe we can 
win. At the half year results we announced 
the outcome of the strategic review of 
our activities in France. Our proposals 
included restructuring the Building 
Materials business and refocusing it as 
a regional player in the north of France 
where we have a decent scale position. 
This will be achieved through the sale of 
88 branches in the south to Chausson, a 
regional distributor. Following employee 
consultation and competition clearance in 
the summer we are now in the process of 
transferring those branches to Chausson. 
We have also agreed to collaborate in 
the future on product sourcing which will 
beneﬁt both businesses. We will retain the 
Wood Solutions business which whilst 
cyclical is proﬁtable and cash generative. 
Management responsibility was transferred 
to the Central Europe region in the year.
While organic growth remains a priority, 
we have continued to make selective in-ﬁll 
acquisitions to our existing businesses. 
These have been small in-ﬁlls so far in 
our existing geographies so we can 
integrate them rapidly into our strong 
businesses, extract the cost synergies and 
deliver attractive returns. In line with this 
approach we made six small acquisitions 
this year including: 22 Burdens branches 
in the UK, a leading utilities business; 
Power Equipment Direct, a Chicago 
based online distributor of outdoor power 
equipment; and Keramikland, a small 
Swiss sanitary business. In September 
2012, we completed the acquisition of 
Davis & Warshow, which is a leading 
plumbing distribution business in New 
York. The North East of the USA continues 
to be a signiﬁcant opportunity for regional 
expansion for the US business.
Over the past four years we have 
deleveraged the balance sheet and this 
has been achieved through a keen focus 
on cash generation. We want to maintain 
a strong balance sheet which will enable 
us to invest in both organic growth and 
in-ﬁll acquisitions while at the same time 
rewarding shareholders with an attractive 
and sustainable ordinary dividend through 
the economic cycle. Net debt at 31 July 
2013 was £411 million (31 July 2012: 
net cash of £45 million) after payment 
of the special dividend of £348 million 
on 31 December 2012. 
Reﬁning our strategy – driving 
towards a systematically 
managed branch network 
Now that we have a strong set of business 
units to invest in and build, we are 
continuing to evolve our business unit 
strategies and in doing so we are reviewing 
the business models employed by each. 
Here, our objective is always to have the 
lowest cost platform in the industry, to drive 
continuous improvement by better process 
management and to make sure that we are 
executing our processes at the right point 
in the organisation. Some processes we 
will leave very local, whilst others we will 
execute above the branch network to give 
us beneﬁts of scale. 
We are now identifying and using the best 
core processes in our most successful 
business units to derive further beneﬁts 
from a more systematic approach. Over the 
medium term this will mean gradually 
moving away from a model where all 
processes and decisions are based in 
the branch. For example, in Stockholm,  Wolseley plc

Chief Executive’s review continued
Our values
We act with 
integrity
We drive for 
results and 
improvement
We value our 
people
We conduct all our 
activities with fairness, 
honesty and integrity.
We listen and respond 
to the needs of our 
customers, then exceed 
their expectations; we are 
not happy with the status 
quo, and constantly strive 
to improve.
We understand, respect 
and value personal and 
cultural differences;  
we are open and honest 
in all our dealings with 
our people.
“Over time and as 
new technology becomes 
more freely available 
our customers are 
increasingly choosing 
how they interact 
with us.”
Sweden, this year we relocated outbound 
logistics for eight branches that would 
normally be run independently, into a 
single hub for the region. This has given 
us productivity beneﬁts by avoiding cost 
duplication, and has freed up the branches 
to concentrate on customer service. 
We are able to offer customers later 
ordering and earlier delivery times which 
they hugely value.
The evolution from a loose confederation 
to a systematically managed network will 
have a signiﬁcant impact on the ﬂexibility of 
decision-making in our branches. We will 
need to achieve greater compliance with 
our core processes in areas such as pricing 
discounts, identifying and maintaining 
core product ranges and supply chain 
programmes. We will have to achieve better 
efﬁciency from our vendor programmes 
to ensure we do get the best terms and 
there will be increased use of centralised 
sourcing processes and private label in 
speciﬁc categories. There will be more 
delivery from distribution centres, avoiding 
cost duplication. We will move to labour 
models that reﬂect the customers’ needs 
by the month, week, day and even by the 
hour rather than a set “9 to 5” plus overtime 
structure. Overall, people will transition 
from being generalists to masters of a few 
key specialist skills and this will require us 
to be more functionally skilled, for example, 
in supply chain, marketing and 24/7 IT 
support and recovery.
We will also utilise Group business models 
where they can be replicated in other 
geographies. For example, during the year 
we have taken our successful Build.com 
business to consumer (“B2C”) e-commerce 
business and, using the same business 
model approach and a common IT 
platform, launched new businesses in the 
UK and Canada. Over time, and as new 
technology such as mobile e-commerce 
becomes more freely available, our 
customers are increasingly choosing 
how they interact with us.  Overview
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 15
“The overall scores 
for both service and 
employee engagement 
have continued to 
improve across all 
our businesses.”
We are also building market leading 
transactional B2B e-commerce sites 
for the major geographies as we know 
customers value doing business with us 
this way. Customers don’t always want to 
make purchases face-to-face in a branch, 
particularly for everyday items, and we 
need to give them greater ﬂexibility and 
choice over how they do business with 
us. In the USA, B2B e-commerce now 
represents about 9 per cent of revenue 
and we expect this to grow signiﬁcantly 
over the next few years. This year we have 
achieved over 6.5 million self-service events 
where B2B customers have completed 
an activity online rather than directly in a 
branch or on the phone.
We are making progress in improving 
customer service and employee 
engagement in our businesses which 
we have been regularly measuring for 
several years now. The overall scores for 
both service and employee engagement 
have continued to improve across all our 
businesses. We know that at the heart 
of our business, great people are working 
very hard to provide great service to our 
customers. This allows us to generate a 
margin and ultimately a decent proﬁt and 
good returns on capital, but it is our people 
who absolutely drive this performance from 
every one of our 2,917 branches across 
the world.
We have some real strengths and the 
work we have undertaken shows us that 
we deliver excellent service in many of our 
branches. However, it also shows us areas 
of improvement down to speciﬁc branches 
and customers, which we can act upon. 
The feedback has also reinforced that 
“price” as a choice factor continues to rank 
relatively low on many customers’ priorities 
behind product availability, staff knowledge, 
next day delivery and breadth of the 
product range – showing that customers 
recognise the value of these beneﬁts and 
are willing to pay for them. This gives us 
great conﬁdence that as we continue to 
improve service we can also incrementally 
improve gross margins.
So, in summary, in making this major 
transition for Wolseley the overriding factor 
has been to ensure that the evolution of our 
business is always in service of customer 
needs. The theme of this year’s annual 
report is “listening to our customers” 
and you can see several examples of the 
innovations we are bringing to the business 
in support of this. These are outlined in the 
operating reviews on pages 26 to 37.
Corporate Responsibility
We see Corporate Responsibility as a 
reﬂection of how we want to do business 
at Wolseley. I am pleased to report excellent 
progress on a number of fronts this year 
including higher employee engagement 
scores, better controls in the management 
of our ethics programme and reductions 
in our carbon emissions and waste. 
More remains to be done and it was 
disappointing to report an increase in 
the Group’s injury and lost workday rate. 
We have set a clear path to improve our 
performance in this and other areas which 
you can read about in the Corporate 
Responsibility report on pages 48 to 63.
Our people
Finally, on behalf of the Executive team, 
I would like to thank all of my Wolseley 
colleagues for their continued contribution 
and commitment to our customers. It is 
their energy, enthusiasm, commitment and 
dedication to providing great service that 
makes Wolseley such a great company 
to work for.

Listening to our customers
I want to spend more time helping my customers
Stockholm is the largest 
metropolitan market in Sweden. 
Our Swedish building materials 
business, Beijer, is the market 
leader and has a strong presence 
in Stockholm operating from eight 
branches across the city. Instead of 
putting more capacity in branches that 
would normally be run independently, 
we recently centralised the outbound 
logistics for the Stockholm region 
into a single hub. Now all deliveries 
for Stockholm are dealt with centrally 
which gives the customer more 
ﬂexibility on delivery times and also 
efﬁciency savings for the business, with 
better capacity planning for deliveries 
across the city. Most importantly it has 
freed up time in the branches for staff 
to focus on serving customers and 
growing the business. Overview

I don’t have time to chase paper
Electronic proof of delivery 
(“ePOD”) was deployed this 
year in the USA and is providing 
a more efﬁcient approach to 
managing customer deliveries 
than traditional manual methods. 
The new system allows our drivers 
to capture electronic signatures on 
outbound deliveries at the job site at 
the time of delivery. With just a few key 
strokes, a POD can now be printed, 
faxed or emailed to a customer as 
and when required. Previously the 
manual process was much slower for 
the customer and time consuming for 
associates. Customers can now be 
set up to receive ePOD 100 per cent 
of the time, or they can access ePOD 
themselves online. The end result 
is providing a new level of customer 
service and efﬁciency savings at the 
same time. Wolseley plc

business. They respond to the question 
“how satisﬁed are you that Ferguson 
is a good company to work for?”
The survey methodology is similar 
to Net Promoter Score above.

Deﬁnition
The Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) is a 
survey-based means of measuring 
customer satisfaction. The survey is based 
on a single question “how likely is it that 
you would recommend Wolseley to a 
friend or colleague?” Customers respond 
on a 0-to-10 point rating scale and are 
categorised as follows:
Promoters (score 9-10) are loyal 
enthusiasts who will keep buying 
and refer others, fuelling growth.
Passives (score 7-8) are satisﬁed but 
unenthusiastic customers who are 
vulnerable to competitive offerings.
Detractors (score 0-6) are unhappy 
customers who can damage your brand 
and impede growth through negative 
word-of-mouth.
To calculate NPS, the percentage of 
customers who are Detractors are 
subtracted from the percentage who 
are Promoters. This year an average 
measure has been used to better reﬂect 
performance throughout the year. 
Performance
Processes for tracking and reporting of 
customer service KPIs differ by geography 
and by business unit. An example is 
given for the USA, the largest region in 
the Group, where the net promoter score 
has improved through the year.

Supply chain
There are numerous supply chain initiatives around the Group. Some are monitored by 
ﬁnancial measures, such as annualised savings in transportation costs, and others by 
non-ﬁnancial measures such as inventory turns and, for the Group’s distribution centres, 
the ﬁll rate achieved. This is the proportion of orders that can be fulﬁlled from inventory 
on hand at the time of the order.
Deﬁnition
Total working days lost to work related 
injuries per 100 employees. The number 
of days lost is the total number of calendar 
days that the injured person was out of the 
workplace (but only including the days that 
the injured person was scheduled to work) 
irrespective of the number of hours that 
would normally have been worked each 
day. The injury and lost workday rates are 
now calculated using “full-time equivalent” 
(“FTE”) employee numbers instead of 
total headcount. The reported rates for 
2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12 have 
been restated also using FTE numbers. 
This ensures that injury and lost workday 
rates are not understated as part-time 
hours are taken into consideration.
Performance
Workdays lost per 100 employees 
deteriorated by 2 per cent in the year. 
We are disappointed to report an increase 
in the injury and lost workday rate. 
The underlying causes of some of these 
trends are understood and are being 
addressed. We are targeting a reduction 
in injury and lost workday rates next year 
(see page 53 for further information).

Whether you’re an installer, 
contractor or site manager, the 
UK business understands that 
time is money. They don’t like letting 
customers down, so have developed 
On Time In Full (“OTIF”) measurements 
against customer orders to enable both 
the business and our customers to 
measure performance. Delivery dates 
are mutually agreed, with the promise 
of OTIF each time, every time, with 
updates provided to customers on the 
occasions when this is not possible. 
Pipe and Climate Center launched the 
OTIF measurement in 2011 and today 
consistently delivers very high levels 
of orders on time in full month-on- 
month. Our other UK businesses have 
also introduced their own initiatives 
to make life easier for customers; 
from Plumb Center’s availability key 
in its trade price guide (which shows 
guaranteed availability on over 20,000 
product lines), to Integrated Services’ 
industry-leading web-based system, 
which provides each customer the 
information they need about their 
order at a click of a button. Wolseley plc

Business and 
management structure
The Group’s business falls into six 
geographic regions – the United States, 
Canada, United Kingdom, the Nordic 
region, France and Central Europe.
Within each geography the Group operates 
a number of distinct business units with 
strong trading identities, including many 
with market leading positions in their 
local markets.
The Group has strong management teams 
in each region. Business units report on 
operational performance and strategic 
progress through regular performance 
review meetings with senior executives.
The business model offers opportunities 
for synergies to be achieved by being part 
of the Group. These include:
 management synergies such as sharing 
best practice, management development 
and corporate ﬁnance; and
 operating synergies in the areas of joint 
sourcing, private label development and 
the sharing of costs and infrastructure.
Business unit strategies
Business unit strategies are aligned with 
our value creation model as outlined on 
page 13. Each business unit aims to grow 
market share faster than the competition 
through gaining a greater share of its 
existing customers’ business and through 
attracting new customers. 
To achieve this each business unit 
focuses on:
 best customer service;
 best branch employees; and
 preferred vendor relationships.
Underlying this, Wolseley aims to operate 
the most efﬁcient operating model in the 
industry, ensuring its distribution activities 
beneﬁt from national scale and an efﬁcient 
supply chain.
The business units drive operational value 
through gaining market share, improving 
productivity, expanding gross margins 
and improving returns and cash.
In order to give customers greater choice 
we are developing new business models 
including e-commerce platforms in 
most geographies.
Market overview
The markets for plumbing and heating and 
building materials are directly exposed 
to macroeconomic cycles. The Group 
delivered improved overall ﬁnancial results 
against a backdrop of weak demand in 
Continental Europe and improved market 
conditions in the USA. Further detail by 
geography is provided in the regional 
performance reviews on pages 26 to 37.
Although our markets are cyclical, 
the business model is strong and it is 
underpinned by demographic trends 
towards ageing populations, small 
households and by the ageing of 
housing stocks.
We supply customers in the new; repair, 
maintenance and improvement; and civil 
infrastructure sectors. The exposure to 
each market differs by geography and by 
business unit and is outlined on pages 4 
and 5.
Market trends
The Group’s results depend on levels 
of activity in the new construction and 
property repair and remodelling markets. 
The major factors which inﬂuence demand 
therefore include:
 the rate of gross domestic product 
(“GDP”) growth;
 consumer conﬁdence;
 the availability of credit to ﬁnance 
consumer investment;
 mortgage and other interest rates;
 government initiatives to stimulate 
economic activity; 
 inﬂation; and 
 unemployment.
To better aid understanding of how these 
macroeconomic trends directly affected 
demand in the major countries in which the 
Group operates, quarterly GDP data has 
been set out in the regional performance 
reviews on pages 26 to 37. In addition, 
where the Group operates building materials 
businesses, principally in the Nordic region 
and France, construction indicators have 
also been shown. This is because activity 
levels in building materials businesses 
correlate more directly to construction 
activity levels than in plumbing and heating 
which are more directly exposed to repairs, 
maintenance and remodelling markets. Overview

Product integrity
The Group is committed to responsible 
sourcing and has a range of policies and 
procedures in place related to product 
safety and ethical sourcing practices. 
Our Group-wide product integrity 
policy and the associated business unit 
procedures are starting to improve the 
way that we procure products of the right 
quality from vendors that adhere to our 
expected standards. Product integrity 
is a core element of our Corporate 
Responsibility programme and further 
detail is provided on page 60.
Source
We source a wide range 
of products efﬁciently and 
responsibly, bringing together 
the range of products from 
different vendors that our 
customers need.
What differentiates Wolseley
 Around 70,000 trade vendors supplying 
a broad mix of products including private 
label ranges.
 Leading national market positions drive 
scale advantages in sourcing – a key 
competitive advantage.
 Targeted international sourcing drives 
scale advantages in areas such as 
private label.
Vendor relationships
Our vendors need distributors who can give 
them access to many smaller customers 
cost effectively. Our relationships with these 
vendors are key to our success; we want 
to build strong relationships and grow our 
business with them.
Key vendors are manufacturers with 
market leading brands, usually focused 
on the needs of local markets. We work 
in partnership with our key vendors to 
offer market breadth and penetration 
and to collaborate on promotions and 
incentive programmes. We aim to derive 
beneﬁt from national scale. Whilst the 
vendor base is predominantly based on 
national geographies, some international 
sourcing beneﬁts exist, for example across 
Europe and for the sourcing of private 
label products. Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 24
Distribute
We distribute products 
efﬁciently to our branches 
and customers, allowing us 
to provide great product 
availability levels for 
our customers.
What differentiates Wolseley
 Branch network of 2,917 branches.
 Large scale network of distribution 
centres supporting the plumbing and 
heating businesses.
 High levels of product availability across 
a broad range of stock keeping units 
(“SKUs”).
Distribution network
Distribution centres are a key competitive 
advantage for Wolseley, allowing the 
Group to purchase in bulk and better serve 
customers through reduced delivery times, 
broader product selection, increased 
ﬁll-rates and improved product availability, 
as well as enabling the Group to better 
manage inventory.
The Group has an extensive network of 
distribution centres which serve branches 
for our plumbing and heating businesses. 
By contrast, the majority of products in our 
building materials businesses are delivered 
directly to our branches or customers.
Our objective is to operate the lowest 
cost, most efﬁcient operating model in 
our industry, ensuring that our distribution 
activities beneﬁt from national scale and 
an efﬁcient supply chain. The Group 
has invested signiﬁcantly in supply chain 
technology to manage inventory in our 
distribution centres and branches in order 
to maximise efﬁciency.
An example of how a pilot project in 
Stockholm is leading to a more efﬁcient 
supply chain in the city is outlined on 
page 16.
Product availability
The availability of a wide range of products 
to our customers is fundamental to the 
Wolseley business model. Our distribution 
network is key to allowing us to 
outperform the competition in this area. 
Each distribution centre aims to maximise 
the ﬁll-rate that it achieves, which is the 
proportion of orders that can be fulﬁlled 
from inventory on hand at the time of the 
order. The distribution centres operate 
with ﬁll-rates that are substantially better 
than those we receive from our vendors, 
bridging the gap between vendor ﬁll-rates 
and those to our branches. An example 
from the UK of how On Time In Full 
measurements against customer orders 
is driving improved customer service is 
outlined on page 21.
At a branch level, product ranges are 
focused on the fastest moving products, 
with the distribution centres able to quickly 
deliver a wide range of other products 
as required. A number of our businesses 
offer service guarantees and next day 
delivery options.
“Our objective is to 
operate the lowest cost, 
most efﬁcient operating 
model in our industry.”
Branches
With 2,917 branches across 11 countries, 
Wolseley is an international business but 
also a local business, with the majority 
of the Group’s customers travelling less 
than 20 miles to a branch. We rely on 
the strength of our brands in their local 
markets, and the local knowledge of 
our employees in the branches to meet 
our customers’ needs.
Transport
The Group uses a range of transport 
solutions in each of its businesses including 
its own extensive ﬂeet and third party 
delivery services. The Group uses ﬂeet 
management systems and backhauling 
arrangements to maximise the efﬁciency 
of its transport network and minimise its 
environmental impact. The Group is also 
piloting more centralised approaches to 
logistics to improve efﬁciency. An example 
of this is outlined on page 16, which 
relates to the Beijer business in Sweden. 
Further detail on the environmental impact 
of our transport requirements and actions 
taken to minimise CO2 emissions is given 
in the Corporate Responsibility report 
on pages 48 to 63.

Sell
We sell through a variety of 
channels including branches, 
call centres and online, with 
a strong focus on providing 
excellent customer service.
What differentiates Wolseley
 Continued focus on customer 
service measured through regular 
customer surveys.
 Investment in employee training 
programmes and tools to allow our 
branch employees to deliver the best 
customer service.
 Investment in online sales channels 
to drive organic growth.
Channels
Sales to customers are made over the 
counter at our branches, through supply 
contracts which are managed centrally, 
or through orders that can be placed 
with branches, into call centres, or via the 
internet. In some regions we also operate 
a network of showrooms which enables 
us to showcase our product range.
“E-commerce is a rapidly 
growing sales channel 
for the Group and we 
continue to invest in 
B2B and B2C websites.”
E-commerce is a rapidly growing sales 
channel for the Group and we continue to 
invest in B2B and B2C websites and mobile 
applications across the Group. An example 
relating to our Swiss e-commerce business 
is outlined on page 2. Our B2C offering 
now includes websites in the USA, Canada 
and the UK.
Customers
The Group has a wide range of customers 
operating in different industry sectors, 
ranging from individual plumbers and 
builders through to national contractor 
chains and house builders. Wolseley’s 
primary customer focus is on professional 
contractors, who constituted 88 per cent of 
the Group’s customer base during the year 
ended 31 July 2013. The Group has around 
1 million customers globally and no single 
customer represented greater than 1 per 
cent of Group revenue in 2012/13.

Customer service
Wolseley is a relationship business and 
our focus is to meet our customers’ needs 
better than the competition, ensuring we 
deliver the right products, at the right price, 
at the right time, on every occasion they do 
business with us. We use regular customer 
surveys in all of our business units so 
that we can take actions to improve our 
performance, both nationally and within 
each branch operation. See pages 18 and 
19 to read more about how we measure 
customer service.
Branch employees
In order to achieve the best customer 
service in the industry we need to have the 
right talent with relevant training, skills and 
knowledge in our locations. Within each of 
the business units there is a strong focus 
on ensuring that training programmes and 
tools are available for our people so that 
they are equipped to give the best service 
in the industry. Employee engagement is 
measured in each business unit at least 
annually and the results are used to make 
improvements in working practices and 
environments. An example which relates 
to how we measure employee engagement 
in the UK is outlined on page 10.

Regional performance: USA
Business unit portfolio 
and proﬁle
In the USA we operate six business units. 
Ferguson is the primary operating brand 
although a number of other brands have 
been retained to service speciﬁc markets. 
The business operates in all 50 states and 
is served by 11 distribution centres across 
the country that provide next day product 
availability, a key competitive advantage. 
Small in-ﬁll acquisitions have been made 
to strengthen positions in existing markets 
and to enter areas where the business 
has historically been under-represented. 
Ferguson predominantly serves the RMI 
markets and has relatively low exposure 
to the residential new construction market.
The Ferguson Blended Branches business 
sells to customers across the residential, 
commercial and industrial sectors for new 
construction and RMI projects through its 
national branch network. In smaller markets 
that may not justify a stand alone presence 
for heating, ventilation and air conditioning 
(“HVAC”) and waterworks, a blended 
location can also provide the products 
and services for these customers.
The Waterworks business distributes 
pipes, valves, hydrants, ﬁttings and 
meters to residential, commercial and 
municipal contractors. The business is 
diversifying its customer base into private 
water companies and treatment plants, 
and expanding its product range into new 
areas such as metering technologies.
The HVAC business distributes 
heating, ventilation, air conditioning 
and refrigeration equipment to specialist 
contractors, predominantly in the 
residential and commercial sectors. 
Branded dealerships of high quality 
equipment are an important feature of 
this market. Most revenue is generated 
by providing equipment and parts for 
the repair and replacement market.

are estimated as follows:
Market position
Blended Branches 1
Waterworks 2
Industrial 3
HVAC 4
Ferguson has no direct competitor that 
operates across all its markets, and each 
business unit has its own competitors. 
These range from large national players, 
including professional sales from the 
national home improvement chains, to 
single branch operations. 
The market remains fragmented with 
a large number of small and regional 
distributors making up the majority of 
the market.
Overall, Ferguson has continued to gain 
market share in the year, growing sales 
signiﬁcantly ahead of the market.

*GDP growth shown is the movement of the quarter 
compared to the same quarter of the previous 
calendar year.
Quarterly GDP growth in the USA has 
remained steady throughout 2012/13 which 
drove a continued recovery in levels of new 
construction and a resilient RMI segment. 
Operating performance
Revenue in the USA was 8.2 per cent 
ahead of last year on a like-for-like basis 
including price inﬂation of approximately 
1 per cent. The RMI segment remained 
resilient and the recovery in levels of 
new residential construction continued. 
The major business units of Blended 
Branches and Waterworks gained market 
share in the period.
Blended Branches continued to grow 
strongly across the country, underpinned 
by good RMI markets. The Waterworks and 
HVAC businesses grew strongly though 
Industrial was slightly lower overall due to 
low demand for shale gas piping products, 
although Pipes, Valves and Fittings (“PVF”) 
grew well. Build.com continued to grow 
strongly and generated good returns.
Gross margins improved across most 
business units. Operating expenses 
were 9 per cent higher in constant 
currency, and this included £26 million 
growth from acquisitions, £9 million 
of increased healthcare costs, and 
£11 million of additional investment in 
B2C marketing. The UK B2C business is 
managed from the USA and the prior year 
results have been restated to reﬂect this. 
Favourable exchange rate movements 
contributed £4 million to trading proﬁt 
which was 26.8 per cent ahead at 
£492 million (2011/12: £388 million).
Acquisitions completed in the year 
accounted for 2.1 per cent of revenue 
growth in the region. These included 
Davis & Warshow, a Blended Branches 
business in New York, Power Equipment 
Direct, a Chicago based online distributor 
of power equipment and Fluid Systems Inc, 
a Hawaii based distributor of below ground 
drainage products. We opened 54 new 
branches, principally in the Waterworks and 
Industrial businesses. Headcount growth 
of 3.9 per cent was well controlled with 
nearly half of all headcount growth coming 
from acquisitions.
The USA trading margin was 7.3 per cent 
(2011/12: 6.3 per cent) which was ahead 
of the previous peak achieved in 2007.
Gain market share
“The major business units 
of Blended Branches, 
Waterworks and heating, 
ventilation and air 
conditioning (“HVAC”) 
gained market share 
in the period.”
The Industrial business distributes pipes, 
valves and ﬁttings, including specialty 
high-density polyethylene pipes, to 
industrial customers across all sectors 
including oil and gas, mining and power 
generation. It is a project driven business 
that has historically performed strongly 
over the economic cycle. The Industrial 
business also offers maintenance, 
repair and operations services (“MRO”) 
and off-site integrated supply with 
centralised procurement, storeroom 
and commodity management.
Our Fire and Fabrication business unit 
supplies ﬁre protection systems to 
commercial contractors.
Our B2C business supplies to consumers 
via websites using the product range 
and distribution network of the Blended 
Branches business. This is a particularly 
fast growing area of the US business. Wolseley plc

*GDP growth shown is the movement of the quarter 
compared to the same quarter of the previous 
calendar year.
Quarterly GDP growth in Canada was 
subdued in 2012/13 at just above 1 per 
cent throughout the ﬁnancial year with 
the growth rate falling in the ﬁrst half as 
new residential construction volumes 
fell. Industrial infrastructure investment 
remained strong driven by high activity 
levels in the oil, gas and natural resources 
extraction industries. 
Operating performance
In Canada revenue was 2.0 per cent 
ahead on a like-for-like basis including 
price inﬂation of approximately 1 per cent. 
New residential markets dipped although 
infrastructure spending continued to 
grow. Overall, we held market share in 
the Blended Branches and Industrial 
businesses, making gains in the 
second half.
Blended Branches grew modestly and 
improved proﬁtability. Industrial continued 
to grow strongly. Waterworks traded slightly 
lower against very strong comparators.
Gross margins were ahead of last year and 
operating expense growth was restricted 
to 3 per cent in constant currency with 
net staff numbers reduced by 96 to 2,511. 
Trading proﬁt of £51 million edged ahead of 
last year by £2 million. The trading margin 
was 5.8 per cent (2011/12: 5.8 per cent).

Regional performance: UK (ongoing)
Business unit portfolio 
and proﬁle
The UK is focused on its core, strong 
businesses with market leading 
positions in plumbing and heating 
and adjacent businesses.
The majority of the UK’s revenue is 
generated from the RMI market, with 
the public sector accounting for around 
35 per cent of revenue.
Plumbing and Heating includes Plumb 
and Parts Center which is a leading 
distributor of plumbing and heating 
products. The business operates 
through a national branch network and 
can deliver superior ﬁll-rates and a wide 
range of products through its distribution 
centres. The business also supplies a 
wide range of spares and replacements. 
Efﬁciencies arise from purchasing volumes, 
from opportunities to cross-sell and from 
shared sites. The business has delivered 
a strong ﬁnancial performance in a tough 
trading environment and continues to look 
for opportunities to improve customer 
service and grow revenue.
Pipe and Climate Center distribute 
pipes, valves, ﬁttings, air conditioning 
and refrigeration products. The business 
has a sound track record of proﬁtability, 
and volumes are driven by non-residential 
new build projects.
The Burdens branches acquired in the 
year operate in the utilities sector and have 
helped to gain a market leading position 
in the below ground drainage sector.
Burdens will be the new “below ground 
drainage” brand of Wolseley UK and 
21 Drain Center branches are being 
rebranded. The remaining Drain Center 
branches will focus on “above ground 
drainage”, which is part of the Plumbing 
and Heating segment.
Integrated Services offers outsourced 
inventory management and procurement 
services for maintenance activities on a 
long-term contract basis, mainly to public 
institutions such as housing associations.

*GDP growth shown is the movement of the quarter 
compared to the same quarter of the previous

Quarterly GDP was broadly ﬂat during 
2012/13 although improved slightly towards 
the end of the year largely helped by a

and manufacturing sectors. Ongoing cuts 
in consumer spending and poor consumer 
conﬁdence continued to impede growth.

for-like basis. New residential construction 
and RMI markets improved in the second 
half. There was no signiﬁcant price inﬂation 
during the year.
Plumb and Parts Center increased market 
share as did Pipe and Climate Center 
though growth was held back by weaker 
industrial markets. Gross margins were 
down on last year due to the dilutive impact 
of the Burdens acquisition in January and 
a challenging pricing environment.
Operating expenses were 2 per cent 
lower when excluding the impact of 
the Burdens acquisition and 2 per cent 
higher on an ongoing basis. Headcount in 
the ongoing business increased by 52. 
Trading proﬁt for the ongoing business 
of £95 million was £2 million ahead 
of last year, principally due to one-off 
property gains.
The trading margin was 5.7 per cent 
excluding the impact of the Burdens 
acquisition and on an ongoing basis was 
5.4 per cent (2011/12: 5.6 per cent).

Business unit portfolio 
and proﬁle
Wolseley’s Nordic business operates in 
Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway.
Stark is the leading distributor of heavy 
building materials, tools, hardware, timber 
and panels in Denmark. Stark’s customers 
include both professional contractors and 
DIY builders with around half of stores 
having a dedicated DIY section. Stark’s 
market leadership and its efﬁciencies 
of scale have historically delivered 
strong results.
Beijer is the leading distributor of building 
materials in Sweden, serving local building 
contractors and retail consumers. As the 
Swedish market is very fragmented, 
Beijer’s reach is valuable to vendors, and 
by maintaining efﬁciencies of scale and 
working capital management it delivers 
strong trading results.
Starkki is a Finnish chain of builders’ 
merchants with a format based on large 
stores and well-trained specialist staff. 
The business serves both local building 
contractors and consumers and small 
retail stores. Starkki has a strong record of 
excellent proﬁtability based on a very low 
cost base.
Silvan is a DIY and retail chain in Denmark, 
focused on serving customers with building 
materials for the RMI market. The majority 
of Silvan’s product range overlaps with 
other businesses in the Nordic region and 
therefore the business delivers signiﬁcant 
synergies by taking advantage of these 
economies of scale.
Smaller business units in the region include 
Neumann Bygg, a distributor of building 
materials in Norway, and Cheapy, a DIY 
chain in Sweden.

The Stark and Beijer brands are market

respectively, with Silvan the number

the second largest builders’ merchant 
in Finland.
Each country in the Nordic region is a 
distinct market with its own national, 
regional and local competition. However, 
there are several major competitors 
operating across the region in the building 
materials and DIY markets. The markets 
in the Nordics tend to be fragmented 
and there are signiﬁcant opportunities to 
consolidate our market positions across 
the region.

 **Denmark, seasonally adjusted housing starts. 
Denmark is the largest segment in the 
Nordics and generated 45 per cent of 
overall revenue in 2012/13. Quarterly GDP 
trends in 2012/13 remained very subdued 
in Denmark throughout the year. 
Construction indicators have remained 
depressed seeing the lowest level of 
housing activity since records began 
in 1949.
Operating performance
Construction markets and consumer 
sentiment remained very weak across 
the Nordics. Like-for-like revenue declined 
5.7 per cent in the year, including 1 per cent 
price inﬂation. The major business units 
maintained their market leading positions.
Gross margins were ahead of last year 
despite the very challenging market 
conditions and strong competition. 
During the year operating expenses were 
tightly controlled and decreased by 4 per 
cent in constant currency, with headcount 
reduced by 131 to 6,145. Trading proﬁt for 
the ongoing business declined by £7 million 
to £86 million. The trading margin for the 
ongoing businesses was 4.5 per cent 
(2011/12: 4.6 per cent).

Business unit portfolio  
and proﬁle
During the year a strategic review of 
the Group’s business in France was 
conducted. In March we announced that 
Wolseley France is being reorganised into 
a single building materials distribution 
business. Management responsibility 
for the France Wood Solutions business 
was transferred to Central Europe in 
the second half.
The building materials business comprises 
Réseau Pro, the number two integrated 
distributor in France, selling building 
materials, rooﬁng, insulation, timber 
and ﬂooring, and Panofrance, focused 
on timber, panels and interior design. 
Along with the disposal of 109 branches, 
Wolseley France has entered into a joint 
sourcing arrangement with Chausson 
which is expected to improve efﬁciency.

France is estimated as follows:

In addition to a number of large national

there are also a number of buying groups 
that operate in France, accounting for a 
large proportion of the market.

 ** France, 12 month rolling housing starts. 
Quarterly GDP declined in France 
throughout 2012/13 with record 
unemployment, and low business 
and consumer conﬁdence. 
Construction markets weakened 
throughout the year with new residential 
housing starts in July 2013 down 16 per 
cent from the prior year.
Operating performance
Results in France exclude 109 branches 
held for sale, though they still include 
14 branches which we plan to close. 
Revenue declined by 9.1 per cent on a 
like-for-like basis, with no price inﬂation. 
New construction markets remained very 
weak throughout the year.
Gross margins were lower principally as a 
result of lower rebates. Operating expenses 
were well controlled and were 10 per cent 
lower in constant currency, with headcount 
signiﬁcantly reduced by 311. Trading proﬁt 
for the ongoing business was £10 million 
(2011/12: £17 million) including a £6 million 
lower depreciation charge relating to assets 
impaired in the period and a £2 million tax 
credit in respect of a refund of payroll tax 
under new French legislation.
The strategy we announced in March is 
progressing as planned and is expected to 
be completed in early 2014. The business 
will comprise of 144 branches which in 
the year ended 31 July 2013 generated 
revenue of £598 million and trading proﬁt 
of £12 million. The trading margin in the 
ongoing businesses in France was 1.6 per 
cent (2011/12: 2.4 per cent). We expect the 
ongoing business to make a small loss in 
the year ending 31 July 2014.

Wolseley operates in four countries in the 
region: Switzerland, Austria, Netherlands 
and France Wood Solutions.
In Switzerland, Tobler is the leading 
distributor of heating and plumbing 
products. It operates a national distribution 
centre and has invested signiﬁcantly 
in e-commerce, giving it the ability to 
generate a signiﬁcant proportion of its 
sales online.
The Austrian business, ÖAG, sells 
plumbing, heating and sanitary products 
as well as pipes and valves to industrial 
and municipal customers.
In the Netherlands, Wasco is a distributor 
of heating, plumbing and ventilation 
equipment, particularly boilers and spares. 
Its customers include large regional and 
national contractors.
The wood solutions business, transferred 
from the France region, includes 
Silverwood, the market leader in 
specialist sawn and processed woods, 
and a structural wood business which 
manufactures trusses and other carpentry 
systems. Previous years’ numbers have 
been restated to include the wood 
solutions business.

*GDP growth shown is the movement of the quarter 
compared to the same quarter of the previous year.
Switzerland is the largest segment in 
Central Europe and generated 29 per 
cent of overall revenue in 2012/13. 
Quarterly GDP growth remained subdued 
in Switzerland throughout 2012/13. 
While the economy has remained relatively 
more robust than much of Continental 
Europe, the strong Swiss Franc has led to 
lower exports which has restricted growth.
Operating performance
In Central Europe like-for-like revenue 
declined by 2.5 per cent with no signiﬁcant 
price inﬂation. Switzerland and Netherlands 
grew modestly while revenue in Austria and 
the wood solutions business was lower. 
In Switzerland, volume growth was partly 
offset by price deﬂation as a result of the 
appreciation of the Swiss Franc.
Central Europe gross margins were slightly 
lower than last year though operating costs 
were tightly controlled, 4 per cent lower in 
constant currency with headcount reduced 
by 151 to 2,736. In June we acquired 
Keramikland, a small sanitary business with 
two showrooms, to expand our product 
offering in sanitaryware in Switzerland.
Trading proﬁt in the ongoing businesses  
was £33 million (2011/12: £43 million).  
The trading margin in the ongoing 
businesses was 3.8 per cent

“We generated a gross 
margin of 27.8 per cent, 
which is 0.3 per cent 
ahead of last year.”
The results of the Group reﬂect widely 
different economic conditions across the 
countries we trade in with good growth in 
the USA, modest growth in the UK and 
Canada and sharp declines in Continental 
Europe. Overall like-for-like growth in 
the ongoing business was 2.9 per cent 
including valuable market share gains in 
key markets such as the USA and the UK.
Maintaining and improving gross margins 
is a key objective for our teams and we 
generated a gross margin of 27.8 per cent, 
which is 0.3 per cent ahead of last year.
In all of our businesses we stayed 
sharply focused on operating expenses, 
particularly where proﬁtability was 
under pressure due to weak demand.  Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 39
Performance
Whilst operating expenses overall were 4.1 per cent higher than 
last year, on a like-for-like basis, operating expenses were lower 
than last year in all regions outside of the USA.
Trading proﬁt growth was 10.7 per cent and the trading margin 
grew by 0.3 per cent to 5.6 per cent.
There were two fewer trading days in the year which reduced 
trading proﬁt by approximately £10 million and favourable 
exchange movements increased trading proﬁt by £5 million.
Disposals
Revenue of £300 million and £nil trading proﬁt arose from 
businesses which have been disposed of or are held for sale at 
31 July 2013. An agreement to dispose of 88 branches of the 
Réseau Pro Building Materials business in the south of France 
is expected to complete by early 2014. 
Exceptional items
Market conditions within Europe remained challenging throughout 
the year. In order to prepare for future years we took some tough 
actions to address under-performing operations and to reduce 
our cost base. These actions gave rise to signiﬁcant restructuring 
costs and impairment charges of £164 million which have been 
reported as exceptional items.

£51 million of exceptional items arose from severance costs and 
property provisions. £68 million related to asset write-downs 
and gains and losses on disposal and £45 million arose from 
other items.
Amortisation and impairment 
of acquired intangibles
Normal amortisation charges amounted to £55 million 
(2011/12: £60 million). The Group has reviewed the carrying value 
of goodwill and other intangible assets and concluded that an 
impairment charge of £10 million is appropriate in relation to 
goodwill in the Netherlands, where trading conditions deteriorated 
in the year.
£457 million (37 per cent) of the Group’s goodwill and intangible 
assets relate to our businesses in the Nordic region and an 
impairment charge of £220 million was incurred last year. 
Whilst economic conditions throughout the region remained 
challenging, the goodwill and intangible asset balances are 
sustainable based on current projections. If markets continue 
to deteriorate this could give rise to a further impairment charge 
at a future date.
Finance costs
Net ﬁnance charges in the year amounted to £23 million 
(2011/12: £30 million). The reduction primarily reﬂects lower 
pension scheme charges. We will adopt IAS 19 (revised) with effect 
from 1 August 2013 and if we had adopted it in the current year 
our ﬁnance charges would have been £13 million higher.
Tax
The Group incurred a tax charge on proﬁt before discontinued 
operations of £180 million. Tax before one-off provision 
movements, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 
and exceptional items amounted to £201 million which represents 
an effective rate of 28.6 per cent (2011/12: 24.9 per cent).
There are no signiﬁcant special tax incentives available to 
the Group that impact the tax charge such as research and 
development tax credits or patent box. Several factors are key to 
understanding the level of tax paid in each country in each year.
The Group has made substantial capital investments in assets 
over many years including in its various technology programmes, 
branch network and distribution centres. These investments 
are amortised in accordance with the laws relating to capital 
allowances in each country, including Part 2 CAA 2001 in the UK. 
As at 31 July 2013 capital allowances of £363 million are available 
to offset against future proﬁts in the UK.
In recent years the Group has made signiﬁcant contributions 
into funded pension schemes including special contributions 
of £260 million in the UK since 2011, during which pension 
contributions have exceeded proﬁtability. Generally tax laws 
around the world, including FA 2004 section 196-200 in the UK, 
require that a tax deduction is claimed after the contributions are 
made to the relevant pension scheme.
Group companies sometimes generate losses. Where they can 
be relieved or carried forward to be relieved in future periods, the 
Group does so in accordance with the relevant law. In the UK, 
section 457 CTA 2009 governs the utilisation of trading losses and 
as at 31 July 2013 the UK has losses of £402 million available to 
offset against future proﬁts. Certain losses, particularly those related 
to impairments, cannot be relieved against taxable proﬁts and this 
has had a substantial impact on the Group’s overall tax charge as a 
proportion of pre-tax proﬁts which has averaged 44.4 per cent over 
the last 10 years as detailed in the 10 year tax history table below.

Financial review continued
During the year the Group generated cash balances surplus to its 
short-term investment needs and a special dividend of £348 million 
was paid. Due to continued strong cash generation, the Board has 
proposed to pay another special dividend of £300 million with an 
accompanying share consolidation.
These dividends will bring the total payments to shareholders 
since dividends were resumed in 2011 to £1,126 million.
Liquidity
During the year the Group agreed two new facilities for a total of 
£529 million with maturities of 3 to 3¼ years. The Group maintains 
sufﬁcient borrowing facilities to ﬁnance all investment and capital 
expenditure included in its strategic plan with an additional 
margin for contingencies. As at 31 July 2013 the Group had total 
committed facilities of £2,167 million of which £1,412 million was 
undrawn. £1,968 million of the total facilities mature after more 
than two years.
Net debt
Net debt at 31 July 2013 was £411 million, equivalent to 0.5 times 
EBITDA. The level of net debt at any point in time is affected by 
the working capital cycle and at 31 July 2013 net debt would have 
been approximately £160 million higher after taking into account 
the timing of year-end supplier payment runs. 
Cash ﬂow
The Group continued to convert proﬁts strongly to cash. 
Cash generated from operations before one-off pension 
contributions was £758 million (2011/12: £807 million). We made 
a £125 million special contribution into the UK pension scheme 
(2011/12: £60 million) in order to continue to improve funding. 
We completed a number of smaller in-ﬁll acquisitions in the year 
and continued to invest in branch infrastructure, technology and 
expansion projects. Total investment amounted to £251 million 
(2011/12: £176 million). Dividends, including the special dividend of 
£348 million, amounted to £521 million. We also used £103 million 
to effectively hedge outstanding share awards to employees.

The Group paid £184 million of corporate taxes in the year 
compared to a tax charge of £180 million.
The Group’s operations are international with 64 per cent of the 
Group’s trading proﬁts generated in the USA, 24 per cent in other 
overseas territories and 12 per cent generated in the UK before 
central costs. Wolseley plc is incorporated in Jersey and is tax 
resident in Switzerland. The Group conducts its tax affairs in 
accordance with the law and arranges its tax affairs in line with 
its commercial activities. As such, it follows the terms of double 
taxation treaties and relevant OECD guidelines in dealing with 
issues such as transfer pricing and the establishment of a taxable 
presence, and the Group does not maintain an active tax presence 
in any country in which it does not trade. Other than intra-group 
ﬁnancing and the recharging of shared-service administrative 
costs the Group has no signiﬁcant transfer pricing arrangements. 
Group businesses do not generally trade with each other or make 
charges for intangible assets such as intellectual property. As far 
as possible the Group simpliﬁes its legal and commercial structure 
in order to reduce risk and minimise ongoing costs, including fees 
to advisors. The simpliﬁcation of the Group’s corporate structure 
continued throughout the year with the relevant costs charged to 
trading proﬁt.
Discontinued operations
A proﬁt of £12 million from discontinued operations (2011/12: 
loss of £3 million) arose from the release of provisions no 
longer required relating to the discontinued Stock Building 
Supply business.
Earnings per share
Headline earnings per share, which is earnings per share 
before exceptional items, the amortisation and impairment of 
acquired intangibles and non-recurring tax items was 8.0 per 
cent ahead of last year at 181.8 pence (2011/12: 168.4 pence). 
The increase reﬂects the increase in trading proﬁt, the reduction 
in ﬁnance charges and the share consolidation, partially offset 
by a higher underlying tax rate. Basic earnings per share from 
continuing operations was 106.3 pence (2011/12: 21.2 pence).
Dividends
The Group paid an interim dividend in May 2013 of 22 pence per 
share (2011/12: 20 pence per share), amounting to £59 million. 
A ﬁnal dividend of 44 pence per share, equivalent to £121 million, 
is proposed. The total dividend for the year of 66 pence per 
share (2011/12: 60 pence per share) is covered 2.8 times 
(2011/12: 2.8 times) by headline earnings per share.
The Group generates strong cash ﬂow and this is applied in order 
of priority as follows:
i) Fund organic growth
ii) Pay ordinary dividends which are expected to grow over time
iii) Make acquisitions which meet the Group’s strict return criteria
iv) Return surplus cash to shareholders reasonably promptly. Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 41
Performance
Other ﬁnancial risks
The nature of the Group’s business exposes it to risks which are 
partly ﬁnancial in nature. Counterparty risk is the risk that banks 
and other ﬁnancial institutions which are contractually committed 
to make payments to the Group may fail to do so. Commodity risk 
is the risk that the Group may have to purchase commodities 
which subsequently fall in value.
The Group manages counterparty risk by setting credit and 
settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties, which 
are approved by the Treasury Committee and monitored 
regularly. The Group manages convertibility risk by limiting its 
overnight exposure to euro assets. The management of credit 
and commodity risk is considered to be the responsibility of 
operational management and, in respect of these risks, the 
Group does not prescribe a uniform approach across the Group.
Further information on risk management and internal control 
can be found on pages 42 to 47.
Financial reporting
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under IFRS. 
The Group’s accounting policies are set out on pages 144 to 
150. There have been no changes to Group accounting policies 
during the year ended 31 July 2013, other than incorporation 
of the amendment to IAS1 (presentation of items of other 
comprehensive income).
Going concern
The Directors are conﬁdent, on the basis of current ﬁnancial 
projections and facilities available, and after considering 
sensitivities, that the Company and the Group has sufﬁcient 
resources for its operational needs and will enable the Group 
to remain in compliance with the ﬁnancial covenants in its bank 
facilities for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly the Directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
ﬁnancial statements. 
John Martin  
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
Pensions
The Group’s net pension obligations under IAS 19 at 31 July 
2013 were £133 million (2011/12: £358 million). This reduction 
is principally due to a one-off contribution of £125 million 
(2011/12: £60 million) during the year and gains in equity markets. 
Following consultation, the UK pension scheme will be closed to 
future accrual as at 31 December 2013 and will be replaced by a 
new deﬁned contribution scheme. No curtailment gain will arise 
from these changes.
Operating lease commitments
As at 31 July 2013 the Group had total operating lease 
commitments of £868 million (2011/12: £842 million). 
Management continues to believe there is substantial capacity 
for revenue growth utilising the existing branch infrastructure 
and will remain cautious when considering new lease 
commitments for the foreseeable future.
Other ﬁnancial matters
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to risks arising from the international 
nature of its operations and the ﬁnancial instruments which fund 
them. These instruments include cash, liquid investments and 
borrowings, and also items such as trade receivables and trade 
payables which arise directly from operations. The Group also 
enters into selective derivative transactions – principally interest 
rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts – to reduce 
uncertainty about the amount of future committed or forecast 
cash ﬂows. The policies to manage these risks have been applied 
consistently throughout the year. It is Group policy not to undertake 
trading in ﬁnancial instruments or speculative transactions.
Capital structure
The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise cash ﬂows 
generated by operations, borrowings from banks and other 
ﬁnancial institutions and equity contributed by shareholders. 
To assess whether the capital structure is appropriate for current 
and forecast trading, the Group’s principal measure is the ratio of 
net debt to EBITDA. The Group aims to operate with investment 
grade credit metrics and maximum net debt of 1 times to 
2 times EBITDA.
Foreign currency
The Group has signiﬁcant overseas businesses whose revenue 
is denominated in local currencies. The Group does not normally 
hedge proﬁt translation exposure since such hedges have only 
temporary effect.
The Group’s policy is to adjust the currencies in which its debt is 
denominated to materially match the currencies in which its trading 
proﬁts are generated.
Interest rates
The Group’s private placement bonds, with an outstanding 
par value of £437 million, have a hedged average ﬁxed rate of 
2.5 per cent.

investment grade credit metrics

A focus on the risks that matter
As the Group responds to changing 
customer needs and market conditions, so 
does its system of risk management and 
internal control. Some risks, such as those 
relating to IT, have inherently increased 
with the pace of technological innovation. 
Others, such as employee risks, are 
reducing as the Group invests further in its 
people, their performance and customer 
service. In response to these changes, 
the Group has strengthened its existing 
controls in some areas and introduced 
new programmes of work in others.
How are risks identiﬁed 
and reported?
A dedicated Group Head of Risk and 
Compliance works with a network of Risk 
Directors across the Group’s businesses 
to continuously improve risk management. 
A six-monthly risk assessment is 
conducted by each business unit and 
all Group central functions. The risk 
assessment includes a standard set 
of risk categories and risk deﬁnitions, 
which are reﬁned with each reporting 
cycle. Structured rating scales are used 
to deﬁne the level of risk the Group is 
accepting. A reporting tool automates the 
assessment using standard criteria and the 
evaluation of “gross” and “net” risks. All risk 
assessments, once reviewed by local 
management, are consolidated at Group-
level to identify organisation-wide impacts 
and trends. Action plans are established 
and updated, with clear allocation of 
responsibilities for their completion. 
The four levels of defence against which we 
review signiﬁcant risks are shown below:
Level 1
Front line business operations conduct 
their daily tasks in compliance with the 
Group’s deﬁned policies and procedures 
and in accordance with the Code of 
Conduct. Practices are adapted as 
required in line with changing risk levels 
and the emergence of new operational 
risks. For example, in 2012/13, speciﬁc 
front line actions have included:
 greater scrutiny of the safety and 
integrity of our products; 
 testing and improvement of controls to 
prevent fraud, bribery and corruption;
 reviewing and strengthening 
management systems for health and 
safety in all of the Group’s businesses;
 employee engagement surveys 
completed for a third year in 
all businesses.
Level 2
Corporate oversight functions monitor 
activity and performance and support the 
businesses to ensure that objectives are 
met whilst operating within the desired 
risk tolerance of the Group. Examples in 
2012/13 include:
 testing of branch health and safety self-
assessments by a central health and 
safety or audit team;
 monitoring the implementation of new 
business models;
 the use of monthly ﬁnancial reporting 
checklists by Finance teams to highlight 
areas of non-compliance to business unit 
Finance teams;
 monitoring of fraud incidents to highlight 
trends and introduce new controls; and
 reviews of risks and controls in the Group’s 
principal e-commerce businesses. Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 43
Performance
Level 3
Independent assurance and testing has 
been carried out by the Group’s Internal 
Audit team and external organisations. 
During 2012/13, the Internal Audit team 
has reviewed and tested controls in a 
number of areas including health and 
safety compliance; ﬁnancial payment 
controls; rebate calculations and supplier 
contract terms; compliance with the 
Group’s product-related policies and 
ethics programme (which addresses 
the requirements of the UK Bribery Act). 
External testing has been undertaken 
on payment controls, health and safety 
compliance (in some of our Central 
European businesses) and the accuracy 
of environmental data reporting.
Level 4
The Board regularly monitors the 
implementation of strategy and the 
ﬁnancial performance of the Group. 
In July 2013 the Board discussed and 
determined the extent to which they 
were willing and prepared to take risk. 
The Board receives frequent reports 
related to the Group’s top risks, (see 
following pages for details). On behalf 
of the Board, in March and September 
each year the Audit Committee reviews 
key risks and controls and how they have 
been managed in practice. The Audit 
Committee receives reports on the ﬁndings 
from internal audits. More information on 
the activities undertaken by the Board 
and its Committees, including the Audit 
Committee, is contained in the Governance 
section on page 64.
Signiﬁcant risks facing 
the business
The nature of the industry in which we 
operate and our chosen strategy expose 
the Group to a number of risks. There are 
areas of the Group’s business where 
it is necessary to take risks to achieve 
a satisfactory return for shareholders. 
The Board has considered the nature and 
extent of the signiﬁcant risks it is willing 
to take in achieving the Group’s strategic 
objectives. These key risks, their level and 
trend are summarised in the tables overleaf.
The materialisation of these risks could 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
results or ﬁnancial condition. If more than 
one of these risks occur, the combined 
overall effect of such events may be 
compounded. Various mitigation strategies 
are employed to reduce these inherent 
risks to an acceptable level – these are 
summarised on the following pages. 
Some risk factors remain beyond the 
direct control of the Group and the 
risk management programme can only 
provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance that key risks are managed 
to an acceptable level. 
The Group faces many other risks 
which, although important and subject 
to regular review, have been assessed 
as less signiﬁcant and are not listed 
here. These include, for example, major 
incidences of fraud, bribery or corruption 
or health and safety related risks. 
Further information on ﬁnancial risks and 
their management is contained on page 41. 
More information on health and safety can 
be found on page 53.
The UK business 
in standards 
certiﬁcation 
hat-trick
Two UK business units, along with 
the operational headquarters, 
have achieved three prestigious 
environmental, health and safety 
and quality certiﬁcations. 
Drain Center and Integrated Services 
have been awarded OHSAS 18001, 
ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 certiﬁcation 
by the British Standards Institution 
(“BSI”). OHSAS 18001 certiﬁcation, an 
assessment series for health and safety 
management systems, demonstrates 
an organisation’s awareness of health 
and safety legislation and a commitment 
to continuous improvement and will 
help control occupational health and 
safety risks. In addition, Drain Center, 
Integrated Services and the UK’s 
operational headquarters hold ISO 
14001 and ISO 9001 certiﬁcation, which 
displays a commitment to reducing 
environmental impact and ensuring 
superior quality management. All units 
had to meet speciﬁc criteria to achieve 
the standards, such as showing an 
enhanced knowledge of health and 
safety law, controlling waste and setting 
targets for continuous improvements 
that are meaningful and achievable.

Economic downturn
Inherent risk level 
– High
Trend – Stable
The Group’s results depend on the levels 
of activity in new construction and property 
repair and remodelling markets. In light 
of the suppressed market conditions in 
Europe and Canada, there continues 
to be a risk that markets may ﬂuctuate 
rapidly or experience further downturns. 
Factors inﬂuencing this risk include:
 the general rate of GDP growth;
 consumer conﬁdence;
 the availability of credit to ﬁnance 
customer investment;
 mortgage and other interest rates;
 the level of government initiatives to 
stimulate economic activity;
 inﬂation; and
 unemployment.
These factors are out of the Group’s control 
and are difﬁcult to forecast.
Traditional processes for producing 
management information may need 
enhancing to enable the Group to respond 
to such rapidly-changing markets.
The Group believes it has effective measures in place to respond 
to market conditions. Our mitigation strategy is to reinforce 
existing measures in place. These include:
 the development of our business models;
 resource allocation processes;
 planning, budgeting and forecasting processes;
 cost reduction, pricing and gross margin management 
initiatives, including a focus on customer service and 
productivity improvement; 
 improvements in monthly management information;
 diversiﬁcation into other sectors which present new 
opportunities; and 
 further restructuring of the Group’s operations in markets 
with suppressed levels of economic activity.
Pressure on margins
Inherent risk level 
– High
Trend – Stable
Market conditions in many geographies 
continued to drive greater competition 
during the period under review. If not 
mitigated, this could lead to downward 
pressure on sales prices and proﬁt margins.
There is a risk that such competitive 
pressures will continue and could be 
exacerbated by factors such as the arrival 
of new competitors, customer or supplier 
consolidation, manufacturers shipping 
directly to customers, other changes in the 
route to market, and changes in technology.
The Group continues to strengthen mitigation actions already in 
place. Gross margin improvement initiatives remain a priority for 
all businesses.
We believe that high levels of customer service and product 
availability play a fundamental role in maintaining competitive 
advantage. The Group has continued with its programme of work 
to improve levels of customer service and inventory.
A number of local initiatives have been undertaken by Wolseley 
businesses in the last 12 months, including:
 the development of our business models;
 continued focus on improving terms with our customers; and
 improved compensation plans for sales teams in some markets.

Litigation
Inherent risk level 
– Medium/high
Trend – Stable
The international nature of Wolseley’s 
operations exposes it to the potential 
for litigation from third parties, and such 
exposure is considered to be greater in the 
USA than in Europe. 
Wolseley’s strengths include its employees, 
its products and the terms it negotiates with 
its suppliers. It is in these areas where the 
potential risk of litigation may be greatest.
During the year, there has been no material 
change in the level of litigation to which the 
Group is exposed. For more information on 
speciﬁc litigation affecting the Group, see 
pages 111, 132 and 143.
Levels of litigation are monitored by individual operating 
companies and by Group functions.
To reduce its exposure to product-related claims, the Group is 
reviewing the level of product-related risk in all business units. 
This includes improvements in how we mitigate product-related 
exposures and how we monitor performance in this area.
Internal audits of rebate calculations and supplier contracts were 
completed in 2012/13.
The Group has completed a review of its working practices in the 
USA. Improvement opportunities are being identiﬁed and will be 
introduced during the next ﬁnancial year.
In the case of claims related to exposure to asbestos, Wolseley 
employs independent professional advisers to actuarially 
determine its potential gross liability. Wolseley has insurance which 
exceeds the current estimated liability relating to asbestos claims. 
Systems and infrastructure capabilities and resilience
Inherent risk level 
– Medium
Trend – Risk is rising
The Group can only carry on business as 
long as it has the information technology 
and the physical infrastructure to do so. 
The safe and continued operation of such 
systems and infrastructure is threatened 
by natural and man-made perils and is 
affected by the level of investment available 
to improve them. For example:
 the level and sophistication of IT security 
threats are increasing;
 some of the Group’s businesses 
are earning greater revenues via 
e-commerce channels;
 some of the Group’s physical assets 
are located in areas exposed to natural 
catastrophe risks;
 we remain reliant on a number of different 
technology systems across the Group, 
some of which have been operating for 
many years; and
 to optimise costs and supply chain 
efﬁciency, some companies within the 
Wolseley Group have also centralised their 
distribution network and are therefore 
reliant on a smaller number of larger 
distribution centres.
Core IT systems and data centres for the Group’s material 
businesses, including the Group’s principal e-commerce 
businesses, have documented disaster recovery plans which 
are tested annually. 
In the USA, signiﬁcant improvements have been made in the 
recovery times for core systems and our business there has been 
certiﬁed as Payment Card Industry compliant.
The Group’s building materials business in France strengthened 
its IT disaster recovery capabilities during 2012/13. 
The Group operates an IT governance framework including 
dedicated IT security policies. Speciﬁc operational controls for IT 
security include intrusion prevention and detection, penetration 
testing, wireless remediation of issues, log and conﬁguration 
management and in-ﬂight projects to reduce the likelihood of 
an incident. The Group’s Chief Information Security Ofﬁcer has 
this year undertaken a review of information security capabilities 
across the Group.
The loss of a physical site is naturally hedged by the diversiﬁed 
nature of our locations, customers and suppliers. 
The Group has formally documented and tested plans for those 
distribution centres, head ofﬁce buildings and data centres where 
the risk is deemed to be greatest. The UK business undertook a 
comprehensive review of its business continuity priorities during 
the year and is addressing the ﬁndings.

Wolseley’s ability to provide products and 
services to customers depends on retaining 
sufﬁciently qualiﬁed, experienced and 
motivated people.
In order to increase productivity, and to be 
able to take growth opportunities when 
markets improve, Wolseley must maintain 
the skills and experience of its existing 
employees and continue to develop the 
managers of the future.
While staff turnover rates are stable at 
present the current difﬁcult conditions 
experienced in certain markets, and the 
Group’s response to them, may demotivate 
remaining employees.
The Group monitors voluntary turnover rates and employee 
engagement scores. Employee engagement scores have 
increased in almost all businesses and remain high compared 
to industry averages.
The People Strategy that was agreed by the Board in 2011 sets 
out key principles and practices for people management, which 
operating companies implement in their businesses.
Effective personal performance management underpins the 
People Strategy. The quality of individuals’ performance reviews 
remains a high priority and is being monitored and improved 
in all areas of the business. For more information on people 
development, see page 52.
During 2012/13, future people needs were deﬁned by each 
business and succession planning exercises were undertaken. 
The Group’s most talented and promising individuals are identiﬁed 
and continually developed.
Career mobility has been increased, providing more employees 
with the opportunity to work in different areas of the Group.
The Group believes that employee participation in community 
and charity events enhances employee skills and increases 
engagement levels. These activities are actively supported 
across the Group.
Speciﬁc examples of activity in business units includes a new 
Leadership Development Committee in Ferguson, USA and 
a fast-track development programme in Wolseley UK.
New business models
Inherent risk level 
– Medium
Trend – NEW
To respond to changing customer needs 
the Group is introducing new business 
models. This will involve the development 
of new technologies, updated ﬂexible 
employment patterns and different ways 
of working.
The Group’s ability to successfully execute 
these changes will affect its ability to grow 
proﬁtably in the future. 
The Group must successfully implement 
these changes without disrupting 
existing operations.
Each business unit has a clear strategy for continuously 
developing its business model and a deﬁned programme of work 
to execute the strategy.
Programmes of work are deﬁned, resourced and implemented 
locally, according to customers’ needs and market conditions. 
Businesses undergoing the greatest change have dedicated 
programme and change management capability with 
associated KPIs.
Progress in implementing these changes is reviewed during 
the Group’s regular performance management reviews, held by 
the Group CEO and CFO with each business unit. Wolseley plc

Governmental regulations
Inherent risk level 
– Medium/low
Trend – Stable
The Group’s operations are affected by 
various statutes, regulations and laws in the 
countries and markets in which it operates. 
The amount of such regulation and the 
penalties can change. 
While the Group is not engaged in a highly 
regulated industry, it is subject to the laws 
governing businesses generally, including 
laws relating to competition, international 
trade, fraud, bribery and corruption, land 
usage, zoning, the environment, health 
and safety, transportation, labour and 
employment practices (including pensions), 
data protection, payment terms and 
other matters. 
The Group’s compliance with laws to 
prevent anti-competitive behaviour and 
to combat bribery and corruption remain 
a priority.
Building codes or particular tax treatments 
may affect the products Wolseley’s 
customers are allowed to use and, 
consequently, changes in these may affect 
the saleability of some Wolseley products.
The Group monitors regulations across its markets to ensure that 
the effects of changes are minimised and that compliance with 
all applicable regulation is continually sought. 
During the year, the Group has undertaken a comprehensive 
review of its anti-fraud, bribery and corruption practices. 
Improvements have been made to existing risk assessment 
and due diligence procedures. Further information on our ethics 
programme and legal compliance can be seen on page 55.
The Group is well positioned to comply with the new regulation 
regarding carbon data reporting, having collected the relevant 
data for a number of years. See page 58 for more information. Wolseley plc

Corporate responsibility
Sustaining Wolseley’s 
profitable, long-term 
growth
The Group’s Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) 
activity is not a separate programme of work, 
but a reﬂection of the way we want to do 
business. The year under review has focused 
on putting in place the most important 
aspects of the CR strategy that were deﬁned 
in 2012. 
Good progress has been made during the year. 
Employee engagement scores increased and remain high 
compared to industry averages. Processes and controls for 
the management of health and safety and product integrity 
and the prevention of fraud, bribery and corruption have been 
strengthened, supported by new Group minimum standards. 
The Group has further reduced its carbon and waste impact and 
signiﬁcant progress has been made towards the Group’s two-year 
reduction targets.
More remains to be done. The Group’s injury and lost workday 
rates increased by 2 per cent, which was disappointing. 
Clear standards, plans and targets have been set in this 
and other areas and performance will be closely monitored 
by the Board in 2013/14.

Overview
Each aspect of the programme exists because 
it supports the proﬁtable growth of the Group 
whether through expanded gross margins, 
increased market share or improved 
productivity. A well-trained and motivated 
workforce delivers exceptional customer 
service and strengthens the Group’s market 
share. Reducing the number of days lost 
through injury improves productivity. 
Reduced fuel and energy consumption lowers 
the Group’s cost base and expands margins. 
More rigorous screening of suppliers and 
products leads to fewer defects with products 
and more reliable customer service. 
  Further detail on progress in 2012/13 and objectives 
for the year 2013/14 is provided in the following pages. 
Additional information, including more case studies, is available 
on the Wolseley plc website www.wolseley.com.
Key developments in the year
The Group emitted 6.1 per cent less carbon and sent 19 per 
cent less waste to landﬁll relative to turnover.
Employee engagement survey scores improved again and 
continue to outperform industry averages.
We assessed the skills and experience needed to develop 
our business and updated our recruitment, development 
and succession plans accordingly.
New Group minimum standards were developed for health and 
safety, anti-fraud, bribery and corruption and product integrity 
and were approved by the Board.
All business units now have targets against the three Group 
health and safety metrics; injury rate, lost workday rate and 
collision rate.
All business units achieved greater consistency in the 
implementation of the Group’s standards for anti-fraud, bribery 
and corruption.
The accuracy of the Group’s environmental data has improved.
Governance of Corporate Responsibility
Who has overall accountability and sets direction?
The overall programme is agreed by the Board and reviewed 
annually to ensure its ongoing relevance to business strategy, 
stakeholder expectations and broader national and international 
sustainability agendas. The Group’s Company Secretary and 
General Counsel is responsible to the Board for the overall 
corporate responsibility programme and for maintaining 
regular dialogue with business units to drive performance. 
Individual programme components receive more frequent 
review and input by the Board and the Executive Committee. 
Who implements the strategy set by the Board?
With direction from the Board, business units deﬁne and execute 
local action plans. Business unit plans differ according to their own 
particular level of development and the greatest opportunities for 
progress in line with strategy. The Group Risk, Compliance and 
Sustainability team oversees implementation. This team includes 
a dedicated Risk and Sustainability Manager. 
Are targets and objectives set?
Objectives and, where appropriate, quantiﬁed targets are set for all 
CR programme components. For some focus areas, Group-wide 
KPIs have been deﬁned. KPIs have not been set for all elements 
of the programme as it is not always practical to bring distinct 
local practices and reporting methods under one uniﬁed metric. 
Improved performance is the primary goal. Uniﬁed processes 
and measures are implemented where there is beneﬁt in doing 
so. The potential for further Group-wide performance metrics 
for future reporting will continue to be reviewed.
How is performance monitored?
Specialist teams in each business unit monitor performance for 
their speciﬁc area of responsibility. The Group Risk Compliance 
and Sustainability team monitor performance across all areas of 
the CR programme, with the exception of “People Development” 
(which is overseen by the Group HR function). During the year 
Wolseley’s Internal Audit teams tested compliance with policy 
and adherence to procedures for a number of programmes, 
including the product integrity and ethics programmes. 
How are risks assessed and mitigated?
Non-ﬁnancial as well as ﬁnancial risks are assessed as part of the 
Group’s comprehensive risk management process. These include 
fraud, corruption, product quality, employee, health and safety 
and environmental risks. For further information on the Group’s risk 
management programme, see pages 42 to 47.  Wolseley plc

People  
development
We value our people and are committed to train and 
develop all of our employees. We understand, respect 
and value personal and cultural differences and 
promote diversity.
Developing and retaining our people will lead to better 
customer service, increased productivity and motivation, 
improved quality of operations, and greater market 
share. Equipping our employees with the skills they need 
for the future will fast-track the development of new 
business models.
Health and safety
We will provide a safe and healthy working environment 
and we will not compromise the health or safety of 
any individual.
Protecting the health and safety of our people minimises 
interruptions to business operations and helps us to gain 
and maintain their trust and loyalty. It protects the skills 
and experience that are used to serve our customers. 
Maintaining our physical assets minimises the risk of 
injury, helps us to preserve the integrity of our operations, 
improves efﬁciency, lowers our costs and improves the 
quality of our customer service.
Ethics and 
compliance 
programme
We are committed to observing both the spirit and the 
letter of the laws of all jurisdictions in which we operate, 
and to complying with our Code of Conduct.
Conducting business responsibly and with integrity 
minimises risks related to fraud and corruption and 
strengthens our reputation. It also makes our business 
more efﬁcient because we avoid costly disruptions. 
Compliance programmes strengthen our internal controls.
Environmental  
performance
We will run efﬁcient operations that consume less energy 
and fuel, produce less waste and reduce any negative 
effect of our business activities on the environment. 
We will explore opportunities to reduce the environmental 
impacts of our suppliers and customers.
Improving our environmental performance increases 
efﬁciency and productivity and reduces operational costs.
Product  
integrity
We will work with our suppliers to maintain excellent 
standards of product quality and safety.
We expect our vendors, contractors and agents to adhere 
to our Code of Conduct and to adopt similar standards.
Complying with our product integrity policy reduces risks 
of litigation, claims and business disruption, improving 
productivity and customer service and reducing 
our costs.
Sustainable  
construction
We will be a positive link in the sustainable construction 
supply chain.
Entering new markets and attracting and maintaining 
customers through new customer services will increase 
our market share. Working with suppliers to rationalise 
product packaging reduces operating costs related to 
distribution and waste management.
Community  
engagement
We will be a responsible member of the communities 
in which we work.
Building closer relationships with the communities 
in which we operate helps us to promote our 
business, attract high quality recruits and gain a 
greater understanding of our customers, vendors 
and employees. Wolseley plc

 People development
How does “people development” underpin  
our strategy?
Skilled and engaged employees deliver excellent customer service, 
develop strong vendor relationships, and maximise operational 
efﬁciencies. We believe that ensuring a motivated and engaged 
workforce results in more productive ways of working and fast-
tracks the development of new business models.
What are the risks and how are we  
managing them?
Employee retention and motivation is recognised as one of our 
signiﬁcant risks. For more detail on how we are managing the risk, 
please see page 46.
What does “people development” entail?
We develop our people through structured performance 
management, training, leadership development programmes, 
and succession planning (talent management); together these 
represent four of the six components of our People Strategy 
(below). 
We continuously measure our progress through engagement 
surveys in all businesses. We are proud that our results improved 
against the previous year in almost all our markets and are higher 
than the industry averages.

Organisation
What did we achieve in 2012/13?
We improved the induction process and training 
for front-line employees.
We place great importance on induction and training of our 
front-line staff – those who face our customers. In the USA, we 
launched a new Sales Manager Training Programme to ensure 
that we continue to provide our sales teams with the right tools 
to provide our customers with excellent service. 
In our UK business, we introduced a new induction programme 
for branch employees. This ensures that employees receive 
a consistent, high quality induction regardless of location. 
New employees also have an assigned buddy to take them 
through their induction and act as a mentor. 
We re-assessed our future people needs and 
developed our succession and recruitment plans 
to align with them.
Over the past year, we looked at the people resource and skill sets 
that will be needed to support future business models and aligned 
our recruitment and succession plans accordingly. The resulting 
“talent pipeline” strategy was presented to and approved by the 
Board. We are now working on implementing action plans in all of 
our businesses to ensure that we continue to attract and develop 
the best talent at all levels, and we will measure progress against 
agreed objectives. In support of this programme, we relaunched 
our graduate programme in the UK, to provide future talent for our 
operations as well as our support functions.
Succession planning is a key part of ensuring that our business 
is ﬁt for the future. We continue to conduct talent reviews which 
provide valuable data to our talent management process. 
We focused our businesses on improved diversity 
and inclusion.
In addition to our drive for promotion from within, we increased 
our talent pool with key external recruitments to supplement 
the diversity of knowledge, backgrounds, skills and experience. 
We believe in the strength of an inclusive culture and this is 
embedded in our values. We will maintain our focus on providing 
a work environment where all employees can deliver to their full 
potential. This supports improved diversity and ultimately delivers 
better business results.
We assessed our development programmes for 
mid-level high potential managers and for our 
senior leaders.
We redesigned the leadership programme for senior and mid-level 
managers. Learning and development requires a blended learning 
approach and therefore the mid-level high potential leadership 
programme comprises classroom training, individual feedback 
and coaching as well as participation in live business projects 
where participants work in cross-functional groups. This enables 
participants to grow and develop individually as leaders, while also 
adding value and providing innovative solutions to the business.
We conducted in-depth studies on workforce 
productivity.
This has provided valuable insight and enabled us to focus on 
processes that add value to our customers. Speciﬁc action plans 
have been developed and are being implemented to improve 
operational efﬁciency.  Wolseley plc

Health and safety
How does “health and safety” underpin 
our strategy?
A robust health and safety programme and a positive health and 
safety culture improve productivity by reducing the number of 
days lost to injury. It helps to protect proﬁtability by reducing our 
liabilities and helps the Group to win business where contracts 
require strong health and safety credentials.
What are the risks and how are we managing them?
The principal health and safety risks relate to workplace 
injuries such as slips, trips and falls, manual handling incidents, 
working at height and the use of motorised equipment such 
as fork lift trucks. Outside of the workplace, the greatest risk is 
posed by vehicle collisions while driving on company business. 
The Group has introduced improved standards across all 
its businesses and performance is monitored quarterly by 
the Board. Some businesses are certiﬁed to OHSAS 18001, 
the internationally-recognised standard for health and 
safety management.
What does “health and safety” entail?
Our businesses are continuously improving the systems in place 
to manage the health and safety of our employees, customers 
and others with whom we come into contact. These systems 
include policies stating our approach and intent, and tools such 
as risk assessments, documented safe working practices and 
self-assessments. At a Group level we measure and report injury 
rates, lost workday rates and collision rates. For many of our 
business units, additional business or country speciﬁc measures 
are in place.
How did we perform in 2012/13?
Performance against our three health and safety 
metrics was mixed.
Our performance metrics are injury rate, lost workday rate and 
vehicle collision rate. Group performance against these measures 
is shown below.

New Employer of the Y ear 
The UK business has been presented with the New 
Employer of the Year award by the National Mentoring 
Consortium (“NMC”), following its involvement in their 
Ethnic Minority Undergraduate Scheme. 
The NMC works with over 300 employers and 15 universities 
to promote equality and diversity in graduate recruitment 
and to enhance the employability of black, Asian and ethnic 
minority students, particularly those with a disability or dyslexia. 
The programme provides support and experience to students 
seeking managerial and professional careers. The UK business 
placed four managers into one-to-one mentoring partnerships 
which helps prepare the students for working in a professional 
environment.  Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 54
Corporate responsibility continued
We are disappointed to report an increase in the injury and lost 
workday rate. The underlying causes of some of these trends are 
understood and are being addressed. We are targeting a reduction 
in injury and lost workday rates next year. 
In spite of our improved collision rate, we regret to report a 
fatal collision that involved a Wolseley delivery driver in wintry 
conditions in the USA in January 2013. We continue to provide a 
rigorous training programme for all drivers, which includes speciﬁc 
guidance for driving in cold weather.
Please note that the injury and lost workday rates are now 
calculated using “Full-Time Equivalent” (“FTE”) employee numbers 
instead of total headcount. The reported rates for 2009/10, 
2010/11 and 2011/12 have been restated also using FTE numbers. 
This ensures that injury and lost workday rates are not understated 
as part-time hours are taken into consideration.

Due to rounding of the ﬁgures in the bar charts, there is not a 
precise correlation with the accurate percentage performance 
ﬁgure shown in the title bar.
A new Group-wide minimum standard for health and 
safety has been developed.
A new Group minimum standard was developed during 2012/13  
in line with our commitment to continually improve practices 
across the Group. The standard expects compliance with 43 
speciﬁc requirements. All business units scored themselves 
against these requirements during August this year. This has 
allowed us to identify areas for improvement during 2013/14. 
All business units will be compliant with the new Group minimum 
standard by 31 July 2014.
Some business units are already compliant with OHSAS 18001, 
the internationally recognised Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System standard. 
We strengthened corporate oversight of branch 
self assessments.
In many of our businesses, branches complete self-assessments 
of compliance with health and safety standards. 
It is important that these self-assessments are accurate so that 
weaknesses are correctly identiﬁed and addressed. We increased 
corporate oversight of branch self-assessments by strengthening 
the health and safety function in the Nordic region and by 
developing an operational audit team in the USA. Similar teams 
already exist in the UK, France and Canada. Central European 
businesses have engaged with third party health and safety 
specialists to assess their health and safety performance.
Targets have been set for all businesses against 
the three Group health and safety KPIs.
Business unit targets, which have been amalgamated into the 
Group level targets presented on page 53, are achievable by 
31 July 2014.
Data accuracy and completeness has improved.
The Internal Audit team assessed all business units for compliance 
with the reporting guidelines and all audit recommendations 
have been actioned. Additionally, a more detailed set of reporting 
guidelines has been documented to ensure the consistency and 
comparability of performance data.
Internal audits have been conducted in a number of our 
businesses to assess health and safety compliance.
Internal audits of health and safety compliance have been 
completed in the USA and Canada.
Health and safety specialists across the Group 
continue to share best practice.
Health and safety specialists from each region participate in a 
quarterly best practice call. The health and safety team also meet 
face-to-face once a year to review current practices and discuss 
priorities for the coming months. Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 55
Performance
Ethics and compliance 
programme
How does the “ethics and compliance 
programme” underpin our strategy?
Compliance with the letter and the spirit of the law and a 
commitment to high ethical standards protects our business 
from unforeseen liabilities and strengthens our reputation with 
stakeholders; it nurtures trust across our customer and supplier 
base; it gives reassurance to our shareholders; and it instils 
conﬁdence in our workforce.
What are the risks and how are we 
managing them?
Compliance with governmental regulations is recognised as one of our 
most signiﬁcant risks. For more detail on how we are managing the risk, 
please see page 47 .
What does the “ethics and compliance 
programme” entail?
Our ethics programme and Code of Conduct aim to strengthen 
our core values (see page 14) by setting out in clear terms the 
standards and behaviour expected of our employees and, in 
some cases, our business partners. It sets out standards in areas 
such as bribery, corruption and fraud, preservation of conﬁdential 
information, managing conﬂicts of interest, treating customers 
and vendors fairly, engaging in fair competition, maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance, providing a safe and healthy 
working environment, running efﬁcient operations, minimising waste, 
limiting our environmental impact, developing our employees and 
valuing diversity.
What did we achieve in 2012/13?
We extended our training programmes.
We ensured that employees received the appropriate level of 
training relevant to their roles. All new joiners are required to 
complete training on the Group Code of Conduct, competition law 
and anti-bribery and corruption, tailored to their role and seniority, 
as a standard part of their induction. 
Our controls for the prevention of fraud, bribery 
and corruption were strengthened.
As part of the anti-corruption programme, internal audits were 
carried out in the UK in 2012 and in the USA and Canada in 2013. 
Areas for improvement were identiﬁed and action plans developed. 
Our businesses have carried out anti-fraud, theft and bribery and 
corruption risk assessments and actions to mitigate the identiﬁed 
risks are being taken as part of a continuing programme. For the 
coming year, further work will be conducted with major suppliers 
in order to maintain compliance with the Group’s bribery and 
corruption policies. 
Strengthened central 
support for health and safety 
– Nordic region
The Nordic region has enhanced its central health and 
safety team, which now consists of seven business 
partners working throughout Denmark, Sweden, Norway 
and Finland.
Their job is to support local health and safety initiatives and 
to perform audits to test branch compliance with national 
legislation and Group minimum requirements. To support 
this initiative the business has implemented a new IT system. 
Each business partner uses a mobile tablet to complete 
checklists on-site. The result of each audit is automatically 
sent to the relevant Branch Manager as an action plan, with 
relevant photo documentation attached. The Branch Manager 
is required to complete all recommended actions before the 
agreed deadline. A copy of the report is sent to the local health 
and safety employee representative and the regional manager. 
The system provides management with useful real-time 
information on health and safety for each site.
Health and safety business partners conduct branch audits to test 
compliance with national legislation and Group minimum requirements. Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 56
Corporate responsibility continued
Enhanced competition law training has been 
conducted throughout our businesses.
An online competition law refresher course (to supplement the 
full online training course) was developed and used in all our 
businesses. Employees who previously completed the full course 
were required to complete the refresher course. In addition 
advanced, detailed training materials were developed and delivered 
face-to-face across our businesses to employees identiﬁed as 
being most at risk. Competition law specialists along with internal 
counsel delivered the training to ensure that it was tailored for 
our employees.
We continue to encourage our employees to report any 
incidents of non-compliance through our Group-wide 
conﬁdential reporting system, “Speak Up!”.
Employees can disclose information in any language, conﬁdentially 
and anonymously via an international hotline, voicemail or web 
message. The conﬁdential reports are investigated and, where 
necessary, actions are taken to rectify any weakness in our 
systems that may have been identiﬁed. These actions, and the 
overall integrity of the reporting system, are subject to regular 
scrutiny by the Audit Committee.

Environmental 
performance
How does “environmental performance” 
underpin our strategy?
The reduced consumption of energy, fuel and water and 
production of less waste lowers our environmental impact 
whilst reducing cost, improving our operational efﬁciencies 
and expanding our margins. Responsible environmental 
management helps to protect our reputation, as increasingly 
customers assess our environmental credentials through 
pre-qualiﬁcation questionnaires.
What are the risks and how are we 
managing them?
There is a risk of increased operational cost due to rising energy 
and fuel prices, increasing carbon and waste taxes and more 
burdensome reporting requirements. To address the risk, all 
business units have targets in place to improve energy, fuel and 
waste efﬁciency and the Group is reviewing processes to ease 
the administrative burden of reporting. 
What does “environmental 
performance” entail?
Environmental performance concerns the management and 
reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions, our waste and our 
water consumption. Where possible, we work with our suppliers 
to reduce their environmental impacts. For example, we reduce 
supplier transport emissions by “backhauling” products from their 
factories when our trucks would otherwise return empty to our 
distribution centres. This reduces the mileage and related CO2
 
emissions of our suppliers whilst also reducing Wolseley’s costs 
and number of “empty miles” on the road.  Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 57
Performance
What did we achieve in 2012/13?
We reduced greenhouse gas emissions (6 per cent 
improvement), waste sent to landﬁll (19 per cent 
improvement) (both per £million of revenue), and water 
consumption (3 per cent improvement) (per employee).

Due to rounding of the ﬁgures in the bar charts, there is not a 
precise correlation with the accurate percentage performance 
ﬁgures. Where environmental data has not been included due to 
business disposals, the relative measures (revenue and employees) 
have been recalculated to ensure a like-for-like comparison. 
All businesses implemented initiatives to work towards 
their individual targets.
Each business unit has targets against its two biggest carbon 
contributors (typically vehicle fuel and energy) and waste to 
landﬁll. These performance targets are owned by and remain 
the responsibility of each business. The Group-level targets are 
an aggregation of the targets set by each business. The 2012/13 
performance statistics and examples of how the businesses 
have improved their environmental performance are detailed 
in the greenhouse gas emissions, waste and water sections 
that follow, with further examples available on the Wolseley plc 
website www.wolseley.com.
We have improved the reliability of our environmental 
data and have restated our 2011/12 numbers.
We have collected and analysed data at a Group level at year 
end for a number of years. This year, for the ﬁrst time, we also 
collated data at the half year in order to assess progress towards 
targets. Through greater scrutiny of the data we identiﬁed some 
inaccuracies in the 2011/12 numbers. These inaccuracies related 
primarily to miscalculation of Wolseley’s Scope 3 (indirect) 
emissions related to outsourced transportation. Our 2011/12 
numbers have therefore been restated to ensure that we report 
an accurate assessment of performance against targets.
13 per cent of the data that makes up our carbon totals were 
based on estimates, compared to 47 per cent in 2011/12. 48 per 
cent of the data that makes up our waste totals were based on 
estimates, compared to 27 per cent in 2011/12. 27 per cent of the 
data that makes up our water totals were based on estimates, 
compared to 77 per cent in 2011/12. Further attention will be given 
to waste data accuracy during 2013/14.
To provide further conﬁdence in our data, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
(“PwC”) have been engaged to test the Group environmental data. 
An initial review (known as a “readiness for assurance” test) was 
completed during the ﬁnal quarter of 2012/13. We will work to 
achieve full assurance of our carbon and waste data in 2013/14. 
The knowledge of our environmental experts continues 
to be shared across the Group.
Knowledge-sharing sessions have been run to develop best 
practices and facilitate achievement of targets. These have

What are our targets for 2013/14?
Metrics 2013/14 targets
1. Greenhouse gas emissions 
(tCO2e per £m revenue)
To continue to reduce tCO2e 
(carbon emissions) and achieve 
the two-year target of 7.5%.*
2. Waste sent to landﬁll 
(tonnes per £m revenue)
To continue to reduce waste to 
landﬁll and achieve a redeﬁned 
two-year target of 23%.*
3. Data accuracy 
(estimation levels)
To continue to improve data 
accuracy by reducing reliance 
on estimates.
*The Group-level targets are set against a 2011/12 baseline, with a target date of 
31 July 2014. 
1. Greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2e)
As in previous years, and in line with future UK carbon 
reporting regulations, total emissions are presented opposite. 
Performance relative to revenue is presented on page 57. 
Absolute carbon emissions reduced by 4.5 per cent during 
2012/13.
Emissions have been reported in accordance with the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol (“GHG Protocol”). Wolseley reports on its Scope 
1, Scope 2 and selected Scope 3 emissions. Reported Scope 1 
emissions include vehicle fuel emissions (from owned or leased 
vehicles) and fuels used for operation including natural gas, LPG, 
diesel, petrol and oil. Scope 2 emissions include purchased 
electricity and heat (i.e. district heating). Scope 3 emissions include 
the road-based transportation of goods by outsourced transport 
providers, road-based business travel in private vehicles and air 
and rail-based business travel.

The Group’s emissions data has been presented differently 
in the chart (above) this year (and retrospectively for 2011/12). 
Further information on this is available on the Wolseley plc 
website www.wolseley.com.
As a Group, the biggest contributors to carbon emissions are 
vehicle fuel (51 per cent of total tCO2e, including both commercial 
vehicle and company cars, owned and outsourced ﬂeets), and 
electricity (31 per cent). Fuel consumption for operations (i.e. gas, 
oil and district heating consumption) represents 16 per cent of 
the carbon footprint. Refrigerant leakage and rail and air-based 
business travel account for 1 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. 
The improved emissions performance for the Group’s commercial 
ﬂeet (2.5 per cent improvement) was driven by a number of 
initiatives including the implementation of route optimisation 
programmes, the ﬁtting of tracking devices to trucks and running 
eco-driver training. Company car ﬂeets continue to be upgraded 
with more fuel-efﬁcient vehicles. The USA has expanded its 
successful energy-efﬁcient lighting programme into more new 
locations. The Canadian business unit has begun a programme 
to switch the entire estate to low-energy lighting. Other initiatives 
include heating system upgrades and fuel-switching (i.e. oil to 
electric heating). Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 59
Performance
Additionally, we continue to reduce our suppliers’ 
emissions through “backhauling”. 
In the USA and UK business units, drivers collect products from 
supplier factories when driving back to their distribution centres 
(“DCs”), following branch deliveries. In 2012/13 the US business, 
through its carrier UPS, ﬁlled 41 per cent of its DC backhaul 
“empty miles”, compared to 39 per cent in 2011/12.
Hydrogen powered forklifts – 
Nordic region
Stark, a business unit in the Nordic region, is acting 
as a sustainable leader, being the ﬁrst construction 
distribution business in the country to invest in forklifts 
with fuel cells that run exclusively on hydrogen. 
Since November, trucks in operation at the Stark City store in 
the Copenhagen area all use fuel cell technology. The forklifts 
create zero pollution, the only “waste” being completely pure 
water – which is discharged by the heating fuel cells as steam.
Additionally, the trucks only consume hydrogen when they 
are being driven or are lifting. When the truck is stationary, for 
example when handling items, no energy is consumed – unlike 
diesel forklifts that consume fuel even when idle. In addition 
to the trucks, the site also has its own hydrogen station which 
makes refuelling quick and easy – it takes only three to four 
minutes to refuel a tank.
*2011/12 numbers have been restated. See page 57 for further details.
Stark in the Nordic region has invested in hydrogen fuel-cell forklift trucks, 
reducing carbon emissions and saving time with faster refuelling.
2. Waste management
Wolseley moves large volumes of product through its supply chain, 
generating non-hazardous packaging waste and some damaged 
or obsolete stock. The Group’s businesses also create smaller 
quantities of hazardous waste. Deﬁnitions vary from country to 
country: hazardous waste may include items such as batteries, 
paint and electronic equipment; non-hazardous waste typically 
includes materials such as paper, plastic and metal.
Total waste volumes reduced by 11 per cent during 2012/13, 
compared to 2011/12. Per £million of revenue, waste volumes 
improved by 12 per cent. The mix of waste types by ﬁnal 
destination (landﬁlled, incinerated or recycled) also improved, 
with 21 per cent more waste being recycled and 18 per cent less 
waste being sent to landﬁll. As our two-year target of a 15 per 
cent reduction in waste sent to landﬁll per £million of revenue has 
been surpassed during the ﬁrst year of the target period, the target 
has been adjusted upwards for the second year (see page 58). 
Our business units will continue to increase the proportion of 
total waste that is recycled, and reduction targets for waste to 
landﬁll will help in achieving this.

Product integrity
How does “product integrity” underpin 
our strategy?
At Wolseley, product integrity means ensuring that we source and 
supply safe products that are of suitable quality as efﬁciently as 
possible. In doing so we aim to improve our margins, avoid liability 
arising from defective products and maintain or grow market share 
through enhanced customer satisfaction and conﬁdence.
What are the risks and how are we 
managing them?
Product-related litigation is recognised as one of our signiﬁcant 
risks. For more detail on how we are managing the risk, please see 
page 45.
What does “product integrity” entail?
Product integrity includes:
 ensuring that our products are reliable, robust and safe 
when used for their intended purpose; 
 understanding our business partners, the quality of their 
systems and how they conduct their business and provide 
their services; and
 ensuring compliance with legal standards.
What did we achieve in 2012/13?
Business units continued to implement more 
structured procedures for the evaluation of suppliers 
and products.
Our businesses have reviewed the level of risk associated with 
their products. Further risk assessments will be completed during 
the ﬁrst quarter of 2013/14, after which we will engage with all 
suppliers linked to high-risk products to ensure that our required 
controls are in place.
We have evaluated our procedures with suppliers to understand 
where we need greater clarity in our contracts or assurance 
regarding ethical practices or ﬁnancial health. We have continued 
to promote systems through which suppliers can provide us with 
this type of information quickly and consistently, and these have 
been introduced in some businesses. This activity will continue 
through the next ﬁnancial year.
Lean and green – USA
The US business recognises that moving towards more 
environmentally sustainable business practices makes 
good sense. Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to 
reduce the volume of waste sent to landﬁll, by improving 
the collection of recyclable waste, and by using plastic 
containers and pallets. 
Every distribution centre (“DC”) in the US business has its own 
baler, making it possible to compact its own cardboard and 
plastic. The DCs also backhaul cardboard and plastic from 
the branch network. This recyclable waste is then sold for the 
manufacture of items such as paper, new boxes and packing 
materials. As well as meeting its environmental objectives, 
the business also saves money, especially on waste disposal 
fees. The DCs have almost eliminated the need for cardboard 
pallet-sized boxes to ship smaller materials to the branches by 
investing in re-usable plastic shipping totes and plastic pallets. 
The US backhaul recyclable waste from branches to the distribution centres, 
reducing the volume of waste sent to landﬁll.
3. Water use
The majority of the Group’s water consumption is related to 
normal operational and sanitary use. Although water consumption 
is not as material a factor in our operations as it would be for a 
manufacturer, we have continued to measure water consumption 
throughout the Group in an effort to identify opportunities to 
increase our water efﬁciency. Some of our local businesses have 
targets in place for reduced water consumption but targets are 
not required for all businesses and a Group-level target has not 
been set.
This year our absolute water use decreased by 6.5 per cent 
and the average water consumption per employee improved 
by 3 per cent. Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 61
Performance
We continued to strengthen our timber sourcing 
policies and procedures.
In March 2013, the EU Timber Regulation came into effect. 
The regulation introduces obligations for conﬁrming the integrity 
and source of products on the operator and/or importer of the 
timber products. Operators must implement a due diligence 
process which enables them to trace timber products and 
to conﬁrm their legality at the place of harvest. Wolseley has 
assessed its timber products for a number of years and, where 
appropriate, works with specialist business partners to ensure 
the systems we have in place meet the requirements of the 
regulations and our sourcing policies.
What are our objectives, how did we perform in 2012/13 
and what are our objectives for 2013/14?

Sustainable construction
How does engagement in the “sustainable 
construction” supply chain underpin 
our strategy?
The requirement for sustainable construction is growing at differing 
rates in our markets and, where the market opportunity exists, 
we can gain market share by stocking sustainable construction 
products and by offering training and advice to our traditional 
customer base.
What are the risks and how are we 
managing them?
Suppressed market conditions and pressure on margins are two 
of the Group’s most signiﬁcant risks. Sustainable construction 
products open up new market opportunities to mitigate 
these risks.
What does engagement in the “sustainable 
construction” supply chain entail?
Wolseley supports the distribution and promotion of sustainable 
construction products in line with the local market opportunity. 
Each market is at a different level of maturity and therefore the  
level of engagement with this new market opportunity also differs 
by market. 
Sustainable construction products can include products that:
 improve the thermal efﬁciency of a building (i.e. insulation products, 
draught-prooﬁng); or
 increase the efﬁciency of a building’s systems (i.e. heating controls, 
energy-efﬁcient lighting, water-efﬁcient showers); or
 generate clean energy (i.e. solar thermal or ground-source 
heat pumps).
The sustainability of a product also refers to its impact over its  
life cycle and takes into account the scarcity of the materials that 
go into its fabrication.
What did we achieve in 2012/13?
We worked to engage our customers in 
sustainable construction.
We recognise the need for traditional plumbing and heating 
engineers to be familiar with new renewable products and 
solutions, and have developed facilities that allow customers 
to experience the products ﬁrst hand. Training is a key element 
of the customer proposition in this sector, with some Wolseley 
businesses developing comprehensive training courses and 
opening training centres to encourage the industry to adopt 
sustainable products. We publish tailored sustainable-product 
guides in a number of markets to assist customers in identifying 
better products. For example, Beijer, in Sweden, has developed 
a product label called “Green Choice” which helps its customers 
to select products that enable improved energy-efﬁciency and 
reduced carbon emissions. Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 62
Corporate responsibility continued
We became a Green Deal Provider in the UK.
Plumb Center in the UK has received authorisation from the 
Green Deal Oversight and Registration Body to act as a Green 
Deal Provider. Green Deal Provider status provides Plumb Center 
customers the opportunity to access Green Deal funding on behalf 
of the end consumer.
Under the Green Deal households are able to beneﬁt from energy 
efﬁciency improvements, such as heating controls, condensing 
boilers and various types of insulation, with little or no up-front 
cost. Instead, the Green Deal provides a “pay as you save” 
ﬁnancing mechanism, enabling consumers to take out a loan for 
the improvements and pay the cost back in instalments through 
future electricity bills. The repayments are calculated to be, on 
average, no more than the corresponding savings made on 
energy bills.
Plumb Center believes that a heating installer is ideally placed to 
become both a Green Deal Installer and a Green Deal Adviser. 
Plumb Center’s dedicated Green Deal website, www.gogreendeal.
co.uk, provides information for anyone wishing to become 
accredited for either, or both, roles under Green Deal.
We signed up to a charter to support future sustainable 
development – Nordic region.
Stark in Denmark joined with a number of Nordic companies 
in signing the Nordic Built Charter. Nordic Built is an initiative to 
accelerate the development of sustainable building concepts, 
initiated by the Nordic ministers for trade and industry. The Charter 
is a public declaration of the values, intentions and ambitions of 
a united Nordic building sector. It describes a holistic approach 
to the built environment – taking energy, climate, economy and 
people into account and all businesses that sign up to it commit 
to ten principles. Essentially, the Nordic Built Charter gives a 
fragmented sector a platform for cooperation and provides a 
common set of fundamentally sustainable values.
What are our objectives, how did we perform 
in 2012/13 and what are our targets for 
2013/14?
The objective remains for our businesses to continue to provide 
access to sustainable products and training, in line with local 
market opportunity. No prescriptive actions or targets have been 
set in this area at a Group level due to varying levels of market 
development and differing business strategies. 
Business units will continue to share expertise and best 
practice across the Group to facilitate market entry or increased 
market share.
Delivering affordable warmth 
in the UK
The UK business is helping to deliver the Energy 
Company Obligation (“ECO”), a government scheme 
which requires energy companies to fund the installation 
of energy efﬁciency measures in homes throughout 
the UK. 
The ECO gives vulnerable people and those on lower incomes 
access to free energy-efﬁcient products and systems for their 
homes. This reduces energy loss from buildings (supporting 
government carbon reduction targets) and lowers the home 
owners’ energy bills – a win-win situation. 
Designed to work alongside the Green Deal, the Department 
of Energy and Climate Change estimates that the ECO will see 
280,000 additional heating systems installed across the UK by 
the end of March 2015.
The UK business is helping heating engineers to beneﬁt from 
the new business opportunities generated by the ECO scheme 
by giving them the training and tools required to carry out Green 
Deal assessments, supplying the comprehensive package 
of products required and facilitating access to ECO ﬁnance. 
The UK business provides training and tools to customers, equipping the customers 
to bid for new business through government-led energy-efﬁciency schemes. Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 63
Performance
Community engagement
How does “community engagement” underpin 
our strategy?
By engaging with the communities in which we operate we 
promote our business, attract high quality recruits and gain a 
greater understanding of our customers, vendors and employees. 
Community or charitable events serve to enhance employee skills 
and increase employee engagement.
What does “community engagement” entail?
Our businesses seek to be contributing members to the 
communities in which they operate. The Group also supports a 
number of charitable organisations both at a Group and a business 
unit level. Our principal areas for charitable support continue to 
be the alleviation of homelessness, the provision of training for 
the homeless or marginalised in order to allow them to return to 
work, and the improvement of the quality of the built environment. 
Our businesses have also supported numerous other charitable 
causes, including support for neglected and vulnerable children 
and provision of care for sufferers of cancer or other illnesses.
Who is responsible?
Community engagement is, by its very nature, a local activity and 
our corporate head ofﬁces and individual businesses manage 
their own activities in this area to suit their own preferences 
and locations. We encourage all of our employees to engage in 
charitable or community activities outside the workplace and 
we recognise the value that this brings to communities and the 
personal reward and new skills it can bring to our employees.
What did we achieve in 2012/13?
Our employees engaged in a great number of 
community and charity events. 
For examples of the events and schemes our employees and 
businesses have supported over the last year visit the Wolseley 
plc website www.wolseley.com. Through the Company’s 
charitable trust, we continued to support a number of 
organisations, in particular the Prince’s Foundation for Building 
Community. The Company is a member of its Corporate 
Partnerships Programme.
“60 Days of Caring” – USA

Governance: Chairman’s letter
Dear Shareholder
This section of our report outlines 
how the Board ensures that high 
standards of corporate governance 
are maintained. At Wolseley, we are 
committed to fostering an effective 
governance framework that supports 
the Company’s core values and 
which underpins our ability to set 
the overall strategic direction of the 
Wolseley Group.
Your Board
Your Board provides strong leadership 
to the Company and continues to have 
effective and constructive relationships 
with both the management team and 
shareholders. The relationships within 
the Board have continued to develop 
well this ﬁnancial year. We have a strong 
culture of open debate where all Directors 
are actively encouraged to challenge 
existing assumptions and to raise 
difﬁcult questions.
The Non Executive Directors continue to 
be independent and objective, and to play 
an essential role in the composition of 
the Board due to the skills and expertise 
they bring.
Our annual Board effectiveness review 
assists us in highlighting areas in which 
improvements can be made. This year, the 
review was conducted internally and the 
outcome of this review and our progress 
against the areas identiﬁed for improvement 
in last year’s externally-facilitated review are 
provided on page 75.
Board appointments and 
succession
In January 2013, Pilar López and Alan 
Murray joined as Non Executive Directors, 
broadening the scope of the skills and 
experience on the Board. Pilar and Alan are 
a welcome addition to the Board and have 
made valuable contributions since joining. 
Biographical details for Pilar and Alan can 
be found on page 66.
On 25 July 2013, we announced that 
Andrew Duff would be stepping down from 
the Board on 26 November 2013 after nine 
years of service to Wolseley. As part of a 
phased handover of responsibilities, Alan 
Murray succeeded Andrew as Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee on 1 August 
2013 and as Senior Independent Director 
on 1 October 2013. We are fortunate 
to have a Non Executive Director of the 
calibre of Alan Murray to assume those 
roles. I would like to thank Andrew for his 
outstanding contributions to Wolseley and 
wish him the very best for his future.
Diversity
In last year’s report, I outlined our intention 
to improve on workforce diversity at all 
levels and to redesign our senior leadership 
development programmes. I am pleased 
to report that we have taken steps towards 
achieving these goals. Further details of 
how we have done this are provided on 
pages 52 and 83. We are supportive of the 
voluntary approach as an effective way to 
encourage companies to improve gender 
diversity in boardrooms; I am pleased to 
be able to remind you that of our last ﬁve 
Non Executive Director appointments, 
three have been women. As at the date 
of this report we have two women on the 
Board, Tessa Bamford and Pilar López, 
and we remain conﬁdent that by 2015 
the diversity of the Board will meet the 
recommendations set in Lord Davies’ 
report, “Women on Boards”.
Early adoption of new 
reporting requirements
Following the publication of the new 
edition of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”) in September 2012 
and the regulations published by the 
Department for Business, Innovation and 
Skills concerning narrative and directors’ 
remuneration reporting which come into 
force for companies with ﬁnancial years 
ending on or after 30 September 2013, as a 
matter of good governance the Board has 
taken the opportunity to implement certain 
changes earlier than required. Details of 
this and other areas where requirements 
have been adopted early are provided on 
page 70. We expect to meet all of these 
disclosure requirements in the 2013/14 
Annual Report and Accounts.
Next year
During the next ﬁnancial year, we shall 
implement the remaining new reporting 
requirements and continue to maintain 
our strategic focus on driving the evolution 
of Group business models, develop our 
recruitment and succession planning 
processes and prioritise workforce diversity 
at all levels of the organisation.

Governance
Corporate and governance structure of the Group
Where does Wolseley plc carry on business 
and which rules apply to it?
Wolseley plc is a public company limited by shares and 
incorporated in Jersey with registered number 106605. It is tax 
resident in Switzerland. The Company has a premium listing on 
the London Stock Exchange, and is therefore subject to the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The Company complies with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and relevant 
institutional shareholder guidelines.
Although the Company (being Jersey incorporated) is not subject 
to the UK Companies Act, the Board retains its standards of 
governance and corporate responsibility as if it were subject to 
the Act. It continues to provide shareholder safeguards which are 
similar to those that apply to a UK registered company.
Under Wolseley plc, the Wolseley Group carries on its businesses 
in 11 countries through a number of operating companies. 
The Group is made up of six geographic regions: USA, Canada, 
UK, France, Nordics and Central Europe. They are led by ﬁve 
Chief Executives and, in the case of Canada, by John Martin, the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, all of whom report directly to Ian Meakins. 
With the exception of the Chief Executive of Central Europe, they 
are all Executive Committee Members.

Governance
Leadership 
 
 
 
Who is on the Board? 
As at 31 July 2013, the Board was made up of 10 members 
consisting of the Chairman, three Executive Directors and six 
Non Executive Directors. Biographical details for each of the 
Directors in office as at 31 July 2013 are shown on pages 66 
and 67.  
The Non Executive Directors and the Chairman are each 
considered by the Board to be independent and free of any 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgement.  
Provision B.1.1. of the Code requires the Board to consider, 
where a Director has served for a period of more than nine years, 
whether that Director continues to be independent. As at 1 July 
2013, Andrew Duff had served nine years on the Board. To facilitate 
a smooth handover of both Chairman of Remuneration Committee 
and Senior Independent Director responsibilities it was agreed that 
Mr Duff should remain a member of the Board and the Committees 
until the end of the 2013 AGM. The Board believes this approach 
allows the Company to benefit from Mr Duff’s extensive skills and 
experience whilst ensuring his continued independence. 
When and where does the Board meet? 
The Board met regularly during the year, with Board and Committee 
meetings scheduled over two or three day periods. There were six 
scheduled meetings and details of attendance are shown in the 
table below. 
Members and attendance (eligibility) at meetings held during the 
year ended 31 July 2013:

2 Alan Murray was appointed as a Non Executive Director on 1 January 2013. 
In addition to the scheduled meetings, one unscheduled meeting 
was convened at short notice to deal with matters that needed 
to be considered before the next scheduled meeting. All Directors 
were given notice of the meeting and some of them were unable to 
attend due to prior commitments which could not be rearranged. 
The meeting was attended by Ms Bamford and Messrs Davis, 
Martin, Meakins, Roach and Wareing.  
The Company is registered in Jersey and is tax resident in 
Switzerland. During the year all meetings of the Board, 
Committees of the Board and all other meetings requiring 
decisions of a strategic or substantive nature were held outside 
the United Kingdom. 
In order to provide the Board with greater visibility of the Group’s 
operations and to provide further opportunities to meet senior 
management, the Board intends to visit at least one of the Group’s 
business unit locations each year. Such visits allow the Board to 
gain a deeper understanding of local market dynamics and assess 
management performance and potential. In addition, members of 
the Board periodically visit business units and meet management 
around the Group.  
Who attends Board meetings? 
Each Director is required to attend all meetings of the Board and 
Committees of which they are a member. In addition, senior 
management from across the Group, and advisers, attend some of 
the meetings for the discussion of specific items in greater depth. 
It is important to the Board that it meets members of senior 
management from around the Group’s businesses, as it 
further enhances the Board’s understanding of operations, 
the implementation of strategy and the changing dynamics 
of the markets in which the business units operate. 
How does the Board operate and how are 
decisions made? 
Certain strategic decision-making powers and authorities of the 
Company are reserved as matters for the Board. The formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its decision was updated during 
the year to incorporate provisions relating to remuneration, risk 
management and review of performance, and to incorporate 
changes under Part C of the Code.  
The principal matters reserved for the Board are set out in the table 
on page 72. Day-to-day operational decisions are managed by the 
Executive Committee, led by Ian Meakins. 
Where appropriate, matters are delegated to a Committee which 
will consider them in accordance with its terms of reference. 
Details of each Committee’s terms of reference are available 
to view on the Wolseley plc website www.wolseley.com.

Governance
 
 
 
Having identified the areas which the Board focused on during the year, set out below are some highlights of its activities which provide an 
indication of the nature of the Board’s work. 
Strategy 
Throughout the year, the Board considered the development of 
the Company’s strategy and evolution of its business models. 
In addition, a full strategy review was undertaken through a 
dedicated Board Strategy Day in May 2013. Management 
from all regions presented their proposals for the strategic 
development of their businesses and there was detailed analysis 
of some specific future initiatives. More information on our 
strategy can be found on pages 12 to 15. 
 
Operations 
At least once in each year, the Board reviews in detail the 
operational performance of each region. Best practice that 
was developed and shared amongst the businesses was 
regularly presented by the Chief Executive and discussed by 
the Board. Items covered during the year included customer 
service and e-commerce. All information was readily available 
to senior managers across the Group through a centrally 
maintained portal. 
 
 
 
People 
There was continued focus on the composition and succession 
of the Board, Executive Committee and senior management 
team. In March 2013, as part of its regular talent and succession 
review process and with the assistance of the Group HR Director, 
the Board conducted a detailed review of members of the 
Group’s senior leadership team and their successors. The Board 
believes the talent and succession planning processes to be of 
a high standard. 
 
Finance 
The Board regularly monitored the Group’s financial performance. 
A monthly performance pack was provided to the Board by the 
Chief Financial Officer which includes an overview of the Group 
and business unit performance, market trends, competitor 
activity and shareholder matters. This was discussed at every 
Board meeting. All financial statements to be released to the 
market were discussed and reviewed. The 2013/14 budget 
was reviewed and approved at the July 2013 meeting. 
 
Board visit to the US 
Members of the Board visit the Group’s geographic 
operations on an ongoing basis and, in July 2013, the 
Board and Committee meetings were held in New York. 
This provided an opportunity for executives from our 
businesses in the United States to meet the Board and 
discuss the business strategy and operational performance 
of those businesses in the United States in more detail.  
During the visit, the Board was given a tour of the head office 
and principal warehouse facility of the Davis & Warshow 
business, acquired by the Group in October 2012. The Board 
met with a range of senior executives as well as branch-based 
employees, received an in-depth presentation of the 
performance of the Davis & Warshow business and 
discussed strategic development opportunities. 
 
What are the Board’s priorities for 2013/14? 
The Board’s priorities for the year will focus on ensuring effective 
execution of existing strategic plans. 
2013/14 objectives 
Strategy Regularly review and monitor the Group’s progress 
against its strategic objectives. These include the 
further refinement of business models and improving 
the productivity of its existing operations, 
accelerating profitable growth through organic 
expansion and selective acquisitions where 
opportunities would provide strong synergies. 
Annual strategy review. 
People Regular review to include maintaining the 
appropriate balance and depth of skills and 
experience of the Board, succession planning 
of the Board, the Executive Committees and 
leadership teams in all regions and to continue 
making progress in improving workforce diversity. 
Why should you vote to re-elect your Board? 
The Board contains a broad range of experience and skills from 
a variety of industries and advisory roles, which fully complement 
each other and have been strengthened through further 
appointments in January 2013.  
In accordance with Provision B.7.1. of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, with the exception of Andrew Duff, all Directors 
will stand for re-election at the 2013 Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”). Full biographies for the Directors can be found on pages 
66 and 67 and in the Notice of AGM. As Andrew Duff will be 
standing down from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM, 
he wil  not be putting himself forward for re-election.  Wolseley plc

Effectiveness 
 
 
How do we maintain an effective Board? 
Board relationships 
The effective working of the Board is crucial to the long-term 
prospects and strategic aims of the Company. This is achieved 
through strong and open working relationships between the 
Directors and, in particular, the Chairman, Group Chief Executive 
and Senior Independent Director, whose roles are agreed and 
set out in writing. A short summary of their roles and division of 
responsibilities is set out below. 
Roles and division of responsibilities 
Chairman 
 Responsible for overall leadership and governance of the Board 
(including induction, development and performance evaluation) 
 Ensures that the Directors have an understanding of the views 
of the Company’s major shareholders

and Committee meetings 
Group Chief Executive 
 Responsible for the effective leadership of the Company 
 Strong and focused management and development of the 
Group’s operations

 Developing and implementing policies integral to improving 
the business, including in relation to Health and Safety and

 A sounding board for the Chairman and an intermediary for the

 Conducts consultations with shareholders on remuneration 
matters 
The Chairman regularly discusses the way the Board functions, and 
broad governance matters, with the Senior Independent Director 
and the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel. The 
Senior Independent Director separately held informal discussions 
with the Non Executive Directors, with and without the presence of 
the Chairman. In his capacity as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee he has also led extensive consultations with 
shareholders on remuneration matters. 
There was detailed planning throughout the year, with the 
assistance of the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel, 
to consider and review the Board’s 12-month rolling agenda 
programme. This ensured that all matters reserved for the Board 
and other strategic issues were discussed at the appropriate time. 
Board support 
The Board and its Committees are provided with sufficient 
resources to undertake their duties. The Group Company Secretary 
and General Counsel, Richard Shoylekov, was Secretary to the 
Board and its Committees during the year. Prior to each set of 
meetings he ensured that the papers and other information were 
delivered sufficiently in advance of the meeting date so that all 
Directors were provided with necessary time and resources to fulfil 
their duties. This information is published in advance via a secure 
web portal, allowing remote access by Directors using an iPad. 
As well as meeting support, the Company Secretariat department 
and other Group functions provided the Directors with induction 
briefings and visits to key businesses, training and updates on 
the business. 
In addition to receiving regular briefings throughout the year on 
consultations, governance, legal and regulatory matters, all 
Directors have access to a reading room through the iPad portal 
which provides access to a library of relevant information about the 
Company, the Group and Board procedures.  
The Board has an established procedure for Directors, if necessary, 
to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense 
in furtherance of their duties. This is in addition to the direct access 
that every Director has to the Group Company Secretary and 
General Counsel for his advice and services. 
Refreshment and development of the Board 
As noted on page 64, Pilar López and Alan Murray were appointed 
as Non Executive Directors during the year. As new Directors, they 
were provided with a comprehensive induction programme, which 
is standard for all new Directors, details of which are summarised 
on page 75.  
All Directors are provided opportunities for further development and 
training following their induction and, during the year, the Chairman 
discusses a development plan with each Director. In addition to the 
regular updates on governance, legal and regulatory matters, the 
Board also receives detailed briefings from advisers on a variety of 
topics that are relevant to the Group and its strategy. The annual 
formal review of governance provides the Directors with an 
opportunity to assess their effectiveness and that of the Board 
as a whole.

Induction programme 
The Company’s induction programme for new Directors was 
improved during the year to reflect what was regarded as best 
practice. The new Non Executive Directors, Pilar López and 
Alan Murray, were provided with an induction programme 
aimed at ensuring they developed an understanding and 
awareness of our businesses, people and processes. 
The programme included: 
 Provision of relevant current and historical information 
about the Company and the Group 
 Specific details about the duties of Directors and the 
Company’s rules of residence (in light of its registration 
in Jersey and tax residence in Switzerland) 
 Meetings with major shareholders and advisers 
 Visits to operations around the Group  
 One-to-one meetings with members of the Executive 
Committee and other senior executives in the businesses 
and in corporate functions 
How is the performance of the Board and the Directors evaluated? 
The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance and that of its Committees each year, with an external evaluation every three 
years. The external evaluation in 2012, undertaken by Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review, identified a number of areas for improvement. 
During the year the Board reviewed its progress. A summary of how the action points have been addressed is provided below: 
Action point Responsibility Outcome 
Greater focus on competitive 
benchmarking, monitoring customer 
trends and strengthening supply chain. 
Board Regular updates were provided to the Board concerning the 
performance of competitors and trends in customer preferences 
when this information became available. There were further in-depth 
reviews of the Group’s development of its business models. 
Enhance Board oversight of risk through 
review of improved management 
coordination of Internal Audit, internal 
controls and risk management activities. 
All Directors to participate in Audit 
Committee meetings where risk is 
discussed. 
Board, Audit Committee 
and Internal Audit 
Improvements were made to the management and review of risk 
through the Internal Audit, internal controls and risk functions. 
All Directors attended Audit Committee meetings where 
management of the Group’s risks was reviewed. In addition to 
the regular Audit Committee review of the effectiveness of the 
risk management programme, the Board will discuss the main 
risks in the context of the overall strategy and the extent to which 
those risks are acceptable. 
Further improvement of the talent 
development process in addition to the 
scheduled six-monthly review. 
HR Reviews have been undertaken to identify and develop high-
performing, high-potential people both in operational business roles 
and central functions. Good progress has been made in developing 
long-term succession plans and to encourage diversity at graduate 
recruitment, middle management and senior management levels. 
Address future gaps in the composition 
of the Board. 
Board and Nominations 
Committee 
Two new Non Executive Directors were appointed in January 2013. 
The selection process in place ensured that we appointed the best 
individuals who would bring diverse backgrounds and an 
appropriate level of experience to each role.  
Maximise the use of the Board’s time 
together, with more management briefings 
and site visits. 
Chairman and Group 
Company Secretary 
and General Counsel 
Detailed reviews of business performance, with senior management 
from the operating companies, coupled with site visits by Directors, 
both individually and collectively, maximised the used of the Board’s 
time together and further strengthened the Board’s knowledge of 
the Group. 
“The meetings with the advisers were 
very useful. The tour of the Pipe and 
Drain Center branches was a great way 
to get to know the UK business, what 
our people do and how they feel, how 
the business makes money, what our 
customers look like and what they want. 
Finally, the meeting with the UK 
management team and the visit to the 
National Distribution Centre was a good 
wrap up to put everything into context.”
Pilar López Non Executive Director Wolseley plc

Effectiveness continued 
How did we review effectiveness this year? 
This year, the Board effectiveness review was facilitated internally 
using sets of questions adapted to address the activities and 
concerns of the Board, the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nominations Committee. An online survey 
format was used, including questions from previous years (in order 
to be able to compare responses and monitor progress) as well 
as new questions reflecting current priorities and concerns. They 
encouraged comment and qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness 
of the Board and each Committee, the individual members and the 
support received from management and from advisers. The results 
of the surveys formed the basis of discussion of areas for further 
improvement by the Board and the Committees. Each of the 
Directors continues to be considered by the Board to be effective 
and to demonstrate commitment to his or her role.  
Also during the year, the Non Executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, evaluated the performance of the Chairman, 
taking into account the views of the Executive Directors. Following 
the evaluation, the Board concluded that Gareth Davis should be 
reappointed as Chairman for a further three year period. 
What were the key findings and improvement actions? 
The Board effectiveness review concluded that the Board had 
strong and open dynamics with a good balance of skills. The 
standard of planning and support for the Board were considered 
to be of a high quality; a good succession planning process was 
considered to be in place. No critical issues were identified but 
the review did identify areas for further improvement which are 
summarised below. 
As at the date of this report, the Board has already begun to 
incorporate a number of these action points into its processes 
and procedures. 
Action  Responsibility 
Continued focus on measuring the 
performance of the Company against its 
own targets as well as the performance of 
competitors.   
Board 
Enhance Board oversight of the Group’s 
growth opportunities through more regular 
and detailed evaluation of projects.  
Board 
When appointments are next made to the 
Board, consider further expanding the range 
of skills and experience to reflect the Group’s 
strategic objectives.  
Board and 
Nominations 
Committee 
Time commitment 
All Directors are aware, from the time of appointment, of the need 
to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively. The Board continually monitors potential 
conflicts of interest, as detailed on page 85. 
External appointments 
The Board believes that there are significant benefits for both the 
Board and the individual if an Executive Director holds an external 
non executive directorship on the board of a non-competitor 
company. Ian Meakins continues to hold his non executive position 
at Centrica plc; details of payments received in respect of this 
appointment are set out on page 104. No other Executive Directors 
hold any external appointments. 
Accountability 
The Board is committed to presenting a clear assessment of 
the Company’s position and prospects through the information 
provided in this report, through interim financial statements 
and other reports as required.  
How does the Board approach risk management? 
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives and for maintaining sound risk management and internal 
control systems. The effectiveness of these systems is also 
reviewed through the work of the Audit Committee.  
There is a Group-wide standard framework in place which supports 
the Group’s risk management programme and allows the Board to 
assess and manage risk through its strategic planning and 
performance monitoring processes. 
The key risks which the Board has focused on this year are set out 
in the Risk management and internal control section of this report 
on pages 42 to 47. 
Remuneration 
Further details relating to the level and components of remuneration 
together with the Company policies on such matters are provided 
in the Remuneration report on pages 89 to 104.

Relations with shareholders 
 
 
Communication with shareholders 
We are fully committed to engaging with all shareholders, including 
employee shareholders, and this is reflected in our annual investor 
relations and communications programmes. In our interactions 
with shareholders, we ensure that we act professionally, provide 
accurate data, are timely with our disclosure of information to the 
market and are at all times accessible. 
Our Group Director of Communications and Investor Relations 
is the senior executive who has day-to-day responsibility for all 
investor relations matters and for contact with shareholders 
(institutional and private), as well as with financial analysts and 
the media. He reports to the Chief Financial Officer and Group 
Chief Executive. 
All investor communication is governed by written guidelines to 
ensure the appropriate governance of the processes for engaging 
with shareholders and financial analysts is maintained. In addition, 
these guidelines govern the prompt disclosure of inside information 
which could affect the Company’s share price. 
Who are our major shareholders? 
As at 31 July 2013 and as at the date of this report, the Company 
had received notification of the following material shareholdings 
pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK 
Listing Authority.

How do we engage with our shareholders? 
During the year, an extensive communications programme was 
followed. We maintained regular dialogue with institutional 
shareholders and financial analysts. Many of these meetings 
and conversations closely involved the Group Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer. We released quarterly updates of 
the financial performance of the Group incorporating revenue, 
profitability by region, net debt and appropriate commentary 
on key business trends. The Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee also engaged with major shareholders in relation 
to executive remuneration. 
As our shareholder base is mainly institutional, it is difficult to 
engage with all of our private shareholders using the same direct 
engagement model. We hold periodic meetings with the UK 
Shareholders Association and respond to all communications 
from individual shareholders. In an effort to ensure that all 
shareholders have equal access to information we make 
all documents presented at investor events available on the 
Wolseley plc website. There is also a shareholder information 
section on the Wolseley plc website www.wolseley.com and 
at the end of this report on pages 170 to 172.

Relations with shareholders continued 
Who did we meet during the year? 
We are keen to maintain an open dialogue with all of our 
shareholders and have a well developed investor relations 
programme. The allocation of time spent in the UK, continental 
Europe and North America reflects the distribution of our 
shareholders as highlighted on page 77. 
During the year ended 31 July 2013, there were a total of 245 
meetings. Ian Meakins and John Martin (together with the Group 
Director of Communications and Investor Relations) attended 
116 meetings. Frank Roach and the Chief Financial Officer, USA 
attended 10 meetings. In addition, the investor relations function 
met with institutions through a further 119 meetings, conferences 
and site visits. 
The Chairman often meets with the larger institutional shareholders 
and attended Full Year and Half Year results presentations. He also 
ensures that the Board as a whole maintains an appropriate 
dialogue with shareholders. The Non Executive Directors also 
attend presentations of the Full Year and Half Year results when 
possible. The Group Director of Communications and Investor 
Relations regularly provides the Board with details of feedback 
received from institutional shareholders and any key issues raised. 
Investors’ Day – Virginia 
On 23 October 2012, the Company held an Investors’ Day 
in the USA which was attended by over fifty institutional 
investors and financial analysts.  
The meeting was webcast on the Wolseley plc website. 
The event included management presentations, a site visit 
to a large branch in Chantilly, Virginia and a tour of our 
Distribution Centre in Front Royal, Virginia.  
 
 
What are our plans for engagement in 
2013/14? 
A similar Investor Relations programme will be run during the 
financial year. In addition, the Investor Relations team will be 
meeting with members of the UK Private Shareholders Association 
prior to the AGM in November 2013. 
2012 AGM 
The 2012 AGM was held on 29 November 2012 at Parkhotel in 
Zug, Switzerland with an audio-visual link to Deutsche Bank, 
London, UK. The link allowed shareholders in London to see and 
hear proceedings, and provided the opportunity to put questions 
directly to the Board about the business of the meeting and about 
the Company. The Board as a whole is committed to the 
constructive use of the AGM as a way to meet with shareholders, 
hear their views and answer their questions. All Directors attended 
and answered a wide range of questions from shareholders. 
2013 AGM 
The 2013 AGM will be held on 26 November 2013 at Parkhotel, 
Industriestrasse 14, CH-6304, Zug, Switzerland at 1.00pm 
Swiss time. An audio-visual link to the meeting is proposed to 
be available at the offices of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP,

The Board considers that the Chairman and each member of the Committee 
has relevant financial experience and is independent within the definition set out 
in the Code. 
2 Pilar López was appointed as a Non Executive Director on 1 January 2013. 
3 Alan Murray was appointed as a Non Executive Director on 1 January 2013. 
Set out below is the report of the Audit Committee for the 
financial year ended 31 July 2013. 
Dear Shareholder 
It has been yet another busy year for the Audit Committee and 
much has been reviewed and reported from across the Group. 
We have kept abreast of the ongoing consultations on audit reform 
and we have detailed our thoughts on page 81. We have also 
considered the changes provided in the new edition of the Code 
in September 2012 and the regulations published by the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills relating to narrative 
reporting. As outlined on page 70, we have taken the opportunity 
to implement certain changes to our reporting earlier than required 
by the Code and the regulations. 
Each member of the Committee brings relevant skills and 
experience at a senior executive level and the appointment of Pilar 
López and Alan Murray broadens the scope of expertise of the 
Committee. In addition, I was International Chief Executive of KPMG 
until I retired in September 2009 and I currently chair the Audit 
Committee of two other FTSE 350 companies. This provides the 
Board with further assurance that the Audit Committee meets the 
Code requirements that at least one member of the Committee 
has significant, recent and relevant financial experience. The key 
strengths and experience of each member of the Committee are 
summarised on pages 66 and 67.  
At the 2013 AGM, I shall be available to respond to any questions 
shareholders may raise on this report or any of the Committee’s 
activities. 
Other attendees 
In addition to the members of the Committee, the Chairman, the 
Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group 
Financial Controller, the Head of Internal Audit and the Group 
Company Secretary and General Counsel, together with senior 
representatives of the Company’s external auditors, attended and 
received papers for each meeting. Other senior executives were 
also invited to certain meetings to present and discuss specific 
items. The Committee periodically meets separately with the 
Head of Internal Audit and the external auditors without the 
presence of executive management and also separately with 
the Chief Financial Officer. 
What has the Committee done during 
the year? 
An overview of the Committee’s 2012/13 objectives and how the 
Committee has achieved these objectives is set out below:  
2012/13 objectives Progress 
Continue to improve the 
Committee’s total assurance 
efforts in relation to the Group’s 
key risks and controls, including 
Internal Audit, External Audit and 
internal controls, the Advanced 
Control Environment (“ACE”). 
The efforts were monitored 
throughout the year, with reports 
to the Committee from Internal 
Audit, External Audit and ACE. 
The programmes for each area 
of assurance, and their 
effectiveness, were also carried 
out during the year. 
Continued vigilance over the 
effects of the economic 
downturn on the Group and on 
its financial position. 
In March and September each 
year, the Audit Committee 
reviews key risks and controls 
(including the impact of market 
conditions) and how they have 
been managed in practice. 
Prepare for the implementation 
of the final requirements arising 
from the current FRC and EU 
debate on audit rotation and 
other audit governance matters, 
once these are known. 
We have monitored this debate 
and our thoughts are detailed 
on page 81. 
The annual review of the effectiveness of the Committee was 
carried out in May 2013. The review concluded that the Committee 
meetings followed a balanced and broad programme; the 
information provided was good quality and timely; the work of the 
external auditor was well scrutinised and that there was good 
collaboration between internal and external auditors. The report also 
highlighted areas for improvement and we have incorporated these 
into our priorities for 2013/14 as set out on page 82.

Financial reporting and significant 
financial judgements 
The Committee reviews whether suitable accounting policies have 
been adopted and whether management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements and seeks support from the external 
auditors to assess them. As part of the review process, the 
Committee has discussions with management and makes its 
assessment in accordance with accounting guidelines. The main 
issues reviewed in the year ended 31 July 2013 and how these 
issues were addressed are summarised below: 
 The Committee considered the accounting treatment of branch 
disposals, closure costs and significant restructuring costs of the 
French businesses during the year. The Committee addressed 
this issue through a range of reporting outlining the commercial 
agreements and actions undertaken including the 
appropriateness of any provisions required. The Committee 
concluded that the classification and valuation of assets held for 
sale and the period in which the restructuring costs were 
recognised was appropriate.  
 The Committee reviewed the impairment analysis of goodwill 
and other intangible assets. The Committee considered and 
reviewed the assumptions used in the impairment calculations 
including the achievability of the long-term business plan, 
applicable market conditions, long-term growth rates and 
discount rates and concluded they were reasonable. The 
Committee received and considered detailed feedback from 
the external auditors covering this issue.  
 The Committee reviewed the recognition of supplier rebate 
income which is an area of inherent risk due to the number and 
complexity of supplier rebate arrangements and the majority of 
the arrangements being on a calendar year basis. The Committee 
concluded the level of supplier rebate income and rebate 
receivable as at 31 July 2013 to be appropriate. 
 The Committee considered the provisions held and settlements 
made in relation to litigation disputes, potential product liability, 
environmental claims and indemnities provided on business 
disposals. The Committee addressed this issue by assessing 
managements’ reports and the extent to which they have taken 
professional advice on these matters. The Committee agreed 
with the position taken by management in respect of these 
matters. 
At the request of the Board, we considered whether the 2012/13 
Annual Report and Accounts was fair, balanced and understandable 
and whether it provided the necessary information for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and 
strategy. We were satisfied that, taken as a whole, the 2012/13 
Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable. 
External audit 
External audit processes 
During the year, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) undertook 
external audit and certain non-audit work. The Group Audit Partner, 
Stuart Watson, together with Neil Grimes of the PwC audit team, 
attended as representatives of the external auditors at each Audit 
Committee meeting. They also attended the 2012 AGM. 
They provided the Committee with information and advice as well 
as relevant reports on the financial statements and controls. 
In November 2012, the Committee reviewed and approved the 
terms, areas of responsibility and scope of the 2012/13 audit as set 
out in the external auditors’ engagement letter. During the year, 
PwC provided audit related services such as regulatory and 
statutory reporting. PwC are expected to report to the Committee 
any material departures from Group accounting policies and 
procedures that they identify during the course of their audit work. 
None were found or reported in the financial year. 
PwC’s 2012/13 Year End External Audit Plan was approved in 
March 2013 and has been successfully completed at the date 
of this report.   Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 81

Auditor appointment and effectiveness 
Following the incorporation of the Company in Jersey in 2010, PwC 
were appointed as the Company’s auditors. PwC had been the 
auditors of Wolseley plc for many years prior to the redomiciliation 
of the Company.  
The Committee conducts an annual review of the performance of 
the external auditors, including feedback from the finance teams 
at each of the operating companies. This review was conducted in 
November 2012 and the Committee is satisfied that PwC continues 
to provide an effective audit service. The Group Audit Partner, 
currently Stuart Watson, is required to rotate after a maximum of 
five years, key audit partners after a maximum of seven years, and 
all other partners and senior team members after a maximum of ten 
years. The Committee discusses audit partner rotation with PwC 
on a regular basis.  
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s 
choice of external auditor. This year the Committee did not consider 
it necessary to conduct a tender process for the appointment of the 
Company’s auditors. 
External audit tendering 
During the last two years, the Committee has been monitoring and, 
through its Chairman, contributing to the debate on external audit 
tendering. The Committee has given preliminary consideration to 
the potential impact of the requirements by the UK Financial 
Reporting Council (“FRC”) regarding audit firm tendering, which are 
welcomed. However, the Committee notes that both the European 
Commission and the United Kingdom Competition Commission 
(together, “the Regulators”) have proposed potentially conflicting 
guidelines in this area. We will continue to monitor developments 
in this area and await the outcome of the Regulators’ consultations. 
In accordance with our policy on audit partner rotation referred 
to above, Stuart Watson, who was appointed as Group Audit 
Partner in 2010, will be due to rotate off the Company s audit 
after completing the 31 July 2015 audit engagement.  
Subject to the continued satisfactory performance of PwC, it is the 
current intention to tender the external audit during the financial year 
ended 31 July 2016. 
Auditor independence 
The Company has policies and procedures in place to ensure 
that independence and objectivity is not impaired. These include 
restrictions on the types of services which the external Auditor 
can provide, in line with the APB Ethical Standards on Auditing. 
Details of the services that the external auditors cannot be engaged 
to perform are provided on the Wolseley plc website 
www.wolseley.com. 
In relation to the non-audit services provided by PwC during the 
year, the Committee reviewed and approved management’s 
reasons for selecting PwC as the best placed adviser on a  
case-by-case basis. This decision was typically based on the 
merit of using PwC’s existing knowledge of both the Company 
and the Group and its importance in relation to the advice sought 
on each relevant transaction. This added value and saved fees 
in the process. 
At each Committee meeting the Committee considered all requests 
for engagements of non-audit work to be performed by PwC for the 
Group. The Committee followed its agreed policy regarding such 
services to ensure that the objectivity or independence of the 
external auditors was not impaired. In accordance with this policy, 
any non-audit work which would exceed a level (set by the 
Committee) required prior approval of the Committee. 
PwC also provides specific assurance to the Committee on the 
arrangements and safeguards it has in place to maintain its 
independence and objectivity, including an internal process to pre-
approve provision of non-audit services and the use of separate 
teams where non-audit services are being provided to the Group. 
The Committee continues to be satisfied with their independence. 
Audit and non-audit fees 
The total fees paid to PwC in the year ended 31 July 2013 (together 
with a comparison to fees paid in the year ended 31 July 2012) 
are set out in the following table. Further disclosure of the non-audit 
fees paid during the year ended 31 July 2013 can be found in

non-audit fees related to other services. 
The non-audit services related mainly to assistance on tax advisory 
and compliance matters and other assurance engagements, 
including corporate responsibility reporting. The level of such fees 
increased marginally due to work undertaken to support enhanced 
corporate responsibility reporting. These services were provided 
within the constraints of the Audit Practices Board Ethical 
Standards on Auditing and were assessed on a case-by-case 
basis so that the best placed adviser was retained. 
Internal audit 
During the year, prior to each of the four scheduled Committee 
meetings, the Chairman of the Committee met with the Head of 
Internal Audit, who attended each Committee meeting, where 
his reports were reviewed and discussed in detail. The Committee 
considered the results of the internal audits and the adequacy 
of management’s response to matters raised in them, including 
the time taken to resolve any such matters. 
In March 2013, the Committee conducted the annual review of 
the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit function, including 
its terms of reference, its audit plans, its general performance 
and its relationship with the external auditors. This review was 
undertaken using guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in England and Wales and the Institute of Internal 
Auditors – UK.

Audit Committee continued 
Risk 
Risk management 
Risk management reports, prepared by the Group Head of Risk 
and Compliance, were submitted to the Committee in September 
2012 and March 2013. These reports summarise submissions from 
all areas of the business which the Executive Committee and senior 
management have reviewed. They identify the significant risks to 
the Group and highlight the tolerance levels that the Executive 
Committee is prepared to accept. 
Internal controls 
During the year the Committee monitored and reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems, accounting 
policies and practices, standards of risk management and risk 
management procedures and compliance controls, as well as 
the Company’s statements on internal controls, before they were 
agreed by the Board for this Annual Report. The way in which 
the processes of external audit, internal audit and internal controls 
overlap and complement each other was reviewed in May 2013. 
The Group’s internal control systems are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate business risk. They provide reasonable but 
not absolute assurance against material mis-statement or loss. 
Such systems are necessary to safeguard shareholders’ investment 
and the Company’s assets and depend on regular evaluation of the 
extent of the risks to which the Company is exposed. Management 
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal 
control over financial reporting for the Group, including the 
consolidation process, and it does this through the Advanced 
Control Environment (“ACE”) framework. The Committee received 
regular updates at each meeting on the work undertaken by the 
ACE team, which is independent of management.  
The Committee is assured that the Company’s systems comply 
with the guidance set out in the Turnbull Report “Internal Control: 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code”. At each meeting, 
the Committee has in depth discussions about the internal 
controls with the managers responsible for their implementation. 
The Committee can confirm that the Company’s systems and their 
effectiveness have been in place for the full financial year and up to 
the date on which the financial statements were approved, and are 
regularly reviewed by the Board. The Committee is of the view that 
the Company has a well-designed system of internal control. 
The Chairman of the Committee reports any matters to the Board 
arising from the Committee’s review of the way in which the risk 
management and internal control processes are applied and on 
any breakdowns in, or exceptions to, these processes. There were 
no significant failings or weaknesses identified. These processes 
have been in place throughout the year ended 31 July 2013 
and have continued to the date of this report. 
Full details of how the business implements its risk management 
and controls on a Group-wide basis are set out in the Risk 
management and internal control section on pages 42 to 47. 
Whistleblowing and fraud 
The Group’s whistleblowing policy, which supports the Group-wide 
Code of Conduct, is monitored by the Committee. A copy of the 
Group’s Code of Conduct is available on the Wolseley plc website 
www.wolseley.com. The Committee received reports at each 
Committee meeting providing details of matters reported through 
the Group’s international confidential telephone reporting lines and 
secure website reporting facility, which are operated on its behalf by 
an independent third party. All matters reported are investigated by 
the relevant operating company and, where appropriate, reported 
to the Committee, together with details of any corrective action 
taken. The Committee also received reports at each Committee 
meeting providing details of fraud losses in each quarter.  
One of the Group’s subsidiary companies in France made a series 
of unauthorised payments over a period of six weeks in the first half 
of the financial year. The payments were not in compliance with 
Group policies or with an agreed bank mandate. The total loss 
to the Company was £11 million which was accounted for in 
the period. The Company is taking all available steps to recover 
the lost funds.  
What are the priorities for 2013/14? 
Objectives 2013/14 
Maintain close scrutiny of the Company’s management of its 
principal risks and ensure continued improvement of the risk 
management framework. 
Prepare for and, if appropriate, implement the regulatory 
changes to Audit Committee governance, in particular in relation 
to the tendering of the audit. 
Continue to monitor the effectiveness of the overall assurance 
provided by Internal Audit, internal controls and risk management 
processes and, in particular, review the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal control systems.  
As at the date of this report, the Committee has already begun to 
implement a number of these action points.

Dear Shareholder 
What has the Committee done during the year? 
An overview of the Committee’s 2012/13 objectives and how the 
Committee has progressed against these objectives is set out below:  
2012/13 objectives Progress 
Continue the search for at least 
one new Non Executive Director. 
Achieved. Two new Non 
Executive Directors appointed 
in January 2013. 
Review the balance, experience 
and skills of the Board, 
recognising the departure of the 
Senior Independent Director and 
Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee. 
Achieved. Andrew Duff 
transferred his responsibilities as 
Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and Senior 
Independent Director as part of 
a phased handover prior to his 
retirement from the Board in 
November 2013. The overall 
balance and skills of the Board 
are constantly assessed by 
the Chairman and periodically 
discussed with the Committee 
and the Board as a whole.  
Monitor the Company’s progress 
in developing its diversity policies. 
Ongoing. Management will 
report on progress during the 
course of the year. 
The Committee regularly reviews the composition and experience of 
the Board to ensure that the range of skills, breadth of experience 
and diversity of the Board are fully considered, and will continue to 
do so for future appointments. During the year, the Committee 
undertook a search for two new Non Executive Directors and 
we finalised the appointment of Pilar López and Alan Murray, who 
were appointed as Non Executive Directors on 1 January 2013.  
In accordance with our procedure for selecting and recruiting 
Directors, the Committee retained an external search agency, 
Zygos, which has no connection to the Company, to assist in the 
process of identifying potential candidates for nomination to 
the Board. 
The Committee remains focused on monitoring the Company’s 
progress in developing and implementing its diversity policies; this 
subject continues to receive significant attention. The Committee 
has ensured that the skills, experience, potential and overall balance 
of the Board – as well as diversity and gender – were considered in 
relation to the recent appointment process conducted for our new 
Non Executive Directors. 
At the 2013 AGM, I shall be available to respond to any questions 
shareholders may raise on this report or any of the Committee’s 
activities. 
What are the priorities for 2013/14? 
Objectives 2013/14 
Continue to review the balance, experience and skills of 
the Board. 
Monitor the Company’s progress in developing and 
implementing its diversity policies.

Other ad hoc committees 
As required by the demands of business, the Board may appoint 
ad hoc committees to facilitate the implementation of its decisions 
or to consider specific matters in further detail between scheduled 
meetings. The Board may delegate matters of a substantive nature 
to a special purpose Committee. If it does so it will generally have 
already considered the matter in-depth at a full Board meeting 
but may require further review prior to final approval. 
During the year, a number of committees were appointed for the 
specific purpose of implementing decisions of the Board in relation 
to approved acquisitions, the development of projects or the release 
of announcements.

Amendment of the Company’s  
Articles of Association 
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by a 
special resolution of the Company’s shareholders.  
Authority to allot shares 
At the Annual General Meeting held in November 2012, authority 
was given to the Directors to allot new ordinary shares up to a 
nominal value of £19,087,512. The Directors intend to propose at 
the Annual General Meeting in November 2013 to seek authority 
to allot and grant rights to subscribe for or to convert securities 
into shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £19,122,250, 
representing approximately two-thirds of the Company’s issued 
share capital as at the date of this report, but of that amount, 
£ suant to a fully pre emptive 
rights issue. If approved, this authority will expire at the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting to be held in November 2014. 
Subject to the terms of the authority noted above, the Directors 
will also recommend that they be empowered to allot equity 
securities for cash other than pro rata to existing shareholders, 
until the Annual General Meeting to be held in November 2014. 
This authority shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities 
for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,434,165 being 
approximately 5 per cent of the ordinary share capital issued at 
the date of this report. The Directors currently have no intention 
to issue ordinary shares, other than pursuant to the Company’s 
employee share schemes and any share dividend alternatives. 
Authority to purchase shares 
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the Company 
to purchase its own ordinary shares and a special resolution will 
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting in November 2013 
to renew the Directors’ limited authority, last granted in November 
2012, to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares in the market. 
The authority will be limited to a maximum of 27,436,390 ordinary 
shares (being approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s issued 
share capital at the date of this report) and sets the minimum and 
maximum prices which may be paid. The Directors will use this 
authority to purchase shares only after careful consideration, taking 
into account market conditions, other investment opportunities, 
appropriate gearing levels and the overall financial position of the 
Company. The authority will enable the Directors to continue to 
be able to respond promptly should circumstances arise in which 
they consider that such a purchase would result in an increase 
in earnings per share and would be in the best interests of the 
Company. In accordance with the Company’s Articles the 
Company is allowed to hold shares purchased by it to be held as 
treasury shares that may be cancelled, sold for cash or used for the 
purpose of employee share schemes. As at the date of this report, 
the Company holds no shares in treasury but the Directors currently 
intend that any shares which are purchased will be held in treasury. 
The authorities to be sought by each of the resolutions noted 
above are intended to apply equally to shares to be held by the 
Company as treasury shares and to the sale of treasury shares. 
The Directors consider it desirable for these general authorities 
to be available to provide flexibility in the management of the 
Company’s capital resources. 
Change of control (significant agreements) 
The Company is not party to any significant agreements that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following a 
takeover except for the €750,000,000 multicurrency revolving credit 
facility agreement dated 18 July 2011, the US$270,000,000 
revolving credit facility agreement dated 21 July 2011, the 
£200,000,000 revolving credit facility agreement dated 27 March 
2013 and the US$500,000,000 receivables facility agreement dated 
31 July 2013 which could become repayable following a relevant 
change of control. There are no agreements between the Company 
and any Director that would provide compensation for loss of office 
or employment resulting from a change of control following a 
takeover bid, except that provisions of the Company’s share 
schemes may cause options and awards granted under such 
schemes to vest in those circumstances. All of the Company’s 
share schemes contain provisions relating to a change of control. 
Outstanding options and awards would normally vest and become 
exercisable for a limited period of time upon a change of control 
following a takeover, reconstruction or winding up of the Company 
(not being an internal reorganisation), subject at that time to rules 
concerning the satisfaction of any performance conditions. 
Charitable donations 
The Group’s charitable donations in 2012/13 totalled £2,425,000 
(2012: £1,389,000). Donations to charitable organisations from 
the businesses across the Group range from small to substantial 
amounts. The charitable organisations which received donations 
of more than £10,000 per annum from Wolseley and other details 
of charitable donations made in the year are referred to in the 
Corporate responsibility report. 
Conflicts of interest 
Processes and procedures are in place which require Directors to 
identify and declare actual or potential conflicts of interest, whether 
matter-specific or situational. These notifications are made by a 
Director prior to or at a Board meeting, or in writing. All Directors 
have a continuing duty to update any changes.  
The Board may authorise potential conflicts which can be limited 
in scope, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
These authorisations are regularly reviewed. During the year, 
all conflict management procedures were adhered to and 
operated efficiently. 
Creditor payment policy 
All Group companies are responsible for establishing terms and 
conditions of trading with their vendors. It is the Company’s policy 
that payments to vendors are made within agreed terms and are, 
where applicable, consistent with The Prompt Payment Code, 
which is sponsored by the UK Department for Business Innovation 
& Skills (“BIS”). Copies of this Code can be obtained from BIS. 
At 31 July 2013, the Company had no trade creditors (2012: nil). 
The amount of trade creditors for the Group as at 31 July 2013 
was equivalent to 63 days (2012: 63 days) of trade purchases. 
CREST 
The Company’s ordinary shares are in CREST, the settlement 
system for stocks and shares.

Other disclosures continued 
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. The Directors 
have prepared the Directors’ Remuneration Report as if the 
Company were required to do so in accordance with the UK 
Companies Act 2006. 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union. The Directors are also 
responsible for preparing parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, and for 
being satisfied that the Consolidated and Company financial 
statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company 
and Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Consolidated and Company financial statements respectively; 
and 
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the Consolidated financial statements comply 
with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website. Jersey legislation and United Kingdom 
regulation, governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements, may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 66 and 67, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
 the Consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and 
 the Performance review contained in the report of the directors 
includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
In addition, having taken all matters considered by the Board and 
brought to the attention of the Board during the year into account, 
the Directors consider that the Company’s 2012/13 Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, presents a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s position and 
prospects and provides information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
Employees 
The Group actively encourages employee involvement in driving 
our current and future success and places particular importance 
on keeping employees regularly informed on the Group’s activities 
and financial performance and on matters affecting them individually 
and the business generally. This can be through informal bulletins, 
in-house publications and briefings, as well as via the Group’s 
intranet sites. The Group operates on a largely decentralised basis 
with a rigorous control framework exercised by a small team at 
the Group Services Office. This ensures that consistent standards 
are set and maintained while allowing for implementation in a way 
that supports each business unit’s particular circumstances. 
Local management is responsible for maintaining high standards 
of health and safety and for ensuring that there is appropriate 
employee involvement in decision-making. 
A European Works Council (“EWC”) has been operating since 1996 
to provide a forum for informing and consulting employees in 
Europe on such matters as significant developments in the Group’s 
operations, management’s plans and expectations, organisational 
changes within the Group and also for employee representatives to 
consult Group management about concerns over any aspect of the 
Group’s operations. At the date of this report, there were 18 EWC 
representatives of which 12 were employee representatives and six 
were management representatives. Employee representatives are 
appointed from each European country in which Wolseley operates. 
All employees are offered a range of benefits depending on their 
local environment. Where possible, they are also encouraged to 
build a stake in the Company through the ownership of shares 
through participation in the Company’s employee share schemes. 
Employment policies 
Our employment policies aim to attract the very best people and 
we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture is a key factor in 
being a successful business. The Group remains committed to 
equality of opportunity in all of its employment practices. It is the 
Group’s policy that the selection of employees for appointment, 
career development and promotion be determined solely on the 
skills and attributes which are relevant to the job and which are 
in accordance with the laws of the country concerned, and it will 
progressively promote diversity. Ongoing training of employees 
and the continued development of their skills is of prime 
importance. The Group also has policies in place relating to 
the continuation of employment of, and appropriate retraining for, 
employees who become disabled.

Indemnities and insurance 
The Company indemnifies the Directors in respect of liabilities 
incurred as a result of their office in accordance with its Articles of 
Association and to the maximum extent permitted by Jersey law. 
Qualifying third-party indemnity provisions (to the maximum extent 
permitted by English law) were granted to all Directors in office and 
to the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel by Wolseley 
plc (now known as Wolseley Limited) and these remain in force as 
at the date of this report. When Wolseley plc (registered in Jersey) 
became the new holding company, additional third party indemnity 
provisions were granted by the Company, and it has granted 
indemnities to all Directors appointed since November 2010 in 
accordance with Jersey law.  
There is appropriate insurance coverage in respect of legal action 
against the Directors and officers. Neither the Company’s 
indemnities nor insurance would provide any coverage to the extent 
that a Director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
Independent Auditors and audit information 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) are willing to continue 
as auditors of the Company, and resolutions concerning their 
reappointment and the determination of their remuneration will 
be proposed at the next Annual General Meeting. The Directors 
in office at the date of this report confirm that, so far as they are 
each aware, in respect of the consolidated financial statements 
for the financial year ended 31 July 2013, there is no relevant audit 
information of which PwC are unaware and each Director has 
taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a Director to 
be aware, in respect of the consolidated financial statements for the 
financial year ended 31 July 2013, of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that PwC are aware of that information. 
Management report 
The management report for the year, as required by the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, is incorporated within the Overview and 
Performance sections of the Annual Report. 
Political donations 
At each of the Annual General Meetings held since 2002, shareholders 
have passed a resolution, as a precaution, to approve donations to 
political organisations and to incur political expenditure (as such terms 
are now defined in sections 362 to 379 of the Companies Act 2006). 
Each year, the Board has confirmed that it operates a policy of not 
giving any cash contribution to any political party in the ordinary 
meaning of those words and that it has no intention of changing that 
policy. In previous years this resolution related to the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006. The Company has ensured that, although 
registered in Jersey, it will continue to apply the same standards and 
has such provisions incorporated into its Articles of Association. The 
Directors propose to seek, once more, authority for the Group to make 
political donations and/or incur political expenditure for amounts not 
exceeding £125,000 in aggregate, which they might otherwise be 
prohibited from making or incurring under the provisions of Article 12 
of the Company’s Articles of Association (equivalent to sections 362 
to 379 of the Companies Act 2006) and which would not amount to 
“donations” in the ordinary sense of the word. This authority would last 
until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting. During the year, no 
expenditure was incurred which could be regarded as political in nature.  
Restrictions on transfer of shares 
There are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to the 
Company’s ordinary shares or on the transfer of securities in the 
Company. No person holds securities in the Company carrying 
special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company 
is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting 
rights. The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by 
a special resolution of the Company’s shareholders. 
Share capital and voting rights 
On 10 December 2012, the shares of Wolseley plc were 
consolidated on a 22 for 23 basis (“Consolidation”). Details of the 
authorised and issued share capital, together with any movements 
in the issued share capital during the year, are shown in note 26 
of the consolidated financial statements. As at 31 July 2013 there 
were 274,361,228 fully paid ordinary shares of 10
5
⁄11 pence each 
in issue and listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and 
without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing shares or 
class of shares, any share may be issued with such rights and 
restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution determine 
or as the Board shall determine. Copies of the Company’s Articles 
of Association can be obtained from Companies Registry, Jersey or 
by writing to the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel. 
The Company also has a Level 1 American Depositary Receipt 
(“ADR”) programme in the US for which Deutsche Bank Trust 
Company Americas acts as Depositary. The American Depositary 
Shares (“ADS”) which are evidenced by ADRs are traded on the 
US over-the-counter market, where each ADS represents one-tenth 
of a Wolseley plc ordinary share. 
Share options 
At the time of the share Consolidation in November 2012, the 
Board determined that since the effect of a share Consolidation, 
when combined with the payment of a special dividend, was

options, no adjustment to such share awards and options, or any

UK pension schemes  
Wolseley currently has two pension schemes in respect of 
employees in the United Kingdom: 
(1) Defined Benefit Scheme – the Wolseley Group Retirement 
Benefits Plan (“Plan”) is a trust-based defined benefits scheme. 
It consists of two sections: the Wolseley Section and the 
William Wilson Section. Both sections have been closed to 
new entrants since 31 May 2009. Following detailed and 
comprehensive consultation it has been agreed with the 
Trustees to close the Plan to future accrual from 31 December 
2013. On and from 1 January 2014, all remaining active 
members of the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan 
will transfer to the Wolseley Group Defined Contribution Plan. 
There are three trustees consisting of an independent trustee, 
a member nominated trustee and a corporate trustee. The 
corporate trustees consists of six trustee directors and, save for 
David Illingworth (chairman of the trustees) and Ian Percy, CBE, 
all of the other trustee directors are employees of the Group. 
(2) Defined Contribution Scheme – the Wolseley Group Defined 
Contribution Plan is a trust-based defined contribution 
pension scheme with three Company nominated trustees, 
one of whom is an independent trustee and two who are  
UK-based employees of the Group; the chairman of the 
trustees is Wayne Phelan of PS Independent Trustees Limited. 
In addition, up to three member-nominated trustees may be 
appointed. The Trustees have regularly sought member-
nominated trustees. Whilst there were none who put themselves 
forward following the last selection process, a further process 
will be run in January 2014. The Wolseley Group Defined 
Contribution Plan has been used as the vehicle to auto-enrol 
Wolseley employees and the plan rules have been updated to 
meet the auto-enrolment legal requirements. The basis of 
contribution to the Wolseley Group Defined Contribution Plan 
will be enhanced from 1 January 2014.

Remuneration report 
For the year ended 31 July 2013 
 
 
This report sets out the remuneration policy 
for the Directors of Wolseley plc and 
discloses the amounts paid to them for 
the year ended 31 July 2013. 
Dear Shareholder  
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present our Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 31 July 2013. This is my last 
Remuneration Report as I have handed 
over the responsibilities of my role as 
Chairman of the Committee to Alan Murray 
from 1 August 2013. 
I am pleased to make my report this year 
in the context of a continued strong 
performance both in terms of share price 
and underlying earnings. Since the current 
executive team came together in 2009 
they have delivered TSR growth of 148 per 
cent and have taken EPS from 95.6 pence 
to 181.8 pence.  
The strategy and portfolio restructuring 
initiated by our talented management team 
have driven a significant improvement in 
trading margin. Group trading margin over a 
three year period to date shows consistent 
incremental improvement: from 4.9 per cent 
in 2010/11, to 5.3 per cent in 2011/12 and 
5.6 per cent in 2012/13. 
The Company has continued to make 
progress and has delivered a strong 
performance in the last year despite difficult 
market conditions in Europe.  
As a result of this strong performance, LTIP 
and ESOP targets were met in full in the year 
ended 31 July 2013. The Company achieved 
a TSR ranking of third position against the 
FTSE 100 comparator group, up from 
seventeenth last year leading to full vesting 
of the scheme. EPS for the Company was 
181.8 pence in the last year and has grown 
by 90.2 per cent over the four year 
performance period. As a result option 
awards have vested in full. Achievement 
against these performance conditions is 
consistent with the strong correlation between 
our strategy, corporate performance, 
executive reward and shareholder return. 
During the year we carried out the review of 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration referred 
to in last year’s Remuneration Report. This 
confirmed that the current salaries (as well 
as total remuneration) of the Group Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer are below 
market competitive levels. Consideration was 
given to the fact that significant increases in 
salary should not be the norm. The Committee 
decided to limit increases to salary to the 
rates of increase of the workforce generally 
in the UK and the USA. 
In light of the continued growth of the 
Company and its progress since their 
appointment, it is concerning that executive 
target remuneration levels should remain so 
far below competitive levels. After extensive 
consultation, the Committee decided that in 
order to incentivise continued outperformance 
of the Group, there should be an increase in 
the potential variable pay relating to annual 
bonus for the Chief Financial Officer and to 
LTIP awards for the Group Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer. Further details 
are set out in the report at page 95. We are 
fortunate to have a highly successful and 
a valued executive team and it is the 
Committee’s belief that their remuneration 
packages should be structured to incentivise 
the continued drive for future growth. It was 
also decided to increase the EPS target 
for the highest tranche of ESOP awards. 
The EPS performance targets can be found 
at page 95 of the report. 
In January 2013, we welcomed Pilar López 
and Alan Murray to the Board as Non 
Executive Directors and as members of the 
Committee. Alan was appointed Chairman 
of the Committee with effect from 1 August 
2013. Details of their remuneration can be 
found later in this report.  
The Committee has considered the new 
remuneration reporting regulations for 
UK listed companies introduced by BIS 
which come into force for such companies 
with financial years ending on or after 
30 September 2013. Although not required 
to be adopted by a Jersey registered 
company the Committee has decided, as a 
matter of good governance, to incorporate 
into the report some of the new BIS 
requirements whilst still complying with 
current regulations. The Remuneration 
Report for 2013/14 will meet the disclosure 
requirements of the new BIS regulations.  
We have attempted to set this report out 
in the form of a policy section and an 
implementation section similar to that 
required by the new reporting arrangements. 
This Remuneration Report is intended to 
provide the context and explanation of 
the Committee’s policies and practical 
considerations that influence our decisions. 
Our aim is always to provide clear and 
transparent reporting of our pay policy 
and it will continue to be so.  
Thank you for your support over the years. 
It has been a privilege to serve on the 
Board of this great Company and I very 
much hope that we will receive your 
support at the 2013 AGM to be held on 
26 November 2013. 
Andrew Duff  
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee  
for the year ended 31 July 2013 
This report, approved by the Board, has been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority and Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 of the 
United Kingdom. 
Although it is not a requirement of Jersey company 
law to have the Directors’ remuneration report 
approved by shareholders, the Board believes that as 
a Company whose shares are listed on the London 
Stock Exchange it is good corporate governance for 
it to do so. Accordingly, a resolution to approve the 
entire Directors’ Remuneration Report will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.  
Furthermore, the Board has also applied the 
principles of good governance relating to Directors’ 
remuneration contained within the UK Corporate 
Governance Code updated in September 2012.

Policy Report on Remuneration 
Future remuneration policy 
The Company’s policy is to provide remuneration to senior executives to reflect their contribution to the business, the performance of 
the Group, the size and complexity of the Group’s operations and the need to attract, retain, treat fairly and incentivise executives of the 
highest quality. The Committee seeks to provide remuneration packages which are simple, clear and transparent and easily understood by 
both executives and shareholders, whilst providing an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay and which support the delivery 
of the Group’s strategy.  
The key components of the remuneration policy and associated arrangements for Executive and Non Executive Directors from  
1 August 2013 are shown below: 
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity 
Executive Directors  
Base salary  
 To pay Executive Directors at a level 
commensurate with their contribution to the 
Company and appropriately based on skill, 
experience and performance achieved.  
 The level of salary paid is considered 
appropriate for motivation and retention of 
the calibre of executive required to ensure 
the successful formation and delivery of the 
Group’s strategy and management of its 
business in the challenging international 
environment in which it operates. 
 The policy is to normally set base salary at or around the mid-market level of other 
companies comparable on the basis of size, internationality and complexity with the 
opportunity to exceed this level to reward sustained individual high performance. 
If any newly appointed Executive Director’s base salary has been set below the 
mid-market level, the policy is to review and decide on a case-by-case basis whether 
it is appropriate to award increases to progress quickly to or around that mid-market 
level once expertise and performance has been proven and sustained.  
 Paid monthly in cash in the currency specified in the employment contract. 
 Executive Directors’ salary is reviewed annually by the Committee which takes into 
account prevailing market and economic conditions and governance practices trends. 
In exceptional circumstances, or if an individual assumes significantly more responsibility, 
the Committee may consider it appropriate and necessary to award larger increases.  
Benefits  
 To provide a range of market competitive 
benefits to encourage retention and which 
enable an Executive Director to perform his 
or her duties. 
Eligible for a range of benefits that can include: 
 Life assurance cover 
 Critical illness cover 
 Private medical cover for Executive Directors and their dependants 
 Car, driver, car allowance 
 Professional tax and financial advice 
 All-employee Sharesave schemes 
Pension  
 To provide a market-competitive benefit for 
retirement which rewards sustained 
contribution and encourages retention. 
 Eligible to participate in the relevant pension arrangements offered by the Group or to 
receive a cash salary supplement in lieu of pension entitlement. 
 The maximum opportunity, either by way of a Company contribution to a Group pension 
arrangement or payment of a cash salary supplement, is 32 per cent of base salary. 
Annual Bonus  
 To reward achievement of annual financial 
and operational goals consistent with the 
strategic direction of the business.  
 
 The maximum opportunity is 110 to 140 per cent of base salary. 
 The Committee sets performance targets annually. 
 At least 80 per cent of maximum bonus is weighted to financial performance. 
 Not more than 20 per cent of maximum bonus is weighted to individual personal 
objectives. 
 Paid annually and is not pensionable.

Executive Directors (continued) 
Long Term Incentives (“LTI”)  
 To align interests of senior executives 
and those of shareholders in developing 
the long-term growth of the business 
and execution and delivery of the 
Group’s strategy. 
 To facilitate share ownership to provide 
further alignment with shareholders. 
Eligible to participate (subject to selection by the Committee) in LTI plans approved by 
shareholders under which: 
 awards are made annually 
 clawback may be applied to awards granted from December 2012 
 awards are not pensionable 
 the level of awards are determined by the Committee at its discretion 
 Current LTI plans approved by shareholders 
 Executive Share Ownership Plan (“ESOP”)  
 Awards are subject to EPS growth targets above UK inflation measured over 
three financial years, starting with the financial year in which the grant takes place.  
 A percentage of salary vests for threshold performance (0 per cent vests 
below threshold) increasing in tranches to the maximum award. 
 The maximum award that may be granted is stipulated by the relevant plan rules. 
 Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) 
 Awards are subject to the Company meeting TSR targets over three financial years, 
starting with the financial year in which the grant takes place.  
 A percentage of the award vests for threshold performance (0 per cent below threshold) 
increasing pro rata to 100 per cent vesting for maximum performance.  
 The maximum award that may be granted is stipulated in the relevant plan rules. 
Non Executive Directors  
Fees  
 To remunerate Non Executive Directors to 
reflect their level of responsibility.  
 The Chairman is paid a base fee determined by the Committee. 
 Fees for other Non Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors at a Board meeting. The fees paid comprise a base fee and 
additional fees for the roles of Senior Independent Director, Chairman of Audit 
Committee and Chairman of Remuneration Committee. 
 In determining the fees, consideration is given to market data for similar non executive 
roles in other companies comparable on the basis of size, internationality and complexity 
as well as the expected time commitment. 
 Additional fees for Non Executive Directors for duties beyond those stated above may 
be payable from time to time to reflect the time and responsibility involved.  
 Non Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive plan, nor is any pension 
payable in respect of their services, and they are not entitled to any benefits, except for 
assistance with their tax affairs arising from the Company’s tax residency in Switzerland.
Executive and Non Executive Directors  
Shareholding guidelines  
 To encourage all Directors to build up a 
shareholding in value equivalent to a set 
multiple of base salary or fees. 
 To align interests of Directors and those of 
shareholders in developing the long-term 
growth of the business and the execution 
and delivery of the Group’s strategy. 
 All Directors are required to hold shares equivalent in value to a prescribed percentage 
of their base salary or fees. 
 All Directors are advised of a target, a timeline to achieve the target and requirements 
for maintaining the shareholding in line with salary or fees increases. 
 For Executive Directors, share ownership may be achieved by retaining shares received 
as a result of participating in a Company share plan, after taking into account any shares 
sold to finance option exercises or to pay an income tax or National Insurance liability 
(or overseas equivalent).

Remuneration report continued 
Notes to the Policy Table 
(1) Details of how the Company will implement the policy set out 
above from 1 August 2013 are shown in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration section on page 95. 
(2) Our policy for Executive Directors and employees is to provide 
remuneration at mid-market levels. On promotion or appointment 
senior executives may be initially remunerated below market levels 
and then increase to market levels over time, once performance has 
been established. The emphasis on the various elements of pay 
within our policy varies depending on the role of the individual within 
the Group. Where possible, employees are encouraged to hold 
shares in Wolseley, thereby providing alignment with shareholders 
and benefiting from any growth in value of the Group but through 
different delivery mechanisms. For the Executive Directors and senior 
executives, a greater emphasis is placed on performance-related pay. 
(3) The list of benefits is not exhaustive and would be reviewed by 
the Company on a case-by-case basis due to the position and 
circumstances arising for each Executive Director (e.g. if an Executive 
Director was asked to relocate, a relocation package may be agreed). 
It is expected that an Executive Director would have benefits 
consistent with his individual circumstances. 
(4) Annual Bonus: financial key performance indicators are used for 
the annual bonus plan. A proportion of the bonus (20 per cent in 
2012/13) is based on personal goals aimed at driving the strategic 
objectives of the business. The targets will be set each year with 
reference to the Group’s annual budget and long-term strategic 
business plan, as well as market expectations.  
(5) ESOP Performance Conditions: the Committee considers the EPS 
condition to be appropriate for share options as it requires substantial 
improvement in the Group’s financial performance and complements 
the inherent requirement for share price growth for an option to have 
value. It is possible for the Committee to vary the targets of options 
to take account of any technical changes, for example, in accounting 
standards, provided that any amended target would be materially 
no less challenging in the circumstances as a result of any change.  
(6) ESOP Targets: the Committee sets the EPS growth range having 
due regard to the Group’s budget and strategic business plan every 
year as well as market expectations, the Group’s trading environment 
and the consensus of analysts’ forecast trading profit.  
(7) LTIP Performance Conditions: the Committee has selected TSR 
as the appropriate performance measure to ensure that the interests 
of the Executive Committee and Directors are closely aligned with 
those of the Company’s shareholders over the long term and to 
incentivise outperformance of the Company relative to its peers. 
(8) LTIP Targets: the Committee has based the relative TSR targets 
on a list of comparator companies, being the full constituent 
members of the FTSE 100 at the respective date of grant, 
with no additions or exclusions.  
(9) The Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the 
Company’s all-employee Sharesave plans, as these are open to all 
employees of the Group and there are no performance conditions 
determining the vesting of awards under them.  
(10) The Committee considers both fixed and variable elements of 
pay. In setting targets for the variable elements of the executives’ 
packages, the Committee strives to align executives’ interests 
with those of the Company’s shareholders. The Committee sets 
appropriate and demanding targets for variable pay in the context 
of the Company’s trading environment and strategic objectives. 
(11) The Group’s strategy is to deliver long-term sustainable and 
profitable growth. In order to do so, the Committee believes that 
the Company requires a high quality Executive management team 
committed to the business and encouraged to remain with the 
Company for the long-term. The Company’s policy on base salary, 
benefits, pension, bonus and long term incentives is aimed at 
attracting and retaining a high quality Executive management team 
to deliver the strategy in a sustained way over time. The annual bonus 
is designed to promote sustained and profitable growth through 
establishing appropriate financial targets and personal objectives. 
The long term incentives use TSR and EPS measures which the 
Committee believes incentivises the Executive management team 
to deliver growth over the longer term which is profitable. 
How shareholder views are taken into consideration  
The Committee’s aim is to have an ongoing and open dialogue 
with major shareholders. The Chairman of the Committee will 
usually meet at least annually with major shareholders and 
shareholder representative bodies to discuss the business and 
executive remuneration more widely. When any material changes 
are proposed to remuneration policy, the Chairman of the 
Committee will inform major shareholders in advance, and offer 
a meeting to discuss the proposed changes. This shareholder 
engagement, together with the consultation process noted below, 
highlights the fact that the Committee recognises the importance 
of understanding shareholders’ views and ensuring that they are 
considered when making decisions. 
The Committee also considers shareholder feedback received in 
relation to the AGM each year. During the year under report, the 
Chairman consulted with major shareholders and shareholder 
representative bodies on two separate occasions. The first was 
in relation to the adoption of the Company’s two new long term 
incentive plans. The Committee took into account the views of its 
shareholders and made certain amendments to the proposed new 
long term incentive plans as a result. Those plans were approved at 
the 2012 AGM. The second consultation related to certain proposed 
changes to remuneration for Mr Meakins and Mr Martin for the 
2013/14 financial year. The Committee listened to feedback from 
shareholders. The bonus opportunity for Mr Martin has been 
increased. The award levels under the LTIP to Mr Martin and 
Mr Meakins will be increased. In relation to the ESOP, the award 
levels for Mr Martin and Mr Meakins will not be increased and the 
target EPS level at the higher level of vesting will increase. During 
2013/14 investors and representative bodies will be consulted 
regarding the Company’s executive remuneration policy for 2014/15. 
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group 
and other matters determining policy  
Whilst the Group has not consulted with employees directly in respect 
of the Company’s executive remuneration policy, it does receive 
feedback on leadership capability annually through engagement 
surveys and the results are generally positive. The Committee 
consider the basic salary increase, remuneration arrangements and 
employment conditions for the broader employee population when 
determining remuneration policy for both the Executive Directors 
and the Executive Committee. It also takes account of market 
developments, the wider economic environment, good corporate 
governance practices and its responsibilities to its shareholders.   Wolseley plc

Target and maximum indicative levels of remuneration 
for 2013/14 
 
 
 
The charts give an indication of the level of remuneration that 
would be received by each Executive Director in accordance 
with the Policy in respect of minimum (fixed pay), on target and 
maximum performance and based on assumptions set out below. 
The assumptions do not incorporate any share price appreciation 
and the assumed LTI vesting figures relate to remuneration to be 
granted in 2013/14. The figures are therefore not comparable 
with those contained in the Remuneration table on page 98 as 
the LTI vesting figures on that page relate to remuneration vesting 
in 2012/13. 
Scenario assumptions 
In arriving at the scenarios, the following assumptions have been 
made in relation to the fixed elements of remuneration: 
 Base salary for 2013/14. 
 Benefits received for 2012/13 (as set out in the Remuneration 
table on page 98). 
 Pension using the current policy (as set out in the Future policy 
table on page 90). 
For the non-fixed elements of remuneration: 
 In relation to the Annual Bonus, the scenarios are based on bonus 
payable to be made in accordance with the remuneration policy 
for 2013/14. 
 In relation to LTIP and ESOP awards, the scenarios are based 
on the awards to be made in accordance with the remuneration 
policy for 2013/14. 
In each case the assumptions for on-target and maximum 
performance are applied in the table below.

Attendees at Committee meetings 
The Group Chief Executive, Chairman of the Board and Group HR 
Director are usually invited to attend the Remuneration Committee 
meetings. They are asked to advise on or respond to specific 
questions raised by members of the Committee. This specifically 
excludes attendance on matters concerning the details of, and any 
discussions relating to, their own remuneration. 
Advisers to the Committee 
During the year, the Committee received advice and/or services 
from various parties. Details of such advice and/or services, the 
remuneration paid for their services to the Committee and other 
services they provided to the Company are set out below. 
New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited and part 
of Aon plc) (“NBS”) are the Committee’s independent remuneration 
consultants. The Committee has established arrangements to 
ensure that the advice received from NBS is independent of the 
advice provided to the Company. NBS meets and speaks with the 
Remuneration Committee Chairman periodically through the year 
to discuss remuneration matters which are of particular relevance to 
the Company, and how best it can work with the Company to meet 
the Committee’s needs. NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Code of Conduct and has confirmed to the 
Committee that it adheres to the Code. NBS was reappointed by 
the Committee in November 2012 as part of its annual review of 
advisers. Fees are charged predominantly on a “time spent” basis 
and the total fees paid to NBS for the advice provided to the 
Committee during the year was £170,000. 
While the Aon group itself provided insurance services to the 
Company during the year, these services were not provided by 
NBS, which only provided services to the Company in relation to 
remuneration activities. The Committee is satisfied that any services 
provided by the rest of the Aon group in no way compromised the 
independence of advice provided by NBS and that the advice 
provided by NBS is both objective and independent. 
Alithos Limited (“Alithos”) provided information to the Committee for 
the testing of the TSR performance conditions for the LTIP awards 
and also provided the TSR performance graphs for the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. The total fees paid were £23,000. Alithos 
was appointed by the Company for both services and did not 
provide any other advice or services during the year. 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (“Freshfields”) provided legal 
advice to the Committee during the year in relation to the new 
ESOP and LTIP plans. Fees are charged predominantly on a 
“time spent” basis and the total fees paid to Freshfields for the 
advice provided to the Committee during the year was £52,000. 
Freshfields was appointed by the Company and provided other 
services to the Company during the year. The Committee is 
satisfied that the services provided to it by Freshfields are of a 
technical nature and did not create any conflict of interest. If a 
conflict of interest were to arise, the Committee would appoint 
separate legal advisers from those used by the Company. 
Statement of shareholder voting 
At the AGM on 29 November 2012, shareholders voted to approve 
the Remuneration Report. The number of votes for totalled 
197,871,612, the number of votes against totalled 8,078,799

Remuneration table (showing single total figure of pay for year) (Audited) 
The total payments made for the financial year 2012/13 payable from 1 August 2012 for the Directors who served during the year are set 
out below. The figure for total remuneration includes share price appreciation for the value of LTI vesting. As the LTIP and ESOP grants 
made in December 2010 will not vest until December 2013, the values of LTI vesting in the table below include share price appreciation 
determined using a share price of 3212 pence being the average closing mid-market quotation for the three months ended 31July 2013. 
The values in the scenario charts on page 93 show target and maximum indicative levels of remuneration for 2013/14, and do not take into 
account share price appreciation. The figures for the value of LTI vesting below relate to levels of remuneration awarded in 2010/11 and 
vesting in 2013/14. Therefore the figures below should not be directly compared with those on page 93. The chart at footnote 5 below 
provides the value of LTI vesting with share price appreciation included.

When considering the objectives for the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee 
takes into account whether specific attention should be given to environmental, social and governance matters. Directors take such 
matters into account when considering any investment proposal or operational matter and management is expected to meet performance 
targets which include compliance with any environmental, social or governance-related standards that have been set. The overall 
performance of the businesses and of management is reviewed at the end of the year when considering the award of bonuses and 
whether operational and personal objectives have been met.

Detail of Long Term Incentives  
Long Term Incentives awarded to Executive Directors under the 
ESOP and LTIP in December 2010 will vest in December 2013. 
The vesting of both awards is subject to the performance conditions 
shown in the tables below. 
ESOP 
The Committee determined that the EPS start point for measurement 
in 2010/11 was not sufficiently challenging, as such the EPS 
reported figure in 2009/10 was used as the base point for 
measurement. Targets set were based on EPS growth over 
four years. 
Headline EPS was 181.8 pence and was 95.6 pence in 2009/10, 
this represents growth of 90.2 per cent. Over the same four-year 
period RPI growth was 17.0 per cent. The growth above RPI in the 
period was therefore 73.2 per cent and accordingly all performance 
targets have been achieved, as set out below:

TSR performance graphs and CEO pay table 
The following graphs show Wolseley’s TSR performance against 
the performance of the FTSE 100 Index. The FTSE 100 Index has 
been chosen as being a broad equity market index consisting of 
companies comparable in size and complexity to Wolseley. 
The graph below is for information and illustrates the performance 
of Wolseley for the five years from 31 July 2008 to 31 July 2013. 
 
The following graph is prescribed by Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports)

1 There were no vested (unexercised) awards under the LTIP or Sharesave. 
2 The reduction in shareholdings for T Bamford, A Duff and M Wareing was due to the impact of the share consolidation and not share disposal. 
3 All Directors have met their shareholding guideline targets, except Ms Bamford who has until 31 July 2016 to achieve the shareholding guideline, and Ms L  pez and Mr Murray 
who have until 1 January 2018. For the purposes of calculating whether the guideline has been met, the average share price for the two months ended 31 July 2013 and base 
salary as at 1 August 2013 has been used. Once met, the target is increased annually in line with base salary or fee increases, if any.

 Awards under the ESOP and LTIP are based on a percentage of salary determined by the Committee. The Committee considers annually 
the size of each grant, determined by individual performance, the ability of each individual to contribute to the achievement of the 
performance conditions, and market levels of remuneration. Awards under the ESPP scheme are subject to prescribed maximum limits.  
 Maximum vesting is 100% of the award granted.  
 Face value is calculated as a percentage of salary at the time of the grant, in accordance with the relevant plan rules. 
 Details of performance conditions for awards which were granted during the year are set out on page 95.

Further Information  
Detail of Employee Benefit Trusts 
The Wolseley plc 2011 Employee Benefit Trust (“Jersey Trust”) and 
Wolseley plc US Trust (“US Trust”) were established in connection 
with the obligation to satisfy historic and future share awards under 
the ESOP, LTIP and OSP and any other employee incentive schemes. 
The trustees of each of the Trusts have waived their rights to 
receive dividends on any shares held by them. As at 31 July 2013, 
the Jersey Trust held 1,810,543 ordinary shares of 10
5
⁄11 pence and 
£173,060.18 in cash; and the US Trust held 1,882,096 ordinary 
shares of 10
5
⁄11 pence. 
Detail of all-employee Sharesave plans 
The Company operates two all-employee Sharesave plans which 
Executive Directors can participate in. In US and Canada, the 
Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) operates as a one-year 
savings contract plan. In all other business units, employees may 
participate in the Wolseley Group International Sharesave Plan 
(“ISP”) saving for a period of three or five years.  
Dilution 
In accordance with the recommendations of the Association of 
British Insurers, the number of new shares that may be issued to 
satisfy options granted under all of the Company’s employee share 
schemes is restricted to 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company over any rolling 10-year period. Further, 
the number of new shares that may be issued to satisfy executive 
options granted under the Company’s discretionary share schemes 
is restricted to 5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company over any rolling 10-year period.  
As at 31 July 2013, the headroom under the Company’s 5 per cent 
and 10 per cent limits was 1.76 per cent and 4.80 per cent 
respectively. Options may be satisfied by either the issue of new 
shares or by shares purchased in the market. Awards under the 
OSP cannot be satisfied by new issue shares and therefore do 
not count towards the dilution limits. 
External directorships 
Executive Directors are permitted to take on an external non executive 
directorship. In order to avoid any conflicts of interest, all such 
appointments are subject to the approval of the Nominations 
Committee. The Committee believes that taking up an external 
non executive appointment helps bring a wider perspective to 
the Company and also assists in the development of business 
skills and experience. 
Ian Meakins is a non executive director of Centrica plc and receives 
a fee of £65,000 per annum for his services (2011/12: £65,000). 
The Company allowed Mr Meakins to retain this fee. 
Remuneration of other senior executives 
The Executive Committee members, who are not on the Board, 
are senior executives in the business who are considered to be 
able to significantly influence the ability of the Group to meet 
its strategic objectives.  
The Committee determines the level of remuneration for this group 
of individuals, based on proposals from the Group Chief Executive. 
Their total remuneration including salary and benefits, actual bonus, 
and the fair value of long term incentives granted or awarded during 
the year ended 31 July 2013 is summarised below: 
Total remuneration 
2012/13 (£000) 
Number in band
(2011/12 in brackets) 
501–600 1(1)
601–700 1(1)
701–800 3(2)
801–900 0(1)
901–1,000 1(1)
Share awards to other senior executives 
Executive Committee members, who are not on the Board, are 
eligible to participate in the LTIP, ESOP and OSP. Participants 
are selected by the Committee at its discretion and upon the 
recommendation of the Group Chief Executive. The Committee 
considers annually the size of each grant, determined by individual 
performance, the individual’s ability to contribute to the achievement 
of the performance conditions, and market levels of remuneration.  
The next levels of senior management are eligible for awards under 
the OSP. The grant of an award under the OSP is based upon the 
recommendation of the individual’s manager, taking into account 
his or her performance and development potential. Vesting of 
awards under the OSP typically happens after three years. Awards 
under the OSP are subject to continued employment with the 
Company at the end of the vesting period. They are designed to act 
as a retention incentive whilst also encouraging participants to hold 
equity in the Company, thereby creating a better alignment with the 
interests of shareholders. 
Shareholding guidelines for other senior executives 
Executive Committee members are subject to share ownership 
guidelines in the same way as the Executive Directors. Share 
ownership may be achieved by retaining shares received as a result 
of participating in a Company share plan, after taking into account 
any shares sold to finance option exercises or to pay an income tax 
or National Insurance liability (or overseas equivalent). These levels 
of shareholding are usually expected to be achieved within three to 
five years from the date on which the individual is included in the 
programme. The Committee reviews and notes progress made 
towards meeting these targets during the year. 
This report has been approved by the Board and is signed 
on its behalf by the chairman of the Remuneration Committee.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
Year-ended 31 July 2013 
1. Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
as adopted by the European Union, including interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and 
its committees.  
The Company is incorporated in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and is headquartered in Switzerland. 
Accounting developments and changes 
There have been no changes to Group accounting policies during the year ended 31 July 2013, other than incorporation of the 
amendment to IAS 1 (presentation of items of other comprehensive income). A summary of the principal accounting policies applied 
by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set out in note 37 on pages 144 to 150. 
Certain new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards have been published that will be mandatory for the Group 
with effect from 1 August 2013.  
 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 
The effect of the above standard has been assessed by the Group and is not material.  
 IAS 19 Employee benefits 
An amended standard on employee benefits, IAS 19, requires the net funding cost of retirement benefit obligations to be calculated using 
the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation. If the Group had adopted this amended standard in the year ended 
31 July 2013 its financing costs would have been increased by approximately £13 million.  
There are no other new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards that have been published that would be 
expected to have a material impact on the Group.  
Choices permitted by IFRS 
The Group has elected to apply hedge accounting to some of its financial instruments, and to recognise its liability for retirement benefit 
obligations in full. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
Many of the Group’s accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. 
The following areas are most sensitive to the accuracy of such estimates. 
Impairment of trade receivables 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made when management estimates that the expected present value of future cash flows 
recoverable in respect of these receivables is less than the carrying amount. Determining the amount of such provision requires estimating 
the amount and timing of such future cash flows, giving consideration to the financial condition of the debtor and the probability that the 
debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation. The actual amounts of cash recovered may differ materially from the estimated 
amounts on which the provision is based. 
The amount relating to continuing operations charged to the income statement in 2013 in respect of impaired receivables represented 
0.19% of revenue (2012: 0.25%). The Group held a provision for impairment of receivables at 31 July 2013 amounting to £46 million 
(2012: £46 million). 
Valuation of inventories 
Inventory comprises finished goods. Provisions are made against slow-moving, obsolete and damaged inventories for which the net 
realisable value is estimated to be less than the cost. Inventories which are damaged or obsolete are written down as identified. The risk 
of obsolescence of slow-moving inventory is assessed by comparing the level of inventory held to future sales projected on the basis of 
historical experience. The actual realisable value of inventory may differ materially from the estimated value on which the provision is based.  
The Group held provisions in respect of inventory balances at 31 July 2013 amounting to £127 million (2012: £116 million).

1. Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued 
Impairment of assets 
The Group reviews assets that have an indefinite useful life at least annually to assess whether their recoverable amount exceeds their 
carrying value. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, which in turn is the present 
value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is assessed on the basis of the value in use of the cash generating unit 
or group of cash generating units (“CGU”) to which they are attributed. The estimate of value in use, and hence the outcome of the 
impairment test, is sensitive to the assumptions made about the revenue growth, trading margin and the level of working capital required to 
support trading over the next five years, the long-term growth rate of their market, and the discount rate considered appropriate to reflect 
the time value of money and any risks specific to the CGU that are not reflected in the cash flows. 
The estimates of value in use assumed long-term nominal growth rates in a range between 1.1% and 2.5%, and pre-tax discount rates in a 
range from 11% to 14%. Underlying those rates was an estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 8.5%. As disclosed in 
notes 12 and 13, a charge of £10 million has been incurred in the Central Europe region in respect of the impairment of goodwill and other 
intangible assets at 31 July 2013 (2012: £353 million). 
During the year ended 31 July 2012, the Group recognised impairment charges against the carrying value of goodwill and acquired 
intangibles in its Danish businesses, Stark and Silvan, and its Norwegian business, Neumann Bygg. On the basis of the updated estimates 
and assumptions made in the 2013 impairment review, the value in use of these businesses exceeds carrying value by 27% (£94 million), 
11% (£12 million) and 17% (£10 million) respectively. The estimated value in use of these businesses is most sensitive to the forecast sales 
growth. The sales growth assumptions for Stark, Silvan and Neumann Bygg are compound annual growth rates over the 5 years of 3.6%, 
4.5% and 3.2% respectively. If all other assumptions are held constant, shortfalls in the annual revenue growth rates of 4.2%, 1.5% and 
3.2% respectively can be sustained before further goodwill charges would arise. 
If the estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital were increased to 9.5%, but all other assumptions on which the estimates 
of value in use are based were held constant, a minor impairment charge of £2 million would arise against the carrying value of the goodwill 
of Silvan.  
Rebates receivable from vendors 
The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors that provide for rebates from the cost of inventory purchased. Many of these 
agreements apply to purchases in a calendar year rather than financial year, and under certain agreements the rebate rises as a proportion 
of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases are made. The Group adjusts the cost of inventory purchased to reflect estimated 
rebates receivable, which can depend on the projected volume, value and mix of purchases from a vendor through to the end of the 
qualifying period. Actual rebates receivable from vendors may differ materially from the estimates on which the cost of inventory is based. 
Provisions for self-insured risks 
The Group retains layers of certain of its insurable risks, principally US casualty and global property damage, which are managed by a 
captive insurance company, Wolseley Insurance Limited. Certain of the retained risks are subject to an annual actuarial assessment. 
The provision for self-insured risks represents an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding 
claims and claims incurred but not reported. The actual cost of settling these liabilities may differ materially from the estimated amounts 
on which the provision is based. At 31 July 2013, the provision for claims arising from this insurance was £51 million (2012: £46 million). 
Provisions for legal, environmental and related exposures and contingent liabilities 
The Group makes provisions for known and potential legal claims and environmental and other matters, including asbestos related litigation 
and product liability claims, where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate may be made of the likely 
outcome of the dispute or matter. In establishing such provisions the Group takes into account the relevant facts and circumstances of 
each matter and considers the advice of its legal and other professional advisers. The ultimate liability for potential legal claims and other 
matters may be dependent upon the discovery of facts that are currently uncertain, the outcome of litigation proceedings and possible 
settlement negotiations, and the actual cost of settlement may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provisions are 
based. At 31 July 2013, legal, environmental and other provisions amounted to £147 million (2012: £149 million). Where the Group has 
insurance cover that it is virtually certain will settle a provision then it recognises an equivalent asset in trade and other receivables.  
The Group may also become involved in legal proceedings or commercial disputes in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable 
estimate of the financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings or disputes. In these cases, where material, 
appropriate disclosure would be included in the financial statements but no provision would be made and no contingent liability can 
be quantified.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
1. Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued 
Provisions for onerous leases 
When the present value of the future cash flows receivable from the operation of leased assets is less than the present value of the rental 
payments to which the Group is committed, the Group applies the shortfall firstly against the carrying amount of the assets (in the case 
of finance leases) and then provides for any further onerous element of the contract (for all leases). Determining the amount of such a 
provision requires estimating the future net cash flows receivable in respect of these assets, and in the particular case where the leased 
properties are vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the property will remain vacant, the cost of any works required 
to enhance its marketability and the rental income receivable when the property is sublet. Actual cash flows paid and received may 
differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provisions are based. At 31 July 2013, the provision for onerous leases was 
£39 million (2012: £39 million). 
Taxation 
Accruals for current tax are based on management’s interpretation of country-specific tax law, and require judgements about the likelihood 
that tax positions taken will be sustained. Where management considers it probable that the tax position will be sustained, each material 
tax benefit is reviewed to assess whether it should be recognised in full, or whether provision should be made for a potential settlement 
through negotiation. All such provisions are included in current liabilities. Any estimated exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for 
in the tax charge. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are accounted for 
using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements. These actuarial 
assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates, and are disclosed in note 25. 
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect the 
balance sheet and income statement. The Group considers that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate and life expectancy. 
The Group has estimated that a decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would increase the liability by £155 million, an increase of 0.5% 
would decrease the liability by £139 million. Increasing the estimate of life expectancy by one year would increase the liability by £41 million. 
2. Segmental analysis 
The Group’s reportable segments are the operating businesses overseen by distinct divisional management teams responsible for their 
performance. All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and heating products 
and building materials. 
The Group’s business is not highly seasonal half on half. The Group’s customer base is highly diversified, with no individually significant 
customer. 
The French Wood Solutions business has been managed and reported within the Central Europe region since 1 February 2013. The UK 
B2C business moved under the responsibility of USA management. All prior period comparative figures have been restated to show like-
for-like comparison.

4. Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, and are presented separately in the 
income statement to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. These exclude impairments of acquired intangibles 
which are also presented separately in the income statement. Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include the 
restructuring of business activities and gains or losses on the disposal of businesses. If provisions have been made for exceptional items 
in previous years, then any write-back of those provisions is shown as exceptional. 
Exceptional items included in operating profit from continuing operations are analysed by purpose as follows:

After the reporting date the Directors proposed a final ordinary dividend of £121 million (44 pence per share) and a special dividend of 
£300 million. These dividends are subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and therefore, in accordance with 
accounting standards, they have been excluded from these financial statements.  
9. Non-GAAP performance measures 
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles. It is a 
non-GAAP measure. As explained on page 156, the Group considers that trading profit, and other performance measures based on it, 
including EBITDA before exceptional items, present valuable additional information to users of the financial statements.

Headline profit after tax from continuing operations  501 477
Applying the adjusted tax expense of £201 million to the profit before tax, exceptional items and the amortisation of acquired intangibles 
of £702 million gives an effective tax rate of 29% (2011/12: 25%).  Wolseley plc

The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by Employee Benefit Trusts, was 
275.6 million (2012: 283.3 million). The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase 
the weighted average number of shares in issue to 278.2 million (2012: 286.2 million).  
On 29 November 2012, the shares of Wolseley plc were consolidated on a 22 for 23 basis. The impact of the share consolidation on 
the weighted average number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share is 12 million. Further details in respect 
of the share consolidation are given in note 26.

As explained on page 147, impairment tests were performed for all of the Group’s cash generating units or groups of cash generating units 
(“CGUs”) during the year ended 31 July 2013. These impairment reviews have resulted in the recording of an impairment charge of £9 million 
to goodwill and £1 million to other acquired intangibles of Wasco in the Central Europe segment, reflecting the deterioration of trading 
conditions in the Netherlands in the second half of the year.

The standard rate of UK corporation tax in the year changed from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 and will change to 21% from 
1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015. UK deferred tax is therefore recognised at the reduced rate of 20%. 
Deferred tax assets in the UK have been recognised on the basis that the UK is forecast to have sufficient taxable profits in the future to 
enable these to be utilised. 
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling £115 million (2012: £23 million) that have not been recognised 
on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. The losses are in the UK, relating to capital disposals, France relating to asset 
impairments that have not been recognised on the basis that France is not forecasting to have sufficient taxable profits in the future to 
utilise them and Luxembourg relating to trading losses that have also not been recognised on the basis that Luxembourg is not forecast 
to have sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise them. None of the losses expire.  
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries. However, tax 
may arise on £176 million (2012: £176 million) of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal 
and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

individually determined not to be collectible in full, because of known financial difficulties of the debtor or evidence of default or delinquency 
in payment, amounting to £33 million at 31 July 2013 (2012: £37 million); and a provision based on historic experience of non-collectability 
of receivables, amounting to £13 million at 31 July 2013 (2012: £9 million).

The carrying value of the senior unsecured loan notes of £491 million comprises a par value of £437 million and a fair value adjustment 
of £54 million (2012: £542 million, £475 million and £67 million respectively). The fair value adjustment arose during the period until 
30 November 2011, when the loan notes were hedged by a series of interest rate swaps. From 30 November 2011 the hedge relationship 
was de-designated, and the fair value adjustment is being released to the income statement on an amortised cost basis over the period 
to maturity of the notes.  Wolseley plc

22. Financial instruments and financial risk management 
There have been no significant changes during the year to the Group’s policies on accounting for, valuing and managing the risk of financial 
instruments. These policies are summarised on pages 149 to 156. 
Capital structure 
To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure to current and forecast trading, the Group’s principal measure of financial gearing is 
the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items. The Group aims to operate with investment grade credit metrics and ensure this 
ratio does not exceed 1 to 2 times. The Group’s main borrowing facilities contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA before exceptional items to 3.5:1.  
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to 
reduce debt.  
Liquidity 
During the year the Group completed a £200 million revolving credit facility with a 3 year maturity. In addition a £329 million (US$ 500 million) 
securitisation of Ferguson’s trade receivables with a maturity of 3¼ years was agreed. Neither of the facilities was drawn at year end.

Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and 
claims incurred but not reported on certain risks retained by the Group (principally US casualty and global property damage).  
The environmental and legal provision includes £51 million (31 July 2012: £52 million) for the estimated liability for asbestos litigation on a 
discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 3.3% (2012: 2.2%). This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2013 
based on advice from independent professional advisers. The Group has insurance that it currently believes is sufficient cover for the 
estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables. Based on current estimates, 
the amount of performing insurance cover significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material profit or cash flow 
impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future. 
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs and future lease rentals on closed branches. In determining 
the provision for onerous leases, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates. 
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately three years. 
Other provisions include warranty and separation costs relating to businesses disposed of and rental commitments on vacant properties 
and dilapidations on leased properties. The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately four years.

The curtailment gain includes £7 million of exceptional gain arising from a change in assumptions in the Tobler pension scheme in 
Switzerland. Following consultation, the UK pension scheme will be closed to future accrual as at 31 December 2013, and will be replaced 
by a new defined contribution scheme. No curtailment gain will arise from these changes.

The expected long-term rates of return for equities have been established by actuarial advice. The expected equity returns can be 
considered as a risk free rate of return (determined by reference to government bond rates in the countries in which the plans are based) 
plus a risk premium to reflect the additional risks associated with equities. For the UK scheme the expected return implies a premium of 
3.2% per year as at 31 July 2013 (2012: 3.9%) over the expected return from government bonds. For the principal overseas schemes in 
the USA, Canada and Switzerland a similar approach has been adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond rates after taking 
actuarial advice.

The Group acquired 100% of the following businesses in the year ended 31 July 2013. All these businesses are engaged in the distribution 
of plumbing and heating products or building materials. These transactions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.

The fair value adjustments for the period ended 31 July 2013 are provisional figures, being the best estimates currently available. 
Further adjustments to goodwill may be necessary when additional information is available concerning some of the judgmental areas. 
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the new markets and product ranges to which the 
Group has gained access, and to additional profitability and operating efficiencies in respect of existing markets. 
The acquisitions contributed £195 million to revenue, £5 million to trading profit and £3 million to the Group’s operating profit for the period 
between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. It is not practicable to disclose profit before and after tax, as the Group 
manages its borrowings as a portfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition.  
If each acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been £13,260 million and Group 
trading profit would have been £727 million. It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to equity shareholders, 
as stated above. It is not practicable to disclose operating profit as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets that would 
have been acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

Operating lease payments mainly represent rent payable by the Group for certain of its properties. Some of these operating lease 
arrangements have renewal options and rental escalation clauses, though the effect of these is not material. No arrangements have 
been entered into for contingent rental payments. 
The commitments shown above include commitments for onerous leases which have already been provided for. At 31 July 2013 
provisions include an amount of £39 million (2012: £39 million) in respect of minimum lease payments for such onerous leases net of 
sublease payments expected to be received. The total minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable 
subleases at 31 July 2013 is £17 million (2012: £36 million). 
35. Contingent liabilities 
Group companies are, from time to time, subject to certain claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business in relation to, 
among other things, the suitability of products, contract and commercial disputes and disputes with employees. Provision is made if, on 
the basis of current information and professional advice, liabilities are considered likely to arise. In the case of unfavourable outcomes the 
Group may benefit from applicable insurance recoveries. Certain claims arise as a result of the unintentional supply of defective products 
and these claims are usually the responsibility of the manufacturer, though defence and other costs may also be incurred by the Group. 
Mislabelled gaskets 
In December 2011 the Group’s US business wrote to a number of customers in the USA and Canada in relation to the unintentional supply 
of gaskets which were mislabelled by a former supplier, Lortech Rubber Inc. of Canada, as being non-asbestos. A number of customers 
had found asbestos in gaskets above the level at which they can be classified as non-asbestos. Independent expert advice confirmed that 
there was no health or safety risk arising from the handling, installation and use of the gaskets. Well-established protocols are maintained 
by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration to ensure the safe removal of all types of gaskets. The performance of the 
gaskets is not affected and the expert advice is to leave the gaskets in place until the end of their lives. The supply of these products in 
the USA and Canada is legal. No significant product liability claims have arisen from this matter to date. 
Warranties and guarantees in relation to business disposals 
Following a review of the appropriate allocation of the Group’s resources in 2009, the Group has disposed of a number of non-core 
businesses and various Group companies have provided certain standard warranties and guarantees to acquirers and other third parties, 
including warranties regarding financial statements and taxation. Provision is made where the Group considers that a liability is likely to 
crystallise, though it is possible that claims in respect of which no provisions has been made could be received in the future. Group 
companies have also guaranteed certain property and other obligations which could be called in an event of default. As at the date of this 
report there are no significant outstanding claims in relation to business disposals. 
Environmental 
The operations of certain Group companies, particularly those engaged in processing, converting or treating building materials, are subject 
to specific environmental regulations. From time to time the Group conducts preliminary investigations through third parties to assess 
potential risks including potential soil or groundwater contamination of sites. Where an obligation to remediate contamination arises then 
this is provided for, though future liabilities could arise from sites for which no provision is made. 
Outcome 
The outcome of claims and litigation to which Group companies are party cannot readily be foreseen as, in some cases, the facts are 
unclear, further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case, or they are part of continuing legal proceedings. However, based 
on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation 
is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.

37. Additional information 
Group accounting policies 
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set 
out below. 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available-
for-sale investments and financial assets and liabilities held for trading. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, and are presented separately in the 
income statement to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. These exclude impairments of acquired intangibles 
which are also presented separately in the income statement. Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include the 
restructuring of business activities and gains or losses on the disposal of businesses. 
Consolidation 
The consolidated financial information includes the results of the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 July 2013. 
The trading results of businesses operations are included in profit on ordinary activities from continuing operations from the date 
of acquisition or up to the date of sale. 
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated 
on consolidation. 
Discontinued operations 
When the Group has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business component that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations it classifies such operations as discontinued. The post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operations 
is shown as a single line on the face of the income statement, separate from the other results of the Group.  
Foreign currencies 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the subsidiary undertaking operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the parent company. 
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling during the 
relevant financial period. 
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the period end. 
Exchange differences arising between the translation into sterling of the net assets of these subsidiary undertakings at rates ruling at the 
beginning and end of the year are recognised in the currency translation reserve as are exchange differences on foreign currency 
borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets. 
Changes in the fair value and the final settlement value of derivative financial instruments, entered into to hedge foreign currency net assets 
and that satisfy the hedging conditions of IAS 39, are recognised in the currency translation reserve (see the separate accounting policy on 
derivative financial instruments). 
In the event that an overseas subsidiary undertaking is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is determined 
after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the subsidiary undertaking concerned. 
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the 
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. All currency translation differences are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency 
borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets as detailed above.   Wolseley plc

37. Additional information continued 
Group accounting policies continued 
Business combinations 
The introduction of a new holding company in 2011 constituted a group reconstruction and was accounted for using merger accounting 
principles. In all other cases the Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at 
the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. Acquisition related costs are expensed. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is 
recognised directly in the income statement. 
Revenue 
Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and services falling within the Group’s ordinary activities, excluding intra-group 
sales, estimated and actual sales returns, trade and early settlement discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes. 
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred to the 
customer. The risks and rewards of ownership of goods are deemed to have been transferred when the goods are shipped to, or are 
picked up, by the customer. 
Revenue from services is recognised when the service provided to the customer has been completed. 
Customer loyalty credits are accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in which they are granted. A portion of the fair 
value of the consideration received is allocated to the loyalty credits and recognised over the period that loyalty credits are redeemed. 
Revenue from the provision of goods and services is only recognised when the amounts to be recognised are fixed or determinable and 
collectability is reasonably assured. 
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales includes purchased goods, the cost of bringing inventory to its present location and condition, and labour and overheads 
attributable to assembly and construction services. 
Vendor rebates 
The Group enters into arrangements with certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates. These purchase rebates are accrued as 
earned and are recorded initially as a reduction in inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. 
Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the 
acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings is included in intangible assets. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses 
on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
All goodwill has arisen from business combinations. On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was 
allocated to cash generating units and groups of cash generating units (“CGUs”). These are independent sources of income streams, and 
represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at 
country, divisional, brand or regional level. Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs 
that are expected to benefit from that business combination. No CGUs are larger than the reporting segments determined in accordance 
with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”.  Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 146

37. Additional information continued

Other intangible assets 
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. 
The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. 
Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised 
separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is 
calculated using the reducing balance method for customer relationships and the straight-line method for other intangible assets. 
The cost of the intangible assets is amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
Customer relationships 4 – 25 years 
Trade names and brands 1 – 15 years 
Other   1 – 4 years 
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and 
is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs include software licences, consulting costs 
attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the 
development, design and implementation of the computer software. Costs in respect of training and data conversion are expensed as 
incurred. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to the income 
statement over its estimated useful life as follows: 
Software   3 – 5 years 
Software assets are generally either purchases from third parties or internally generated. Other intangible assets arise on business 
combinations. 
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) 
PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, except for land and assets in the course of 
construction, which are not depreciated and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. In addition, subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised 
as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group 
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the 
financial period in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated 
useful life, as follows: 
Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 20 – 50 years 
Operating leasehold improvements  over the period of the lease 
Plant and machinery   7 – 10 years 
Computer hardware   3 – 5 years 
Fixtures and fittings   5 – 7 years 
Motor vehicles    4 years 
The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date. 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the long-term construction or production of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. 
Leased assets 
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have transferred to 
the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives. The asset is recorded 
at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease. The capital elements of 
future obligations under finance leases are included in liabilities in the balance sheet and analysed between current and non-current amounts. 
The interest elements of future obligations under finance leases are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and 
represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding in accordance with the effective interest rate method. 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. The cost of operating 
leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the periods of the leases.  Wolseley plc

37. Additional information continued 
Group accounting policies continued 
Assets and disposal groups held for sale  
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business. 
Where a group of assets and their directly associated liabilities are to be disposed of in a single transaction, such disposal groups are also 
classified as held for sale. For this to be the case, the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, 
and management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset or disposal group which, when initiated, was expected 
to result in a completed sale within 12 months. Assets that are classified as held for sale are not depreciated. Assets or disposal groups 
that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.  
Impairment of assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation or depreciation and are tested for impairment 
annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are 
subject to amortisation or depreciation and assets under construction are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use. The value in use is in most cases based on the discounted present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or from the individual asset or asset group.  
The value in use calculations in respect of CGUs use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts approved by management. 
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are extrapolated after the five year period at an estimated average long-term 
nominal growth rate for each market (ranging from 1.1% to 2.5%), and discounted back to present value. The discount rate assumptions 
use an estimate of the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.5%, based on the five year historic volatility of Wolseley 
shares and on benchmark interest rates. The pre-tax discount rate which ranges from 11% to 14% (2012: 11% to 14%) has been applied 
to the risk adjusted cash flows of each CGU. The carrying amounts of goodwill and acquired intangibles for CGUs which have a significant 
proportion of the Group’s total are: Blended Branches (USA) £272 million, Beijer (Nordic) £156 million, Stark (Nordic) £141 million, 
Waterworks (USA) £107 million and Starkki (Nordic) £102 million. 
Inventories 
Inventories, which all comprise goods purchased for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined 
using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method or the average cost method as appropriate to the nature of the transactions in those items of 
inventory. The cost of goods purchased for resale includes import and custom duties, transport and handling costs, freight and packing 
costs and other attributable costs less trade discounts, rebates and other subsidies. It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is 
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Examples of such evidence include significant 
financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in 
payments. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. Trade 
receivables are written off against the provision when recoverability is assessed as being remote. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited to the income statement. 
Provisions 
Provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs, product and service warranties and legal claims are recognised when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Such provisions are measured at the present value of 
management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The discount rate used 
to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses. 
Provisions for insurance represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and 
claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date on certain risks retained by the Group.  Wolseley plc

Retirement benefit obligations 
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
For defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits, the cost is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method and 
is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the recommendations of 
independent qualified actuaries. The current service cost of defined benefit plans is recorded within operating profit. The total expected 
return from pension scheme assets less the total interest on pension scheme liabilities is recorded within finance costs. Past service costs 
resulting from enhanced benefits are recorded within operating profit and recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, or 
immediately if the benefits have vested. Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns 
on the plan assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income 
in the period in which they occur. The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each 
plan of the present value of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less any past service costs not yet recognised, less the fair 
value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date. Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any 
unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction 
in future contributions.  
Taxation 
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account any adjustments arising from prior years. 
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Share capital 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are 
cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.  Wolseley plc

Share-based payments 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s executive share option, long-term incentive, employee share 
purchase and ordinary share plan schemes. The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the 
fair value of the awards, measured using Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is 
determined at the date of grant (including the impact of any non-vesting conditions such as a requirement for employees to save) and is not 
subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified. For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is 
determined at the date of grant and is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled.  
The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated by the binomial methodology for all schemes 
except the long term incentive scheme, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used. The fair value of shares granted under the Ordinary 
Share Plan and Restricted Share Plan was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value 
of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period. 
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: 
 Executive Share Options  Employee Share Options  
Long Term 
Incentive Schemes 
 2013 2012  2013 2012  2013 2012 
Risk free interest rate 1.1% 1.4% 0.4% 0.7%  0.7% 1.4%
Expected dividend yield 2.9% 3.8% 2.4% 3.2%  3.0% 3.8%
Expected volatility 42% 45% 35% 44%  33% 41%
Expected life 5.7 years 5.7 years 1–7 years 1–7 years  3 years 3 years
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of extraordinary volatility 
due to the Group’s capital reorganisation and rights issue in 2009. Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the 
exercise pattern. 
The principal assumptions for the Ordinary Share Plan are an expected dividend yield of approximately 2.7% and an expected life 
of three years. 
Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected 
and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions. 
Dividends payable 
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
shareholders of the Company (generally in the case of the final dividend) or paid (in the case of interim dividends). 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance 
sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and no practice of net settlement with cash balances. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from 
the business activities of the Group and the financing of those activities. There is no trading activity in derivative financial instruments. 
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of derivative financial instruments, the Group documents the relationship 
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk management objective and the strategy underlying the 
proposed transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently 
on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. Where 
derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39, changes in their fair values are recognised 
in the income statement.   Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 150
 
 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
37. Additional information continued 
Group accounting policies continued 
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment 
hedges. Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted by 
the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement 
where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest 
method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity. Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge 
or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the 
hedged risk are recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement. When the hedged item is recognised in the financial 
statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item 
results in a non-financial asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains 
in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified 
as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance 
sheet date.

Financial instruments by measurement basis 
Financial instruments in the categories “derivatives used for hedging”, “fair value through profit or loss” and “available-for-sale” are all 
measured in the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value measurements can be classified in the following hierarchy: 
 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1); 
 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (level 2); 
 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). 
The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 July 2013 and 31 July 2012:

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The fair value 
of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation 
techniques. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable 
yield curves. The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using market prices at the 
balance sheet date. 
The Group’s other financial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value. Other receivables include an amount of £50 million 
(2012: £52 million) which has been discounted at a rate of 3.3% (2012: 2.2%) due to the long-term nature of the receivable. Because other 
current assets and liabilities are either of short maturity or bear floating rate interest, their fair values approximate to book values. The book

Financial instruments: risk management policies 
The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations, and the financial instruments which fund them. The main 
risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Group has well defined 
policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied 
during the financial years ended 31 July 2012 and 31 July 2013. By the nature of its business the Group also has trade credit and 
commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated to operating businesses. There has been no change since the year 
end in the major financial risks faced by the Group. 
Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below. When the Group enters into derivative 
transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts), the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain 
interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is, and has been throughout the period 
under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.  Wolseley plc

Capital risk management 
The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise cash flows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and 
borrowings from banks and other financial institutions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may pay a special 
dividend, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and capital expenditure included in its 
strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin.  
The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outflows including interest payable in respect of its trade and other payables 
and bank borrowings on an undiscounted basis. The principal assumptions are that floating rate interest is calculated using the prevailing 
interest rate at the balance sheet date, and cash flows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date. 
These cash flows can be analysed by maturity as follows:

Foreign currency risk 
The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the 
operations are located. Approximately 52% of the Group’s revenue is in US dollars and 15% in Euros. The Group does not have significant 
transactional foreign currency cash flow exposures. However, those that do arise may be hedged with either forward contracts or currency 
options. The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only temporary effect. 
The Group’s policy is to adjust the currencies in which its net debt is denominated to materially match the currencies in which its trading 
profit is generated. Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used 
in the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in the five year summary on 
page 167. The net effect of currency translation was to increase revenue by £59 million (0.4%) (2012: decrease of £47 million, or 0.3%) 
and to increase trading profit by £5 million (0.6%) (2012: no impact). These currency effects reflect a movement of the average sterling 
exchange rate against US dollars, Euros and Canadian dollars as follows: 
 
2013
Strengthening/ 
(weakening)
of sterling 
2012
Strengthening/ 
(weakening)

US dollars (1.0%) (1.2%)
Euros 0.7% 2.8%
Canadian dollars (1.1%) 0.3%
The Group has financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies which have been designated as hedges of the net investment in its 
overseas subsidiaries. The principal value of those financial instruments designated as hedges at the balance sheet date was £1,539 million 
(2012: £452 million). The loss on translation of these financial instruments into sterling of £43 million (2012: gain of £7 million) has been 
taken to the translation reserve. 
At 31 July 2013 the Group had the following short-term currency swaps and forward contracts which were designated and effective as 
hedges of overseas operations.

Interest rate risk 
To manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Group’s policy is normally that between 0% and 50% of projected 
borrowings required during the next two years should be at fixed rates. However, this percentage is regularly reviewed by the Board and 
82% of loans were at fixed rates at 31 July 2013. The Group borrows in the desired currencies principally at rates determined by reference 
to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR. Rates which reset at least every 12 months 
are regarded as floating rates, and the Group then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile. 
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at Treasury Committee and Board meetings. The Treasury Committee gives prior 
approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements. 
During November 2011, the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest payable on US$664 million of 
notional principal. The contracts expire between November 2015 and November 2020 and the fixed interest rates range between 1.51% 
and 2.94%. These contracts have been held since inception at fair value through profit or loss. With effect from 1 December 2011 interest 
rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest receivable on notional principal of US$729 million have been classified as held at fair value 
through profit or loss. The contracts expire between November 2015 and November 2020 and the fixed interest rates range between 
5.05% and 5.32% (2012: 4.93% and 5.32%).

The Group’s private placement borrowings are at fixed rates. At 31 July 2011 interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest 
receivable on notional principal of $729 million were designated as hedges of the fair values of these borrowings. The movement in fair 
value of these interest rate swaps between 1 August 2011 and 30 November 2011 was analysed into a proportion that was effective as a 
hedge, and a proportion that was ineffective; both portions were charged to the income statement with the effective portion offsetting the 
change in fair value of the hedged borrowings (see note 5). With effect from 1 December 2011 the contracts were held at fair value through 
profit or loss.

Credit risk 
Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers. There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay 
outstanding balances. At 31 July 2013 the maximum exposure to credit risk was £1,980 million (2012: £1,846 million) of which nil 
(2012: £6 million) is secured against properties under construction or completed properties awaiting sale. 
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables. Significant outstanding and 
overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis. In some cases protection is 
provided through credit insurance arrangements. All of the major businesses use professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases field-
based. Appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis. Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables 
is limited as the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. Accordingly, management consider that there is no further credit risk 
provision required above the current provision for impairment.  
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions, and enters into certain contracts (such as interest 
rate swaps) which entitle the Group to receive future cash flows from financial institutions. These transactions give rise to credit risk on 
amounts due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of £403 million (2012: £888 million). This risk is managed by setting credit 
and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties. The limits are approved by the Treasury Committee and ratings are 
monitored regularly. 
Market price risk 
The Group monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on financial instruments over various periods of a range of 
possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates. The Group has estimated that an increase of one percentage point in the principal 
interest rates to which it is exposed would result in a charge to the income statement of £2 million, arising from changes in the fair value of 
interest rate swaps. The Group has estimated that a weakening of sterling by ten per cent against all the currencies in which the Group 
does business would result in a charge to equity of £57 million (2012: £14 million), arising from the translation of borrowings denominated 
in foreign currency, and a credit of £7 million to the income statement, arising from the retranslation of interest rate swaps held at fair value 
through profit or loss (2012: £8m). 
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit risk or 
commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Group’s exposure to any of the macro-economic 
variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices of commodities. 
Additional information about non-GAAP measures of performance 
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles. It is a 
non-GAAP measure. Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, and are 
presented separately in the income statement to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. In addition, the current 
businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition. Operating profit includes only the 
amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 31 July 2004 and 
as such does not reflect equally the performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 (where no amortisation or impairment of 
acquired intangibles was recognised), businesses that have developed organically (where no intangibles are attributed) and those 
businesses more recently acquired (where amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is charged).  
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing the Group’s 
performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able to influence and 
on a basis consistent across the Group. The Group uses trading profit and certain key performance indicators, calculated by reference to 
trading profit, for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for its internal assessment of the operating performance of individual 
businesses within the Group.

Description of plans 
The principal scheme operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final 
or the average of the last five years of pensionable salaries. The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. The scheme’s 
retirement benefits are funded by a salary sacrifice arrangement from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies. 
Employees’ salary sacrifice is either 5% or 8% of earnings depending on the level of benefits accruing. The Group contribution rate is 
calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary. This scheme was closed to new entrants 
in 2009. Following consultation, the Group Retirement Benefits Plan will be closed to future accrual as at 31 December 2013 and will 
be replaced by a new defined contribution scheme.  
The principal schemes operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance with US 401k 
rules. Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans. The Group also operates two defined 
benefit schemes in the United States which are closed to new entrants. One of the schemes is funded and the majority of assets are held 
in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies. The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee 
in conjunction with a defined contribution scheme. The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) Method as agreed with 
independent consulting actuaries.  
In Canada defined benefit schemes and a defined contribution scheme are operated. Most of the Canadian defined benefit schemes are 
funded. The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries. 
In Europe both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated. Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are 
calculated in accordance with actuarial advice. 
Investment policy 
The Group’s investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally and, if relevant, by the trustees of the plan, and 
takes account of the relevant statutory requirements. The Group’s objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return 
in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities. 
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the 
target rate of return. Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing 
cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and within acceptable boundaries of risk. 
For the UK scheme, the policy is to invest approximately 75% of the assets in equities and 25% in other asset classes, principally bonds. 
The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Group. For the overseas schemes 
the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested 
in cash and bonds.

Additional information about share-based payment plans 
The Group operates eight share option plans of which four are discretionary plans (collectively, the “Executive Option Schemes”) and four 
are all employee sharesave plans (collectively the “Employee Saving Option Schemes”). Four plans were adopted as part of the Company’s 
redomiciliation after approval by shareholders in November 2010. 
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth 
in headline earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the 
same period by at least 9% and consequently vest over a period of three years. Awards granted under the Employee Savings Option 
Schemes vest over periods ranging from three to seven years, except for awards granted under the US sharesave plan, which vest over a 
one-year period. 
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Scheme (“LTIS”) and the Wolseley Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) for senior executives. 
Under the LTIS, executives are awarded a variable number of shares depending on the level of total shareholder return over the next three 
years relative to that of the FTSE 100. The vesting period is three years. The maximum award under the LTIS is determined at grant date 
and then adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the market performance condition. Under the RSP, executives are granted free 
shares. The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures other than retained employment. 
Since 28 September 2011 the Group has operated the Wolseley Group Ordinary Share Plan 2011 (the “Ordinary Share Plan”) for 
employees, not key management personnel, of the Group. Under the Ordinary Share Plan, employees can be granted a variable number 
of awards in any form or combination of options, restricted share awards, conditional share awards or phantom share awards up to 
a maximum of 100% of their current salary. The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures other than retained 
employment. 
Additional information about employee benefit trusts 
Two Employee Benefit Trusts have been established in connection with the Company’s discretionary share option plans and long term 
incentive plans. Bedell Trust Company Limited have been trustees of the Jersey trust since 16 March 2012, when three previous trusts 
were amalgamated. RBC Trust Company (Delaware) Ltd have been the trustees of the US trust since it was established on 24 October 2012. 
During the year the trusts purchased 3,822,612 shares at a cumulative cost of £110 million, and issued to employees exercising options 
2,064,842 shares at a weighted average cost of £73 million, receiving £7 million in respect of the exercise price of options. At 31 July 2013 
the trusts held 3,692,639 shares with a market value of £116 million (2012: 1,934,869 shares with a market value of £45 million). 
Dividends due on shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts are waived in accordance with the provisions of the trust deeds.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
Year ended 31 July 2013 
 
1. Corporate information 
Wolseley plc (the “Company”) was incorporated and registered in Jersey on 28 September 2010 under the Jersey Companies Law as a 
public company limited by shares under the name Wolseley plc with registered number 106605. The principal legislation under which the 
Company operates is the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, and regulations made thereunder. The address of its registered 
office is 26 New Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3RA, Channel Islands. It is headquartered in Switzerland. 
The principal activity of the Company is to act as the ultimate holding company of the Wolseley Group of companies. 
2. Company accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented in compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are 
traded on the London Stock Exchange’s main market. They have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost 
convention, and in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(“UK GAAP”). They are presented in pounds sterling which is the functional currency of the Company. 
The Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that it is included in the consolidated 
financial statements which it has prepared.  
Note 8 (Dividends) on page 119, note 26 (Share capital) on page 136 and note 27 (Share-based payments) on page 137 of the 
Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements form part of these financial statements. 
Foreign currencies 
The cost of the Company’s investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings is translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date of investment. 
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the 
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. All currency translation differences are charged/credited to the profit and loss account. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are recorded at cost less provision for impairment. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether 
there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired. 
Cash at bank and in-hand 
Cash at bank and in-hand includes cash in-hand and deposits held with banks which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and 
intention to net settle with cash balances. 
Share capital 
The Company has one class of shares, ordinary shares, which are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue 
of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax. 
Where the Company or one of the Company’s trusts purchases the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are 
cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently disposed or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. 
Share-based payments 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Company’s executive share option, long-term incentive and share purchase and 
ordinary share plan schemes. The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the 
awards, measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is 
determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified. For 
cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled. 
Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and 
actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions or achieve non-market performance conditions. 
Dividends payable 
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by 
the shareholders of the Company (generally in the case of the final dividend) or paid (in the case of interim dividends).  Wolseley plc

charge in the year (2012: £nil). Amounts charged to subsidiary companies for equity-settled share-based payments amounted to 
£22 million (2012: £21 million). 
13. Contingent liabilities 
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims and legal actions in progress. The Company takes legal advice 
as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice that 
the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made. 
In addition the Company has given certain banks authority to transfer at any time any sum outstanding to its credit against or towards 
satisfaction of its liability to those banks of certain subsidiary undertakings. The Company has also given indemnities and warranties to the 
purchasers of businesses from the Company and certain Group companies in respect of which no material liabilities are expected to arise.  Wolseley plc

Dividend payment methods 
1. Direct payment to your bank: You are encouraged to receive your dividends directly to your bank or building society 
account. This is more convenient and helps reduce the risk of cheques becoming lost or delayed in the post. The associated tax 
voucher will still be sent direct to your registered address. To switch to this method of payment you can download a dividend 
mandate form from the Shareview website (www.shareview.co.uk). Alternatively, you can contact Equiniti by telephone who will 
also be able to assist with any questions you may have. 
2. Overseas payment service: If you live overseas, Equiniti offers an Overseas Payment Service which is available 
in certain countries. This may make it possible to receive dividends direct into your bank account in your local currency*. 
Further information can be found on the Wolseley plc website, Shareview website or you can contact Equiniti by telephone.  
3. Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP): The Company offers a DRIP which gives shareholders the opportunity to use their 
dividend to purchase further Wolseley shares. Instead of receiving cash, shareholders receive as many whole shares as can 
be bought with their dividend, taking into account related purchase costs. Any residual cash will be carried forward and added 
to their next dividend.  
If you wish to join the DRIP, you can download copies of the DRIP terms and conditions and the DRIP mandate form from the 
Shareview website. Simply complete the DRIP mandate form and return it to Equiniti. Should you have any questions on the DRIP 
or wish for a paper mandate form to be sent to you, please contact Equiniti on 0871 384 2934**. Please note that if you wish to 
join the DRIP in time for the 2013 final dividend, our Registrars, Equiniti, must have received the instruction by 8 November 2013. 
Instructions received by Equiniti after this date will be applied to the next dividend. 
* Please note that a payment charge would be deducted from each individual payment before conversion into your local currency. 
** Calls to this number are charged at 8 pence per minute plus network extras. Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, each business day.

Forward-looking statements 
Certain information included in this Annual Report and Accounts is 
forward-looking and involves risks, assumptions and uncertainties 
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Forward-
looking statements cover all matters which are not historical facts 
and include, without limitation, projections relating to results of 
operations and financial conditions and the Company’s plans 
and objectives for future operations, including, without limitation, 
discussions of expected future revenues, financing plans, expected 
expenditures and divestments, risks associated with changes in 
market conditions and pressures on margins, changes in the level 
of litigation, employee motivation, the performance and resilience of 
the Company’s systems and infrastructure, the level of government 
regulation and financial risks (such as fluctuations in exchange and 
interest rates). 
Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-
looking terminology, including terms such as “believes”, “estimates”, 
“anticipates”, “expects”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “plans”, “projects”, 
“goal”, “target”, “aim”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “could” or “should” 
or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable 
terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of 
future performance. All forward-looking statements in this Annual 
Report and Accounts are based upon information known to the 
Company on the date of this Annual Report and Accounts. 
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any particular 
expectation will be met and readers are cautioned not to place 
undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only 
at their respective dates. 
Additionally, forward-looking statements regarding past trends or 
activities should not be taken as a representation that such trends 
or activities will continue in the future. Other than in accordance with 
its legal or regulatory obligations (including under the UK Listing 
Rules, the Prospectus Rules, the Disclosure Rules and the 
Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), the 
Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any 
forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or otherwise. Nothing in this Annual Report and 
Accounts shall exclude any liability under applicable laws that 
cannot be excluded in accordance with such laws.  Credits

The greenhouse gas emissions from the production 
and distribution of this Annual Report and Accounts 
have been neutralised through The Gold Standard 
Basa Magogo offsetting project in South Africa. 
The ﬁrst Gold Standard project of its kind in the 
world, this innovative behaviour-change programme 
teaches local communities in South Africa to burn 
coal differently in order to be more fuel efﬁcient, 
thereby reducing carbon emissions. The technique, 
called Basa Magogo, means “Light it up! 
Grandmother” in Zulu. In addition to the emission 
reductions, the Basa Magogo technique also 
improves visibility and reduces health risks by 
producing less smoke. Wolseley plc

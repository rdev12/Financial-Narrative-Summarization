royalty company with a 
portfolio centred on base 
metals and bulk materials.
Anglo Pacific Group PLC (‘Anglo 
Pacific’, the ‘Company’ or the ‘Group’) 
is the only listed company on the 
London Stock Exchange focused on 
royalties connected with the mining of 
natural resources. Our strategy is to 
build a diversified portfolio of royalties 
and metal streams, focusing on 
accelerating income growth through 
acquiring royalties in cash or near-
term cash producing assets.
It is an objective of the Company to 
pay a substantial portion of these 
royalties and metal streams to 
shareholders as dividends.

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Group 
overview
Strategic 
report Governance
Financial 
statements
Other 
information
A mining royalty is a non-operating interest in a mining 
project that provides the royalty holder with the right to  
a proportion of revenue, profit or production.
Historically, royalties originated as a result of the sale  
of a mineral property, allowing the seller to retain some 
ongoing economic participation in the property.  
However, an increasing number of royalties are now 
created directly by operators and developers as a source 
of finance. A royalty holder is not generally obligated to 
contribute towards operating or capital costs, nor 
environmental or reclamation liabilities.
Types of royalties
The Group’s royalties are mostly 
revenue or production-based 
royalties. Typically, these royalties 
are either Gross Revenue 
royalties or Net Smelter Return 
royalties, each of which can be 
described as follows: 
GRR : Gross Revenue royalty 
A GRR entitles the royalty holder 
to a fixed portion of the gross 
revenues generated from the 
sales of mineral production from 
a property. In calculating a GRR 
payment, deductions, if any, 
applied by the property owner  
to reduce the royalty payment 
are usually minimal, and GRRs 
are therefore the simplest form 
of royalty to account for and 
implement.
NSR : Net Smelter Return 
royalty
An NSR entitles the royalty 
holder to a fixed portion of the 
net revenues received from a 
smelter or refinery from the sales 
of mineral production from a 
property, after the deduction of 
certain offsite realisation costs. 
Typical realisation costs include 
those related to transportation, 
insurance, smelting and refining. 
These deductions are generally 
higher in base metals mines due 
to the semi-finished product, 
such as concentrate, often being 
produced at the mine site, when 
compared to precious metals 
mines, which produce a 
nearly-finished product on site.
Primary versus secondary 
royalties
Primary royalties are entered 
into between a royalty company 
and the property owner directly, 
where the property owner 
grants a royalty to the royalty 
company in return for one or 
more up-front cash payments 
from the royalty company.  
In contrast, secondary royalties 
are existing royalties that are 
acquired from a third party with 
no payment made to the owner 
of the underlying property.
Metal streams
A metal stream is an agreement 
that provides, in exchange for  
an upfront payment, the right to 
purchase all or a portion of one 
or more metals produced from  
a mine, at a price determined for 
the life of the stream. 
Streams, whilst providing similar 
outcomes for Anglo Pacific, are 
not royalties because they do 
not constitute an interest in land 
and there is an ongoing cash 
payment required to purchase 
the physical metal. However, a 
stream holder is not ordinarily 
required to contribute towards 
operating or capital costs, nor 
environmental or reclamation 
liabilities.

12 months ago I reported 
that 2015 had seen the 
beginnings of a turnaround 
in the fortunes of Anglo 
Pacific. It is therefore 
extremely gratifying to now 
report that that turnaround 
has become a full scale 
recovery with a further 
doubling in royalty income 
from £8.7m to £19.7m and 
more significant growth 
anticipated in 2017 .

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Group 
overview

report Governance
Financial 
statements
Other 
information
Our royalty income benefited from a 
range of factors in 2016. Mining at 
Kestrel returned increasingly to our 
royalty lands, a trend which will 
continue in 2017 and beyond. There 
was a recovery in commodity prices 
during 2016, notably for Anglo Pacific,  
in coking coal. While there was slippage 
in spot prices towards the end of the 
year, the average price achieved was 
still significantly ahead of 2015, and the 
EU referendum and subsequent sterling 
weakness also benefited our royalty 
income, all of which is either Australian, 
Canadian or US dollar denominated.
With operating expenses remaining 
broadly unchanged, this led to a six fold 
increase in operating profit, up from 
£2.1m in 2015 to £12.7m in 2016.  
Our results were, as usual, impacted by  
a number of revaluation adjustments  
and non-cash impairments, which this 
year resulted in a net credit of £10.9m  
(2015: charge £32.5m). The main driver 
for this turnaround was an upward 
revaluation of our Kestrel royalty of 
£17.9m due to the improvement in 
coking coal prices together with a 
favourable exchange rate movement.  
As a result, overall profit before tax was 
£28.3m compared to a loss of £30.5m  
in 2015. Basic and diluted earnings per 
share were 15.60p (2015: loss per share 
14.06p). Stripping out these non-cash 
items, we present an adjusted earnings 
measure (refer to � note 11 to the 
accounts) which, we believe, more 
closely reflects the performance within 
management’s control. On this basis 
adjusted earnings per share were  
9.76p (2015: 2.47p).
Dividends
Twelve months ago we rebased our 
dividend levels to a minimum annual 
payment of 6p per share, while retaining 
our overall target of paying dividends  
of 65% of adjusted earnings. On an 
adjusted basis, our dividend cover for 
2016 is 1.6 times and current projections 
suggest that we should be reviewing 
dividend levels upwards during the 
course of 2017. Those projections are, 
however, heavily dependent on 
commodity prices in general and coal 
prices in particular. The latter were 
subject to significant fluctuations during 
2016 and we wish to have much greater 
certainty about how they perform 
during 2017 before committing to a 
sustainable dividend increase.
Royalty portfolio
Once again it is encouraging to note 
that all of the Group’s royalties that  
were in production in 2015 remain in 
production and continue to generate 
royalty income. It is equally encouraging 
to see that all of those royalties, with the 
exception of El Valle which remained 
flat, increased their contributions and 
that our Four Mile royalty contributed 
for the first time. Payments from 
Narrabri and, in particular, Kestrel 
increased significantly. Both benefited 
from improvements in coal pricing while 
at Kestrel, mining was increasingly 
within our royalty lands. More detail of 
our royalty performance is shown on    
� pages 25 to 36.
No major acquisitions were concluded 
last year but we did announce a 
financing and streaming arrangement 
with Denison Mines Corp. earlier in the 
current year. Further details on this 
transaction are given in the case study 
on � pages 10 and 11.
The improved trading performance 
referred to above coupled with the 
additional firepower available to us 
through headroom under our 
refinanced revolving credit facility and 
the steadily increasing value of our 
share portfolio have enabled us to 
extend our investment criteria.  
As shown on � pages 16 and 17, this  
now includes pre-production royalties, 
which, we believe, offer the opportunity 
of significantly higher returns, albeit 
some distance in the future.  
Our principal objective, however, will  
remain the acquisition of producing  
or near production royalty and 
streaming assets.
Board
There were no changes to the Board 
during 2016. We have collectively, I 
believe, all the skills and expertise 
necessary to drive the Company forward. 
As you will have noted, however, we 
recently announced that I will be 
stepping down as chairman at the 
conclusion of the forthcoming AGM  
and will be succeeded by Patrick Meier. 
The Company is now extremely well 
positioned to take advantage of the 
renewed confidence within the mining 
sector and the opportunities that will 
provide. Patrick, with his extensive 
experience in investment banking in 
general and the mining sector in 
particular, is perfectly placed to lead  
the Company through the next stage  
in its development.
Our Strategic report
Our 2016 Strategic report, from � pages 
08 to 43, was reviewed and approved by 
the Board on March 29, 2017.
Outlook
2017 should be a year of continued 
organic growth for Anglo Pacific as 
production at Kestrel moves 
increasingly into our royalty lands and 
we receive our first contributions from 
the Denison financing arrangement. 
Much, however, will depend on how 
coal prices move during the year.   
In addition, as confidence returns to  
the mining sector, fresh opportunities 
should arise. We have shown our ability  
to be innovative and imaginative in  
our approach to the Denison opportunity 
and believe that approach will continue 
to bear fruit in the year ahead. 
In conclusion, I should like to thank all 
Directors and staff for their continued 
diligence and hard work during the year.

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Market outlook
The outlook for the mining sector has 
changed markedly over the past year, 
primarily due to a combination of 
Chinese production restrictions and 
improved macro-economic conditions. 
Whereas a year or so ago, people 
expected a negative macroeconomic 
environment, today the combination  
of supply restrictions and faster growth 
prospects has led to a much more 
optimistic outlook and a rapid rebound 
in equity prices. This also suggests that 
we are at the beginning of another 
multiyear cycle and that we need to 
accelerate our level of activities over 
the next year or two, as this should be  
a relatively favourable period to put 
capital to work in the sector.
With regards to the royalty and 
streaming markets, this about turn has 
significant implications. First, some of 
the very large bulk royalties we were 
working on during 2016 with the majors 
are unlikely now to materialise. The 
rebound in commodity prices is rapidly 
resulting in the deleveraging of their 
balance sheets so they have little need 
for further assistance and soon will be 
looking to expand again. There is still  
a lack of capital flowing to the sector 
and so there may be room in the 
coming mergers and acquisitions 
activity for royalty financing. However, 
more prospective is the mid-tier and 
development arena where the expected 
supply deficits as a result of consistent 
underinvestment in the sector should 
spur renewed investment in developing 
the next wave of projects for the future. 
We are, as a result, already seeing an 
uplift in activity and royalty financing 
opportunities for those seeking to 
engage in mergers and acquisitions  
or moving projects forward.
Coal outlook
Whilst we continue to diversify the 
portfolio away from Kestrel, coal, and  
in particular coking coal, continue to  
be a major area of exposure for your 
company. Whilst we suffered with lower 
coal prices in 2015, fortunately at a time 
when our share of Kestrel's production 
was also low, the recovery in coal pricing 
together with the growth in that share 
contributed significantly to our growth 
in 2016 and is expected to do the same 
this year. In that context, the outlook for 
coal continues to be important to us. 
The coal price has seen significant 
volatility over the past year, driven largely 
by restrictions on Chinese production in 
the autumn. This was part of a general 
trend to reduce poor quality coal 
production and consumption in China 
to improve air quality. The impact of this 
reduction in supply increased the price 
of energy or thermal coal by around a 
third in H2. The effect on the rarer form 
of coal which Kestrel produces, namely 
coking coal, was even more extreme 
and the spot price tripled. Subsequently 
over the Chinese winter, the authorities 
relaxed their restrictions and the price of 
thermal coal dropped by 20%, with the 
spot price of coking coal almost halving. 
It is worth noting that coking coal prices 
nevertheless remain roughly double  
the level of a year ago. 
Looking forward, we expect the 
direction of travel to remain unchanged 
i.e. continued Chinese volume 
reductions. It is possible that further 
restrictions will be imposed during Q2 
after the Chinese winter which in turn 
will send prices back up. However, we 
are making much more conservative 
assumptions in our internal forecasts 
and assume prices average slightly less 
than current spot levels for the year. 
What is important is that the 
environment for coal has changed  
and prices are unlikely to return to  
their previous low levels.
Shareholders should note that we are 
well positioned in coal with royalties on 
modern mines in safe locations and 
exposure to high quality, cleaner coals. 
Denison financing  
and streaming agreements
Though this transaction was announced 
early in 2017, we had been working  
on it for much of last year. As the case 
study presented on � pages 10 and 11 
highlights, it is a transaction which should 
provide a stable long-term stream of 
income with some upside. Shareholders 
should expect to see the positive effects 
of the Denison transaction start to  
come through in our results from Q1  
of this year.
Reflecting the different structure of the 
Denison transaction, where income will 
be derived in part from the repayment of 
debt, we are now introducing a new KPI 
in the form of cash generation which we 
believe will be a more accurate measure 
of progress going forward than earnings.
We expect to execute on further 
transactions in the year ahead, though 
the structure of the Denison transaction 
was a one off and future deals should be 
more in the form of traditional royalties 
and streams.

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 08 New strategy
Although our main focus will continue 
to be on immediately revenue 
producing royalties, we announced 
early in the year that we were 
broadening our investment mandate  
to include development royalties.  
These could take up to a decade to bring 
into development, should generate 
higher returns, given the development 
risk, and have the potential to increase  
in value significantly in the coming 
years. The size of these investments  
is unlikely to exceed US$20m and the 
intention is to fund them primarily  
from retained earnings.
Dividend
The recovery in our earnings has 
significantly improved our dividend 
cover and it is pleasing that this 
exceeded 1.6x last year. With further 
improvement expected this year, there 
should be scope for dividend increases 
on a prudent and progressive basis. 
However, the levels of our earnings are 
in turn driven by the price of coking coal 
and this has been extremely volatile of 
late. Barring a transformational large 
transaction which fundamentally alters 
this relationship, your Board therefore 
intends to await the outcome of the first 
half of the year before considering any 
alterations to dividend levels. Any new 
level of dividends announced needs to 
be a new base from which we can 
comfortably grow in the years ahead.  
Taxation
Assisted in part by the disposal of our 
Isua royalty, announced with the year 
end results, we have created significant 
tax losses. These should reduce our tax 
charge in the coming year, more than 
we had previously indicated to the 
market. We also have significant capital 
losses, some of which were used to 
shield against our equity profits in the 
current period, and which hopefully  
will be utilised during this cycle.
Currencies
The weakening of sterling as a result  
of the EU referendum has had the effect 
of increasing our income and profits.  
In order to maintain this benefit, we have 
instituted a rolling hedging program 
over part of our income, hedging against 
the main currencies in which our 
income is denominated. As at year end, 
this program had generated £0.7m of 
additional income.
Central costs
Central costs continued to be well 
controlled. One of the virtues of the 
Anglo Pacific model is that overheads 
do not increase in line with income, 
providing additional operating leverage. 
This proved to be the case in 2016 
where income slightly more than 
doubled but operating profits rose 
almost six fold.
Financial resources
We are pleased to have repaid 
significant amounts of our borrowings 
last year and took advantage of the 
Denison opportunity to renew our 
borrowing facilities and extend them.  
If we had not invested in Denison, we 
would have been debt free by the end 
of Q1 2017. With our much higher 
income levels, we expect the new debt 
assumed for Denison to be repaid in 
short order leaving our new facility 
available for new acquisitions. This, 
together with our equity portfolio and 
income, provides considerable 
firepower for new deals. We intend to  
be prudent with regards to debt levels, 
with the intention of not exceeding 2x 
free cash flow and generally operating 
well below this level. 
Net assets and share price
The increase in net asset value per 
share to 124p after the payment of 6p 
of dividends during the year is good 
news for all shareholders. The share 
price has recovered along with the 
sector and provides us with a better 
currency to move forward. However, it 
continues to trade at a discount to what 
we consider to be the true net asset 
value, and gives no credit for those 
assets in our portfolio which we believe 
have increased in value considerably 
since we acquired them and which is 
not reflected on the balance sheet.
Our shares continue to provide a much 
higher dividend yield than our global 
peers and we hope that the process of 
rerating will continue during the year.  
We were gratified that approximately 20 
new institutional investors joined the 
register with the Denison transaction  
and we welcome these new shareholders 
on board.
Board developments
I would like to take the opportunity to 
pay tribute to the chairmanship of Mike 
Blyth over the past few years. He has 
made a significant difference to the way 
the Company is run and governed, 
instigating a series of disciplines and 
controls which reflect best practice, and 
which should stand us in good stead for 
the years ahead. We are fortunate that 
he has decided to retain his presence  
on the Board.
I look forward to working closely with 
Patrick Meier in the years ahead to take 
the Company to a new level.
Outlook
In summary we have moved forward 
significantly over the past 12 months 
and are now in the fortunate position of 
having the resources to take advantage 
of being in the early stages of the 
upcycle. We expect this progress to 
continue during 2017, both from 
organic growth and new acquisitions.

Achieving our strategy 
The completion of the McClean Lake Mill financing and streaming 
agreements demonstrates the Group’s progress towards its aim of 
developing as the leading international diversified royalty company  
with a portfolio centred on income production based metals and  
bulk materials royalties and streams. 
The financing and streaming agreements clearly 
satisfy the Group’s stated investment criteria: 
Established natural resources jurisdictions
 · Established North American mining jurisdiction
Long-life, high-quality & low-cost asset
 · 12 year reserve based mine life
 · Underlying mine is the highest grade uranium operation globally,  
well positioned on the global uranium cost curve
Near-term producing assets
 · The McClean Lake Mill is a producing asset with immediate cashflow 
generation and full production expected in 2017
Production & exploration upside potential
 · Production upside potential from Cigar Lake Phase II mine life extension 
or mill capacity expansion
Strong operational management team
 · Mine & mill operators amongst the world’s largest publicly traded 
uranium companies
Diversification of royalty portfolio
 · Further diversified asset base, commodity exposure and geography
 · Growing exposure to non-carbon energy 
In addition to satisfying the Group’s investment criteria,  
the completion of the financing and streaming agreements  
was supported by a strong financial rationale: 
 · Immediately accretive to adjusted EPS and dividend cover
 · Income backdated to July 1, 2016
 · Toll milling revenue expected to provide stable cashflow base to  
Anglo Pacific’s broader royalty portfolio
 · Reduced commodity price risk given toll milling fees are inflation- 
linked and based on units of production
This transaction ticks all the 
boxes for Anglo Pacific and 
moves forward our growth and 
diversification in a material way

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 12 The positive performance has continued 
into the first quarter of 2017 and that 
momentum is anticipated to be 
maintained for the remainder of the year. 
Despite this improving sentiment, the 
market remains cautious with regard to a 
second year of outperformance in light of 
slowing Chinese growth, global political 
instability and uncertainty of the impact 
of President Trump’s economic policies.
Throughout 2016, equity values of 
miners globally rebounded in a manner 
reminiscent of the recoveries seen in 
2009. Broadly, commentators are of the 
view that the multi-year commodity 
nadirs have passed and the sector as a 
whole may be at the beginning of 
another cycle. Commodity prices were 
pushed higher in part due to new fiscal 
support in China, reversing the 
deflationary conditions seen for the past 
two years. Additionally, improved 
economic performance in the US, 
Europe and Japan supported commodity 
price and equity recoveries. 
The top performing commodity in the 
year was coal, with coking coal and 
thermal coal prices up 146% and 102% 
respectively. Restrictions in Chinese 
domestic coal supply and strong steel 
demand saw hard coking coal prices 
nearly quadruple to $310/t from January 
to November with thermal coal prices 
doubling to $110/t. With the restrictions 
relaxed in the second half of the year the 
prices have now eased off somewhat to 
around $150/t.  
Industrial metals also performed well  
as supply met sustained demand and  
a perceived lack of investment during  
the downturn meant that supply deficits 
are widely anticipated. Copper prices  
ran from October rising to $2.50/lb  
by year end, an annual gain of 17%, as 
supply side concerns and stronger global 
demand positively impacted prices. 
Other top performing commodities 
included zinc (+86%), palladium (+52%) 
and lead (+44%). 
Gold prices rallied for the first nine 
months of the year, reaching highs of 
$1,375 per ounce, but prices softened  
to $1,150 per ounce by year end due to  
a stronger US dollar and the Federal 
Reserve decision to raise interest rates  
in December.
The tough operating environment faced 
in 2014-15 has led to continued focus  
on cost optimisation, capital discipline, 
balance sheet strengthening and debt 
reduction. Companies focused on 
projects with higher returns on capital 
with greater optionality and flexibility 
across asset portfolios and improved  
cost curve positions. Dividend policies  
were revised by the majors in 2016 and 
several companies decided to suspend 
payments, certainly a signal of the low 
point in the cycle. A theme across the 
sector was to link dividend policies 
directly to earnings and cash flow within 
revised dividend policies. 
Positive sector sentiment and rising 
commodity prices led to an increase in 
M&A volumes in 2016 despite the overall 
value of deals falling compared to the 
previous year. The diversified majors  
who typically drive acquisitions are still 
focused on portfolio realignment and 
balance sheet strengthening rather than 
acquisitions for future growth, with 
divestments still featuring in 2016. Junior 
and intermediate producers however did 
look to consolidate market share in the 
last 12 months, taking advantage of asset 
and corporate transactions which may 
not have been available under different 
operating environments. 
The most targeted commodity continued 
to be gold and the most active geography 
was Canada. Capital raising saw a slight 
resurgence in 2016; global funds raised 
increased 9% year-on-year to $249 billion. 
Excluding China, corporate bond issuance 
fell, as did overall lending. Convertible 
bond issuance remained relatively flat  
and IPO activity was negligible. However, 
equity issuance volume and value saw  
an increase on 2015 levels. The upturn in 
commodity price environments across 
the board provided investors with greater 
confidence. Notwithstanding this, funding 
from equity markets remains significantly 
below pre-crash levels and therefore 
royalty and alternative financing remains 
an attractive and complementary source 
of capital for mining companies. 
Looking to 2017, the sentiment towards 
the mining sector appears more positive 
than it has been for several years. 
Commentators broadly expect to see an 
uptick in M&A, as majors signal a potential 
end to their focus on divestments, and  
an increase in initial public offerings  
as commodity prices have firmed. It is 
expected that the majors will look to 
maintain efficient balance sheets and  
will enjoy enhanced cash flows having 
extensively reduced capex. They may 
look to spend on organic and inorganic 
development and exploration projects 
and this may increasingly be done by way 
of joint venture. The return of a sector 
wide focus on reserve and resource 
expansion may be of a higher priority 
now, and the return of growth to the 
sector in 2017 may require companies  
to look for additional capital to fund 
projects. As equity and debt financing 
return to favour, companies may look to 
balance these sources with alternative 
financing such as royalties and streams  
in order to ensure the long-term success 
of projects and create the capacity to 
return value to shareholders.

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 13 STRATEGIC REPORT
Our business model
The Group is seeking to grow its 
portfolio of cash-generative royalties 
and streams by investing in producing 
or near-term producing assets with 
long mine lives. Given the relatively  
low overhead requirements of the 
business, the Group believes cash  
flow to shareholders can be maximised 
through economies of scale, which 
would allow for growth in the portfolio 
without significantly increasing our 
cost base.
Revenue-based royalties limit the Group’s 
direct exposure to operating or capital cost 
inflation of the underlying mine operations, 
as there is no ongoing requirement for the 
Group to contribute to capital, exploration, 
environmental or other operating costs at 
mine sites. 
The Group is seeking to build a diversified 
portfolio of royalties across a variety of 
different commodities and geographic 
locations. Investing in royalties across a wide 
spectrum of commodities and jurisdictions 
reduces the dependency on any one asset  
or location and any corresponding cyclicality.  
A fully diversified portfolio can help to reduce 
the level of income volatility, stabilising cash 
flows which contribute towards investment 
and dividend payments.
Royalty holders generally benefit from 
improvements made to the scale of a mining 
operation. Exploration success, or lower 
cut-off grades as a result of rising commodity 
prices, can serve to increase economic 
reserves and resources. Increased reserves 
will extend a mine’s life, or facilitate an 
expansion of the existing operations. Any 
subsequent increases in production will 
generally result in higher royalty payments, 
without the requirement for the royalty 
holder to contribute to the cost of expanding 
or optimising the operation. 
Royalties and streams provide exposure to 
underlying commodity prices. The Group 
expects to benefit from a rising commodity 
price environment, with the upside feeding 
through to increased royalty receipts.

T H E M I N E O P E R AT O R
Royalties and streams reduce the 
upfront capital required to fund the 
development of a project. These are 
generally structured as asset (or even 
by-product) specific, often leaving  
the remaining assets of the operator 
unencumbered for raising additional 
finance.  
Compared to the issuance of new equity, 
royalties and streams do not depend on the 
prevailing state of the capital markets but  
are rather the result of bilateral negotiations. 
The issuance of new equity can also serve  
to dilute existing shareholders, particularly 
during periods of depressed share prices. 
Furthermore, as royalties and streams are 
asset specific, the reduction in the upside  
for existing shareholders can be limited to  
a certain mine or product.  
Royalties and streams do not typically  
levy interest, nor do they typically require 
principal repayments or have a maturity 
date. More importantly, unlike conventional 
debt arrangements where interest payments 
tend to start immediately or are capitalised 
until cash payments can be made from  
a project’s cash flow, most royalties are 
payable only once the project comes into 
production and is generating sales. In 
addition, many forms of debt, such as project 
finance, include restrictive covenants and 
may require commodity price hedges to  
be put in place. These are not only typically 
costly in terms of fees, but can also limit the 
miner’s exposure to upside in the prices of 
their core commodities. 
The value of a royalty is realised over the 
duration of the mine life. Often royalty 
owners may have a need to free up cash in 
order to recycle capital. There is a limited 
secondary market for royalties and Anglo 
Pacific can be a source of valuable liquidity  
for private royalty holders.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Our strategy
Strategy
Achieving our aim through 
the acquisition of both 
primary and secondary 
royalties, together with 
metal streams.
New strategy
Although income 
producing royalties remain 
our key focus, we will now 
selectively deploy modest 
amounts of capital on 
royalties which have the 
potential to offer superior 
returns albeit with some 
development risk.
AR16 | 29.03.17 | FRONT – PROOF 8
Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 16 Goal
Executing the strategy will result in additional cash 
producing royalties, a substantial proportion of whose 
cash flows will be paid to shareholders as dividends.
Criteria
Achieving our strategy 
through acquisitions 
which satisfy these 
criteria
 Established natural  
 resources jurisdictions
 Long-life assets
 High-quality and low- 
 cost assets
 Near-term producing  
 assets
 Production and   
 exploration upside   
 potential
 Strong operational   
 management teams
 Diversification of  
 royalty portfolio
Established natural resources  
jurisdictions
The Group continues to review 
potential business opportunities 
globally and, in order to manage its risk 
profile, intends to focus predominantly 
on mines in established, relatively 
low-risk mining jurisdictions, primarily 
those in North America, South 
America, Europe and Australia.  
As at December 31, 2016, 95.2% of  
the Group’s existing assets were based 
in such jurisdictions.
Long-life assets
Long mine life assets can provide 
long-term revenue, which in turn  
can contribute to ensuring that 
acquisitions to replace depleted 
royalties and maintain cash flows are 
not required on a regular basis. Three 
of the royalties in the Group’s existing 
portfolio are over mines that have 
reserves of 20 years or more.
High-quality and low-cost  
assets
The Group is also focused on 
ensuring that new royalties are over 
high-quality and low-cost operations.  
This helps ensure longevity of cash 
flows by reducing the risk of mining 
operations ceasing to be economically 
viable. Within its existing portfolio,  
the Group has exposure to low cash 
cost assets in the Kestrel and Narrabri 
mines. Both Kestrel and Narrabri 
operate in the lowest quartile on  
the cost curve in comparison to 
similar mines. 
Near-term producing assets
The Group is seeking to grow its 
royalty income beyond the existing 
organic growth profile of its current 
royalty portfolio by investing in 
producing or near-term producing 
assets.
Production and exploration  
upside potential
The Group seeks to acquire  
royalties where it may benefit from 
improvements made to the scale  
of mining operations. Any increases  
in production can result in higher 
royalty payments, without requiring 
the Group to contribute to the cost  
of expanding or optimising the 
operation. Royalties can also benefit 
from exploration successes that  
lead to enlarged economic reserves. 
Increased reserves can extend a 
mine’s life or facilitate an expansion  
of the existing operations, potentially 
providing higher revenue over a 
longer period.
Strong operational management  
teams
Strong operational management  
teams are integral to delivering a 
successful project and to optimising 
the value of a mine and, therefore, a 
royalty or stream. The Group’s current 
royalty portfolio includes mines 
operated by highly experienced 
management teams.
Diversification of royalty  
portfolio
The Group is seeking to build a 
diversified portfolio of royalties across 
a variety of different commodities  
and geographic locations to reduce 
dependency on its cornerstone 
royalty, Kestrel.
The Group’s target portfolio would 
result in an increased exposure  
across various base metals and bulk 
materials. The Group may also 
selectively pursue royalties in energy 
commodities, such as uranium and oil

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 17 Background
The Board, in conjunction with the Audit 
Committee, reviewed the Group’s previous risk 
disclosures since the publication of the 2015 
Annual Report and Accounts. Although risk is  
an area which is frequently considered by the 
Board, the latest review was performed against 
the backdrop of a much-improved outlook  
for commodities in particular and the sector  
in general. As such, the risks which have the 
potential to materially affect the Group’s 
prospects now are likely to have a different 
weighting to those considered 12 months  
ago. In addition, an improved outlook for the 
sector, whilst positive for the Group’s financial 
prospects, could result in less demand for 
royalty financing which would have a material 
impact on the Group’s ability to execute its 
strategy. The table below presents the outcome 
of the Board’s assessment of principal risks.
Risk appetite and viability
The Company is once again voluntarily 
complying with provision C2.2 of the 2014 
Combined Code, which requires a statement  
on viability to be made in this report, including 
the determination and consideration of stress 
tested ‘severe but plausible’ scenarios.  
This analysis was performed for a three-year 
period, consistent with the Group’s medium- 
term planning horizon and the term of its 
borrowing facility.
The viability statement, and underlying 
supporting papers, is intended to intertwine  
risk disclosure and going concern into a more 
meaningful discussion about the financial 
impact of principal risks. Risk can never be  
fully eliminated, but can be mitigated to a level 
which the Directors are prepared to accept as 
necessary to execute the Group’s strategy.
Although the ultimate success of Anglo Pacific 
will depend on its ability to continue to add value 
enhancing royalties and streams to its portfolio, 
the focus of the viability statement is on the 
existing business of the Group and the ability  
of the current royalty portfolio to generate 
sufficient cash to meet the Group’s outgoings, 
including the dividend. Under our ‘severe but 
plausible’ case, this results in the Group drawing 
down further on its borrowing facilities as 
income reduces. The Directors’ risk appetite  
is therefore capped with reference to an 
acceptable and supportable level of borrowings 
relative to the Group’s income profile over the 
next three years on a ‘severe but plausible’ basis.

with Kestrel
That the Group  
fails to identify and 
acquire new royalty 
and streaming 
opportunities
The Kestrel royalty is key to the Group’s success and until such time that sufficient 
acquisitions are made to materially reduce the dependence on this asset.  
Any prolonged geological issues or an inability to produce at Kestrel would result  
in a significant loss of income to the Group.
In addition, risk relating to government royalty rates, change of ownership or the 
economic viability of the mine could materially impact on the Group’s prospects.
The Group has limited means to alter or enhance the terms of or add any further level 
of protection to the royalty to mitigate the risk associated with Kestrel. The Board, 
however, takes assurances from the asset being located in Australia, governed by 
Australian law, operated by a world class miner and sufficiently low on the cost curve, 
which combined should reduce the risk associated with Kestrel.
Deal flow is crucial for Anglo Pacific due to the depleting nature of the Group’s assets 
over the long-term and limited residual value.
Although the recent strong performance of commodity prices has taken some 
pressure off larger mining companies, there remains a large section of the market 
which we believe is still experiencing capital constraints. As such, opportunities to 
acquire accretive royalties should still continue to exist.
Furthermore, the Group will now pursue two investment strategies: core income 
generating royalties and development royalties. The latter has not been the focus for 
the Group whilst we have rebuilt our income, but we now intend to deploy modest 
sums into pre-production assets with a view to higher returns.

Conclusion
The outcome of the Board’s risk assessment resulted in the revisions to the principal risks detailed in the table below.
Taking into account the quantitative analysis performed around each risk identified above and having tested these scenarios  
under a ‘severe but plausible’ set of criteria, the Directors conclude that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group  
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment.

Dependence on 
operators
The Group has always been reliant on the mine operators for determining the correct 
royalty payable, providing information and production guidance and acknowledging 
the Group’s rights as a royalty holder. Counterparty risk is relevant throughout the 
cycle although for different reasons. Towards the bottom of the cycle the risk of 
non-payment or operator survival is higher. At the other end of the cycle there is a 
greater chance of M&A activity and change of control, which could lead to an inferior 
operator taking control of projects or a new operator taking a different interpretation 
of the requirements under the royalty agreement.

and is unable to

The ability to refinance is no longer as urgent as it was 12 months ago following  
the refinancing of the Group’s borrowing facility until 2021. The risk associated with 
financial covenants has abated somewhat with the recovery in commodity prices  
in the past six months and the resulting impact on the Group’s cash balances.
Should leverage be deployed in a meaningful fashion in conjunction with an 
acquisition then this risk might heighten once again.

That the reputation

proposition
Commodity prices recovered strongly in H2 16 which has improved the Group’s 
financial prospects considerably. This is still a principal risk for the Group, although the 
direct impact between absolute levels of income and debt has subsided somewhat 
with the recovery in coal price and increased volumes at Kestrel.
Even if the price of the Group’s two principal commodities fell by 50%, the Group is 
forecasting full compliance with its financial covenants over the viability statement 
look out period, although it would have a higher refinancing risk.
With three fund raises behind it, the Group has demonstrated its ability to successfully 
finance royalty acquisitions.
Equity markets are, by their nature, volatile and there can be no certainty that the 
Group will be able to successfully raise equity in the future. Equity will most likely be 
required as part of any large transformational deal, with the Group most likely to be 
able to use its balance sheet to fund smaller transactions. 
The Group will now consider royalties on operations which are not in production but 
have the potential to generate considerably higher returns. With higher returns 
comes a higher risk profile and there is a risk that those investments do not come into 
production and generate a return on investment. 
Although this risk cannot be mitigated in its entirety, management have exercised 
considerable discipline over the past few years in applying the Group’s investment 
criteria as outlined as its core strategy. The Group will ensure any pre-production 
royalties satisfy our pre-defined investment criteria and we have a wealth of expertise, 
both at Board and management level, to identify those opportunities which have a 
greater likelihood of becoming successful investments.
This was a new risk added to the register in 2015 post the Paris climate accord when 
the sentiment toward fossil fuel extraction and consumption, including coal, 
deteriorated suddenly. Although the price of coal has recovered, and there has been 
recent M&A in the sector, it is still not clear that market sentiment has fully reversed.
For Anglo Pacific specifically, we are aware that some European banks will no longer 
provide finance to the Group until we have further diversified away from coal 
(although non-coal co-investments could still be possible). This issue was not really 
encountered, nor provided any obstacle, in the recent equity raise. The Directors  
are supportive of cleaner energy, and note that the Group’s royalties cover mines 
producing higher quality and lower polluting coal.

Risk Possible cause Mitigation Management comment
That the Group fails to 
meets its obligations under 
its secured borrowing 
facility and is unable to 
refinance
The Group’s borrowings are 
secured and subject to 
certain financial covenants, 
the failing of which could 
impact on the ability of the 
Group to continue to run its 
business independently.
The recent increases in coal 
prices enabled the Group to 
deleverage and, with dividend 
cover now re-established, the 
Group’s leverage ratios should 
be much less sensitive to 
volatility in commodity prices.
 • Breach of financial 
covenant associated with 
a reduction in royalty 
income or unexpected 
liabilities (via commodity 
price declines or 
production disruption) 
could result in the banks 
enforcing security
Detailed cash flow forecasts 
provide timely warning of any 
upcoming tightening of 
headroom under financial 
covenants.
The Group has discretion over 
its cost base and has some 
further liquidity in its equity 
portfolio which could be 
monetised to reduce 
borrowings.
That the current  
portfolio will not generate 
sufficient cash 
The Group expects the 
current portfolio to generate 
a certain level of income, 
largely driven by increased 
mining at Kestrel within the 
Group’s land and continued 
production upside at Narrabri. 
 • Further falls in 
commodity prices
 • Unexpected production 
issues at Kestrel and/or 
Narrabri
 • Reduction in Queensland 
royalty rate
 • Foreign exchange risk 
(discussed separately 
below)
The Group has little ability  
to influence the quantum of 
royalties it receives post 
acquisition as it cannot readily 
and cheaply hedge its 
commodity exposure, nor can 
it influence the royalty rate.
Detailed cash flow projections 
are prepared which include 
downside scenarios to 
understand the sensitivity of 
price and quantity assumptions 
for the Group’s material assets.
The Group is exposed to 
commodity price volatility, 
although unlike mine 
operators its cost base is 
flexible and fully within its 
control. 
Dependence on  
operators 
The Group depends on mine 
operators to correctly 
calculate royalties payable,  
to pay the royalty promptly 
when due, to provide 
information and guidance  
on the operator and to 
co-operate with any audit 
rights and requirements. In 
more extreme circumstances, 
the ability for the operation to 
remain economically viable is 
of upmost importance to the 
Group’s financial prospects. 
 • Disputes over the 
quantum of royalty 
payable 
 • Non-payment of royalty
 • Adhering to existing 
obligation under royalty 
contract in the case of a 
change of control
The best way the Group can 
mitigate against operator 
reliance is to continue 
diversifying its sources of 
income and reducing its 
reliance on any one operator.
The Group has audit rights at 
several of its royalties which 
affords it the opportunity to 
challenge and verify royalty 
calculations.
For those royalties without 
audit rights, underlying 
royalty information and 
forecasts are often provided 
on a voluntary basis by the 
operator. As such, change  
of control at the Group’s 
material assets could 
interfere with the systems 
and communication 
established over the years 
with the existing operators. 
The Group cannot control or 
correct a severe production 
outage at Kestrel which could 
impact materially on 
covenant compliance.

Concentration  
risk associated with 
Kestrel
 • Kestrel accounted for 
over 65% of the Group’s 
royalty income in 2016 
and is likely to be the main 
source of revenue growth 
in 2017
 • Any significant mining 
issues could result in 
considerable production 
disruption, impacting on 
the Group’s expected 
cash flow
 • The royalty rate 
applicable to Kestrel is 
determined by the 
Queensland government 
and so any material 
downward revision to 
rates would directly 
impact on the Group
 • Change of control could 
result in disruption to 
royalty payments or 
processes
 • A material reduction in 
the coking coal price 
would impact on the level 
of income the Group 
expects to receive from 
the royalty
The Group has a good working 
relationship with the operator, 
Rio Tinto, and has received 
royalties from the operator 
consistently since 1992. 
The Group is also provided with 
production forecasts for the next 
four quarters which assists it in 
cash flow preparation, budgeting 
analysis and guiding the market. 
The map which Rio Tinto 
published at the beginning of 
2016 showed for the first time the 
area covered by private royalty. 
This provided considerable 
assurance regarding the direction 
of mining, confirming our 
expectation that over 90% of 
production would be within our 
royalty land by the end of 2017.
The map referred to above was 
published as part of a licence 
extension at Kestrel to obtain 
permitting beyond the currently 
approved mine plan. Although 
this will not impact on the Group 
as this area is outside our royalty 
area, it clearly demonstrates the 
economic viability of the 
operation.
The Group could be impacted if 
Rio Tinto were to dispose of the 
mine as the Group would need to 
develop a relationship with a new 
counterparty which could result 
in some transitioning issues.
That the Group fails to 
identify and acquire new 
royalty and streaming 
opportunities
In order to execute its 
strategy, the Group needs  
to acquire further royalties. 
The success of this strategy 
will depend on the future 
demand for royalty financing 
as part of the financing mix  
in the sector.
 • The recent recovery  
in commodity prices  
has shifted sentiment  
in the sector and eased 
the financial pressure  
on operators, making 
identifying royalty 
opportunities more 
difficult
 • Pricing competitiveness 
of royalties versus 
conventional sources  
of finance, particularly 
when the outlook for the 
sector is improving
 • Appetite of 
counterparties to 
relinquish operating 
margin in favour of 
restrictive debt or  
dilutive equity
Generally, demand for royalty 
financing is greater when the 
underlying market conditions 
are challenging.
The past six months have seen 
considerable recovery in the 
sector which has resulted in a 
windfall for those with 
producing assets, which means 
there is likely to be reduced 
pressure for royalty financing. 
For operators not yet in 
production, the dynamic has 
not changed significantly and 
there remains high competition 
for capital, which should provide 
opportunities for the Group to 
add to its royalty portfolio.
The Group also looks to acquire 
existing royalties, and these 
opportunities exist throughout 
the cycle. 
There can be no guarantee 
that royalties will always be in 
demand throughout mining 
cycles. However, the Group 
has an extensive network of 
advisors and contacts 
globally, in addition to its own 
marketing initiatives, which 
provides a regular source of 
deal flow to appraise at any 
one time.
Ultimately, there is little  
that the Group can do to 
mitigate the dominant 
impact of Kestrel on the 
Group’s prospects other than 
diversifying this through 
material and transformational 
royalty acquisitions, which is 
very much the focus of 
management.

That the Group cannot 
finance royalty and 
streaming opportunities
There can be no certainty  
that the Group will have ready 
access to capital to finance 
royalty opportunities.
 • Sudden adverse change 
in equity market 
conditions   
 • The Group’s cost of 
capital makes executing 
accretive deals more 
challenging
 • Production issues or 
significant price volatility 
could adversely impact 
on the Group’s borrowing 
capacity
The Group demonstrated that 
royalty opportunities which 
meet its strict investment 
criteria, such as the Narrabri 
and Denison transactions, are 
capable of being financed. 
Management regularly meets 
both existing and potential 
investors and listens to any 
concerns or feedback with a 
view to future acquisitions.
The Group remains in close 
dialogue with several 
institutions who are interested 
in co-investing in appropriate 
opportunities. This should 
significantly de-risk financing 
risk for larger transactions.
The recent refinancing has 
reduced sole dependence on 
one bank which should provide 
greater financing capability.
There can be no guarantee 
market conditions will always 
be optimal for raising finance.
That the reputation  
of coal will deteriorate  
and impact on its appeal  
as an investment 
proposition 
The coal industry has 
attracted considerable 
criticism in recent years as 
environmental lobbyists 
continue to exert pressure on 
the investment community 
not to support extractive 
industries. Although Anglo 
Pacific is not a coal operator,  
it continues to be considered 
akin to an indirect investment 
in coal.
 • Climate change lobbyists 
continue to target the 
natural resource sector 
and coal producers in 
particular
Australian coal, on which the 
Group’s Kestrel and Narrabri 
royalties are based, is generally 
regarded as low in ash and low 
in sulphur and much cleaner  
in nature. 
Anglo Pacific believes that  
the coal industry is beginning 
to promote cleaner, more 
sustainable coal which clearly 
has a place in future power 
solutions. 
The Group’s strategy is to 
build a diversified royalty 
portfolio which should 
naturally reduce the Group’s 
exposure to coal going 
forward. 
The Directors continue to 
believe in the future of coal as 
both a power source and raw 
material, especially less 
polluting coal from mines 
such as Kestrel and Narrabri.
Development royalties  
fail to reach production
Development royalties,  
by their nature, are exposed  
to greater risk than income 
producing royalties. 
Conversely, they offer the 
potential for higher returns. 
 • Unproven reserves/
resources
 • Geological/technical 
issues
 • Overspend/insolvency
 • Inexperienced 
management
The Group only intends to 
allocate a modest amount  
of capital, mainly retained 
income, to this asset class.  
As such, any failure will largely 
be immaterial.
The Company has an 
experienced management 
team with in-house geological 
and finance experience to help 
identify those opportunities 
which represent the greatest 
chance of success.
Similar to production risk 
with the Group’s existing 
royalties, risk around 
development royalties 
cannot be fully mitigated, 
although its impact is likely  
to be less detrimental due to 
the modest amounts likely  
to be invested.

Foreign exchange risk
That foreign exchange 
movements adversely

Interest rate risk
That an increase in interest 
rates could adversely impact

 • Unexpected financial

 • Insufficient access to

 • Royalty payment default
 • Bank collapse
 • Cash flow risk associated 
with dollar derived

(including dividend) 
largely payable in pounds
 • Translation risk of having

 • Financing risk when 
raising equity in GBP to 
fund dollar denominated

 • The Group is exposed to 
the US and UK LIBOR rate 
as part of its bank facility
The Group prepares regular 
cash flow projections which 
highlight all anticipated and 
probable expenses including 
routine overheads, tax and any 
capital commitments. The 
Group has sufficient headroom 
under its existing RCF and 
potential access to the capital 
markets to provide additional 
liquidity.
The Group operates controlled 
treasury policies which spreads 
the concentration of the 
Group’s cash balances 
amongst separate financial 
institutions with sufficiently 
high credit ratings.
The Board approved a  
currency hedging policy  
during the year which looks to 
protect a significant amount  
of the Group’s next 12 month 
expected royalty income. 
Under the policy, the Group 
can hedge up to 70% of the 
next quarter’s income, 60% of 
the second quarter followed  
by 30% and 25% thereafter.
The Group has a relatively  
low level of borrowings and,  
as such, interest rate risk is not 
considered material when 
assessing the Group’s longer- 
term prospects.
The Directors have carefully 
considered this risk in making 
a positive statement about 
going concern and viability.
The risk of counterparty 
default is assessed when 
entering into new royalty 
agreements. The Directors 
are confident that the Kestrel 
and Narrabri royalties, which 
represent the majority of the 
Group’s receivables, are at 
relatively low risk of default 
due to the nature of the 
operators involved.
The Group will always be 
exposed to foreign exchange 
risk on future acquisitions  
but has sought to commence 
a cash flow hedging 
programme for its current 
income producing assets. 
Interest rates currently 
remain at historically low 
levels. There can be no 
guarantee that this will 
continue in the short to 
medium term which could 
impact on the cost of the 
Group’s capital when 
acquiring future royalties.
Other pricing risk
The Group’s results are 
determined by other pricing 
inputs which could result  
in unrealised losses at each 
reporting date.
 • The Group has a portfolio 
of certain publicly quoted 
equity investments which 
are marked to market at 
each reporting date
 • The Group’s asset values 
are underpinned by the 
forward commodity price 
outlook at each reporting 
date. A decline in these 
prices could result in 
further impairment or 
revaluation charges
The Group’s equity portfolio 
has largely been divested, 
meaning any future 
impairment should be much 
less material to the Group.
The Group uses independent 
third party consensus prices  
at each reporting date in 
assessing for impairment. 
The Group is exposed to 
commodity prices and a 
significant decrease in 
commodity prices is likely to 
result in further impairment 
charges. There is little the 
Directors can do to mitigate 
against this risk once a royalty 
has been acquired.

Adjusted earnings per share reflects the profit which management  
is capable of influencing. It disregards any valuation movements, 
which reflect short-term commodity price fluctuations, impairments, 
amortisation and share-based payment expenses.
It also adjusts for any profits or losses which are realised from the sale 
of equity instruments within the mining and exploration interests as 
these are determined based on market forces outside the control of 
the Directors. Adjusted earnings divided by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue gives adjusted earnings per share (refer to 
� note 11 for further details).
Royalty income reflects the revenue from the Group’s underlying 
royalty and streaming assets on an accruals basis (refer to � note 4  
for further details).
It is a policy of the Group to pay a significant portion of its royalty 
income as dividends. Just as important as maintaining the dividend  
is maintaining the quality of the dividend. Dividend cover is 
calculated as the number of times adjusted earnings per share 
exceeds the dividend per share (refer to � note 12 for further details).
In any period where there is an adjusted loss, the dividend cover  
will be reported as nil.
The structure of a number of the Group’s royalty financing 
arrangements, such as the Denison transaction completed in 
February 2017, result in a significant amount of cash flow being 
reported as principal repayments, which are not included in the 
income statement. As the Group considers dividend cover based  
on the free cash flow generated by its assets, management have 
determined that free cash flow per share is a key performance 
indicator, going forward.
Free cash flow per share is calculated by dividing net cash generated 
from operating activities, plus proceeds from the disposal of non-core 
assets, less finance costs, by the weighted average number of shares  
in issue (refer to � note 33 for further details).

Australia. It is operated by Rio Tinto 
Limited (‘Rio Tinto’). The Group owns  
50% of certain sub-stratum lands which, 
under Queensland law, entitle it to coal 
royalty receipts from the Kestrel mine. 
The royalty rate to which the Group  
is presently entitled is prescribed by  
the Queensland Mineral Resources 
Regulations. These regulations currently 
AR16 | 29.03.17 | FRONT – PROOF 8
Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 26 stipulate that the basis of calculation  
is a three-tiered fixed percentage of the 
invoiced value of the coal as follows:
Average price per tonne for period Rate
Up to and including A$100  7%
Over A$100 and up to  
and including A$150 First A$100  7% 
 Balance  12.5%
More than A$150 First A$100  7% 
 Next A$50  12.5% 
 Balance  15%
Performance
The Group received royalty income  
of £13.1m from Kestrel during 2016, 
compared to £3.6m in 2015. The 
significant increase in royalty income  
in 2016 was due primarily to increased 
Kestrel production within the Group’s 
private royalty land and the weakening  
of the pound during 2016. 
In accordance with Anglo Pacific’s  
Kestrel information rights, the Group 
estimates that 80-90% of mining at 
Kestrel will be within our royalty lands 
during 2017 (2016: 67%), increasing  
to over 90% from the end of 2017 for  
a period of ~8-9 years.
In addition to the percentage of 
production within the Group’s private 
land increasing in 2016, the Group  
was encouraged by Rio Tinto’s fourth 
quarter production announcement on 
January 17, 2017 which reported overall 
production from Kestrel of 4.9mt for  
2016 compared to 4.1mt in 2015.
Valuation
The Kestrel royalty was independently 
valued at A$200.3m (£116.9m) and 
accounts for 46% of the Group’s total 
assets as at December 31, 2016 (2015: 
A$167.7m; £82.6m; 42%). The increase  
in the valuation of Kestrel resulted in a 
gain of £17.9m (2015: loss £27.2m) on the 
income statement, together with a foreign 
currency translation gain of £16.3m  
(2015: loss £7.2m). The value of the land is 
calculated by reference to the discounted 
expected royalty income from mining 
activity, as described in � note 14.  
The independent valuation has been 
undertaken by a Competent Person  
in accordance with the Valmin Code 
(AusIMM, 2005), which provides 
guidelines for the preparation of 
independent expert valuation reports. 
The Group monitors the accuracy of  
this valuation by comparing the actual 
cash received to that forecasted.
As the asset has a nominal cost base,  
the carrying value virtually represents 
the valuation surplus. The Group 
recognises a deferred tax provision 
against the valuation surplus and, as 
such, the net value on the balance  
sheet is £82.4m (2015: £58.3m).
The increase in fair value is largely due  
to the recovery in coking coal consensus 
prices, combined with the translation 
benefit following the weakening of the 
pound during H2 16.
The Group 
received royalty 
income of £13. 1m 
from Kestrel during

What we own
In March 2015, the Group acquired a 
royalty interest in the Narrabri coal 
project, a low cost thermal coal and 
pulverised coal injection (‘PCI’) coal mine 
located in New South Wales, Australia, 
operated by ASX-listed Whitehaven Coal 
Limited (‘Whitehaven’). The Narrabri 
royalty entitles the Group to royalty 
payments equal to 1% of gross revenue 
on all coal produced from within the area 
covered by the Narrabri royalty. The 
Narrabri royalty includes the Narrabri 
mine, and the Narrabri South project.
The Narrabri mine has scope to materially 
increase production over the short and 
medium term. Whitehaven estimates 
Narrabri to have a reserve based mine life 
of 25 years, and the potential to extend 
production thereafter with the 
development of Narrabri South.
Performance
The Group received royalty income  
of £4.2m during 2016 from Narrabri 
compared to £3.2m the previous year. 
Although the thermal coal price had  
a mixed year, production at Narrabri 
continued its impressive ramp up. In their 
FY 2016 (to June 30, 2016), Whitehaven 
announced that Narrabri produced  
6.8mt run-of-mine (‘ROM’), the top end  
of their guidance. They achieved 7.3mt  
of product, ahead of their previous 
guidance of 7.0-7.2mt. One of their key 
stated priorities at the time was to get  
the 400m wide longwall panel at Narrabri 
operational during FY 17. 
In their 2016 annual report, Whitehaven 
issued guidance of 8.0-8.3mt ROM for 
Narrabri, a significant increase on the 
6.8mt achieved in FY 2016. On January 9, 
2017 Whitehaven announced a revision 
to their guidance for FY 17 to 7.5-7.8mt. 
This was due to adverse geotechnical 
conditions at certain areas within the 
longwall panel. Despite this, and a period 
of wet weather, they remain on track to 
achieve their FY 17 saleable production 
guidance. The Group receives its royalty 
based on sales and not production. 
Whitehaven remains on track to bring  
in the 400m wide longwall panel in the 
first half of 2017, and the surface 
infrastructure and electrical upgrades 
were completed on schedule. 
On February 5, 2016, Whitehaven 
announced it intends to extend the 
Narrabri North longwall panels in the 
Narrabri South area, and that work  
to integrate Narrabri South into existing 
operations at Narrabri North had 
commenced. Drilling to convert Narrabri 
South Mineral Resources to Mineral 
Reserves is scheduled to occur  
during Whitehaven’s fiscal year ending  
June 30, 2017.
Valuation
The Narrabri royalty is classified as a 
royalty intangible asset on the balance 
sheet. As such, this asset is carried at cost 
less amortisation and impairments and 
does not benefit from any valuation uplift 
resulting from the positive developments 
in the year, as described above. Its 
carrying value does, however, reflect  
the impact of translation from Australian 
dollars to pounds which, at the year-end, 
resulted in a favourable uplift. Royalty 
intangible assets are amortised when 
commercial production commences,  
on a straight-line basis over the expected 
life of the mine.

What we own
The Group has a 2% NSR royalty on all 
mineral products sold from the area of 
the Maracás Menchen project to which 
the royalty interest relates. The project is 
located 250km south-west of the city of 
Salvador, the capital of Bahia State, Brazil 
and is 99.97% owned and operated by 
TSX listed Largo Resources Limited 
(‘Largo’).  
Performance
The Group received royalty income of 
£0.8m in 2016, an increase from the 
£0.6m it received in 2015, which was the 
first year of royalty revenue. Production 
ramp up was slower than envisaged at 
the time the Group acquired the royalty, 
not assisted by the pronounced decrease 
in the vanadium price during 2015  
which persisted into the first half of 2016 
and which will have impacted on the 
operator’s cash flow profile.
Despite the weak vanadium price, and 
following a series of financings announced 
by Largo, production began to increase 
significantly from H2 15 onwards.  
Largo announced production of 600t  
of Vanadium in July 2015, increasing to 
730t in April 2016, achieving a run rate  
of ~800t thereafter with a record month  
of 828t in December 2016.
This steady ramp up in production 
coincided with a recovery in the vanadium 
price in H2 16 which increased from 
$2.38/lb at the start of 2016 to reach 
$5.02/lb at December 31, 2016, and the 
Group’s royalty income began to increase 
towards the end of 2016 accordingly. 
Under the terms of the royalty sale 
agreement, the Group is required to pay  
a further US$1.5m once production 
reaches an annualised rate over a quarter 
of 9,500t. Given the production achieved 
in H2 16 by Largo, the Directors consider it 
probable that this production milestone 
will be achieved possibly in the next 18  
to 24 months and as such the Group  
has recognised both an asset and 
corresponding liability for this additional 
payment, as set out in � note 26 to the 
financial statements. A further payment 
of US$1.5m would be payable if 
production reaches an annualised rate 
over a quarter of 12,000t. Based on the 
current guidance however, the Directors 
do not consider this probable and as  
such no liability has been recognised.
Valuation
The Maracás Menchen royalty is  
classified as a royalty intangible asset  
on the balance sheet. As such, this asset 
is carried at cost less amortisation and 
impairments. Royalty intangible assets 
are amortised when commercial 
production commences, on a straight-
line basis over the expected life of  
the mine.

What we own
The Group has a 2.5% life of mine NSR 
royalty on the EVBC gold, copper and 
silver mine owned by TSX-listed Orvana 
Minerals Corp (‘Orvana’). EVBC is located  
in the Rio Narcea Gold Belt of northern 
Spain and was previously mined from 
1997 to 2006 by Rio Narcea Gold Mines. 
The royalty rate increases to 3% when the 
gold price is over US$1,100 per ounce.
Performance
The Group received royalty income  
of £1.2m from EVBC during the past year. 
This compares to £1.2m received in  
2015. EVBC has been one of the Group’s 
most consistent royalties over the past 
few years. 
Orvana acknowledged that EVBC 
produced a disappointing financial result 
in Q4 2016 (their Q1 FY 17). This resulted 
in overall production for the calendar 
year 2016 being some 20% lower than  
in 2015.   
Orvana are determine to extract 
operational efficiencies at the mine  
by targeting higher grade oxide zones 
along with targeting a ramp up from the 
recommenced Carlés operation. They 
also intend to revisit the mine plan to 
transition away from zones with poor 
ground conditions which impacted on 
production in 2016.
The strategy seems to be succeeding,  
as EVBC reached nameplate capacity  
of 2,000t per day in December 2016.
Valuation
The EVBC royalty is classified as an 
available-for-sale equity financial asset 
within royalty financial instruments on 
the balance sheet. As such, the asset is 
carried at fair value by reference to  
the discounted expected future cash 
flows over the life of the mine.

What we own
The Group has a 1% life of mine NSR

Performance
Total royalty income was £0.3m with 
maiden royalty receipts of £0.1m from 
Four Mile in February 2016, following  
the commencement of sales by Quasar. 
Although royalties to date have not been 
to the level the Group was expecting,  
due to lower sales volumes and higher 
deductions – which the Group are 
currently disputing – the key benefit of 
this royalty should accrue when Quasar 
enters into supply contracts which

What we own
The Group has a 1% life of mine NSR 
royalty on the Salamanca uranium 
project located in Spain and operated  
by ASX-listed Berkeley Energia Limited 
(‘Berkeley’). The project consists of four 
main deposits (Retortillo, Alameda, Zona  
7 and Gambuta) and is located in the 
Salamanca Province, Spain, 
approximately 250km west of Madrid.
Performance
Berkeley had a very eventful and 
successful 2016 which saw them build  
on the progress they made in 2015 by 
raising finance during the year to fund 
construction.
On January 31, 2017, Berkeley  
announced its fourth quarter update  
in which it reported an oversubscribed 
$30m equity raise, signing of an off-take 
agreement and continued to develop  
the infrastructure required to construct 
the mine. They appear on track to 
complete the construction of the mine 
during 2017 which, if completed, should 
bring forward the start date for the 
commencement of our royalty.
In addition to having a royalty over  
the Salamanca project, Anglo Pacific is 
also a large shareholder in the company 
and currently holds just over 9%.  
The value of this investment increased 
considerably over the course of the  
year and the Group took the opportunity 
to realise a modest amount of cash from 
this position. We were pleased to see  
the successful fundraisings undertaken  
in 2016 which clearly demonstrates 
considerable support for the project  
and has increased liquidity in the stock.
We were also pleased to see the 
announcement on June 8, 2016 that 
Berkeley had entered into a financing 
agreement with Resource Capital Funds 
(RCF), which included a further 0.375% 
royalty on the project for US$5m. This 
would imply a fair value of $13.3m for  
the Group’s 1% royalty. Anglo Pacific paid 
A$4.1m for the royalty a number of years 
ago, which implies that the value of the 
Group’s royalty, which is not reflected on 
our balance sheet, is considerably higher.
Valuation
The Salamanca royalty is classified as  
a royalty intangible asset on the balance 
sheet. As such, this asset is carried at  
cost less amortisation and impairments. 
Royalty intangible assets are amortised

in north-west British Columbia, Canada, 
following its disposal of the related 
mining licences in 2014 to the project’s 
operator, ASX-listed Atrum Coal Limited 
(‘Atrum’). The royalty entitled the Group 
to the higher of 1% of gross revenue  
on a mine gate basis or US$1.00/t from 
coal sales derived from the Panorama 
licences. Following a series of discussions 
during 2016, an agreement was reached 
to settle amounts outstanding under a 
promissory note in return for additional 
royalties as follows:  
0.5% GRR covering all production  
within Atrum’s Groundhog Anthracite 
Project (‘Groundhog’) tenements from 
first production until ten years from the 
date that Atrum declares commercial 
production on the project; and 
subsequently
0.1% GRR from production within the 
Groundhog North Mining Complex 
project area.
Performance
On June 9, 2016, Atrum announced  
a revised PFS which outlined an 
underground project capable of 
producing 880ktpa of ultra-high grade 
anthracite over a mine life of 28 years.
Atrum published its key objectives for 
2017 on February 14, 2017 which targets  
a small mine permit to enable them to 
produce up to 250kt from Groundhog 
per annum.
Valuation
The Groundhog royalty is classified as  
a royalty intangible asset on the balance 
sheet. As such, this asset is carried at  
cost less amortisation and impairments. 
Royalty intangible assets are amortised 
when commercial production 
commences, on a straight-line basis

Performance
The projects which Noront intend to

was targeting commencing road work 
access to the region beginning in 2018. 
Although this will not directly benefit  
the underlying licences which the Group

of infrastructure works will mark a 
significant event in progressing the asset 
towards production.
In the meantime, the price of chromite 
increased fourfold in 2016, which continued 
to underpin the carrying value of the 
royalty on the Group’s balance sheet.

Performance
Due to limited progress during the year, 
and Hummingbird’s short-term focus  
on its Yanfolila project in Mali, the Group 
extended the likely start date of the

suspended it was producing a mix of 
sinter feed, pellet feed and spiral 
concentrates.  
Performance
Production at Amapá has been 
suspended since 2013 following a major 
port incident. The mine’s operator, Zamin, 
had previously indicated that attempts 
were being made to restructure its 
finances in order to fund the rebuilding  
of the port facilities, however, in 2016  
the Directors understand that Zamin has 
filed for bankruptcy protection in Brazil.  
Valuation
The Directors have assessed the timing 
of Amapá returning to commercial 
production as being indeterminable and 
have recognised an impairment charge  
of £2.0m at the year end. Following the 
impairment charges recognised during 
the year and taking into account 
movements in foreign exchange, the 
residual carrying value was £nil as at 
December 31, 2016 (2015: £1.8m).

What we own
The Group has a 1% life of mine NSR 
royalty on the Jogjakarta iron sands 
project operated by ASX-listed Indo 
Mines Limited (‘Indo Mines’). Until the 
project reaches commercial product, the 
Group receives 8% interest on the initial 
advance of US$4.0m in perpetuity.  
Upon entering commercial production 
the NSR royalty is calculated at 2% until 
the initial advance of U$4.0m is repaid.  
The NSR royalty remains at 2% where  
the pig iron price is more than US$700/t.
Performance
Indo Mines continued a program of 
quantitative test work on the quality  
of the iron concentrates produced  
from their test plant throughout 2016.  
On February 6, 2017, the Group entered 
into a deed of variation with Indo Mines 
agreeing to defer 70% of the interest  
due for the period September 1, 2016 to 
March 31, 2017 until June 30, 2017 to assist 
Indo in managing their cash flows position.
The Group noted that Indo Mines applied 
for a voluntary suspension from the ASX 
pending the finalisation and lodging of 
their December 31, 2016 half yearly 
accounts on March 17, 2017. Indo Mines 
announced that they were in the process 
of finalising two transaction, the first 
relating to the sale of their 51% share  
in a cash generating subsidiary and the 
second relating to the issuance of a 
quasi-debt instrument for between 
US$20.0 – US$24.0m would provide the 
necessary funding to bring the project 
into commercial production, along with 
repaying the US$4.0m advance provided 
by the Group.
Valuation
The Jogjakarta royalty interest is 
accounted for as an available-for-sale 
debt instrument at fair value, calculated 
on a discounted future cash flow basis

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 36 The Group’s financial position and prospects improved considerably during 2016, building on the growth which we had already 
experienced in 2015. This is the second year in a row in which we report noticeable increases in royalty income, and this resulted in the 
Group achieving dividend cover for 2016, the first time since 2011, as well as becoming debt free at the end of January, prior to the Denison 
financing transaction. With further growth in royalty revenue expected in 2017, the Group is in a strong financial position to grow its asset 
base and continue to reward shareholders through a progressive dividend policy. 
Income statement
The combination of an increase in mining within the Group’s royalty land at Kestrel along with the weakening of the pound following the 
EU referendum had the largest impact on the Group’s earnings in 2016. The impact of much higher coal prices in Q4 16 ensured a very 
strong finish to the year.

The Group continued to keep its cost base in line with the previous year, despite a significant increase in revenue. The benefit of the 
weaker pound, particularly in H2 16, led to considerable realised currency gains during 2016. All of this combined to produce earnings  
per share for the year of 15.60p and adjusted earnings per share of 9.76p. On the adjusted metric, the Group’s dividend cover was 1.6x.

Total royalty income 19,705 127% 8,683 149% 3,481
Royalty income increased by 127% to £19.7m in the year, from £8.7m in 2015 and a world apart from the £3.5m earned in 2014. The reason 
for the growth in royalty income year on year since 2014 is largely due to the previously mentioned combination of higher sales volumes 
from Kestrel in 2016 and a greater proportion of this being within Anglo Pacific’s royalty land.
Kestrel
Overall production from Kestrel in 2016 was 4.9mt compared with 4.1mt in 2015, a 19.5% increase in volume. Of greater significance to the 
Group’s earnings was that the percentage of sales attributable to the Group’s royalty land increased significantly, in line with our previous 
guidance and expectations.
In total, 67% of all sales from Kestrel in 2016 were from coal mined within our land, an increase on the 49% in 2015. The map included on 
�
page 26. illustrates the direction of mining at the Kestrel South mine, and adds colour as to why the Group’s income has been so volatile 
over the past three years. However, the map also illustrates why we believe that 2017 will show further growth for the Group as, save for  
a period in Q1 2017, we expect virtually all mining to be within our land for the foreseeable future. Our guidance for 2017 is for 80-90%  
of production to be within our land, and 90% thereafter. 
Although Anglo Pacific attributable volume is the key driver of revenue growth at Kestrel, there are three other factors worth mentioning. Firstly, 
the prices which we realised from Kestrel were largely flat from 2015 levels up until Q4 2016 when the coking coal priced spiked suddenly from 
US$89t in Q3 2016 to $200t in Q4 2016. Although this level of pricing only relates to one quarter of income in 2016 it did provide a significant 
boost to our end of year income. Secondly, and a knock-on effect of the price increase, is that with the higher coal price, the highest royalty rate 
will apply due to a ratchet mechanism as outlined on 
�
page 27. The more than doubling of the coal price for the final quarter ensured a greater 
portion of sales was attracting the highest royalty rate. This led to royalty revenue for Q4 16 being the fourth highest quarterly coal royalty 
received by Anglo Pacific in Australian dollar terms. Finally, the weakening of the pound, following the EU referendum and as discussed further 
below, meant that the Group was translating its Australian dollar revenue at more favourable rates throughout 2016. 
All of this resulted in income from Kestrel increasing by 262% to £13.1m in the year, compared to £3.6m in 2015.

Narrabri
Narrabri also contributed strongly to the Group’s increase in earnings in 2016 generating income of £4.2m, an increase of 32% on the 
£3.2m earned in 2015. This increase has also been driven largely by favourable movements in coal price and foreign exchange rates.  
Sales by Whitehaven in 2016 were 7.8mt, slightly ahead of 7.6mt in 2015. 
Similar to Kestrel, revenue from Narrabri also benefited from a sharp and sudden increase in coal prices in the final quarter of 2016, 
whereas prices had been falling throughout the first six months of the year. The implied average price received by the Group was ~10% 
higher than the previous year. The remainder of the increase is attributable to the benefit of translating Australian dollar revenue into 
pounds at a more favourable exchange rate following the weakening of the pound subsequent to the EU referendum. 
Details on guidance for Narrabri are discussed in more detail on 
�
page 28, explaining why the Group expects further growth in royalty 
income in 2017.
EVBC
EVBC continues to be a consistent performer for the Group, generating revenue of £1.2m in 2016, which is 6% lower than 2015. The 
operator, Orvana Minerals (‘Orvana’), does not publish specific sales information in relation to individual mines. They do, however, provide 
production information. Overall, production was approximately 21% lower in calendar year 2016 at 41,513oz gold, 130,301oz silver and 
3.9mlbs copper. Their guidance for their fiscal year ending on September 30, 2017 shows anticipated increases to 50-55,000oz gold, 
170-200,000oz silver and 6-6.5mlbs of copper, which would represent a significant uplift from 2016. 
The average price for each commodity had mixed fortunes in 2016, with copper down 11.6%, gold up 7.6% and silver up 8.9%. Again,  
the Group’s revenue benefited from translating the Canadian dollars it receives into pounds at a much more favourable exchange rate 
subsequent to the EU referendum. 
Maracás
Income from Maracás increased by 29% in the period to just under £0.8m. The increase was largely attributable to sales volumes 
increasing significantly during the year as Largo reported very strong production numbers in H2 2016. Production increased from 630t  
in July to 828t in December 2016. 
Strong sales numbers in H2 16 coincided with a recovery in the price of vanadium, which ended the year at $5.02/lb, more than double  
the level of $2.38/lb at the end of 2015. 
Four Mile
Royalties from Four Mile commenced during 2016, although at a very low level. We have been disappointed with the level of deductions 
which the operator, Quasar Resources (‘Quasar’), a subsidiary of Heathgate Resources (themselves a division of General Atomic), have 
applied in determining the royalty payable. We have disputed the manner in which Quasar have interpreted the royalty agreement, but 
have not been able to resolve this to date. We are considering our options in relation to this matter but currently, and conservatively, we  
are assuming limited royalty income from this royalty until the matter is resolved. 
Operating expenses
Total operating expenses for the year were in line with 2015 which demonstrates one of the key benefits of the royalty model  
i.e. a significant increase in revenue does not necessitate a corresponding increase in the cost base.

value creation plan and general management of the Group’s royalty portfolio. Staff costs decreased modestly in the period as headcount 
was higher in the first half of 2015. Overall, management are of the view that central costs are not excessive, and exercise discipline around 
cost control, identifying savings where possible.

Realised foreign exchange gains 2,265 411
Finance income 2,347 229.6% 712
Finance costs increased significantly in the year, due to the combination of higher interest costs associated with running at higher average 
borrowings in the year and an increase in aborted costs associated with acquisitions which failed to complete. Aborted costs associated 
with acquisitions is a business cost which is incurred as part of the Group’s efforts to add royalties to its portfolio. The Group invested a 
considerable amount of time during the year on certain transactions which unfortunately proved not to meet the Group’s exacting 
investment criteria. 
Finance income is dominated by realised foreign exchange gains in the period due to the weakening of the pound post Brexit. At a high 
level, it represents the difference between income accounted for at average rates versus the actual amount received. This was particularly 
noticeable during 2016, where the GBP:AUD rate averaged 1.95 in H1 16 whereas the average for H2 16 was 1.70. Even though the average 
for H2 16 was 1.70, the full year Australian revenue was translated at the average rate for the year, which was 1.82. With most of our 
revenue generated in H2 16, this created a large realised foreign exchange gain as the revenue was reflected in the income statement  
at a higher translation rate than what was ultimately received. A similar trend occurred with the Group’s Canadian and US dollar derived 
revenue. Realised foreign exchange gains and losses are included within the calculation of adjusted earnings. 
Other income
Other income comprises the effective income received in relation to royalty instruments along with any other forms of revenue which the

The mark to market ‘gain’ represents the extent to which the Group’s forward currency hedges were in the money at the balance sheet 
date. As noted in the CEO report, the Group took advantage of the sudden devaluation of the pound to put in place a series of forward 
contracts designed to lock in favourable rates of converting its Australian dollar income over the following four quarters. The Group 
entered into these trades in December 2016. The policy is to hedge, on a sliding scale, a percentage (70%-25%) of the next four quarters’ 
expected dollar income and this represents cash flow hedging rather than anything speculative. As this is a point in time valuation, this 
gain is not included in adjusted earnings.
Tax
The Group was successful in obtaining a number of tax rebates in the year, some of which were not provided for in previous periods.  
The Group utilised tax losses in the year, resulting in no corporation tax being paid in 2016.

Profit after tax
Profit after tax of £26.4m for the year ended December 31, 2016, is represented by adjusted earnings as outlined above, plus the gain on 
sale of certain of the Group’s mining and exploration interests of £2.4m, together with the favourable Kestrel revaluation of £17.9m, less 
the impairment charge of £2.0m in relation to the Amapá royalty and the revaluation charge of £4.9m in relation to the Group’s Dugbe 1 
royalty and tax thereon.
Balance sheet
Net assets increased from £162.0m at the beginning of the year to £210.1m at December 31, 2016, an increase of 28.5%. This equates  
to net assets per share of 124p per share at the end of 2016 compared to 95p at the end of the previous year. The main catalyst for  
the increase was undoubtedly the weakening of the pound in the second half of the year, as the majority of the Group’s assets are 
denominated in dollar currencies. The impact of currency was most pronounced for Kestrel, which is fair valued at each reporting date. 
The following table reconciles the movement in net assets during 2016:

The upward revision to the forward price outlook for coal translated into a noticeable increase in the underlying value of the Group’s Kestrel 
royalty. The balance sheet also benefited from translating this Australian dollar asset into pounds at a more favourable rate on the reporting 
date following the weakening of the pound following the EU referendum. In line with IFRS, the Group recognises a deferred tax charge in 
relation to any movement in the value, resulting in an overall £24.0m increase in net assets during the period attributable to Kestrel.
The other main increase in value was the £12.8m translation benefit associated with the portfolio of assets accounted for as intangible 
assets. Intangible assets are recognised at the lower of fair value and amortised cost. As these assets are largely denominated in Australian 
dollars, the increase here relates to the weakening of the pound throughout 2016. The main constituent of the royalty intangible category 
is the Group’s Narrabri royalty. The value of this royalty, similar to Kestrel, has increased considerably with the outlook for thermal coal 
along with higher production rates. The Group, in accordance with IFRS, does not recognise this increase on the balance sheet but the 
unaudited valuation would indicate an increase of as much as 50% on what we paid for it two years ago. 
In December 2016, the Group received several offers from the owner of the Isua project to purchase its Isua royalty, an asset which was 
carried on the balance sheet at £nil. After due consideration, the Group decided to accept an offer and disposed of its interest for £16,000. 
This gave rise to a tax asset of £4.4m which is expected to be available to shelter royalty income during 2017. 
The Group recorded further impairment charges of £2.0m in relation to its Amapá royalty, along with a £5.0m reduction in value of its 
Dugbe 1 asset. These non-cash charges arose due to revisions made to the likely restart/start date of the projects, with the operator of 
Amapá experiencing financial difficulties. Using these revised cash flow projections for Dugbe 1 resulted in the value being less than cost 
and an adjustment was made accordingly. 
The Group took the opportunity to realise a modest amount of cash from its non-core equity portfolio during the year. Despite this, the 
overall value of the portfolio grew by £4.1m, due largely to an increase in the share price of Berkeley Energia in which the Group has a large 
equity position.

The Group generated cash of £12.9m from its royalty portfolio during 2016, compared to £9.0m in the previous year.  With royalty related 
receipts of £12.3m (2015: £5.3m) and other income from the royalty portfolio of £0.6m (2015: £3.7m), sufficient cash was generated during 
the year to allow a partial repayment of £1.3m on the borrowing facility. The Group ended the year with cash of £5.3m and had £6.3m 
drawn on its borrowing facility, resulting in net debt of £1.0m, down from £1.8m at the end of 2015.
The cash and borrowings analysis above has moved on considerably since the balance sheet date. Prior to the completion of the Denison 
transaction, the Group received the Q4 16 royalty receipts of £11.3m in full and paid the 2016 interim dividend of £5.1m. As a result, the 
Group was in a net cash position prior to the Denison transaction. With dividend cover now established, the borrowing facility should be 
used solely for acquisitions moving forward. 
As part of the Denison transaction, the Group took the opportunity to refinance and extend by two years its existing borrowing facility, 
which was due to mature in February 2018. A key criterion in refinancing was the creation of a flexible borrowing feature. As such, although 
the committed amount remains unchanged at $30.0m, there is an accordion feature which allows for this to potentially increase to $40m  
for an acceptable accretive investment opportunity. 
The refinancing also presented the Group with the opportunity to engage with other lenders. We decided that, with the Denison 
transaction imminent, it was the opportune time to establish a syndicate of lenders with the view that having two blue chip banks involved 
should result in greater borrowing capacity as the business grows. Accordingly, we were pleased to welcome Investec as our banker 
alongside Barclays.
Given the increasing level of cash flow generation expected over the coming years, primarily from Kestrel, and the increasing level of 
macroeconomic volatility, the Group has commenced a policy of hedging the currencies in which it receives its royalty income. This 
became particularly attractive immediately after the EU referendum. The Group will look to continue hedging a proportion of its forecast 
next 12 month cash flow. 
Free cash flow per share
The structure of the Denison transaction will result in a significant amount of cash flow being reported as loan principal repayment,  
which will not be included in the income statement. As such, we have decided to introduce a key performance indicator measuring the 
cash generated by the Group. This is important as in addition to the Group assessing dividend cover by making reference to the adjusted 
earnings per share, the Group will also consider the free cash flow per share as a means of assessing the sustainability of the Group’s 
dividend.
During 2016, the free cash flow generated by the Group was £13.2m (2015: £4.7m) versus dividend payments of £11.8m (2015: £11.9m). 
Most of the group’s royalty income for 2016 was earned in the final quarter, and so not received until Q1 17. As such free cash flow, and 
associated dividend cover, in 2017 is expected to be considerably higher than 2016. With mining expected to be firmly within the Group’s 
private royalty land at Kestrel from Q2 2017, the cash flow profile is expected to be much smoother than it has been over the past few 
years, which saw most of the revenue generated in the second half of the year. Refer to 

note 33 for further detail details of the free cash 
flow per share.

Environment
Anglo Pacific is committed to an environmental policy of 
collaborating fully with statutory authorities, local communities 
and other interested parties in order to limit any potential adverse 
impacts of its activities on the natural and human environments 
associated with its operations. The nature of the Group’s royalty 
investments is such that it does not operate any of the properties 
underlying its royalty portfolio and, consequently, it does not 
always have the ability to influence the manner in which the 
operations are carried out. Nevertheless, a responsible approach 
to a project’s environmental impact and its sustainability 
management is essential to the success of the project over its life.
As part of the Group’s investment decision process, careful 
consideration is given to the environmental aspects of any 
potential asset purchase during the due diligence phase. In 
particular, the Group typically engages with consultants who  
have the requisite expertise to ensure that it can consider and,  
if necessary, mitigate any risks in this regard to a properly 
maintainable level. In 2016, as part of the Denison financing 
agreement, Anglo Pacific engaged an independent consultant, 
Golder Associates, to review the key environmental risks and 
environmental liabilities relating to the project. No issues were 
identified as part of this process. The Group expects employees to 
address environmental and sustainability responsibilities within 
the framework of normal operating procedures and to look to 
minimise waste as much as economically practicable. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing the Group’s 
environmental practices and for monitoring their effectiveness.
Social and community issues
Anglo Pacific acknowledges that, whilst its activities have little 
direct contact with communities, it can positively influence the 
social practices and policies of companies it conducts business 
with. Positive social and community relationships are essential to 
profitable and successful mining activities. The Group endeavours 
to ensure that companies it works with have appropriate 
procedures in place to facilitate this. More specifically, Anglo 
Pacific’s investment decision process for potential asset purchases 
involves due diligence relating to the full range of CSR issues, 
including the social and community aspects of the project. As part 
of its 2016 Denison financing agreement, Anglo Pacific reviewed 
the social and community factors associated with the Cigar Lake 
Project. No issues were identified as part of this process. 
Diversity
The Group’s employees are instrumental to its success, and it 
respects and values the individuality and diversity that every 
employee brings to the business. As at December 31, 2016, 54% of 
the Group’s employees were female (2014: 54%) as the Group had 
11 employees, six of whom were female. In terms of the Company’s 
Board of Directors, there were six Directors, five of whom were 
male and one of whom was female. Prior to any appointment to  
the Board, the Nomination Committee gives due regard to diversity 
and gender with a view to appointing the best placed individual  
for the role. The Group recognises that it has more to do in 
encouraging and supporting diversity and hopes to be able to 
identify and develop talent at all levels in the organisation as the

Anglo Pacific seeks to maintain the 
highest standards in all areas of its 
business. 
An extensive review was commissioned in 2014 by the Board, 
taking into account international guidance. The standards 
considered included: the Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative; the Global Reporting Initiative Mining and Metal Sectors 
Supplement; the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Human 
Rights; and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, 
together with CSR reporting and CSR commitments of the mines 
that it is invested in. Consequently, the Group has extended and 
strengthened its due diligence process to reflect current best 
practices.
The mechanism that the Group uses to monitor CSR issues has 
been given greater granularity. In particular, it directs the Group  
to consider the governance, policy provision, management, 
measurement and reporting of each material issue. During 2016, 
the Group has applied this to the consideration of potential 
investments, including it as a key royalty acquisition criterion,  
and uses it in the monitoring of existing investments. 
At the same time the Group has further improved its office 
practices, in particular those within its London head office. The 
Group has implemented improvements, including but not confined 
to measures to conserve energy, which we are pleased to report 
has improved by 14%.
During 2016, the Group improved its recycling policy and now 
recycles 35% of all office waste (2015: 25%). The Group plans  
to improve this further during 2017.
The Group is confident that the changes made will enable it to 
achieve improvements in its CSR practice.
Integrity
Anglo Pacific is committed to maintaining its reputation for  
fair dealing. The Group does not offer, give or receive bribes  
or inducements whether directly or through a third party.
The Group has policies and procedures in place to ensure that all 
Directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, business 
partners, and anyone else who may be acting on its behalf, are 
aware of their responsibilities in this area. The Group actively 
promotes a transparent approach to all of its business dealings  
and expect employees to adopt a zero tolerance attitude to 
corruption. Employees are encouraged to report any potential  
or apparent misconduct in accordance with the Group’s internal 
whistle-blowing policy and any employee that refuses to pay 
bribes, or raises any issues honestly, and in good faith, will be 
supported by the Group.
The Group chooses business partners and counterparties carefully, 
based on merit and reputation, and only works with persons of 
known integrity, who it believes will act consistently with its own 
standards. The Group does not make facilitation payments.  
Where business is conducted in countries with laws that are less 
restrictive than the Group’s policies and procedures, it will seek to 
follow its own policies and procedures, promoting its standard of 
integrity wherever possible.
STRATEGIC REPORT
APG13 | AR16 | 29/03/2017 | Middle – Proof 8
Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 42 Human rights
The debate on the role of business and human rights has gained 
increasing prominence in recent years. Anglo Pacific welcomes  
this focus as respect for human rights is implicit across the Group’s 
employment practices. Further, a commitment to human rights  
is an important part of any successful organisation. As part of the 
Group’s investment decision process, if necessary, consultants 
with the requisite expertise are engaged to assist in identifying  
and mitigating any such risks.
Health and safety
The health and safety of the Group’s employees is of fundamental 
importance and is a responsibility it takes seriously. The Group’s 
small size allows the day-to-day responsibility to remain at Board 
level, being monitored by the Chief Executive Officer. The Group 
has both a health and safety policy and office risk assessments in 
place, which are reviewed on an annual basis. Furthermore, a 
commitment to health and safety is a fundamental component of 
any mining project, and, as part of the Group’s investment decision 
process, consultants with the requisite expertise are engaged to 
assist in identifying and mitigating any such risks.
Donations
The Group’s philosophy on charity has historically been that this  
is a decision best made by shareholders with their own resources. 
The Group has revised its policy and will now consider supporting 
select charities at the discretion of the Directors. No donations 
were made during 2016; however, the Group will continue to 
consider supporting select charities during 2017.
Greenhouse gas emissions
The UK Government requires that UK listed companies should 
report their global levels of greenhouse gas emissions in their 
Annual Report. Anglo Pacific is a relatively small organisation, with 
11 employees, which means that any emission sources within its 
operational and financial control, such as business travel, purchase 
of electricity, heat or cooling by the Group, are not material in their 
impact. As the management and operation of the underlying 
mines generating the Group’s royalty income are outside its 
control, it is unable to report on these emissions.
Following the Group’s move to a new office at the end of 2014, 
power consumption has been monitored and has improved by 
14%.
The information on 
� pages 08 to 43 represents the Group’s 
Strategic Report and has been approved by the Board.

information Our approach towards corporate governance
As a standard listed company on the London Stock Exchange,  
the Company is required to comply with the minimum regulatory 
requirements imposed by the EU that apply to all securities 
admitted to trading on EU regulated markets. Accordingly, the 
Company is subject to the relevant Listing Rules, the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules and the Prospectus Rules. However, it is 
not required to comply with the super-equivalent provisions of the 
Listing Rules which apply to companies with a premium listing. 
The Company is, however, complying on a voluntary basis with 
related party requirements that are substantially equivalent to 
those set out in Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules. 
The Board remains committed to high standards of corporate 
governance, and considers all Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent.
Board and Committee structure
The Board is collectively responsible for approving the Group’s 
long-term objectives and strategy and for reviewing performance 
against them. The Board is also responsible for the general 
oversight of the Group’s operations and management. 
In 2016, the Board continued to be chaired by Mike Blyth, as 
Non-Executive Chairman, responsible for the leadership and 
effectiveness of the Board. The time commitment expected of the 
Non-Executive Chairman is around six days per month. Mr. Blyth’s 
other (mainly charitable) commitments are shown on 
�
page 45, 
none of which is considered to be significant.
The day-to-day management of the Group is delegated to the  
Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’), save for certain matters reserved  
for consideration by the Board. The CEO is supported by the  
Chief Financial Officer & Company Secretary and the Head of 
Investments who meet as an Executive Committee. The Executive 
Committee is no longer a formal Board Committee because it is  
not currently comprised of a majority of Executive Directors. The 
Chairman and CEO have distinct roles which have been defined in 
writing and agreed by the Board.
Other responsibilities are devolved to the Nomination, 
Remuneration and Audit Committees; their members are all 
Non-Executive Directors and their work is described more fully 
below. The terms of reference of each Committee, and the matters 
reserved to the Board, are available on the Group’s website. 
David Archer continued to act as the Group’s Senior Independent 
Director (‘SID’) this year. The role of the SID is to provide a sounding 
board for the Chairman and to serve as an intermediary for the 
other Directors where necessary. The SID takes the lead on 
meetings of the Non-Executive Directors outside the formal 
committee structure, and is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that have not been resolved through the normal 
channels of Chairman, CEO or other member of the Executive 
Committee, or where such channels would be inappropriate.

report Governance The Board
Appointment, development and assessment of Directors
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
opportunity after their appointment. Under the terms of the 
Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors are required to 
retire and seek reappointment by shareholders at an AGM on the 
third anniversary of their appointment. All current Non-Executive 
Directors were appointed for an initial three-year term, renewable 
at the Board’s discretion for up to two further three-year periods 
thereafter, and the Board intends that all future Non-Executive 
Director appointments will be on similar terms. Notwithstanding 
this, it is the Board’s intention that all Directors, including the 
Non-Executive Directors, shall be subject to re-election at  
each AGM.
Each Director is required to disclose to the Board their other 
significant commitments prior to appointment and when there  
is any significant change. The Board considers that all of the 
Directors allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge  
their responsibilities effectively.
Actual and potential conflicts of interest are regularly reviewed. 
Also, as permitted under the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s 
Articles of Association contain provisions that enable the Board to 
authorise conflicts or potential conflicts that individual Directors 
may have and to impose such limits or conditions as the Board 
deems appropriate.
The Company’s Directors have a wide range of skills as well as 
appropriate experience in financial, commercial, audit and mining 
activities and provide a challenge to senior management and  
the Company’s strategy. Each Director takes responsibility for 
undertaking the appropriate training required for developing and 
updating their knowledge and capabilities. The Chairman regularly 
reviews the Directors’ training needs and, where appropriate, the 
Group provides the resources to meet the Directors’ requirements. 
The Board has in place a formal induction process for new 
Directors on joining the Board, which is tailored to the needs  
of the individual.
Board evaluation
Every year, the Board undertakes an evaluation of its own 
performance and that of the Board Committees and individual 
Directors (including the Chairman). This year, we carried out  
a self-evaluation of key areas of the Board’s work including: 
• roles and responsibilities; Committees; strategy setting;
• performance monitoring; risk management; and 
• internal control.
Each of the Directors completed a self-assessment questionnaire 
and discussed views with the Chairman in one-to-one meetings 
held during October 2016. The findings of this review were 
discussed at a meeting of the Board in November and a number  
of actions to further improve Board performance were agreed.
Overall, the review concluded that the Board is performing well, 
with no significant issues identified. The Board is seen to be well 
balanced with a good mix of relevant skills and experience. 
During the review process, the Board discussed a number of 
further performance enhancement opportunities. In summary,  
the Board has agreed to further refine our risk management 
procedures and the process of defining strategic objectives  
and monitoring progress against these throughout the year. 
In addition, the Board agreed on a number of minor administrative 
changes which have already been implemented.
Functioning of the Board
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, is 
responsible for setting the Board’s agenda and for ensuring that 
the Board receives accurate, timely and clear information. The 
agenda includes regular reports from the executive management 
and from the Board’s committees on all matters relating to the 
running of the Group. The Chairman is also responsible for 
ensuring that adequate time is available for discussion of all 
agenda items and in particular strategic issues.
The Group’s Company Secretary is responsible for advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters. All of the 
Directors have access to the Company Secretary’s services and 
advice. All of the Directors may also seek independent professional 
advice in the performance of their duties, at the Group’s expense.

they were eligible to attend during 2016 was as follows:

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 46
GOVERNANCE The key elements of the control system in operation are:
• The Board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision and has put in place an organisational 
structure with clear lines of responsibility and appropriate 
delegation of authority.
• There are established procedures for planning and approving 
investments and information systems for monitoring the Group’s 
financial performance against budgets and forecasts.
• The Chief Financial Officer is required to undertake an annual 
assessment process, to identify and quantify the risks that face 
the Group’s businesses and functions, and to assess the 
adequacy of the prevention, monitoring and mitigation practices 
in place for those risks. This process covers all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls. The 
Board is responsible for reviewing the risk assessment and risk 
management processes for completeness and accuracy.
• In addition to its work on the above, the Audit Committee also 
receives reports about significant risks and associated control 
and monitoring procedures. The Group’s internal controls and 
procedures documentation are regular agenda items for the 
Committee. The Committee also receives regular reports from 
the external auditors.
• The Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board on these 
matters, so as to enable the Directors to review the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control. The Board also receives regular 
reports or updates from its other Committees and directly from 
management in addition to carefully considering the Group’s risk 
register at regular intervals.
• The system accords with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code.
There are no significant issues disclosed in the report and financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and up to the 
date of approval of the report and financial statements that have 
required the Board to deal with any related material internal control 
issues.
The Directors confirm that the Board has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control during the period 
and concluded that the controls and procedures are adequate.  
The Board will continue to review the adequacy of the Company’s 
internal controls and will test the controls and procedures again 
during 2017.
Relations with shareholders
The Group is the only major natural resources royalty company 
listed on the LSE and recognises the importance of developing  
a fuller understanding of its business model amongst investors  
and an effective two-way communication with fund managers, 
institutional investors and analysts. The Chairman and SID meet 
with major shareholders, a range of fund managers and institutions 
on a regular basis.
There are over 2,000 private investors in the Group. The Board  
was pleased by the attendance at the 2016 AGM and the active 
engagement of investors to further their understanding of the 
current business activity.
The Company has three joint brokers, BMO Capital Markets, 
Macquarie Bank and Peel Hunt, and the Board remains satisfied 
that the UK, Australia and Canada, which are the three jurisdictions 
likely to make up most of our shareholder base, are well covered  
by brokers with significant local expertise.
At the same time, the Board continues to receive regular investor 
relations reports, including commentary on the perception of the 
Company, views expressed by the investment community, media 
reports, share price performance and analysis, so as to ensure that 
all Directors are made aware of the major shareholders’ issues and 
concerns.
Risk management and internal control
The Board retains overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management and determines the nature 
and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives. As discussed above, the Board has recognised 
the importance of increased focus on risk and risk management 
and has agreed to extend the remit of the Audit Committee to 
monitor the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management 
processes on behalf of the Board. The Board, supported by 
executive management, will also enhance the review and 
monitoring of the Group’s principal risks. 
A statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial 
statements is set out on 
�
page 69.
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to provide the 
Directors with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the 
Group will not be hindered in achieving its business objectives,  
or in the orderly and legitimate conduct of its business, by 
circumstances that may reasonably be foreseen. However, no 
system of internal control can eliminate the possibility of poor 
judgement in decision-making, human error, fraud or other 
unlawful behaviour, management overriding controls, or the 
occurrence of unforeseeable circumstances and the resulting 
potential for material misstatement or loss.

Main activities covered during 2016
The Nomination Committee was actively involved during 2016  
in reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board, in 
light of the need to maintain a balance of appropriate skills and 
accepted best corporate governance practice. The Committee 
concluded that no changes are required at this time.
Subsequent to the year end, the Committee unanimously 
approved the appointment of Patrick Meier as chairman in 
succession to Mike Blyth and the continuing appointment of  
Mike Blyth as a Non-Executive Director.

skills, experience and diversity being sought when making a 
search for new directors. With the assistance of external 
consultants, identifying and reviewing in detail each potential 
candidate available in the market and agreeing a ‘long list’ of 
candidates for each directorship. Following further discussions 
and research, deciding upon a shortlist of candidates for 
interview. Interview of shortlisted candidates by the Committee 
members who then convene to discuss their impressions and 
conclusions, culminating in a recommendation to the Board.

management are regularly reviewed for subsequent debate  
with the Non-Executive Directors and Chief Executive Officer. 
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the Group’s

Diversity policy
To increase diversity, in particular the representation of women 
and ethnicity on the Board.
The Board recognises the benefits of diversity and that its current 
composition is still deficient in several respects. Whilst the 
appointment of Ms. Rhodes as Non-Executive Director and Audit 
Committee Chair in 2014 was a positive step in addressing this,  
the Company continues to seek further opportunities to promote 
both diversity to the Board and to maintain a policy to appoint 
positions on merit and the needs of the Group at any one time.  
The opportunities for developing and appointing women to 
Executive Directorships will be kept under review.

 note 3.9 together with the disclosures related to the 
impairment charge described in  note 17 for the year ended 
December 31, 2016.
The Committee concluded the impairment charges recognised 
during the year ended December 31, 2016 were appropriate and  
have been adequately disclosed.
Review of the carrying value of royalties held at fair value The Committee reviewed and interrogated management’s key 
assumptions including production profiles, forecast commodity 
prices and discount rates used to determine the carrying value  
of those royalties held at fair value.
The Committee reviewed the disclosures related to the revaluation 
gain of £17.9m in relation to coal royalties, together with the 
revaluation charge of £4.9m in relation to royalty financial 
instruments, described in 
 notes 14 and 15 respectively, for the  
year ended December 31, 2016.
The Committee concluded that the fair value has been calculated  
in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy outlined in 
 note 2, 
is appropriate as at December 31, 2016 and adequately disclosed.
Review and challenge the inputs and judgement used in  
arriving at the conclusion on going concern and viability
The Committee critically assessed the projections of future cash 
flows under different scenarios, including the ‘severe but plausible’ 
case, and compared these with cash balances and committed 
facilities available to the Group. The Committee satisfied itself that  
it was appropriate to recommend to the Board the adoption by the 
Group of the going concern basis of preparation.

GOVERNANCE There are no significant issues disclosed in the report and financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and up to the 
date of approval of the report and financial statements that have 
required the Board to deal with any related material internal control 
issues.
The Directors confirm that there have been no significant changes 
to the system of internal controls, nor have there been any 
significant breaches reported during the year. As a result the Board 
has concluded that the controls and procedures are adequate.
The Committee also considers, on an annual basis, whether an 
internal audit function is required. Its present view is that one is not 
yet justified given the compact size of the Group and the Directors’ 
involvement with individual transactions.
External audit
To safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external 
audit process, it remains the Committee’s policy to review and 
approve all fees related to non-audit services. The policy prohibits 
the auditors from providing certain services such as accounting  
or valuation services. Details of the auditors’ remuneration are 
disclosed in 

note 5b.
The Committee will continue to review its activities in light of any 
regulatory developments going forward.
The Committee has satisfied itself that the external auditors’ 
independence was not impaired.
The Committee held meetings with the external auditors without 
the presence of management on three occasions and the 
Chairman of the Committee held regular meetings with the lead 
audit engagement partner during the year.
The Committee’s assessment of the external auditors’ performance 
and independence underpins its recommendation to the Board to 
propose to shareholders the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as 
auditors until the conclusion of the AGM in 2017.  Resolutions to 
authorise the Board to re-appoint and determine the remuneration 
of Deloitte LLP will be proposed at the AGM on May 10, 2017.

Fair, balanced and understandable
A key requirement of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts is 
that it be fair, balanced and understandable. The Audit Committee 
and the Board are satisfied that the Annual Report and Accounts 
meet this requirement as appropriate weight has been given to 
both positive and negative developments in the year.
In justifying this statement, the Audit Committee has considered 
the robust process which operates in creating the Annual Report 
and Accounts, including:
• the thorough process of review, evaluation and verification  
by senior management, which considered and drew on best 
practice for the creation of the Annual Report and Accounts; 
• a meeting of the Audit Committee held to review and consider 
the draft Annual Report and Accounts in advance of the final 
sign-off; and
• final sign-off provided by the Board.
Internal control and risk management
The Committee is responsible for the oversight of internal control 
and risk management systems across the Group. 
In carrying out its role, the Committee reviews the following:
• Regular updates of key internal control matters in respect of the 
Group financial reporting processes, such as financial reporting 
systems and controls.
• Procedures developed by management to identify and  
evaluate key business, financial and operational risks, and the 
effectiveness of the responses being implemented to mitigate 
the potential impacts.
• Policies and procedures in place to detect, monitor and 
investigate activity in respect of anti-fraud, bribery and 
corruption, such as the Group whistle-blowing facilities. 
The key elements of the control system in operation are:
• The Board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision and has put in place an organisational 
structure with clear lines of responsibility and appropriate 
delegation of authority.
• There are established procedures for planning and approving 
investments and information systems for monitoring the  
Group’s financial performance against budgets and forecasts.
• The Chief Financial Officer is required to undertake an annual 
assessment process to identify and quantify the risks that face 
the Group’s businesses and functions, and to assess the 
adequacy of the prevention, monitoring and mitigation practices 
in place for those risks. This process covers all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls. The 
Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the risk assessment 
process for completeness and accuracy.
• In addition to its work on the above, the Audit Committee also 
receives regular reports about significant risks and associated 
control and monitoring procedures. The Group’s risk register and 
internal controls and procedures documentation are regular 
agenda items for the Committee. The Committee also receives 
regular reports from the external auditors.
• The Audit Committee reports to the Board on these matters,  
so as to enable the Directors to review the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control. The Board also receives reports from 
its other Committees and directly from management.
• The system accords with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code.

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 52
GOVERNANCE Dear Shareholder,
Our remuneration report is, as last year, in two parts: a statement  
of the Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration, and an  
Annual Remuneration Report which describes how the policy  
was implemented during 2016. There have been no changes  
to the policy in the current year and, as such, the format for the 
forthcoming AGM vote will be advisory rather than of formal 
approval. However, and as described below, we are looking for 
approval to amend the Company’s articles of association to 
increase the ceiling on total fees payable to non-executive 
directors as a result of the increases effected from January 1,  
2017 onwards and to refresh headroom.
This report is set against a background of strong Company 
performance during 2016, which generated total shareholder 
returns (‘TSR’) of 134% in the period. A key component of 
long-term executive compensation is to align the interests of 
management with shareholders. The changes made to the Value 
Creation Plan (‘VCP’) at the AGM last year extended the term  
of the plan such that there are still four years remaining before 
management’s performance will be assessed against TSR. The 
Committee continues to believe this is an effective plan to 
incentivise its participants and to encourage the retention of key 
employees by giving them an opportunity to share in the growth  
of the company over the long term. The 2016 awards which were 
approved at the last AGM have not yet been granted due to a 
closed period which ends with the publication of this report and  
it is intended these will be made shortly.
The main focus for the Committee this year was in relation to the 
setting of bonus matrices, director fees and salary benchmarking. 
The salary of the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’), and his direct 
reports were comprehensively benchmarked at the end of 2016. 
The committee concluded that no change to the basic salary of 
the CEO was required at this stage and will continue to conduct  
this exercise on a regular basis in order to ensure that the Company 
is paying market rates that attract and retain key personnel. 
The Chairman’s fee remained unchanged during 2016. However, 
the Committee reviewed the level of the Chairman’s fees, noting 
that the fee had not been increased since April 1, 2014 and that  
the Chairman had waived the consideration of an increase at the 
end of 2015. The purpose of the review was to ensure that we  
were offering a market competitive fee that takes into account  
the need to attract and retain an individual of the right calibre  
and experience and having regards to their responsibilities and 
time commitment. The Remuneration Committee conducted a 
benchmarking exercise which examined companies of a similar 
market capitalisation within a comparable sector. As a result, the 
Remuneration Committee resolved to recommend an increase  
in the Chairman’s fees from £95,000 to £115,000 effective from 
January 1, 2017 and that this be set for a period of two years. 
Directors’ fees, which were set in 2015, remained unchanged for 
2016. However, the Chairman and the CEO reviewed the level of 
the directors’ fees in conjunction with an industry benchmarking 
exercise and concluded that the fees be increased as follows from 
January 1, 2017:
• Base fee assuming at least one committee membership £46,000 
(previous £40,000);
• Committee chairman – an additional £5,000 (previously £3,000) 
and 
• Senior Independent Director – either an additional £6,000 
(previously £5,000) or, if combined with a committee 
chairmanship, £10,000
With the increases in the Chairman’s and Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees we are seeking shareholder approval to increase the ceiling for 
the aggregate level of Director fees paid from the current £400,000 
ceiling in the Company’s articles of association. With the increases 
to the Chairman’s and the Directors’ fees in 2017, the ceiling is 
being approached which would limit the ability of the board to 
increase the size of the non-executive board beyond the current 
five members, or indeed to allow for future increases in fees in line 
with the growth of the Company. The proposal is to increase this  
to £600,000.
The Remuneration Committee spent some time considering  
the most appropriate balance between salary and short-term 
incentives. The Committee is of the view that short-term incentives 
such as bonuses should not be considered as de-facto salary. As  
a result, the Remuneration Committee is looking to modulate  
the balance between salary and bonus by way of ensuring that:
• base salary levels compare favourably with industry 
comparables; and 
• bonus hurdle matrices are related to superior outcomes  
which truly constitute stretch-performance. 
In terms of short-term incentives, the CEO and the CEO’s direct 
senior reports have individually crafted bonus objectives which 
were agreed for the 2016 financial year. The bonus award criteria 
relate to a series of agreed corporate and personal performance 
targets which are scored out of a total of 100 points. The criteria 
have been amended from those of 2015 both in recognition of the 
slightly changed circumstances of the Company and to introduce 
more precision to the link between the real ‘stretch-performance’ 
targets and favourable outcomes for the Company. This score is 
then applied to a maximum bonus calculated as a percentage of 
total salary as outlined on 
�
page 6 1.
It is notable that the CEO elected, having regard to the then 
challenging resources industry conditions, to forgo being 
considered for the award of a bonus in 2015. The CEO’s bonus 
criteria were further tailored for the 2016 year, both to ensure that 
they closely match key performance metrics and at the same time 
provide real ‘stretch-performance’ targets. The CEO was awarded  
a bonus of £167,400 under the bonus criteria matrix or 46.5% of 
the total potential award. 
The last Annual General Meeting approved the award of further 
Value Creation Plan (‘VCP’) units to the CEO and others during 
2016. However, this was not actioned out of caution around 
potential closed periods. It is likely that the anticipated awards  
will be made in 2017, as mentioned above. 
The VCP is a major plank in our overall remuneration strategy and 
is a long-term incentive plan which provides awards of shares (in 
the form of nil cost share options) at the end of five years to the 
CEO and to senior executives for increases in Total Shareholder 
Return (‘TSR’) at rates above 7% per annum. The VCP is designed  
to support the Company’s growth strategy by providing incentives 
aligned with shareholder interests. Further details can be found  
in the Remuneration Policy part of this report. 
In the same vein, no awards were made under the shareholder 
approved Unapproved Share Option Plan (‘USOP’) out of caution 
around potential closed periods although it is likely that awards  
will be made in 2017. The USOP was approved by shareholders  
at the 2016 AGM.

Remuneration policy report
A.  Strategic overview and policy drivers
The foundations for our remuneration strategy were first 
enumerated in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts, and largely 
continue to apply today. The strategy was, historically, based on 
the following Company specific elements, which continue to form 
the backdrop to the overall remuneration strategy: 
• Long investment horizons; often there can be an interval of 
between two and 10 years before a royalty comes on stream  
and the royalty may continue to flow for 20 years or more. As 
business development is now focused on royalty acquisitions, 
incentives are heavily weighted towards longer-term 
performance.
• No comparable peer group; certainly in the UK, for the purposes 
of benchmarking Director performance. As a result, our incentive 
plans have been based on absolute performance rather than 
performance relative to other companies. A relative measure  
in relation to the VCP whereby the rewards for the holders of 
2016 awards to be granted in 2017 will only be earned should  
the Company’s share price performance match or exceed the 
performance of the FTSE 350 All Mining Index.
• A relatively high ratio between its market capitalisation (£220.1m 
at December 31, 2016) and the number of its employees (nine,  
as at December 31, 2016, of whom one is an Executive Director). 
The investment team is relatively small and much of the Company’s 
royalty know-how rests with them. The risk to the business  
of losing these and other key employees is correspondingly 
significant, and we have traditionally regarded retention as an 
important objective of our remuneration strategy.
B.  How the views of shareholders and employees have been 
taken into account
The Remuneration Committee has a policy of active engagement 
with shareholders on remuneration matters. The Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee met with a number of shareholders to 
discuss remuneration matters during 2016, most noticeably in 
relation to the amendment to the VCP which was then approved  
by shareholders at the 2016 AGM. The Remuneration Committee 
also considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the 
AGM each year. Details of votes cast for and against the resolution 
to approve last year’s remuneration report are provided in the 
Annual Remuneration Report. This feedback, plus any additional 
feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then 
considered as part of the Company’s annual review of 
remuneration policy. 
Non-Board employees are consulted individually on the executive 
remuneration policy to the extent that it impacts upon the 
structure and level of their own pay and bonuses.
Salaries
The main objectives for the Remuneration Committee in 2017  
will be to:
• Review and further tailor the senior executive bonus criteria  
for the 2017 financial year;
• Action the award of further units under the VCP and USOP; and 
• Maintain an ongoing review of and determine the most 
appropriate balance between, salary and bonus for the senior 
executive. 
More detail is provided in the body of the Remuneration Report 
and the Remuneration Committee trusts you will endorse the  
level of remuneration paid during 2016. 
Yours sincerely
D.S. Archer
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
March 29, 2017

GOVERNANCE C.  The remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
The policy approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM in respect of basic salary and annual bonus covers the three years 2016-2019 and 
was effective from May 10, 2016. The VCP, which was initially approved at the 2014 AGM and amended following shareholder approval at 
the 2016 AGM, remains in place. The Committee’s specific policy for each element of remuneration is as follows:
Element, purpose  
and link to strategy Operation Maximum
Salary
To recruit, retain and 
reward executives of a 
suitable calibre for the  
role and duties required
Salaries are set with reference to individual performance, experience 
and responsibilities to reflect the market rate for the individual and 
their role, determined with reference to remuneration levels in 
companies of similar size and complexity, taking into account pay 
levels within the Company in general.
Salaries are reviewed annually. Increases for Executive Directors will 
normally be in line with those for the general workforce except where 
there is a change of role or responsibilities or in other exceptional 
circumstances. 
There is no prescribed maximum 
annual increase.
Pension and benefits
To provide market 
competitive benefits
A Company contribution to a money purchase pension scheme, or 
a cash allowance in lieu of pension at the request of the individual. 
Other than a death in service policy which the Company subscribes 
to, no other benefits are provided.
Executive Directors are entitled to 30 days’ leave.
Pension: 10% of salary.
Death in service policy:  
five times salary.
Annual bonus
To encourage and  
reward delivery of the 
Company’s operational 
objectives
The annual bonus will be paid wholly in cash with no deferred 
component, but with a provision for clawback. 
Bonus payments are determined based on the achievement of  
a combination of corporate and personal performance targets.  
Both are expected to form a substantial part of the scorecard.
Corporate performance targets are agreed by the Board at the 
beginning of the year.
Personal performance targets are agreed with the Chairman and  
the Committee.
The Committee will use a balanced scorecard approach to assess 
performance against targets at the end of the year.
The targets are discussed more fully in section D overleaf.
The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 100% of salary.
Long-term incentives
To encourage and reward 
delivery of the Company’s 
strategic objectives and 
provide alignment with 
shareholders through  
the use of shares and 
incentivise retention of  
key personnel
The LTIP takes the form of a VCP with a performance period of 
approximately five years from the date of grant, or amendment,  
to June 16, 2021.
Awards that were granted in 2014 were amended, as outlined in 
section E overleaf.
New awards will have a performance period of five years to June 16, 
2021 and will be subject to two TSR performance conditions:
• Minimum growth in TSR of 7% per annum, with growth measured 
from a premium to the market capitalisation based on the net  
asset value per share as at December 31, 2015. 
• A relative measure of TSR which requires median performance 
compared to a comparator group
New awards to participants with an existing award will accrue at  
a lower level once the 2014 awards reach the threshold growth  
of 7% per annum.
The detailed design is discussed in section E overleaf.
The maximum number of shares  
that can be awarded under the  
option grants equates to 7.5% of the 
Company’s issued share capital as at 
the end of the measurement period.
The Committee intends to allocate 
the remaining pool as follows:
CEO 20.0%
Non-Board senior managers 4.0%
Unallocated reserve: 13.1%
In 2014, the Committee  
allocated the pool as follows:
CEO 56.0%
Non-Board senior managers  6.9%
The potential rewards achievable by Executive Directors under the remuneration policy are illustrated in section F. The policy in respect of 
any future Director appointments is discussed in section I below.

Other 
information
Strategic 
report Governance • For these awards made in June 2014, the performance period 
was extended by a further two years. No value accrues under the 
VCP to its participants unless growth in the Company’s TSR over 
a seven-year performance period is at least equal to 7% growth 
per annum (or approximately 61% total growth over the period). 
• Subject to such threshold growth, participants become entitled 
to receive nil or nominal cost options over ordinary shares in  
the capital of the Company, subject to a cap, set by reference  
to a share of a pool value equal to 10% of the growth in the 
Company’s TSR over the five-year period or, if less, 50% of the 
growth in the Company’s TSR over the five-year period in excess 
of the threshold growth, adjusted to reflect the percentage of  
the pool allocated.
• For the 2014 awards this will mean that, if the total growth in TSR 
over the extended seven-year period is:
– below approximately 61%, no value accrues;
– between approximately 61% and 76%, the value that accrues  
is equal to 50% of the growth in the Company’s TSR over the 
seven-year period in excess of the threshold growth, adjusted 
to 31.5% to reflect the percentage of the pool allocated; and
– between 76% and the 300% cap, the value that accrues is 
equal to 10% of the growth in the Company’s TSR over a 
seven-year period, adjusted to 6.29% to reflect the percentage 
of the pool allocated.
• Options to which participants become entitled at the end of  
the seven-year period (extended from five years) will become 
exercisable as follows:
– One-third immediately;
– One-third after 12 months;
– One-third after 24 months.
D.  Annual bonus – Choice of performance measures and 
approach to target setting
Annual bonuses are based on a scorecard of performance during 
the calendar year. The scorecard sets challenging targets for 
triggering bonus, and for rewarding outperformance on a sliding 
scale. The scorecard will be split between corporate objectives  
and personal objectives, both of which are expected to form a 
substantial part of the scorecard.
The corporate objectives are agreed by the Board at the beginning 
of each year, together with an assessment of the potential for 
outperformance and the risk of shortfall. This covers such areas as 
business performance, finance, relationships and reputation. This 
constitutes the criteria for triggering a bonus and for assessing the 
levels of challenge and outperformance that would warrant higher 
levels of bonus. The CEO’s personal objectives for the year are 
agreed at the beginning of the year by the Chairman of the Board 
in conjunction with the Committee. The personal objectives focus 
on the required contribution of the individual Executive Director  
to the achievement of the Company’s objectives for the year, but 
also on important but less measurable aspects such as leadership, 
building personal and team relationships, and the extent to which 
they personally have ‘gone the extra mile’.
The CEO’s performance against corporate and personal objectives 
is assessed by the Chairman and the Committee at the beginning 
of the following year, and a bonus is awarded on the basis of the 
agreed criteria.
E.  LTIP – Principal terms and conditions and reward 
scenarios
The LTIP takes the form of a VCP. The key features of the VCP are  
as follows: 
• All employees are eligible to participate in the VCP, although 
participation has been limited to the Executive Directors 
together with other non-Board members of the senior 
management team at the discretion of the Committee acting  
in consultation with the CEO.
• No value accrues under the VCP to its participants unless growth 
in the Company’s TSR over the performance period is at least 
equal to 7% growth per annum.
• The maximum number of shares to be awarded under the VCP 
option grants will not be capable of exceeding such number 
equating to 7.5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the 
end of the measurement period. This cap would apply to total 
growth in TSR above 300%.
Awards granted in 2014
• Awards were made following shareholder approval of the VCP  
at the 2014 AGM. The current allocation is as follows:
– CEO:  56.0%
– Non-Board Senior Management:  6.9%
– Total allocated:  62.9%
– Unallocated:  37.1%

– In addition, a relative measure of TSR will be introduced to 
ensure it is at least equal to the movement in the index of a 
relevant comparator group. Although there is no directly 
comparable peer group, using the FTSE 350 Mining Index 
would support the strategy of diversifying the portfolio and 
reflect other companies impacted by commodity prices. In the 
event that the increase in TSR does not equal or exceed the 
aforementioned index, no value will accrue to the new awards.
• Options to which participants become entitled at the end of the 
five-year period will become exercisable as follows:
– One-third immediately;
– One-third after 12 months;
– One-third after 24 months.
• The Committee intends to allocate the pool as follows:
– CEO:   20.0%
– Non-Board senior managers:   4.0%
– Unallocated reserve:  13.1%
The maximum value that can accrue for the full award pool (which 
includes both the 2014 and the 2017 awards) is capped at 7.5% of 
the Company’s issued share capital as at the end of the 
measurement period.
Illustrative returns
The following table illustrates the potential return for the CEO and 
other participants and shareholders for various levels of growth in 
TSR over the seven-year performance period to June 16, 2021:
New awards to be granted in 2017
• The Remuneration Committee wished to avoid rewriting the 
general principles of remuneration as adopted at the 2014 AGM 
and wished to avoid changing the key principles of the VCP 
whilst at the same time reflecting the major change in market 
conditions.
• To achieve this, further awards are to be granted over the 
unallocated pool and will be measured to the same date as the 
original awards (i.e. June 16, 2021) on a similar basis as the 
original awards except that:
– Rather than measuring growth from the market capitalisation 
in June 16, 2014, growth will be measured on the net asset 
value as at December 31, 2015 (£161.3m) which was a 
premium of approximately 61% to the market capitalisation  
on the same date.
– Subject to a threshold growth of 7% per annum over £161.3m 
net asset value, participants become entitled to receive nil  
or nominal cost options over ordinary shares in the capital of 
the Company, subject to a cap, set by reference to a share of  
a pool value equal to 10% of the growth in the Company’s  
TSR over the five-year period, adjusted to 3.71% to reflect the 
percentage of the pool allocated. There will be no ‘catch-up’ 
once the threshold growth is achieved. This means:
• below approximately 40%, no value accrues;
• above approximately 40%, the value that accrues is equal  
to 10% of the growth in the Company’s TSR over 94.9p  
per share over a five-year period, adjusted to reflect the 
percentage of the pool allocated.
– Pay-outs under the proposed additional awards to the CEO 
and other participants who already have awards will accrue at 
a lower level based on the outcome of the awards currently 
allocated. Once the share price reaches the threshold at which 
value accrues under the existing awards, value accrues on only 
Benefit assuming total growth in TSR (from an illustrative starting 
market capitalisation of £248.0m) over a seven-year period of:
Allocation  
of pool 50% 76%
**
100% 150%
CEO – original award 56% £0.0m £10.6m £13.9m £20.8m
CEO – new award 20% £2.3m £3.2m £3.8m £5.0m
Others – original awards 6.9% £0.0m £1.3m £1.7m £2.6m
Others – new awards 17.1% £2.0m £3.0m £3.9m £5.7m
Total 100% £4.27m £18.07m £23.24m £34.14m
Shareholders £119.73m £170.91m £224.76m £337.86m
* Approximately 76% growth in TSR over the seven-year period results in a total pool equal to 9.3% of growth. This reflects a pool equal to 10% for the original awards and a pool for the new   
awards which reflects the reduction in the value that accrues for participants with original awards once the threshold growth of 7% per annum is met.
**  A t the cap of total growth in TSR of 300% over the period, the benefit to shareholders would be £677.20m and total participant awards would be £66.80m, of which the CEO would receive 
£41.7m under the original award and £8.7m under the new proposed award.
 
 TSR performance must match or exceed the performance of the FTSE 350 All Mining Index for new awards to pay out. Awards in the table are calculated from the respective starting market  
 capitalisations (£248.0m for original awards and £161.3m for new awards (based on the net asset value as at December 31, 2015)).

F.  Reward scenarios
The Company’s policy results in a significant portion of remuneration received by the Executive Director being dependent on Company 
performance. The charts below illustrate how the total pay opportunity for the Executive Director varies under three different 
performance scenarios: below target (fixed pay only), on-target and maximum. These charts are indicative as share price movement  
and dividend accrual have been excluded. All assumptions made are noted below the charts. 
The chart below illustrates the total pay opportunities under three levels. Below target and on-target do not include any VCP vesting and 
simply allow for salary and pension for the below-target level with a bonus award included in the on-target level. The maximum level 
includes the current fair value of the VCP should the full 300% TSR hurdle and outperformance of the FTSE 350 Mining Index be achieved.
CEO full-time equivalent total remuneration at different levels of performance
To aid comparability with standard LTIP structures, the chart below reflects the total pay opportunity if the VCP (both the original awards 
made in 2014 and the new awards) are included on an annualised basis.
CEO full-time equivalent total remuneration at different levels of performance
Assumptions:
• Below Target = fixed pay only (salary + benefits + pension);
• On-target = fixed pay, 50% vesting of the annual bonus and 0% of the VCP awards (i.e. the value that accrues for threshold performance);
• Maximum (2016 VCP award included in full in the year of grant) = fixed pay and 100% vesting of the annual bonus and 2016 VCP award, to 
be granted in 2017;
• Maximum (2014 and 2016 VCP awards included on an annualised basis) = fixed pay and 100% vesting of the annual bonus and annualised 
2014 and 2016 VCP awards, to be granted in 2017;
• Salary levels (on which other elements of the package are calculated) are based on those which applied from January 1, 2016. Salary for 
the CEO is on a full-time equivalent basis. The Executive Director does not receive any taxable benefits; and
• The fair value of the VCP in both charts has been calculated using a stochastic model as at February 29, 2016 using assumptions that, at 
grant, the start value from which the TSR growth is calculated is £248.0m for 2014 awards (which includes the adjustment for additional 
capital raised), the start value from which the TSR growth is calculated is £161.3m for the new awards and there are 169.9m shares  
in issue.

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 58
GOVERNANCE I.  Approach to appointment of new Executive Directors
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would  
be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment. Currently, 
for an Executive Director, this would include a potential annual 
bonus of no more than 100%. There is also provision within the 
VCP arrangements for the Committee to dilute the pool by an 
additional 10% for new appointees.
The salary for a new Executive Director may be set below the 
normal market rate, with phased increases following an initial 
probationary period and over the first few years as the executive 
gains experience in their new role. The Committee may offer new 
appointees additional cash and/or share-based elements when it 
considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders, including the use of awards made under 9.4.2 of the 
Listing Rules. Such payments would take account of remuneration 
relinquished when leaving the former employer and would reflect 
(as far as practicable) the nature and time horizons attaching to 
that remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions. 
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time  
of appointment. 
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay 
element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay 
out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account 
the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided 
that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest 
opportunity. 
For external Executive Director appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as 
appropriate.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time.
J.  Service contracts and payments for loss of office
The Committee, together with the Nomination Committee, reviews 
the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure that 
these reflect best practice. 
Although the current Executive Director’s service contract is for an 
indefinite term, it is the Company’s continuing policy that service 
contracts should not have a notice period of more than one year.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination.  
A Director’s service contract may be terminated without notice  
and without any further payment or compensation, except for 
sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence  
of certain events such as gross misconduct. If the employing 
company terminates the employment of an Executive Director  
in other circumstances, compensation is limited to salary due for 
any unexpired notice period and any amount assessed by the 
Committee as representing the value of other contractual benefits 
(including pension) which would have been received during the 
period. Payments in lieu of notice are not pensionable. The service 
contract of Mr. Treger provides for a six-month notice period and 
an additional termination payment equivalent to six months’ basic 
salary. In the event of a change of control of the Company there is 
no enhancement to contractual terms. The service contract of the 
Executive Director is available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
G.  Determinations to be made by and discretions available 
to the Committee
The Committee operates the Group’s variable incentive plans 
according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC 
rules where relevant. To ensure the efficient administration of 
these plans, the Committee will be required to make determinations 
and apply certain operational discretions. These include the 
following:
• selecting the participants in the plans on an annual basis;
• determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payment;
• adjusting basic salaries for changes in time commitment  
(within the full-time equivalent levels set out in this policy);
• determining the quantum of awards and/or payments  
(within the limits set out in the policy table above);
• determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment  
of performance;
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. change of control, variation of share capital 
including rights issues and corporate restructuring events,  
and special dividends); 
• determining ‘good leaver’ status for incentive plan purposes  
and applying the appropriate treatment; and
• undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance 
measures, and setting targets for the annual bonus plan from 
year-to-year.
If an event occurs which results in the annual bonus plan or 
long-term incentive performance conditions and/or targets  
being deemed no longer appropriate (e.g. a material acquisition  
or divestment), the Committee will have the ability to adjust 
appropriately the measures and/or targets and alter weightings, 
provided that the revised conditions or targets are not materially 
less difficult to satisfy.
H.  Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
compared to other employees
The Committee aims to ensure, over time, a proper differential 
between the level of the remuneration of Executive Directors and 
other employees, but also appropriate differences in the structure 
of remuneration to reflect different levels of responsibility and 
planning horizons of employees across the Company.
The remuneration framework of non-Board employees was 
reviewed during 2015 and will continue to be reviewed going 
forward. There are currently three main differences to the 
remuneration framework: 
• the Committee will continue to reserve access to the VCP to  
the most senior executives who have the greatest potential  
to influence the Company’s long-term performance; and
• the Executive Directors will receive any annual bonus wholly  
in cash because of the large potential shareholding offered by 
the VCP; but 
• in order to encourage employees without access (or with less 
access) to the VCP to build up a shareholding in the Company, 
consideration will be given to either including a share 
component in any annual bonuses awarded to non-Board 
employees and continuing to offer them options pursuant  
to the CSOP or the USOP, or a combination of the two.

Strategic 
report Governance Directors’ remuneration report
In summary, the contractual provisions for Executive Directors are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms 
Notice period One year or less.
Termination payment Basic salary plus benefits (including pension), paid monthly and subject to mitigation.
In addition, any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection  
with the termination would be paid as necessary.
Additional termination payment to bring the total payment to the equivalent of 12 months’  
basic salary.
Remuneration entitlements A pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting  
for outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances – see below). 
In all cases performance targets would apply.
Change of control There are no enhanced terms in relation to a change of control.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the VCP will be determined based on the plan rules. The default 
treatment is that any outstanding unvested awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, 
such as death, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (taking into account the individual’s 
performance and the reasons for their departure) ‘good leaver’ status can be applied. For good leavers, the unvested awards remain 
subject to performance conditions (measured over the original time period) and are reduced pro-rata in size to reflect the proportion of 
the performance period actually served. The Committee has the discretion to disapply time pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to do 
so. In determining whether an executive should be treated as a good leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the performance 
of the individual and the reasons for their departure.
K. Non-Executive Directors
The Company aims to attract and retain a high-calibre Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors by offering a market 
competitive fee level. 
The Committee’s specific policy is as follows:
Element, purpose and link to 
strategy Operation Maximum
Board fees
Attract, retain 
and fairly reward  
high calibre 
individuals
Fees are currently paid in cash. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in  
the Company’s annual performance related incentive schemes, share option schemes or 
pension scheme.
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all his responsibilities. The Non-Executive Directors 
are paid a basic fee. Additional fees are paid to Chairmen and members of the main Board 
Committees and to the SID to reflect their extra responsibilities.
Fees are reviewed by the Board taking into account individual responsibilities, factors  
such as Committee Chairmanships, time commitment, other pay increases being made  
to employees in the Company, and fees payable for the equivalent role in comparable 
companies. 
Normally fees are reviewed bi-annually and fee increases are generally effective from 
annual re-election after the AGM.
The Board may adjust the fees for an individual Non-Executive Director during the 
intervening period if there is a significant change in their responsibilities and/or time 
commitments.
Current fee levels  
are set out in the 
Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Overall fee limit  
will be within the 
£400,000 limit  
set out in the 
Company’s Articles 
of Association, 
although the 
Company is seeking 
shareholder approval 
to increase this to 
£600,000 following 
the fee increases 
effective January 1, 
2017.
Mr. Blyth, Mr. Archer, Mr. Meier, Ms. Rhodes and Mr. Stan were appointed for an initial three-year term, renewable at the Board’s discretion 
for up to two further three-year periods thereafter and the Board intends that all future Non-Executive Directors’ appointments will be on 
similar terms. None of the letters of appointment have provisions that relate to a change of control of the Company.

Strategic 
report Governance Relationships, Reputation and Business Development: The 
implementation of a new investor relations plan was undertaken 
and a very active programme of engagement with equity providers 
was undertaken which laid a strong base for the capital raise 
associated with Denison. Continued high calibre engagement was 
both maintained and developed with royalty sourcing networks. 
Superior hurdles were met in each of the three metrics. Total 
overall score of 8.5%. 
Professionalism: Under the guidance of the CEO, the senior 
management team, whilst small, continued to develop its capability 
and maintained a high tempo of activity in 2016 in terms of 
developing the pipeline of new prospects and evaluating a number 
of significant new business opportunities. Focus was applied to the 
development of a collaborative, goal oriented, ethical company 
with harmonious working relationships. Superior hurdles were met 
in each of the two metrics. The CEO’s personal contribution was 
demonstrated as a result of the excellent outcomes around the 
increase in value of the legacy share portfolio and the realisation  
of profits and the judgement applied to defer acquisitions so as to 
limit dilution and having regard to the Company’s cost of capital. 
An overall score of 11 %. 
The overall bonus score was agreed at 46.5% under the bonus 
scoring matrix for a total award of £167,400 (46.5% x £400,000 x 
90%). The overall aggregate bonus of £167,400 bonus falls within 
the 100% bonus limit set out in the policy table of the 2015 Annual 
Report. 
The CEO’s direct senior reports, none of whom are Executive 
Directors, have individually crafted bonus objectives which were 
agreed for the 2016 financial year. The bonus award criteria relate 
to a series of agreed corporate and personal performance criteria 
which are scored out of a total of 100 points. This score is then 
applied to a maximum bonus calculated as a percentage of total 
salary. The percentages range up to 150% of salary depending on 
the executive’s position and their level of individual participation  
in the VCP. 
Bonus criteria will be further tailored for the 2017 year to ensure 
that these closely match key performance metrics and at the same 
time provide real ‘stretch-performance’ targets.
The bonus matrix for the CEO for 2016 is detailed below. Specific 
measures are excluded due to commercial sensitivity.
B. Annual bonus for the year ending December 31, 2016
A set of individually crafted corporate and personal bonus criteria 
were agreed with the CEO for the 2016 financial year. These criteria 
differed somewhat from the criteria for 2015 and took into account 
the evolving corporate and financial priorities of the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee was conscious of the need to  
‘sense check’ the bonus arrangements for the CEO both for  
major negative external influences and for truly outstanding 
performance. As a result, the bonus criteria and calculations were 
made subject to two major caveats:
• That the Company had not suffered an exceptional negative 
event in the bonus year or in the lead up to the determination  
of the quantum of the bonus; and
• The Remuneration Committee may look at overriding some or  
all of the bonus criteria should the CEO’s efforts in the 2016 
financial year result in a major transformational outcome that 
demonstrably benefits shareholders, is reflected in a material 
share price increase and would not otherwise be adequately 
captured in the bonus matrix.
In addition, many of the bonus criteria are referenced to the 
achievement of hurdle performance that is either ‘superior’ or 
‘exceptional’. No bonus is earned for ‘poor’ or merely ‘adequate’ 
performance. 
The main bonus categories which total 100% are: Growth (40%); 
Financial Performance (25%); Financial Control (10%): 
Relationships, Reputation and Business Development (10%); and 
Professionalism (15%). The largest factor in the CEO’s bonus matrix 
at 36% of the total bonus payable relates to growth and securing 
new royalty opportunities. 
Growth: The recent transaction with Denison in February was an 
out-of-period event and fell into the 2017 bonus year and hence  
no bonus was attributable to growth and securing new royalty 
opportunities for 2016. Part of the Growth bonus (4%) related to 
the performance of investments in 2015 (Narrabri) and 2016 
(none) meeting modelled returns. The returns as modelled gave  
an overall score of 4%. Total overall score of 4%.
Financial Performance: Net profit after tax of £26.4m was a multiple 
of the budgeted amount and earned the maximum bonus of 10%. 
There were no capital raisings in 2016 hence no bonus was earned 
in relation to this metric. As at year end, the share price was £1.295 
versus NAV per share of £1.225 and hence exceeded the hurdle of 
>1 and earned the full bonus allocation of 5%. Total overall score  
of 15%.
Financial Control: A new risk and currency management plan  
was successfully implemented in 2016 resulting in the Group 
effectively hedging its Q4 2016 Australian dollar denominated 
royalty income against the pound, together with the first three 
quarters of 2017 royalty income, this plan earned a bonus 
allocation of 2.5%. Budgeting and financial reporting continued  
to be very effectively carried out with timely high quality and met 
the hurdle bonus level of superior to earn a score of 2.5%. Total 
overall score of 8%.

No allocations under the VCP were made in 2016, although the Committee intends to allocate the awards outlined in the 2015 
remuneration report as soon as the Company exits the close period following the completion of the Denison financing transaction and  
the publication of the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts. Allocation of units under the VCP out of the pool to Executive Directors have 
remained unchanged with 56,000 units or 56% of the total number of units allocated to the CEO. As at the date of this report there are a 
total of 66,880 units issued out of a total pool of 100,000 units, including the awards for non-Board senior managers (2015: 66,880 units).
Long-term incentive awards made during the year
There were no awards granted to Executive Directors under the JSOP, the CSOP or USOP in 2016.
Outstanding share awards
There are currently no awards to Executive Directors outstanding under the JSOP, the CSOP or the USOP. 
D. Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The Committee encourages the Executive Directors to build up a shareholding in the Company, so as to ensure the alignment of their 
interest with those of shareholders, but there is no formal shareholding guideline. In addition, the VCP is designed to increase this 
alignment. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to hold shares in the Company although the Chairman and independent 
Non-Executive Directors are expected to ensure that the level of their individual shareholdings is not significant and thereby call into 
question their continuing independence.

None of the Directors hold their shares in hedging arrangements or as collateral for loans. Such an arrangement would require the 
express permission of the Board.
E. Total pension entitlements
The Company makes contributions to employees’ pensions and has designated the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) as its 
stakeholder pension provider. The Committee is prepared to pay additional basic salary (or fees) in lieu of part or all of a Director’s 
pension contribution.
F. Loss of office payments
There were no loss of office payments made to Directors in 2016 (2015: nil). 
G. Percentage increase in the remuneration of the CEO
CEO £’000 2016 2015 % change
– salary (full time equivalent basis) 400 380 5%
– benefits – – –
– bonus 167 – 100%
Average per employee £’000
– salary 81 85 (5%)
– benefits – – –
– bonus 49 26 88%
The table above shows the movement in the salary, benefits and annual bonus for the CEO between the current and previous financial year 
compared to that for the average UK employee. The Committee has chosen this comparator and it feels that it provides a more appropriate 
reflection of the earnings of the average worker than the movement in the Group’s total wage bill, which is distorted by movements in the 
number of employees. For the benefits and bonus per employee, this is based on those employees eligible to participate in such schemes.
H. Total shareholder return
The performance of the Company’s ordinary shares compared  
with the FTSE 350 Mining Index for the five-year period ended on 
December 31, 2016 is shown in the graph above. Both have been 
re-based at the start of the period in order to provide a graphical 
measure of comparative performance.
The Company has chosen the FTSE 350 Mining Index as a 
comparator for historical reporting purposes as it believes  
it to be the nearest relevant index appropriate to the Group.
The middle market price of an ordinary share on December 31, 
2016 was 129.50p. During the year the share price ranged from  
a low of 52.50p to a high of 132.00p.

K. External directorships
Mr. Treger holds an external non-executive directorship with Mantos Copper S.A. for which he earned fees during the year. This directorship 
does not affect Mr. Treger’s ability to perform his role as CEO of the Company, as this directorship forms part of his 10%-time commitment 
aside from Anglo Pacific (see ‘The Board’ section of the Governance Report). As a result, Mr. Treger is paid 90% of his full-time equivalent 
salary of £400,000.
L. 2017 salary review
The Executive Directors’ full-time equivalent (‘FTE’) salaries were reviewed in January 2017, and the current salaries (on a FTE basis) are  
as follows:
Current salaries for the Executive Directors
Executive
FTE Salary as at 
January 1, 2017
FTE Salary as at 
January 1, 2016 Increase
J.A. Treger 400,000 400,000 –
M. Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, the Company’s approach to setting Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is with reference to 
market levels in similar companies, levels of responsibility and time commitments. A summary of current fees is as follows:
2017 2016 % Increase
Chairman 115,000 95,000 21%
Base fee 40,000 38,000 5%
Senior Independent Director 57,000 48,000 19%
Committee Chairman 51,000 43,000 19%
Committee Member 46,000 40,000 15%
The Chairman’s fee of £95,000 was set with effect from April 1, 2014 for a two-year period, however, the Chairman elected to maintain this 
fee for the duration of 2016. On the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Chairman’s fee has been set at £115,000 per 
annum for a two-year period effective from January 1, 2017.
Members of the main Board Committees are paid an additional amount, currently £6,000 per annum, to reflect extra commitments, with a 
Committee Chair receiving a further £5,000. The SID also receives a further additional fee, currently £6,000 per annum, to reflect his extra 
duties.
N. Performance targets for the annual bonus and LTIP awards to be granted in 2016 and beyond
Annual bonuses for 2016 were made in accordance with the policy approved by shareholders in 2015. 
The CEO was awarded a bonus of £167,400 which reflects his performance against his scorecard being assessed as 46.5%. The 2016 
scorecard for the CEO is detailed on 
�
page 63. A similar scorecard approach will continue in 2017. The scorecard will set challenging 
targets for triggering bonus, and for rewarding outperformance on a sliding scale. The scorecard will be a combination of corporate 
objectives and personal objectives. Corporate objectives for 2017 will cover areas such as business performance, funding and finance, 
relationships and reputation. Due to the commercially sensitive nature of the Group’s corporate objectives, further details of the 2017 
scorecard will be provided in the 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report.

No long-term incentive awards were made during 2015 or 2016. Long-term incentive awards for 2014 were made under the VCP with  
a five-year performance period from the date of grant (i.e. to mid-2019); this was extended to seven years following approval by the 
shareholders at the 2016 AGM. No value accrues under the VCP to its participants unless growth in the Company’s TSR over the 
performance period is at least equal to 7% growth per annum (or approximately 40% total growth over the period).
Long-term incentive awards for 2017 will be made under the amended terms of the VCP, approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM,

financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Principal activities
The Group’s principal royalty activities are set out in the Strategic 
Report on 
� pages 04 and 05.
Going concern
The financial position of the Group and its cash flows are set out  
on 
� pages 77 and 80. The directors have considered the principal 
risks of the company which are set out on 
�
pages 18 to 23, and 
considered key sensitivities which could impact on the level of 
available borrowings. As at December 31, 2016, the Group had  
net debt of £1.0m as set out in 

note 22 and subject to continued 
covenant compliance, has access to a further £18.0m in undrawn 
borrowings from its secured revolving credit facility.
The Directors have considered the Group’s cash flow forecasts for 
the period to the end of March 2018. The Board is satisfied that the 
Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance and other uncertainties, 
together with the Group’s net debt position and access to the 
undrawn facilities, show that the Group will be able to operate 
within the level of its current facilities for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason the Group continues to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing its financial statements.
Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is set out on 
�
page 75 of the 
financial statements.
The Group reported a profit after tax of £26.4m (2015: loss £22.6m).
Total dividends for 2016 will amount to 6.00p per share (2015: 
7.00p per share), combining the recommended final dividend of 
3.00p per share for the year ended December 31, 2016, with the 
interim dividend of 3.00p per share paid on February 8, 2017. The 
final dividend for the year ended December 31, 2016, is subject  
to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM. The Board proposes to 
pay the final dividend on August 9, 2017 to shareholders on the 
Company’s share register at the close of business on June 30, 2017.

Directors’ report
APG13 | AR16 | 29/03/2017 | Middle – Proof 8
Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 68
GOVERNANCE The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’).  
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group and the Company for that period.  
In preparing these financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as  
a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
(United Kingdom) and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors who were in office at the date of this statement 
confirm that: 
• so far as they are each aware there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken 
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal  
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s 
website, www.anglopacificgroup.com. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2016 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements that we have audited comprise:
• the Consolidated income statement; 
• the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the Consolidated and Company balance sheets; 
• the Consolidated and Company statements of changes  
in equity;
• the Consolidated and Company cash flow statements; 
and the related

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements,  
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006.
Summary of our audit approach
Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
• Impairment assessment of the royalty intangibles portfolio
• Valuation of the Kestrel & Dugbe royalties
Within this report, any new risks are identified with 

 and any risks which are the same as the prior 
year identified with .
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £4.0 million which was determined on the basis  
of 2% of net assets.
Scoping Consistent with the how the Group is managed, we consider the Group to be one component. 
Consequently all assets, liabilities, income and expenses were subject to a full scope audit.
Significant changes  
in our approach
Last year our report included a risk on classification of the Narrabri transaction. This was not included 
in our report this year as there were no new material royalties transacted in the period.

the solvency or liquidity of the group

principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors and confirm that we are 
independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other  
ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We confirm that we are independent of the group and we have

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation  
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
As described above, the risk identified in the prior year titled 'Classification of the Narrabri transaction’ is no longer applicable to this year, 
and there were no other new material royalties transacted in the period. 
In respect of the ‘Valuation of royalty arrangements held at fair value’ risk reported in the prior year, this has been focussed on the Kestrel 
royalty asset in the current year as it is the most material royalty asset held at fair value. This risk is now described as the ‘Valuation of the 
Kestrel royalty’.
In respect of the ‘Impairment assessment of the royalty and investment portfolio’ risk reported in the prior year, this has been focussed on 
the intangible royalty assets in the current year reflecting that the remainder of the investment portfolio had a lesser effect on our audit 
strategy and allocation of resources during the current audit. This risk is now described as the ‘Impairment assessment of the royalty 
intangibles portfolio’.
Valuation of the Kestrel royalty (  notes 14)
Risk description  Royalties arrangements held at fair value, have a value of £130.4 million at 31 December 2016 (2015: 
£89.2 million). The Kestrel royalty comprises £116.9 million (2015: £82.6 million) of the total and 
management engage an independent valuation specialist to perform an independent valuation of the 
royalty asset. The valuation of the Kestrel royalty is subjective and contains significant levels of 
judgement in relation to the discount rate used, the forecast commodity prices and the expected 
production profile. In addition, the heightened coal price volatility during the year has widened the 
range of analyst forecasts and increased the subjectivity in the valuation.
The price and discount rate assumptions are set out in 

note 14 along with the related sensitivity 
analysis.
Refer to the Audit Committee report where this matter is considered by the Audit Committee as  
a significant issue, ‘Review of the carrying value of royalties held at fair value’ on 

page 50
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
We obtained the valuation model used by management’s expert to determine the fair value of the 
Kestrel royalty held at fair value. We challenged the assumptions made by management by comparison 
to recent third party forecast commodity price data, reference to third party documentation and 
review of reserves and resources reports. To challenge the discount rates we used independent 
valuation experts to create independent discount rates and compared them back to the rates used  
by management.
We evaluated the independence, objectivity and competence of management’s expert. We challenged 
the valuation assumptions consistent with the above methodology directly by reviewing their report 
and speaking directly with the specialist. In doing so we assessed the extent to which management 
may have influenced the key assumptions in the valuation model to address the risk of any possible 
management bias.
Key observations The fair value of the Kestrel royalty is in an acceptable range.

Impairment assessment of the royalty intangibles portfolio (  notes 16)
Risk description  Royalty arrangements held as intangibles have a gross carrying amount of £115.7 million at 31 
December 2016 (2015: £97.5 million) and a carrying amount of £80.0 million (2015: 71.5 million). As a 
consequence of the volatility in current commodity prices, the assessment of the recoverable amount 
of royalty arrangements accounted for as intangible assets involve key judgements. The recoverable 
amount valuations are subjective and contain significant levels of judgement in relation to the discount 
rates used, the forecast commodity prices, the expected production profiles and where relevant the 
probability of production commencing.
Impairment indicators were identified for Four Mile and Amapá with carrying amounts of £1.7 million 
and £2.1 million (pre-impairment) respectively. Indicators of impairment reversal were also identified 
for Ring of Fire which has a carrying amount of £3.8 million.
In the year an impairment of £2.1 million has been recognised at Amapá (  see note 16)
Refer to the Audit Committee report where this matter is considered by the Audit Committee as part  
of the significant issue, ‘Review of carrying values of royalties held at amortised cost along with the 
investment portfolio and resulting impairment charges ’ on 

page 50.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
We challenged management’s assessment as to whether indicators of impairment exist for specific 
royalty arrangements through discussions with management, evaluation of changes in production  
and pricing forecasts and review of publically available information. Where such indicators were 
identified, we obtained copies of the valuation models and challenged the assumptions made by 
management in relation to these models by comparison to third party forecast commodity price  
data, reference to third party documentation and review of reserves and resources reports. 
To challenge the discount rates we used independent valuation experts to create independent 
discount rates and compared them back to the rates used by management
We also reviewed and challenged management’s assessment of whether projects still in the 
development phase would reach production and performed an independent assessment based  
on third party data available from asset operators.
Where there were indicators of impairment reversal for royalty assets we evaluated whether it was 
appropriate to reverse previous impairments.
Key observations We concur with management’s full impairment of the Amapá royalty. In respect of the other intangible 
assets where indicators were identified, we found that the assumptions used were reasonable and had 
been determined and applied on a consistent basis across the Group. No additional impairments or 
impairment reversals were identified from the work performed.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,  
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions  
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £4.0 million (2015: £3.2 million)
Basis for determining 
materiality
2% (2015: 2%) of net assets
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Net assets was considered a more stable base than profits due to the effect of unrealised  
fair value gains/losses in each financial year.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to  
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.08 million 
(2015: £0.06 million), as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters  
that we identified when assessing the overall presentation  
of the financial statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS An overview of the scope of our audit
Consistent with the how the Group is managed, we consider the Group to be one component. Consequently all assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses were subject to a full scope audit.
There were no changes to the overall scope of the audit compared the prior year.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate  
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records  
and returns.
We have nothing to report  
in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report 
arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report 
arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge  
of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report 
is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed.
We confirm that we have  
not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading 
statements.

report Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK  
and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that 
our quality control procedures are effective, understood and 
applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team and independent partner 
reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we

Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate  
to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APG13 | AR16 | 29/03/2017 | Back – Proof 4
Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 80 1 General information
Anglo Pacific Group PLC (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together, the ‘Group’) secure natural resources royalties and streams by 
creating new royalties directly with operators or by acquiring existing royalties. The Group has royalties and investments in mining and 
exploration interests primarily in Australia, North and South America and Europe, with a diversified exposure to commodities represented 
by coal, uranium, gold and iron ore.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange and incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is 1 Savile Row, London, W1S 3JR, United Kingdom (registered 
number: 897608).
2  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and estimates that can have a 
significant impact on the financial statements. Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience 
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most critical 
accounting judgement relates to the classification of royalty arrangements and the key sources of estimation uncertainty relate to the 
calculation of certain royalty arrangement’s fair value and the key assumption used when assessing impairment of property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets. The use of inaccurate or unreasonable assumptions in assessments made for any of these estimates 
could result in a significant impact on the financial results. 
Critical accounting judgements
Classification of royalty arrangements: initial recognition and subsequent measurement
The Directors must decide whether the Group’s royalty arrangements should be classified as:
• Intangible Assets in accordance with IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’;
• Financial Assets in accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’; or
• Investment properties in accordance with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’.
The Directors use the following selection criteria to identify the characteristics which determine which accounting standard to apply  
to each royalty arrangement:
Type 1 – Intangible assets (‘vanilla’ royalties): Royalties, in their simplest form, are classified as intangible assets by the Group. The Group 
considers the substance of a simple vanilla royalty to be economically similar to holding a direct interest in the underlying mineral asset. 
Existence risk (the commodity physically existing in the quantity demonstrated), production risk (that the operator can achieve production 
and operate a commercially viable project), timing risk (commencement and quantity produced, determined by the operator) and price 
risk (returns vary depending on the future commodity price, driven by future supply and demand) are all risks which the Group participates 
in on a similar basis to an owner of the underlying mineral licence. Furthermore, in a vanilla royalty, there is only a right to receive cash to 
the extent there is production and there are no interest payments, minimum payment obligations or means to enforce production or 
guarantee repayment. These are accounted for as intangible assets under IAS 38.
Type 2 – Financial assets (royalties with additional financial protection): In certain circumstances where the ‘vanilla’ risk is considered too 
high, but the Group still fundamentally believes in the quality or potential of the underlying resource, the Group will look to introduce 
additional protective measures. This has typically taken the form of performance milestone penalties (usually resulting in the receipt of 
cash or cash equivalent), minimum payment terms and interest provisions or mechanisms to convert the initial outlay into the equity 
instruments of the operator in the event of project deferral. Once an operation is in production, these mechanisms generally fall away such 
that the royalty will display identical characteristics and risk profile to the vanilla royalties; however, it is the contractual right to enforce  
the receipt of cash through to production which results in these royalties being treated as financial assets in accordance with IAS 32 and 
IAS 39. 
Type 3 – Investment property: Royalties which are derived from the ownership of sub-stratum land are accounted for as investment 
properties under IAS 40, even though the substance of their commercial terms is identical to vanilla royalties. The Group does not expect 
to obtain royalties in this manner going forward, as it is unusual for sub-stratum minerals not to be the property of the state.

The Group considers that the application of the above accounting standards, and the resulting accounting classification and financial 
impact of each in the financial statements, most appropriately reflects the substance of the underlying commercial terms of each royalty 
arrangement. The application of each standard to the underlying royalty arrangement, rather than electing to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39  
to all royalties is consistent currently with the Group’s international peer group and as such enables its stakeholders to make informed 
investment decisions.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Assessment of fair value of royalty arrangements held at fair value
A number of the Groups’ royalty arrangements are held at fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow models (and 
other valuation techniques) using assumptions considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that would be applied by a market 
participant. The determination of assumptions used in assessing fair values is subjective and the use of different valuation assumptions 
could have a significant impact on financial results.
In particular, expected future cash flows, which are used in discounted cash flows models are inherently uncertain and could materially 
change over time. They are significantly affected by a number of factors including reserves and resources and timing/likelihood of mines 
entering production together with economic factors such as commodity prices, discount rates and exchange rates. 
The Group’s most significant royalty arrangement held at fair value is Kestrel, for which the key assumptions and sensitivity analysis is set 
out in

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APG13 | AR16 | 29/03/2017 | Back – Proof 4
Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 82 Impairment review of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date with the assessment 
considering variables such as the production profiles, production commissioning dates where applicable, forecast commodity prices and 
guidance from the mine operators.
Where indicators are identified, the starting point for the impairment review will be to measure the expected future cash flows expected 
from the royalty arrangement should the project continue/come into production. A pre-tax nominal discount rate of between 7% and  
13% is applied to the future cash flows. The discount rate of each royalty arrangement is derived using a capital asset pricing model 
specific to the underlying project, making reference to the risk free rate of return expected on an investment with the same time horizon 
as the expected mine life, together with the country risk associated with the location of the operation. Changes in discount rate are most 
sensitive to changes in the risk free rate and the expected mine life.
The outcome of this net present value calculation is then risk weighted to reflect management’s current assessment of the overall likelihood and 
timing of each project coming into production and royalty income arising. This assessment is impacted by news flow relating to the underlying 
operation in the period, in conjunction with management’s assessment of the economic viability of the project based on commodity price projections. 
3 Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
3.1 Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical costs basis, as modified by the revaluation of coal royalties (investment 
property) and certain financial instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in 
�
note 2.
We highlight on the face of the income statement the following material balances which have been separated to assist users understand 
the performance of the Group:
• Gain/(Loss) on sale of mining and exploration interests ( � refer to note 17)
• Impairment of mining and exploration interests ( � refer to note 17)
• Impairment of royalty and exploration intangible assets ( � refer to � note 16)
• Revaluation of royalty financial instruments ( � refer to � note 15)
• Revaluation of coal royalties – Kestrel ( � refer to � note 14)
Net foreign exchange gains in the year of £2,265,000 have been included in ‘Finance income’. The comparative presentation has been 
restated to be on a consistent basis with gains of £411,000 being reclassified from ‘Finance costs’ to ‘Finance income’ ( � refer to � notes 7 and 8).
3.1.1 Going concern
The financial position of the Group and its cash flows are set out on 
�
pages 77 and 80. The directors have considered the principal risks of the 
company which are set out on 
�
pages 18 to 23 as well as access to funding as set out in in our borrowings 
�
note 24 and considered key 
sensitivities which could impact on the level of available borrowings. As at December 31, 2016, the Group had net debt of £1.0m and subject to 
continued covenant compliance, has access to a further £18.0m in undrawn borrowings from its secured revolving credit facility.
The Directors have considered the Group’s cash flow forecasts for the period to the end of March 2018. The Board is satisfied that the Group’s 
forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading performance and other uncertainties, together with the 
Group’s net debt position and access to the undrawn facilities, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current facilities 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason the Group continues to adopt the going basis in preparing its financial statements.
3.1.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
(a) Amendments to IFRSs that are mandatorily effective for the current year
In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after January 1 2016. Their adoption has not had any 
material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
• Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements – Disclosure Initiative’
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative for the first time in the current year. The amendments clarify that an 
entity need not provide a specific disclosure required by an IFRS if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material, and give 
guidance on the bases of aggregating and disaggregating information for disclosure purposes. However, the amendments reiterate that 
an entity should consider providing additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable 
users of financial statements to understand the impact of particular transactions, events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance.
In addition, the amendments clarify that an entity’s share of the other comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures accounted 
for using the equity method should be presented separately from those arising from the Group, and should be separated into the share of 
items that, in accordance with other IFRSs: (i) will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss; and (ii) will be reclassified subsequently 
to profit or loss when specific conditions are met.

Strategic 
report Governance
Financial 
statements
Other 
information The amendments also address the structure of the financial statements by providing examples of systematic ordering or grouping  
of the notes. 
The adoption of these amendments has not resulted in any impact on the financial performance or financial position of the Group.
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation for 
the first time in the current year. The amendments to IAS 16 prohibit entities from using a revenue-based depreciation method for items  
of property, plant and equipment. The amendments to IAS 38 introduce a rebuttable presumption that revenue is not an appropriate basis 
for amortisation of an intangible asset. This presumption can only be rebutted in the following two limited circumstances: 
(i) when the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue; or
(ii) when it can be demonstrated that revenue and consumption of the economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated.
As the Group already uses the straight-line method for depreciation and amortisation for its property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets, respectively, the adoption of these amendments has had no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle
The Group has adopted the amendments to IFRSs included in the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle for the first time in the 
current year. 
The amendments to IFRS 5 introduce specific guidance in IFRS 5 for when an entity reclassifies an asset (or disposal group) from held for 
sale to held for distribution to owners (or vice versa). The amendments clarify that such a change should be considered as a continuation 
of the original plan of disposal and hence requirements set out in IFRS 5 regarding the change of sale plan do not apply. The amendments 
also clarifies the guidance for when held-for-distribution accounting is discontinued. 
The amendments to IFRS 7 provide additional guidance to clarify whether a servicing contract is continuing involvement in a transferred 
asset for the purpose of the disclosures required in relation to transferred assets.
The amendments to IAS 19 clarify that the rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations should be determined by reference 
to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. The assessment of the depth of a market for high 
qualify corporate bonds should be at the currency level (i.e. the same currency as the benefits are to be paid). For currencies for which 
there is no deep market in such high quality corporate bonds, the market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds 
denominated in that currency should be used instead. 
The adoption of these amendments has had no effect on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
(b) New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been 
issued but are not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU:
• IFRS 2 ‘Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions – amendments’
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
• IAS 7 ‘Disclosure Initiative – amendments’
• IAS 12 ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses – amendments’
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods, except as noted below:
• IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments
The Directors have considered the impact of IFRS 9 on the Group’s royalty interests and have concluded that the application of this 
standard will not have any impact on those royalty interest classified as Investment Property ( � refer to � note 3.5) or Intangibles ( � refer to 
� note 3.6), as both are considered to be outside the scope of IFRS 9.
The Group’s royalty financial instruments, which are either classified as available-for-sale debt or available-for-sale equity financial 
instruments will however, be impacted by the requirement to either account for such interests at amortised cost or fair value through 
profit or loss. The Directors do not consider this change will have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements, as fair value 
movements relating to the Group’s available-for-sale debt financial instruments are largely recognised in the income statement and  
the Group’s only available-for-sale equity financial instrument is approaching the end of the life of mine.
• IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures
The Group’s royalty income are derived from three sources; assets accounted for as investment property (Kestrel) under IAS 40, assets at 
fair value (EVBC) accounted for under IAS 39 and assets account for as intangibles (Narrabri, Maracás Menchen and Four Mile) under IAS 38.
The royalty income derived from these sources will continue to be accounted for in accordance with the assets overriding standards, 
with exception of assets at fair value, which will be accounted for under IFRS 9 following its adoption. As a result the Directors do not 
believe that IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the recognition and disclosure of revenue. 
• IFRS 16 may have an impact on the presentation, recognition and disclosure of the operating leases disclosed in 
�
note 30. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review 
has been completed.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APG13 | AR16 | 29/03/2017 | Back – Proof 4
Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 84 3.2 Consolidation
Subsidiaries
The financial statements incorporate a consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries). Control is achieved when the Company has the power over the investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether  
the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for in the parent company at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in 
consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with 
the policies adopted by the Group.
3.3 Foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the respective Group entity, using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from  
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated 
using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction (and not retranslated). Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
are translated using the exchange rates at the date when fair value was determined.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are charged/credited to other comprehensive income and recognised in the currency translation 
reserve in equity.
Exchange differences on foreign currency balances with foreign operations for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur  
in the foreseeable future, and therefore form part of the Group’s net investment in these foreign operations are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. When a foreign operation is partially 
disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are reclassified in the income statement as part of the gain or  
loss on sale.
3.4 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, 
plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Once a mining project has been established as 
commercially viable, expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant and equipment is capitalised as a producing asset within ‘Other 
Assets’ together with any amount transferred from ‘Exploration and Evaluation Costs’ ( � note 3.6(b)).
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or where applicable over the remaining life of the mine if shorter once it  
is operating in the manner intended by management. The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a units  
of production and/or straight-line basis as follows:
Equipment and Fixtures  4 to 10 years
Other Assets:
Producing assets  Units of production (over reserves)
Coal tenures  Units of production (over reserves) 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
3.5 Coal royalties (investment property)
Royalty arrangements which are derived from the ownership of sub-stratum lands are accounted for as investment properties in 
accordance with IAS 40. Investment property is held to earn a return in the form of royalty entitlements arising from mining activity and  
is initially measured at cost including any transaction costs. Investment property is subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting 
date with any valuation movements recognised in the income statement. Fair value is determined by a suitably qualified independent 
external consultant based on the discounted future royalty income expected to accrue to the Group.

(a) Royalty arrangements
Royalty arrangements which are identified and classified as intangible assets are initially measured at cost, including any transaction costs. 
Upon commencement of production at the underlying mining operation intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
life of the mine. Amortisation rates are adjusted on a prospective basis for all changes to estimates of the life of mine.
(b) Exploration and evaluation costs 
Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Evaluation expenditure arises from a detailed 
assessment of deposits or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential.
Expenditure on exploration and evaluation activities is capitalised when there is a high degree of confidence in the project’s viability and 
hence it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. If this is no longer the case, an impairment loss is recognised in 
the income statement. Amortisation of capitalised exploration and evaluation costs does not commence until the underlying project 
commences commercial production.
3.7 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If such an indication is identified, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value (less costs of disposal) and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that has been adjusted to reflect the risks specific to that asset.  
If the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to be less than its carrying value, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is also recognised in the income statement. 
Should an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment been recognised. A reversal of an impairment loss is also recognised in the income statement. 
3.8 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
(a) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.  
On initial recognition loans and receivables are stated at their fair value. After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. 
The Group’s trade and other receivables fall into this category of financial instruments.
(c) Derivative financial instruments
The Group will selectively enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with 
its Australian dollar denominated royalty income, when considered necessary. Further details of derivative financial instruments are 
disclosed in 
�
note 21.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a 
financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets  
or current liabilities.
(d) Mining and exploration interests
Mining and exploration interests are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under  
a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially 
measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
Mining and exploration interests are classified upon initial recognition as available-for-sale financial assets. 
Interests classified as available-for-sale are measured at subsequent reporting dates at their fair value. For available-for-sale investments, 
unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the investment revaluation reserve, until the security is either disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in profit or loss for the period. Unquoted investments are 
measured at cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined. When a market price can be established these investments are revalued 
to fair value accordingly.

APG13 | AR16 | 29/03/2017 | Back – Proof 4
Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 86 (e) Royalty instruments
Royalty instruments are recognised or derecognised on completion date where a purchase or sale of the royalty is under a contract,  
and are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
Royalty instruments are classified as either debt or equity instruments depending on the nature of the individual agreement.
Debt
Assets classified as debt instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Upon initial recognition an effective interest rate is 
computed based on the estimated future cash flows. Expected future cash flows are determined based on non-observable market data 
such as commodity price forecasts and estimated production schedules. Valuation movements caused by changes in expected future 
cash flows, which could be caused by changes in resource estimates or commodity price assumptions, are recognised in the income 
statement along with the effective interest, if material, with other valuation changes taken to other comprehensive income. Amounts  
are required to be recognised whether received in cash or not.
Equity
Similar to debt instruments, equity instruments are carried at fair value at each reporting date, based on the estimated future cash flows 
from the underlying operation. All valuation movements are recognised in other comprehensive income, except to the extent where 
valuation is below cost and is considered ‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’ in accordance with IAS 39 and the policy outlined in 
�
note 3.9. In this 
case, the valuation difference is recycled through the Income Statement.
(f) Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
(g) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition. After initial recognition these are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(h) Borrowings
Interest bearing bank facilities are initially recognised at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Transaction costs are 
recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the facility.
(i) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
3.9 Impairment of financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not measured at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the 
initial recognition of the asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount 
and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in the 
income statement. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is 
reversed through the income statement.
Impairment losses relating to available for sale equity investments are recognised when the decline in fair value is considered significant  
or prolonged which are defined as follows:
• Prolonged: a period of greater than 18 months that the interest’s fair value is below cost; or
• Significant: a decline in fair value of greater than 25% relative to an individual asset’s original acquisition cost, or its rebased cost post 
impairment.
These impairment losses are recognised by transferring the cumulative loss that has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income to the income statement. The loss recognised in the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost or rebased 
cost and the current fair value. Once the Group has recognised an impairment loss on an available-for-sale equity investment, it cannot 
recognise a reversal through the income statement. 
Impairment losses on debt instruments classified as available-for-sale are reversed only if in a subsequent period, the fair value of that debt 
instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. The 
amount of such reversal is recognised through the income statement.
3.10 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.

Other 
information Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit 
nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with 
such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against 
which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they related to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  
in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is 
included in the accounting for the business combination.
3.11 Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options and jointly-owned shares) of the Company. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined  
by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
• including any market performance conditions;
• excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions; and
• including the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options and jointly-owned shares that are expected to 
vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to  
be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options and jointly-owned shares that  
are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in 
the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs  
are credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
3.12 Reserves
Equity comprises the following:
• ‘Share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares in issue.
• ‘Share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of issuance 
costs.
Other reserves
• ‘merger reserve’ is created when more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue  
of new shares by the Company. 
• ‘warrant reserve’ The warrant reserve was created in June 2014 in connection with the issue of share warrants as part consideration  
of the Maracas royalty.
• ‘Investment revaluation reserve’ represents gains and losses due to the revaluation of the investments in mining and exploration 
interests and royalty instruments from the opening carrying values, including the effects of deferred tax and foreign currency changes.
• ‘Share-based payment reserve’ represents equity-settled share-based employee remuneration until such share options are exercised.
• ‘Foreign currency reserve’ represents the differences arising from translation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.

3.13 Revenue recognition
The revenue of the Group comprises mainly royalty income. It is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable 
after deducting discounts, value added tax and other sales tax. The royalty income becomes receivable on extraction and sale of the 
relevant minerals, and once able to be reliably measured, the revenue is recognised.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the carrying value and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
3.14 Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease except where another 
more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. 
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate 
benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease, except where another systematic 
basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
3.15 Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or, in the case of the interim dividend, when it is paid to the shareholders.
3.16 Alternative Performance Measures
The financial statements include certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) which include adjusted earnings per share, dividend 
cover and free cash flow per share. These APMs are defined in the table of contents and explained in the Strategic Report on

4 Segment information
The Group’s chief operating decision maker is considered to be the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee evaluates the 
financial performance of the Group based on a portfolio view of its individual royalty arrangements. Royalty income and its associated 
impact on operating profit is the key focus of the Executive Committee. The income from royalties is presented based on the jurisdiction  
in which the income is deemed to be sourced as follows: 
Australia: Kestrel, Narrabri, Four Mile, Pilbara, Mount Ida
Americas: Amapá and Tucano, Maracás Menchen, Ring of Fire
Europe: EVBC, Salamanca, Bulqiza
Other: Jogjakarta, Dugbe I, and includes the Group’s mining and exploration interests.
The following is an analysis of the Group’s results by reportable segment. The key segment result presented to the Executive Committee 
for making strategic decisions and allocation of resources is operating profit as analysed below.

The Group’s effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 6.9% (2015: 25.9%). The lower rate in 2016 is mainly due to the 
recognition of a deferred tax asset of £4.8m in relation to Australian tax losses arising on the disposal of the Group’s fully-impaired Isua 
royalty interest. Refer to 
�
note 15 for further detail regarding the disposal of the Isua royalty interest.
In future periods, it is expected that the Group’s effective tax rate will mainly be driven by withholding taxes suffered in overseas 
jurisdictions.

In 2015 the Group was loss making, therefore the Employee Share Option Scheme is considered anti-dilutive as including them in the 
diluted number of shares outstanding would decrease the loss per share.
Adjusted earnings per share
Due to the growing number of valuation and other non-cash movements being recognised in the income statement, the Group presents 
an adjusted earnings per share metric to better reflect the underlying performance of the Group during the year.
Adjusted earnings represents the Group’s underlying operating performance from core activities. Adjusted earnings is the profit 
attributable to equity holders less all valuation movements, non-cash impairments and amortisation charges (which are non-cash 
adjustments that arise primarily due to changes in commodity prices), finance costs, any associated deferred tax and any profit or loss  
on non-core asset disposals as these are not expected to be ongoing.

In calculating the adjusted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue takes into account the dilutive effect of the 
Employee Share Option Scheme in those years where the Group has adjusted earnings. In years where the Group has an adjusted loss, the 
Employee Share Option Scheme is considered anti-dilutive as including them in the diluted number of shares outstanding would decrease 
the loss per share, as such they are excluded.
The weighted average number of shares in issue for the purpose of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share and basic and diluted 
adjusted earnings per share are as follows:

As the Group was loss making in 2015 the Employee Share Option Scheme was considered anti-dilutive as including them in the diluted 
number of shares outstanding would decrease the loss per share.
12 Dividends and dividend cover
On February 4, 2016 an interim dividend of 4.00p per share was paid to shareholders in respect of the year ended December 31, 2015. On 
August 5, 2016 a final dividend of 3.00p per share was paid to shareholders to make a total dividend for the year of 7.00p per share. Total 
dividends, paid during the year were £11.8m (2015: £11.9m).
On February 8, 2017 an interim dividend of 3.00p per share was paid to shareholders in respect of the year ended December 31, 2016. This 
dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. The Directors propose that a final dividend of 3.00p per share  
be paid to shareholders on August 9, 2017, to make a total dividend for the year of 6.00p per share. This dividend is subject to approval by 
shareholders at the AGM and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The proposed final dividend for 2016 will be payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on June 30, 2017. The total estimated 
dividend to be paid is £5.4m. At the present time the Board has resolved not to offer a scrip dividend alternative.
Dividend cover
Dividend cover is calculated as the number of times adjusted earnings per share exceeds the dividend per share. The Group’s adjusted 
earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016, is 9.76p per share ( � note 11) with dividends for the year totalling 6.00p, resulting 
in dividend cover of 1.6x (2015: adjusted earnings per share 2.47p, dividend cover 0.4x).

The Group’s coal royalty entitlements comprise the Kestrel and Crinum coal royalties, and derive from mining activity carried out within the 
Group’s private land area in Queensland, Australia. Rather uniquely to this royalty, the sub-stratum land is the property of the freeholder, 
including the minerals contained within. The ownership of the land therefore entitles the Group to a royalty, equivalent to what the State 
receives on areas outside the Group’s private land. This royalty is accounted for as Investment Property in accordance with IAS 40.
The coal royalty was valued during December 2016 at £116.9m (A$200.3m) (2015: £82.6m and A$167.6m) by an independent coal industry 
advisor, on a net present value of the pre-tax cash flow discounted at a nominal rate of 7.5% (2015: 7%). The key assumptions in the 
independent valuation relate to price and discount rate.
The price assumptions used in the 2016 valuation decrease from US$154/t in the short term to a long term flat nominal price of US$142/t. 
If the price were to increase or decrease 10 per cent over the life of the mine the valuation effect would be:
• a 10% reduction in the coal price would have resulted in the coal royalties being valued at A$170.7m (£99.6m) and a reduction in the 
revaluation uplift in the income statement of £16.2m; and
• a 10% increase in the coal price would have resulted in the coal royalties being valued at A$233.7m (£136.4m) and an increase in the 
revaluation uplift in the income statement of £18.3m.
The pre-tax nominal discount rate used for the asset is 7.50%, if the discount rate used were to increase or decrease by 1% the valuation 
effect would be:
• a 1% reduction in the nominal discount rate would have resulted in the coal royalties being valued at A$208.6m (£121.7m) and  
a reduction in the revaluation uplift in the income statement of £4.2m; and
• a 1% increase in the nominal discount rate would have resulted in the coal royalties being valued at A$192.6m (£112.4m) and an increase 
in the revaluation uplift in the income statement of £4.5m.
The net royalty income from this investment is currently taxed in Australia at a rate of 30%. The revaluation of the underlying Australian 
dollar asset is recognised in the Income Statement with the retranslation of the Group’s sterling presentation currency recognised in the 
foreign currency translation reserve.
Were the coal royalty to be realised at the revalued amount there are £5.3m (A$9.2m) of capital losses potentially available to offset against 
taxable gains. These losses have been included in the deferred tax calculation ( � note 24). Were the coal royalty to be carried at cost the 
carrying value would be £0.2m (2015: £0.2m). The Directors do not presently have any intention to dispose of the coal royalty.
Refer to 
�
note 32 for additional fair value disclosures relating to Kestrel.
The shares over the entity which is the beneficial owner of the Kestrel royalty have been guaranteed as security in connection with the 
Group’s borrowing facility ( � note 24).

Effective interest of £0.2m was recognised in other income ( � note 9) for the year ended December 31, 2016 (2015: £0.2m). This was 
directly offset by cash received in the period of the same amount.
On February 23, 2016, Hummingbird Resources PLC (‘Hummingbird’), the operator of the Dugbe 1 project, gave notice under the U$15.0m 
royalty financing arrangement with Group that a Mineral Development Agreement (‘MDA’) had been signed with the Liberian government. 
The signing of the MDA satisfied Hummingbird’s obligations to repay the US$15.0m advanced by the Group, previously accounted for as  
a non-current receivable and imposed a 2.00% net smelter return royalty, increasing to 2.50% where the gold price is >US$1,800/oz and 
quarterly production is <50,000oz, over the life of the mine.
The net smelter return royalty over the Dugbe 1 project is accounted for as an available-for-sale debt financial asset as outlined in 
�
note 2. 
As at December 31, 2016, the Group’s assessed the likely start date of commercial production at Dugbe 1 to be 2020, this change resulted 
in the royalty being valued at £6.8m and a £4.9m revaluation charge to the income statement.
On December 7, 2016, the Group sold its royalty over the Isua project for £16,000 to General Nice Limited. The Group had assessed the fair 
value of Isua royalty to be nil in 2014, following the appointment of administrators to the project’s previous operator London Mining PLC.  
At the time of the sale, the Group continued to consider the likelihood of this project entering commercial production as remote.

Exploration and evaluation costs
The exploration and evaluation costs comprise expenditure that was directly attributable to the Trefi coal project in British Columbia, 
Canada. Due to the inherent uncertainty that the Trefi coal project will be developed, the Group fully impaired it in 2014.
Acquisition of royalty interests
On March 31, 2016, in satisfaction of the outstanding principal of £0.7m, owed by Atrum Coal NL, the Group accepted a 0.10% gross 
revenue royalty over the Groundhog project in British Columbia. The promissory note arose from the 2014 sale of the Group’s Panorama 
Coal tenements, which included the Groundhog project. 
On March 11, 2015, the Group completed its acquisition of the Narrabri royalty for £45.0m. The Narrabri royalty is a 1% gross revenue royalty 
over all coal produced from the Narrabri mine located in New South Wales, Australia, owned and operated by Whitehaven Coal Limited. 
Under the terms of the Maracás Menchen royalty sale agreement, a further US$3.0m (£2.4m) of cash is payable when the project reaches 
certain annualised production milestones. As set out in 
�
notes 18 and 26, the Directors consider it highly probable that the first of these 
milestones will be achieved in the next eighteen months which would require the Group to pay US$1.5m. As a result the Directors have 
recognised a non-current liability for the deferred consideration, together with an asset under deferred acquisition costs.

The Group’s royalty intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis, upon the commencement of production at the underlying

Amortisation of the Group’s remaining royalty interests will commence once they begin commercial production. As at December 31, 2016, 
the shares over the entity which is the beneficial owner of the Narrabri royalty have been guaranteed as security in connection with the 
Group’s borrowing facility ( � note 24).
Impairments of royalty intangible assets
As described in 
�
note 3.6 and 3.7, at each reporting date the Group’s royalty intangible assets are reviewed for any impairment indicators. 
Consideration is given to the presence or occurrence of adverse operational developments at the underlying mines, together with any 
significant declines in commodity prices. Where impairment indicators exist, a full impairment review is carried out to determine whether 
the discounted future expected cash flows (calculated on a value-in use basis) exceed cost. 
�
note 2 outlines the impairment methodology 
applied.
Amapá
Production at Amapá has been suspended since 2013 following a major port incident. The mine’s operator, Zamin Ferrous Limited,  
had previously indicated that attempts were being made to restructure its finances in order to fund the rebuilding of the port facilities, 
however, in 2016 the Directors understand that Zamin has filed for bankruptcy protection in Brazil. As a result the Directors have the 
assessed the timing of Amapá returning to commercial production as being indeterminable and have recognised an impairment charge  
of £2.0m at the year end (2015: £2.8m). Following the impairment charges recognised during the year and taking into account movements 
in foreign exchange, the residual carrying value of the Amapá royalty was £nil as at December 31, 2016 (2015: £1.8m).
Ring of Fire
Following the sale of the Ring of Fire chromite assets by Cliffs Natural Resources Inc to Noront Resources Ltd in April 2015, the Directors 
reassessed the timeline to production in light of the new operator needing to complete a comprehensive preliminary economic analysis 
for development options for the project. The revision to the anticipated date of the mine entering commercial production resulted in  
the Group recognising an impairment charge of £1.6m during the year ended December 31, 2015. No additional impairment has been 
recognised during the current year, as such the residual carrying value of the Ring of Fire royalty, after movement in foreign exchange,  
was £3.7m as at December 31, 2016 (2015: £3.1m).

The current strategy of the Group is to obtain royalties by other means, and as such, these assets, which have historically been acquired 
with a view to negotiating royalty acquisitions, have been gradually disposed of as they are now non-core to the Group’s primary business. 
The fair values of listed securities are based on quoted market prices. Unquoted investments are initially recognised using cost where fair 
value cannot be reliably determined. In the absence of an active market for these securities, the Group considers each unquoted security 
to ensure there has been no material change in the fair value since initial recognition. Further guidance on fair value measurement is

the absolute decline in value below cost of any individual investment is considered ‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’ in accordance with the 
Group’s impairment policy. Following continued declines in mining equity markets, the Group recognised an impairment charge of 
£29,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015: £0.9m).
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Group realised £3.4m in cash (December 31, 2015: £1.7m) through its disposal of a number of 
its mining and exploration interests from which management no longer considered royalty opportunities to exist. These disposals resulted

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 100 Deferred acquisition costs
As at December 31, 2016, deferred acquisition costs represent the deferred consideration payable by the Group in relation to its acquisition 
of the Maracás Menchen vanadium royalty in 2014. Under the terms of the royalty sale agreement, the Group is required to pay an additional 
US$1.5m (£1.2m) once production reaches an annualised rate over a quarter of 9,500t. Following the latest production guidance issued by 
the operator of the Maracás Menchen mine, Largo Resources Ltd, the Directors consider it probable that this production milestone will be 
achieved within the next eighteen months and as such have recognised both an asset and a corresponding liability ( � refer to � note 26).
In addition to the deferred acquisition costs relating to the Group’s acquisition of the Maracás Menchen vanadium royalty, the Group had 
incurred £0.2m in costs associated with the acquisition of the C$43.5m Denison Mines Inc financing agreement and associated streaming 
agreement completed on February 13, 2017 ( � refer to � note 34).
Deferred financing costs
Deferred financing costs represent the costs associated with entering into the US$30.0m, three year secured revolving credit facility that 
have been deferred and will be amortised over the term of the facility. Upon drawing on the facility in 2015, these costs have been offset 
against borrowings ( � refer to � note 23).

Current trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables principally comprise amounts relating to royalties receivable for the final quarter in each year. The significant 
increase in royalty receivables as at December 31, 2016 is the result of the Kestrel royalty for Q4 2016 totalling A$15.2m (£8.9m) in 
comparison to the Q4 2015 royalty of A$3.8m (£1.9m). 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately their fair value.
Non-current other receivables
The non-current other receivables of £10.1m as at December 31, 2015 represented the US$15.0m in advances made to Hummingbird 
Resources PLC under a royalty financing agreement entered into in 2012. Under the agreement the advances remained repayable until 
Hummingbird entered into a Mineral Development Agreement with the Liberian Government. As described in 
�
note 15, the Mineral 
Development Agreement was signed in February 2016 satisfying Hummingbird’s obligations to repay the US$15.0m advanced by the 
Group, in exchange or a 2.00% net smelter return royalty, increasing to 2.50% where the gold price is greater than US$1,800/oz and 
quarterly production is less than 50,000oz, over the life of the mine. This royalty is accounted for as an available-for-sale debt financial 
asset and classified as a royalty financial instruments.
Amounts due from subsidiaries, are considered long-term loans. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of amounts due from 
subsidiaries is approximately their fair value.
21 Derivative financial instruments
In 2016, the Group entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with its 
Australian dollar denominated royalty income. These foreign exchange forward contracts are accounted for as financial assets or liabilities 
carried at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with

The Group’s borrowings relate to the partial draw-down of the three-year revolving credit facility maturing in February 2018, which is 
available at LIBOR plus 250bps. Deferred borrowing costs relate to the establishment fees associated with the facility and will be amortised 
over its three year term. As at December 31, 2016, the Group had utilised US$7.8m (£6.3m) of the US$30.0m (£24.3m) available under the 
facility.
The Group’s revolving credit facility is secured by way of a floating charge over the Group’s assets and is subject to a number of financial 
covenants, all of which have been met during the year ended December 31, 2016.

On June 10, 2014, the Group acquired a 2% net smelter return royalty interest on all mineral products sold from the area of the Maracás 
Menchen project to which the royalty interest relates in exchange for US$22.0m and 500,000 warrants, which entitle the holder to acquire 
one Anglo Pacific ordinary share at a strike price of £2.50, which are exercisable over five years, and a further US$3.0m cash when the 
project reaches the following annualised production thresholds:
• US$1.5m cash when production reaches an annualised rate over a quarter of 9,500t; and
• A further US$1.5m cash when production reaches an annualised rate over a quarter of 12,000t.
Following the latest production guidance issued by the operator, Largo Resources Ltd, the Directors consider it probable that an 
annualised rate over a quarter of 9,500t will be achieved. As such a contingent liability has been recognised for the US$1.5m (£1.2m) 
deferred consideration that will become payable once this criteria has been satisfied. A corresponding asset has been recognised under 
deferred acquisition costs ( � note 18).
Non-current other taxation and social security payables relates to employer national insurance due on vesting of the certain share-based 
payments.

28 Share-based payments
The Group operates three equity-settled share-based compensation plans as follows:
• The HMRC approved Company Share Ownership Plan (the ‘CSOP’);
• The JSOP operated through the Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust; and
• The Value Creation Plan (the ‘VCP’).
(a) Company Share Ownership Plan 
Under the CSOP, share options are granted to Directors and to selected employees. The exercise price of the granted options is equal  
to the average mid-market closing price of an ordinary share for the three days before the grant. The options are conditional on the 
employee completing three years’ service (the vesting period). The options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date, 
subject to the Group achieving its target growth in absolute TSR over the period of 3% per annum (not compounded) in excess of the UK 
Retail Price Index; the options have a contractual option term of ten years. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase 
or settle the options in cash.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows:

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 106 No awards were made under the CSOP during 2016. The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2015 determined using the 
Black-Scholes valuation model was £0.472 per option granted in May 2015 and £0.394 per option granted in October 2015. The significant 
inputs into the model were weighted average share price of £0.922 and £0.77 at the grant date in May and October respectively, exercise 
price shown above, volatility of 40%, expected option life of three years and an annual risk-free interest rate of 1.5% for both grants.
In accordance with the terms of the CSOP, an employee forfeited 23,831 options upon their resignation in 2016. 
(b) Joint Share Ownership Plan 
Under the JSOP, the Remuneration Committee invites selected directors and employees to enter into an agreement with the Anglo Pacific 
Group Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Co-owner’) to acquire a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. The shares are held  
in the name of the Co-owner; however, the selected Directors and employees maintain a beneficial interest in these shares.
Awards under the JSOP are conditional on the employee completing three years’ service (the vesting period) and the Group’s absolute total 
shareholder return growing at an annual rate (not compounded) of 3% in excess of the UK Retail Price Index over the three-year vesting 
period. In addition the Company’s share price must reach a hurdle price during the three year vesting period as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee at the time of making the award.
Upon satisfying the performance targets and service requirements, the beneficial interest conferred will entitle the Director or employee 
to receive a proportion of the proceeds of sale of the ordinary shares. Their entitlement will be to receive the equivalent of all sales 
proceeds in excess of the threshold amount, settled in ordinary shares of the Company. The threshold amount is fixed by the 
Remuneration Committee and will not be set less than the market value of the ordinary shares of the Company at the time the JSOP award 
is made.
No shares were awarded under the JSOP during 2015 or 2016. A total of 154,660 shares were surrendered in 2015 as a result of 
performance criteria not being satisfied in accordance with the terms of the JSOP, as a result there are no outstanding awards under this 
plan. 
(c) Value Creation Plan
Following the approval at the 2014 AGM, the Group implements a new long-term incentive arrangement for the executive directors and 
selected senior management. The VCP was designed by the Remuneration Committee to incentivise the executive directors and senior 
management to drive growth in shareholder return over a five year measurement period. At the 2016 AGM, shareholders approved the 
extension of the measurement period from five to seven years.
Under the terms of the VCP, no value would accrue to the participants unless growth in the Group’s total shareholder return over the 
measurement period is at least equal to 7% per annum. Subject to such threshold growth, participants would become entitled to receive 
nil or nominal cost options over the ordinary shares of the Company, subject to a cap, set by reference to a share of a pool value equal to 
10% of the growth in the Company’s total shareholder return over the measurement period or, if less, 50% of the growth in the Company’s 
total shareholder return over the measurement period in excess of the threshold growth.
Options granted under the VCP will comprise three equal tranches, the first tranche exercisable as from the time of the grant of the 
options and the other tranches exercisable as from one and two years thereafter respectively. Subject to appropriate adjustments in 
accordance with the terms of the VCP, the maximum number of shares set under the option grants will not be capable of exceeding such 
number equating to 7.5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the end of the measurement period.
VCP awards outstanding at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:

Weighted average remaining contractual life 4.50 3.50
No awards were made under the VCP during 2015 or 2016. In accordance with the terms of the VCP, Mr. Potter forfeited his awards upon 
his resignation on May 31, 2015. 
At the 2016 AGM, the shareholders approved an amendment to the VCP extending the performance period from 5 years to 7 years, 
resulting in the weighted average remaining contractual life increasing by 2 years to 4.5 years.

32 Financial risk management
The Group’s principal treasury objective is to provide sufficient liquidity to meet operational cash flow and dividend requirements and to 
allow the Group to take advantage of new growth opportunities whilst maximising shareholder value. The Group’s activities expose it to  
a variety of financial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk. The Group operates controlled treasury 
policies which are monitored by management to ensure that the needs of the Group are met while minimising potential adverse effects  
of unpredictability of financial markets on the Group’s financial performance. The Group’s financial risk management should be read in 
conjunction with the principal risks outlined on

Financial

Other 
information Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, royalty instruments held as financial assets, trade and other receivables and 
investments. These represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets and total £16.9m at December 31, 
2016 (£19.8m at December 31, 2015).
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its other receivables, including royalty receivables. It is the policy of the Group to present 
the amounts in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior 
experience and the current economic environment. In certain cases the Group has the right to audit the reported royalty income.
The Group’s credit risk on royalty interests held as financial instruments, has been reviewed and the estimated current exposure is as 
disclosed in 
�
note 15 where the future contractual right to cash flow from these instruments is reflected in their fair value.
The credit risk on bank deposits is mitigated by banking with household name financial institutions in reputable jurisdictions. The Group 
has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of currencies and counterparties.
The Group’s credit risk on foreign exchange forward contracts is mitigated by entering into these agreements with large financial 
institutions. The Group limits its exposure to credit risk, together with that of the contracting financial institution by restricting the 
settlement date to no more than a year from the contract date. In addition the Group limits the quantum of the forward contracts  
to no more than an average 50% of forecast royalty revenue expected to be received by the date of settlement.
Share price risk
The Group is exposed to share price risk in respect of its mining and exploration interests which include listed and unlisted equity 
securities and any convertible instruments.
A 10% increase or decrease in the fair value of our mining and exploration interests (listed and unlisted) would increase/decrease the 
mining and exploration interests balance (and investment revaluation reserve in equity) by £1.7m at December 31, 2016 (£1.1m at 
December 31, 2015). We note that if a 10% decrease were to occur then a further assessment would be required to determine whether  
the decrease was considered to be ‘significant’ with any resulting impairment recognised in the income statement.
The Group’s mining and exploration interests are held for the purposes of generating additional royalties and are considered long-term, 
strategic investments. This strategy is unaffected by recent fluctuations in prices for mining and exploration equities; however, interests 
are continually monitored for indicators that may suggest problems for these companies raising capital or continuing their day-to-day 
business activities to ensure remedial action can be taken if necessary. This is expected to be a less significant part of the Group’s strategy 
going forward.
No specific hedging activities are undertaken in relation to these interests and the voting rights arising from these equity instruments  
are utilised in the Group’s favour.
Other price risk
The royalty portfolio exposes the Group to other price risk through fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the prices of coking coal, 
iron ore, gold and uranium. As the Directors obtain independent commodity price forecasts, the generation of which takes into account 
fluctuations in prices, limited analysis of the impact of fluctuations on the valuations of the royalties has been undertaken in 
�
note 14 and 
�
note 15.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s transactional foreign exchange exposure arises from income, expenditure and purchase and sale of assets denominated in 
foreign currencies. As each material commitment is made, the risk in relation to currency fluctuations is assessed by the Executive 
Committee and regularly reviewed. In light of the continued weakness in the pound against the Australian dollar, the Group implemented  
a hedging policy whereby foreign exchange forward contracts can be entered into with a maximum exposure of 60% of forecast Australian 
dollar denominated royalty revenue expected to be received during a period not exceeding twelve months from contract date to 
settlement. Refer to 
�
note 20 for further details on the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 
2016. The Group has no other hedging programs in place.

foreign subsidiaries into the Group’s presentation currency have been excluded.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APG13 | AR16 | 29/03/2017 | Back – Proof 4
Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 110 In terms of the cash balance, the significant sensitivities are as follows:
• A +/- 10% change in the GBP: AUD rate would increase/decrease profit after tax and equity by £114k (2015: £13k);
• A +/- 10% change in the GBP:CAD rate would increase/decrease profit after tax and equity by £117k (2015: £309k);
• A +/- 10% change in the GBP: USD rate would increase/decrease profit after tax and equity by £82k (2015: £87k). 
Exposures to foreign exchange rates vary during the year depending on the volume of overseas transactions. Nonetheless, the analysis 
above is considered to be representative of the Group’s exposure to currency risk.
Capital management and procedures 
The Group’s capital management objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern  
in order to realise the full value of its assets and to enhance shareholder value in the company and returns to shareholders by acquiring 
further royalty assets.
The Directors continue to monitor the capital requirements of the Group by reference to expected future cash flows. Capital for the 
reporting periods presented is summarised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
The optimal capital structure for the Group is to fund its business via equity. In certain circumstances the Directors will tolerate a level of 
gearing. The targeted debt capacity will be 1.5-2 times free cash flow, although a higher ratio can be tolerated for shorter periods when 
there is a reasonable expectation of a recovery in free cash flow.
Fair value hierarchy
The following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet in accordance with the fair value 
hierarchy. This hierarchy aggregates financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance of the inputs used in 
measuring the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair  
value measurement.
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at December 31, 2016:

There have been no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2 in the reporting period.
The methods and valuation techniques used for the purposes of measuring fair value of royalty financial instruments gives more 
prominence to the probability of production by applying a risk weighting to the discounted net present value outcome in order to fully 
reflect the risk that the operation never comes into production rather than factoring this risk into the discount rate applied to the future 
cash flow.
(a) Coal royalties (Investment Property)
The Group’s coal royalties derive from its ownership of certain sub-stratum land in Queensland, Australia. In accordance with IAS 40,  
this land is revalued at each reporting date on the basis of future expected income discounted at 7.5% (2015: 7.0%) by an independent 
valuation consultant. Refer to 
�
note 14 for details of the key inputs into the valuation, together with a sensitivity analysis for fluctuations  
in the price assumptions and discount rate. All unobservable inputs are obtained from third parties.
(b) Royalty instruments
At the reporting date, the royalty financial instruments are valued based on the net present value of pre-tax cash flows discounted at a  
rate between 7% and 13%. The discount rate of each royalty arrangement is derived using a capital asset pricing model specific to the 
underlying project, making reference to the risk free rate of return expected on an investment with the same time horizon as the expected 
mine life, together with the country risk associated with the location of the operation.
For those royalty financial instrument not in production, the outcome of this net present value calculation is then risk weighted to reflect 
management’s current assessment of the overall likelihood and timing of each project coming into production and royalty income arising. 
This assessment is impacted by news flow relating to the underlying operation in the period, in conjunction with management’s 
assessment of the economic viability of the project based on commodity price projections.
The table below outlines the discount rate and risk weighting applied in the valuation of the Group’s royalty financial instruments:
December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015
Classification Discount Rate Risk Weighting Discount Rate Risk Weighting
EVBC Available-for-sale equity 6% 100% 9% 100%
Jogjakarta Available-for-sale debt 8% 100% 8% 100%
Dugbe 1 Available-for-sale debt 13% 75% – –
The Dugbe 1 royalty financial instrument was previously classified as a non-current receivable, as detailed in 
�
note 15.
The Group has reviewed the impact on the carrying value of its royalty financial instruments, and does not consider a +/- 1% change  
in the discount rate or a +/- 10% change in the underlying commodity prices to have a material impact.
(c) Mining and exploration interests – quoted
All the quoted mining and exploration interests have been issued by publicly traded companies on well established security markets.  
Fair values for these securities have been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
(d) Mining and exploration interests – unquoted
All the unquoted mining and exploration interests are initially recognised using cost as the best approximation of fair value. The Group 
notes any trading activity in the unquoted instruments and will value its holding accordingly. At present the Group holds these 
investments with a view to generating future royalties and there is no present intention to sell. The vast majority of these are in 
investments which the Group anticipates a realistic possibility of a future listing.

The derivative financial instruments consist of the foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to hedge the Group’s Australian dollar 
denominated royalty income. At the reporting date the foreign exchange forward contracts are valued based on the net present value of 
the discounted future cash flows estimated based on forward exchange rates and contract forward rates, discounted at a rate that reflect 
the credit risk of various counterparties.

There have been no transfers into or out of Level 3 in any of the years.
The Group measures its entitlement to the royalty income and any optionality embedded within the royalty instruments using discounted 
cash flow models. In determining the discount rate to be applied, management considers the country and sovereign risk associated with 
the projects, together with the time horizon to the commencement of production and the success or failure of projects of a similar nature.
33 Free cash flow
The structure of a number of the Group’s royalty financing arrangement, such as the Denison transaction completed in February 2017, 
result in a significant amount of cash flow being reported as principal repayments, which are not included in the income statement. As the 
Group considers dividend cover based on the free cash flow generated by its assets, management have determined that free cash flow per 
share is a key performance indicator, going forward.
Free cash flow per share is calculated by dividend net cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from the disposal of non-core 
assets, less finance costs divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue.

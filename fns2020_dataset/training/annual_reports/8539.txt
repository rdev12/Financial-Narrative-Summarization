Overview
ITE’s business
ITE is an organiser  
of exhibitions and 
conferences in emerging 
and developing markets
ITE organises high-quality events of an 
international standard throughout the 1 3 
countries in which it operates. The business 
is managed in five main geographic 
sectors: Russia, Central Asia & Caucasus, 
Eastern & Southern Europe, UK & Western 
Europe and Rest of World (see Divisional 
summary on pages 18 to 25 and the 
Financial highlights section on page 1). 
As an exhibition organiser, ITE hires 
venues at which it stages its events and 
markets the events to both exhibitors 
and visitors. Exhibitions and conferences 
provide an opportunity for participants 
from national and international 
companies to meet, network and transact 
business. The exhibition media is the 
best media for suppliers to display and 
demonstrate their products to potential 
buyers. This is particularly powerful in 
emerging and developing markets where 
culturally face-to-face meetings are the 
norm and where alternative media, 
B2B publishing and on-line marketing 
opportunities are less developed. 
ITE’s strength derives from its focus on 
organising B2B exhibitions and conferences, 
the development of strong brands in key 
industry sectors and the regional expertise 
in the markets in which it operates. 
ITE has been operating in these markets 
for over 15 years and its experience 
and local knowledge are unique.
ITE’s principal business of organising 
B2B trade exhibitions accounts for 95% 
of the Group’s revenues. Conferences 
account for circa 4% of the Group’s 
revenues and other activities relating 
to the core exhibition business (mostly 
publishing) account for 1% of revenue. 
ITE’s sector brands are a key asset. The 
brands have been established through 
a sustained record of presenting high 
quality events which meet customer 
expectations. ITE events serve key 
industries including construction & 
interiors, oil & gas, food & drink, travel 
& leisure, motor & transport, fashion, 
medical & healthcare and IT & telecoms. 
ITE has an extensive office network, 
covering both the territories where 
our events are held and international 
sales offices in other countries. ITE is 
able to operate at national level where 
local staff are close to local industry 
trends and at an international level 
where our sales teams are in regular 
communication with key industry 
suppliers in our sectors. The Group has 
25 offices across the world, each of them 
employing almost exclusively local staff.

The offices of the Group co-operate 
in a unique way. Each office sells its 
own exhibitions, but participates 
with equal levels of commitment in 
the exhibitions organised by other 
offices. This holistic approach has been 
carefully cultivated through the years 
and enables ITE’s business to follow 
long-established trading patterns. 05

Scale and sustainability
The Key Performance Indicators that ITE uses to measure progress against 
its objectives and the performance this year are set out below:
Objective Progress KPI
To increase revenues 
from existing 
exhibition portfolio
Sterling revenues from existing (‘like-
for-like’) products have fallen by 6% 
in the year under review. This reflects 
the severity of the recession in our 
markets, which continued to have 
an effect on our business through 
the first three quarters of the year. 
To increase the 
annually recurring 
volume base of our 
exhibition business
The annually recurring volume base 
of the exhibition business increased 
by 9% in 2010 from 406,000m
2
 
to 442,000m
2
. The net increase 
in volume sales is comprised of a 
52,000m
2
 fall in portfolio sales, 
offset by an incremental 88,000m
2
 
from new additions to the portfolio 
in the year. The bulk (73,000m
2
) of 
this new volume is from low yielding 
events in Turkey. Cumulatively over 
the last two financial years ITE’s 
volumes have fallen by 165,000m
2
, 
representing a 29% ‘like-for-like 
reduction’, mitigated by the addition 
of 156,000m
2
 from acquisitions.
To make incremental 
bolt on acquisitions  
in support of  
our objectives
The Group acquired a small exhibition 
business in India in November 2009 
which gives ITE access to a market 
with substantial growth potential.
In April the Moscow business acquired 
two exhibitions to supplement its 
existing portfolio. ‘Citybuild’ and 
‘Meat and Dairy’ will make their initial 
contribution in the next financial year.
In April ITE completed the acquisition 
of three ‘Aquatherm’ events in Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. These 
events supplement our Moscow joint 
venture of the same brand, and give ITE 
a strong position from which the Group 
can build more events in this sector.

Chairman’s statement
A good financial 
performance
Group performance
The Group has delivered a good financial 
performance in its lesser biennial year that 
also reflected the effects of the recession 
although latterly included the beginnings 
of a recovery. The Group’s revenues 
for the year were £1 1 3.5 million (2009: 
£1 16.7 million) and headline pre-tax profits 
were £36.6 million (2009: £45.8 million). 
Reported pre-tax profits were £31.3 million 
(2009: £41.5 million) and fully diluted 
earnings per share were 9.8p (2009: 12.7p).
The balance sheet is strong and the Group 
finished the year with net cash balances 
of £23.0 million (2009: £23.1 million) after 
making investments in new businesses of 
over £20 million over the last 12 months.
Development of ITE’s business
The Group has continued to work on 
expanding the geographic profile of its 
business. In November 2009, ITE made 
initial steps to establish an exhibition 
business in India through the purchase of a 
small exhibition organiser. We now have a 
local office infrastructure in India through 
our operational centre in Delhi. We have 
also expanded our presence in Turkey by 
acquiring a significant portfolio of events 
from our former 50% owned associate 
business. In April, the Group acquired three 
‘Aquatherm’ events in Ukraine, Kazakhstan 
and Azerbaijan which supplement the 
existing Moscow event of the same 
brand. These investments are all in line 
with the Board’s strategy of developing 
international brand strength and expanding 
its emerging market presence.
Board and management
There have been no changes to the Board 
this year. The Group have decided to 
adopt early the new provisions on annual 
re-election of Directors as recommended 
by the recently issued 2010 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, as such, all Directors 
will offer themselves for re-election at the 
Company’s 201 1 Annual General Meeting.
The Board and executive management have 
worked to build a stronger management 
team and to facilitate the development 
of talent within our business. This 
investment is necessary to enable the 
Group to fulfil its strategy for business 
expansion. ITE is full of committed 
individuals, many of whom have 
demonstrated their loyalty and expertise 
over a number of years and I would like 
to thank the 822 staff of ITE throughout 
the world who have worked so hard for 
the Group in a year where the economic 
environment has been challenging.
Dividend
The Board has maintained its progressive 
dividend policy through the recession and 
is recommending a final dividend of 4.0p 
per share, which together with the interim 
dividend of 1.7p per share makes a full 
year dividend of 5.7p per share (2009: 
5.5p). The Board aims to maintain dividend 
cover of two times over the biennial cycle, 
and this dividend therefore reflects both 
the Group’s strong cash position and the 
Board’s confidence in the Group’s future.
Ian Paterson
Non-executive Chairman 13
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Outlook
The Group’s markets have all been 
impacted by the recession over the last 
two years. Moscow, which is our most 
significant market, has seen improving 
trading conditions and next year’s results 
should reflect the financial effect of this 
strengthening recovery. Our other CIS 
markets are lagging Moscow’s recovery, 
but are now showing signs of recovery. 
In our other markets, Turkey, India and 
the UK, trading conditions are either 
stable or improving. This positive outlook 
must be tempered by the risk that the 
global economy remains uncertain and 
could cause this recovery to stall.
At 26 November forward bookings for 201 1 
were £74 million which, on a ‘like-for-like 
basis’, represents growth of more than 10% 
over last year’s bookings at the same time 
and is in line with the Board’s expectations.
The Group has a strong balance sheet 
and excellent market positions in 
places with good growth opportunities 
and is well positioned to expand both 
organically and through acquisitions. The 
Board remains confident of the future 
prospects for the Group’s business.

Chief Executive’s statement
Further strategic  
progress
The Group has delivered a robust financial 
performance in a year that saw sentiment 
in our markets move from recession to 
recovery. Most of the events that took 
place reflect the effects of the recession, 
with only those taking place in the final 
quarter of the year reporting significant 
improvement over last year’s equivalent 
events. The effects of last year’s recession 
are evidenced by the expected 1 1% 
reduction in ‘like-for-like’ volume sales. 
Average exchange rates of the Euro, our 
principal invoicing currency, were 5% 
stronger against Sterling over the year 
and this helped to mitigate the effect of 
the sales shortfall on reported revenues. 
Actual revenues for the year were 
£1 1 3.5 million (2009: £1 16.7 million), 
which in ‘like-for-like’ terms is a reduction 
of circa 6%. The biennial pattern of the 
Moscow International Oil & Gas event 
(which did not take place this year) 
together with the impact of the recession 
accounted for a £10 million reduction 
from last year’s revenues. Revenues from 
newly acquired businesses in the year 
were circa £8.0 million. Approximately 
half of this came from new shows in 
Turkey (previously owned by our former 
associate company) and comprise relatively 
low priced large events. The addition 
of our new Indian exhibition business 
and a portfolio of ‘Aquatherm’ events in 
Ukraine and Central Asia account for the 
balance of new acquisition revenue.
The Group’s gross margin has fallen to 
49% from last year’s high of 52%. This 
partially reflects ITE’s biennial pattern, but 
is also a consequence of the new low-
yielding Turkish events in the portfolio 
which contributed £3.8 million of revenue, 
but at markedly lower yields than the 
Group’s average yield. Administrative 
expenses (before amortisation) have 
risen by 1 1% to £19.9 million, but the 
majority of this increase relates to 
transaction costs and overhead increase 
associated with new acquisitions. 
Excluding these acquisition-related 
costs, administrative expenses before 
amortisation have increased by circa 6%. 
Operating profits before amortisation and 
transaction costs were £36.6 million, which 
represents a net operating margin of 32%. 
Trading summary 2010 
As last year, the principal factor affecting 
the performance of individual events was 
where and when they took place in the 
year. The Russian economy began to show 
positive signs in Moscow shortly after the 
beginning of the calendar year and has 
gathered momentum since then. In Central 
Asia the signs of recovery lag Moscow by 
six months and Ukraine, which suffered 
the worst of the recessions, has yet to 
start a recovery. In Turkey, Azerbaijan 
and Uzbekistan the effects of the global 
recession were moderate compared to the 
impact on Russia, Central Asia and Ukraine. 
Events taking place in the first quarter of 
this financial year reflected the full impact 
of the recession and were set against 
comparative performances from October to 
December 2008 which enjoyed ‘top of the 
market’ conditions for our business. Events 
taking place from January to April enjoyed 
a mix of influences as their booking 
periods included periods of recession and 
also the beginnings of a recovery, and for 
events taking place after May the pattern 
was increasingly one of the recovering 
economy. By September 2010 the events 
had almost all of their bookings cycle made

ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Sectors have also responded differently to 
the recession. Construction, represented 
by the Build brand remains our largest 
sector accounting for 39% of the Group’s 
revenue and has over the last two years 
been the most severely affected of ITE’s 
sectors. Since 2008 the sector has fallen 
in size by 26%. Mosbuild, the dominant 
Moscow construction exhibition, took place 
in April but was a net 16% smaller than the 
equivalent event in 2009, which itself had 
been 14% down on the 2008 peak result. 
Likewise Interstroyexpo, the international 
construction event in St Petersburg, is 
now running at about half of its 2008 
size, and Balticbuild (St Petersburg) and 
Kazbuild (Kazakhstan) are reduced to 
circa 30% of their former peak sizes. Oil 
& Gas, represented by the ‘IOGE’ brand 
is ITE’s second biggest sector accounting 
for circa 12% of revenue and replicated at 
seven events across our territories. These 
events are beginning to recover with the 
recovering oil price. The portfolio was 
24% smaller in 2010 than its equivalent 
peak in 2008. ITE’s travel exhibition brand 
accounts for circa 12% of Group revenue 
and is dominated by the Moscow, Turkish 
and Ukrainian events, all taking place in 
the spring season. A substantial proportion 
of their customer base comes from 
government and regional authorities. The 
2010 events performed exceptionally well 
and collectively were only 1 3% lower than 
the 2008 peak events. However, looking 
forward there is now more pressure on 
many government budgets, particularly in 
the Southern Mediterranean and Western 
European holiday destinations and the 
trading environment for this sector next 
year is more challenging. ‘World Food’ 
is ITE’s major food brand and accounts 
for 10% of Group revenues. Despite a 
positive result from World Food Moscow 
in September 2010, the ‘World Food’ 
portfolio is still more than 20% smaller 
than the comparative 2008 portfolio.
The revenues and profits of the Group’s 
business for this financial year are 
comparable to the results from the last 
pre-recession year, 2008. However in 
the interceding two years the Group has 
absorbed a 29% ‘like for like’ fall in sales 
volumes from its core portfolio, and 
replaced the profits and revenues through 
a combination of new business acquisitions, 
favourable currency movements and cost 
reductions. Accordingly as the Group 
enters 201 1, the underlying base of the 
exhibition business is stronger than in 
2008 and there is scope for a cyclical 
recovery towards previous activity levels, 
if economic circumstances continue 
to improve in the next few years. 
ITE’s strategy
ITE’s primary business objectives are to:
create sustainable growth in 
headline earnings per share; and 
create and maintain sustainable 
positions of market leadership 
in the exhibition business 
in emerging markets.
ITE’s strategic priorities for achieving these 
objectives are: 
(i) to continue to strengthen and build 
on its existing market leadership 
(ii) to expand its business model into 
other sectors and/or geographies 
where there is the potential to 
create strong market positions 
(iii) to grow and improve its portfolio 
of international exhibition brands 
(iv) to invest in the development of 
management talent in ITE.

ITE’s performance against its strategic 
objectives is set out below:
(i) To continue to strengthen and build 
on its existing market leadership
ITE’s existing positions of market 
leadership are based upon the strength 
of its international sales network, its 
market leading brands, established 
local offices and longstanding 
relationships with venues.
International sales reach 
ITE’s International sales reach differentiates 
it from its local competition in Russian 
and CIS markets. Through its subsidiary 
sales offices the Group has built a 
specialist skill base in promoting sales 
into ITE’s Russian and CIS exhibitions. 
In 2010 ‘international sales’ accounted 
for 35% of total metres sold in the year; 
through its London office 20%; its German 
office 5%; its Chinese office 3% and its 
Turkish office 3%. International sales, 
having performed well in 2009, reflected 
the recessionary slowdown this year.
ITE’s market leading brands
ITE has established strong brand identity 
in certain sectors of exhibitions. In 
particular the Build brand in construction, 
the Oil & Gas events brand, the ITE Travel 
exhibition and World Food brands all 
have strong reputations and identities 
with customers, earned through 
more than 15 years of sustained good 
performance. The Group is working to 
establish more recognised brands. ITE now 
runs Aquatherm events, under licence, 
in four of its markets and its security 
portfolio is being expanded and will be 
represented in three markets next year.

and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements 16
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Operating performance and Divisional summary
Building local presence
ITE’s brands have built their reputation 
through sustained delivery of successful 
exhibitions to customers. The foundation 
of this are ITE’s local offices, which like its 
exhibitions and brands, have been in place 
for over 15 years and today employ over 
650 people (outside of the UK) who manage 
local market sales and the details of staging 
an exhibition. Critically they own and 
manage the databases of visitors necessary 
for making an exhibition successful for 
our customers. ITE’s local office skills in 
Russia and CIS are a differentiating factor 
from other international organisers and 
a barrier to entry for new organisers 
wishing to run events in these markets. 
Maintaining venue relationships
ITE has established special relationships 
with the venues that host its exhibitions. 
Historically ITE has supported the 
development of venue facilities which in 
turn has helped the Group’s exhibitions 
to grow. Through this ITE has established 
the rights to run its main exhibition 
themes in its chosen venues at the time of 
its choice. ITE has continued to work on 
maintaining its strong relationships over 
the year and has successfully extended 
its forward venue bookings for key 
events. In Turkey the Group has secured 
the position of its new events with a 
three year prepayment arrangement
(ii) To expand the business model 
into other sectors and geographies 
where there is the potential to 
create strong market positions
In existing markets the strategy targets 
new sectors and regions where businesses 
can be acquired or developed and where 
there is potential for the participation of 
international exhibitors. In new markets 
ITE is targeting the development of 
exhibition businesses where there is clear 
opportunity for strong future growth.
In November 2009 ITE acquired a 
small business in Delhi, India, running 
exhibitions that serve the paper industry 
and the mining, metals and metallurgy 
industries. India does not yet have a 
mature exhibition industry and definitive 
international exhibitions have not yet 
been established. ITE has entered the 
India market with an aim to establish 
its brands and give it the best chance 
of winning a leading market position 
as the exhibition industry develops. 
In February 2010 ITE acquired 100% 
ownership of exhibitions in Turkey which 
serve the food, engineering, furniture and 
promotional gift industries. These are all 
new sectors for ITE in Turkey. There is a 
real opportunity to bring the Food show 
into the ‘World Food’ brand and to leverage 
relationships with international exhibitors.
(iii) To grow and improve its 
portfolio of international brands 
The Group has always had a presence 
in the heating and ventilation markets 
through its own ‘Heat-Vent’ brand. 
Acquiring three shows with the rights to 
use the Aquatherm brand in three more 
of its territories in addition to the Moscow 
event gives ITE the support of a strong 
well-recognised international brand in 
this sector. The existing construction 
events taking place in Kazakhstan and 
Azerbaijan have already benefited from 
this association. The Group’s management 
has been actively developing initiatives to 
improve the strength of its existing brands.
 
(iv) To invest in the development 
of management talent in ITE
ITE has benefited over the years from 
the commitment, loyalty and expertise 
of its employees. The exhibition industry 
is not an established profession and so 
training and development is mostly ‘on 
the job’ and the responsibility of local 
offices. As ITE grows it is important to 
maintain its culture and the Group has now 
started a process of identifying, training 
and developing selected individuals to 
ensure continuity of quality management 
is generated internally in the future.
Chief Executive’s statement 
continued
The actions taken during 
the last 18 months have 
strengthened the Group 
and positioned it to 
benefit from growth
ITE’s sales expertise, 
brand strength and local 
office presence give it 
a unique position in the 
Russian and CIS markets 17
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Operating performance
ITE’s established position in its main sectors 
in its core markets, its brands and its venue 
relationships make it hard for new entrants 
to successfully compete with ITE’s events in 
these markets. Two of these assets – the 
brands and the international sales skills are 
portable and will help ITE to establish itself 
in new emerging and growth markets.
In 2010 the Group ran 167 events (2009: 
1 79). There were a number of cancellations 
in the year reflecting tough economic 
circumstances, with acquisitions and 
new launches compensating for some 
of these events in the overall total.

The average yield on our portfolio 
of annually recurring events is now 
£247 (2009: £268). The change in 
yield is attributable to product mix 
in the portfolio with newly acquired 
events having an average yield of 
£93 per square metre – principally 
attributable to the new Turkish events.
To run successful international exhibitions, 
an organiser must have both local presence 
and international sales strength.

Russia
In Russia ITE operates through three 
offices, Moscow, St Petersburg and 
Novosibirsk. During the year the Group ran 
71 events in Russia, with total volume sales 
of 205,300m
2
 (2009: 257 ,000m
2
). Actual 
revenues of £66.1 million were 18% less 
than last year though 2010 does not include 
the biennial Moscow International Oil & 
Gas event. On a like-for-like basis volume 
sales were down 14% and revenues 7%.
The Russian economy has returned 
to growth and is expected to expand 
by around 4%* in 2010, with a similar 
level of growth expected in 201 1*. In 
general macro-economic indicators look 
more favourable for Russia than a year 
ago, with the price of oil, Russia’s key 
export, holding consistently above $70 
a barrel, a stronger Ruble and inflation 
and interest rates at relatively low levels. 
Although the Russian government is 
now running an annual budget deficit 
for the first time in a number of years, 
this is at relatively low and sustainable 
level of circa 3% pa, with plans for this to 
be eliminated over the next five years.
Across all of our Russian offices the 
story of 2010 has been one of improving 
performance quarter by quarter as the 
effects of a return to growth have started 
to feed into the Group’s sales. The return 
to growth has also been marked by a 
difference in the speed of return of local 
and international exhibitors and by time 
lags in the recovery between Moscow 
and the Group’s various regional offices. 
In broad terms, local exhibitors have 
returned to the market quicker than 
international exhibitors, which reverses 
the Group’s experience in 2009 when 
local exhibitors were the first to react to 
the recession and reduce expenditure. 
Moscow is Russia’s principal international 
exhibition centre and experienced an 
increase in local demand from early 
2010 (the Group’s second quarter), with 
international exhibitors returning in the 
fourth quarter events. In general terms, 
St Petersburg and Novosibirsk have 
lagged Moscow by around six months, 
having seen a return of local exhibitors 
from the end of the third quarter.
In Moscow, where six of the Group’s 
top ten events are held, the autumn 
events, which were largely untroubled in 
2008, all recorded sizeable declines this 
year as the full impact of the recession 
was reflected in their results. Second 
quarter events performed reasonably 
well with strong growth at the Moscow 
Aquatherm exhibition (a joint-venture 
with Reed exhibitions), where the Group 
is responsible for making local sales 
and for staging the event. The Moscow 
international Travel and Tourism event was 
held in March and despite the economic 
MITT, Russia 19
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
difficulties of a number of its exhibitors 
from Southern Europe achieved sales of 
19,500m
2
, a decline of only 3%. This was a 
resilient performance for an internationally 
dominated event and owes much to the 
strong rebound in Russian outbound 
tourism, which grew by over 40% in the first 
quarter of 2010. The third quarter holds 
the largest event in the Group’s portfolio 
including the Moscow construction event 
Mosbuild, which is held in the first week 
of April. This year’s event sold 62,700m
2
, 
a reduction of 16% on last year, reflecting 
the high level of international participation 
and a moribund Moscow construction 
market. The other leading events in 
Moscow to take place during April have 
a larger local exhibitor base and fared 
much better. TransRussia, the transport 
and logistics exhibition sold 7 ,500m
2
, 
an increase of 3% on the last year (2009: 
7,300m
2
) and the Moscow International 
Protection and Security exhibition sold 
6,600m
2
, an increase of 3% on last year 
(2009: 6,400m
2
). ExpoElectronica, the 
electrical components exhibition, sold 
5,100m
2
, a decrease of 7% on last year 
(2009: 5,500m
2
). The final quarter of the 
Group’s financial year, saw a strong return 
to growth. Exhibitions held in this period 
last year fully reflected the effects of the 
recession, and this year they benefited 
from a strong return of local exhibitors 
along with the beginnings of the return 
of international exhibitors. Worldfood 
Moscow, the leading International food 
and drink exhibition, was a significant 
beneficiary selling 21,000m
2
, which was 
29% more than last year (2009: 16,300m
2
), 
and demonstrated the value of not only a 
leading international position, but also the 
Group’s ability to maintain the strength 
of its products through the downturn. 
Trading in St Petersburg, where the 
trading pattern lagged Moscow by around 
six months, was difficult this year. The 
dominance of construction in the St 
Petersburg portfolio added to the difficulty 
with the leading construction event, 
Interstroyexpo, selling 6,400m
2
 a decline 
of 37% on last year (2009: 10,100m
2
). There 
were signs of a small improvement in the 
fourth quarter and latterly indications 
of improved bookings for 201 1.
Sibfair, the Group’s Novosibirsk operation 
held 37 exhibitions during the year and 
delivered volume sales of 36,000m
2
 
(2009: 40,500m
2
). This performance 
reflected the more general spread 
of events across sectors and a lesser 
reliance on international exhibitors. 
The Group continues to enjoy good 
relationships with all of its principal venues 
in Russia. In Moscow there is currently 
more than sufficient international quality 
exhibition space for the current level of 
business activity. St Petersburg’s business 
World Food Moscow, Russia
will benefit from the expected new and 
larger exhibition and conference facility due 
to be built by 201 3. Novosibirsk’s business 
is currently constrained by the quality 
and size of the existing facility, which is a 
converted warehouse. There is however a 
relatively advanced plan for a new quality 
exhibition venue, and construction has 
begun. The planned facility is expected 
to be completed by the end of 2012. ITE is 
currently involved in a dialogue with the 
potential new venue owners to transfer its 
portfolio and agree terms for the future.

Central Asia & Caucasus
ITE’s principal offices in Central Asia 
are in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and 
Uzbekistan. This year ITE organised 
a total of 59 events across these 
territories delivering total volume sales 
of 60,200m
2
, which was 1% less than last 
year. Revenues of £19.6m represented 
an increase of 3% over last year. 
All of the economies within this region 
are dependent on oil for their overseas 
earnings and economic well-being and 
the return to a more stable oil price above 
$70 a barrel for the majority of 2010 
has helped to stabilise the economies. 
In Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, which 
had little exposure to the international 
banking crisis in 2009, the economies 
continued to grow well during 2010.
Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan, which has been exposed 
to the economic recession since its own 
property crash of mid 2008, only began 
to slowly emerge into growth during the 
early part of 2010. The late cycle nature 
of the exhibition industry means that this 
growth is only now beginning to filter 
through to increased space sales. The 
relatively flat nature of economic activity 
during the year meant that 2010 was 
stable overall in volume sales terms in 
comparison to 2009, with volume sales 
of 36,000m
2
 being only 2% less than last 
year and revenues at the same level. The 
region did, however, show a similar pattern 
of improvement in performance during the 
year, with exhibitions taking place in the 
second half of the year performing more 
strongly in comparison to the prior year. 
The region has two principal sectors of 
operation, Oil and Gas and Construction. 
The region’s largest Oil and Gas event, 
the Kazakhstan International Oil & Gas 
Exhibition which took place in the first 
quarter of the year achieved sales of 
7,900m
2
, 23% less than in the prior year, 
reflecting difficult trading conditions. 
The construction sector has begun to 
New exhibition centre, Baku, Azerbaijan 21
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
show signs of recovery, with the leading 
construction event Kazbuild, which takes 
place in September, showing good growth 
albeit at a much lower level of activity 
than in its peak years of 2007 and 2008.
ITE continues to work closely with 
Atakent, the principal venue in Almaty, 
to develop existing venue facilities. At 
present Atakent offers the Group sufficient 
space in which to operate its events. 
Azerbaijan
Azerbaijan was relatively unaffected by 
the economic recession in 2009 and this 
year the region achieved volume sales of 
14,600m
2
, a similar level to last year. The 
highlight of the year was the opening of 
a new 28,000m
2
 venue located close to 
Baku international airport. ITE has agreed 
terms to run its exhibition portfolio there 
and is established as the anchor tenant. 
With state of the art facilities this new 
venue offers the Group an opportunity 
to grow previously space-constrained 
events, notably the Caspian Oil & Gas 
Exhibition and the construction event, 
Bakubuild, as well as launching new events.

Eastern & Southern Europe
The Eastern and Southern European 
region is represented by the Group’s 
offices in Turkey and Ukraine. Overall the 
region sold 1 78,600m
2
 in 2010 (2009: 
73,700m
2
) which on a like-for-like basis 
(excluding acquisitions and biennial events) 
was a decline of 21% in volumes, with a 
corresponding decrease in revenues. These 
two offices performed very differently in 
2010. Ukraine, continued to feel the effects 
of political and economic instability well 
into the year, with little appetite from 
both local and international customers to 
increase their participation in exhibitions 
this year. Turkey, which was relatively 
unaffected by the economic recession in 
2009, performed strongly, grew its overall 
sales on a ‘like-for-like’ for basis and added 
six new exhibitions from the successful 
‘split’ of the Group’s former associate ITF. 
Ukraine
In 2009 the Ukrainian economy suffered a 
15% reduction in GDP, with only a modest 
recovery in 2010 and consequently this 
market was the most severely affected of 
all ITE’s territories during the last financial 
year. The majority of the Group’s Ukrainian 
business takes place in the first half of 
the year and this period experienced the 
full effects of the economic downturn; 
volumes sales fell by nearly 50% in 
comparison to the relatively strong trading 
in the same period in the prior year. 
However, Ukraine remains an attractive 
market for ITE. The country has a 
population of over 45 million, its GDP 
is forecast to grow by 4% to 5% in the 
near future and it has significant natural 
resources, notably iron ore and coal. A 
restructured financial base following a 
support package agreement with the 
IMF, should provide the foundation for 
good recovery in the general trading 
environment and this is expected to 
positively impact the trade exhibition 
market during 201 1 and beyond. This 
potential led the Group to acquire the 
market leading Kyiv Aquatherm event 
(serving the Heating, Ventilation and 
Air-Conditioning industries) in April 
2010. The first event under the Group’s 
ownership was held in May 2010, achieving 
14,200m
2
 and becoming one of the 
Group’s top ten events by contribution.
Turkey
The Turkish economy is growing 
strongly and this is reflected in an 
expanding exhibition market and in 
the expansion of both the main venues 
in Istanbul, who between them are 
building new additional exhibition 
space of 50,000m
2
. When complete, 
the city will have nearly 200,000m
2
 of 
international quality venue space.

ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
In December 2009, the Group successfully 
acquired half the exhibition business of 
ITF, the Group’s former associate company, 
giving ITE control of six exhibitions in a 
variety of sectors, including engineering, 
furniture and food. Full ownership presents 
ITE with the opportunity to influence 
better and improve development of these 
events, particularly their international 
participation. The newly-acquired events 
together with the biennial construction 
machinery event, Ankomak realised 
volume sales this year of 1 18,100m

In India our newly acquired subsidiary 
made an excellent start with a successful 
edition of its leading event Paperex 
(December 2009: 7 ,300m
2
), a biennial 
event which serves the domestic paper 
mill industry, and Lighting South Asia 
in September 2010. The Group’s Indian 
presence is still small, but India offers an 
opportunity for significant organic growth 
as its exhibition industry is currently sub-
size for its economy. The Indian economy 
is projected to show strong growth in the 
coming years. Presently growth of the 
exhibition industry is constrained by the 
lack of suitable large international venue 
facilities. ITE is focused on the development 
LNG16, Algeria
of its portfolio of events to mirror its 
existing sector strength in readiness 
for potential venue expansion. New 
launches are planned in the Construction, 
Food and Oil and Gas sectors.
Elsewhere, ITE successfully managed 
the 16th Liquefied Natural Gas Congress 
in Oran, Algeria, despite the significant 
obstacles posed by the Icelandic volcanic 
ash cloud which prevented a number 
of speakers and delegates attending. 
The event builds on our strength of 
running events for third parties in the 
Oil and Gas sector and the Group is 
actively pursuing similar opportunities.

Strong operational  
cash flow
Revenue and gross profit 
Revenue for the year was £1 1 3.5 million 
(2009: £1 16.7 million) and gross profits  
for the year were £55.3 million (2009: 
£60.3 million). 
Administrative expenses across the 
Group increased to £25.8 million 
from £18.3 million in the previous 
year. Administrative expenses include 
significant non-cash items, including an 
amortisation charge of £5.8 million (2009: 
£4.3 million) reflecting the impact of the 
acquisitions made during the year together 
and a full-year’s charge for acquisitions 
made during 2009, a charge for share-
based payments of £1.4 million (2009: 
£1.1 million) and foreign exchange losses 
of £0.1 million (2009: gain of £3.9 million) 
arising on the translation of foreign 
currency denominated assets held by 
overseas Group companies. Excluding 
these non-cash items administrative 
expenses increased by £2.0 million 
to £19.9 million (2009: £1 7 .9 million), 
with £0.4 million being attributable to 
acquisitions made during the year and 
£0.9 million to transaction costs relating 
to completed and pending acquisitions. 
The charging of transaction costs on 
acquisitions to the profit and loss account 
results from a change in accounting rules 
with effect from the beginning of this 
financial year. Overall, Group administrative 
expenses excluding non-cash items 
represented 16% of revenue (2009: 15%).
Operating profit was £29.9 million 
against a prior year profit of £42.9 million, 
resulting in net operating margins of 
26% (2009: 37%) for the year. This result 
is distorted by significant differences in 
amortisation, foreign exchange gains 
and losses and transaction costs on 
acquisitions. After adjusting for these 
items, operating profit for this year 
is £36.8 million (2009: £43.3 million), 
yielding an operating margins of 32%. 
Headline pre-tax profit this year was 
£36.6 million (2009: £45.8 million).
Other operating income
Other operating income, £0.3 million (2009: 
£0.3 million), represents rental income 
earned from subletting surplus office 
space, principally at ITE’s London offices.
Investment revenue 
Investment income, £1.1 million (2009: 
£0.6 million), came from three primary 
sources during year. Income derived 
from interest on bank deposits, gains on 
derivative financial instruments and gains 
on the revaluation of put options. Interest 
on bank deposits decreased during the year 
to £0.3 million (2009: £0.6 million) as the 
Group held lower average cash balances 
throughout the year of £20.7 million (2009: 
£23.1 million) and the Group was exposed 
to a full year of worldwide interest rates at 
historically low levels. Gains on derivative 
financial instruments of £0.2 million (2009: 
£nil) are derived from forward contracts 
the Group uses to hedge a portion of its 
UK based international sales and gains 
on put options of £0.5 million (2009: £nil) 
represent the difference between the 
original anticipated cost of put options and 
the actual realised cost upon exercise. 
Finance costs
Finance costs of £0.6 million (2009: 
£2.1 million) represent the interest 
cost of the Group’s borrowings in 
Euro and US Dollar, bank charges and 
the loss on settlement of the Group’s 
derivative financial instruments not 
in hedging relationships of nil (2009: 
£1.7 million). The Group enters into 
currency borrowing arrangements as 
part of its currency hedging activity and 
at 30 September 2010 the Group had 
currency borrowings of €10.0 million, 
and US$2.5 million, equivalent to a total 
of £10.2 million (2009: £9.5 million).

Tax charge
The tax charge of £7 .3 million represents 
23% of profit before tax (2009: 26%). The 
reduction in the tax rate results from 
the full year effect of the lowering of 
underlying corporation tax rates within our 
main operating economies, a reduction in 
the tax charged on repatriation of overseas 
profits and the release of provisions as a 
result of agreeing prior year tax positions 
in the UK. The lower levels of underlying 
corporation tax, if sustained, will continue 
to benefit the Group’s tax rate in the future.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 10.0p 
(2009: 12.8p). Diluted earnings per 
share decreased to 9.8p (2009: 12.7p).
The Group achieved headline diluted 
earnings per share of 1 1.6p (2009: 14.2p). 
Headline diluted earnings per share are 
based upon profit for the financial year 
attributable to equity holders of the 
parent, before amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, any profits or losses 
on disposal of Group undertakings, 
revaluation of financial liabilities in 
relation to minority put options and 
transaction costs relating to completed 
and pending acquisitions and disposals.
Dividends
The Group has recommended a final 
dividend of 4.0p per share for 2010, 
to bring the total dividend for the 
year to 5.7p per share (2009: 5.5p).
Return to shareholders
ITE is committed to maximising 
shareholder return and is a leading 
performer in its sector over recent years. 
ITE is committed to a long-term progressive 
dividend policy, set against a principle 
of maintaining approximately two times 
cover across the biennial cycle. Since 2006 
the Company has increased the dividend 
from 3.5p per share to a record level of 
5.7p per share in 2010. Set out above is 
a graph showing total cash returned to 
shareholders (including the share buybacks 
in the years ended 30 September 2007 , 
2008 and 2009) against the post-tax profits 
earned by ITE over the last five years.
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations in the year 
was £49.7 million (2009: £37 .4 million). 
The principal applications of cash were 
£20.5 million applied to acquisitions 
(2009: £8.4 million), £9.2million applied 
to new venue loans and advances 
(2009: £5.4 million); £7 .4 million 
was paid in tax (2009: £1 1.9 million); 
and £1 3.3 million was distributed as 
dividends (2009: £12.6 million). The 
net decrease in cash balances over the 
year was £0.1 million, with the Group 
holding £23.0 million in net cash at 30 
September 2010 (2009: £23.1 million).
Acquisitions 
On 27 November 2009, ITE acquired 70% 
of the issued share capital of Airgate 
Holdings Limited (Airgate) for an initial cash 
consideration of €2.2 million (£2.0 million) 
and deferred consideration of £0.4 million, 
which was settled during the year. The 
Group purchased the remaining 30% of 
Airgate on 23 July 2010 for a consideration 
of €1.3 million (£1.1 million). Airgate owns 
the Group’s Indian exhibition portfolio.
On 31 December 2009, the Group acquired 
six exhibitions in Turkey which were 
formally part of its 50% Turkish associate 
ITF. As a result of the transaction the Group 
acquired assets with a value of £2.6 million, 
the consideration for which was the 50% 
shareholding the Group held in ITF.
On 1 April 2010, the Group completed the 
purchase of the remaining 25% of Primexpo 
NW, the organiser of Interstroyexpo 
(the leading St Petersburg construction 
event), for €3.4 million in cash.
On 9 April 2010, the Group acquired

of up to £1 million. This Moscow based 
business operates two exhibitions, one 
serving the meat and dairy industry 
and the other servicing infrastructure 
suppliers to the construction industry. 
On 29 April 2010, the Group acquired 100% 
of the issued share capital of Fin-mark 
S.r.l.u, an Italian company based in Bologna, 
for a net consideration of €14.3 million 
(£12.5 million) in cash. Fin-mark S.r.l.u owns 
the rights to run the Aquatherm exhibitions 
in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.
During the year the Group paid £0.7 million 
in contingent consideration in relation 
to acquisitions made in prior years. As 
at 30 September 2010 the Group has a 
deferred and contingent consideration 
liability of £1.7 million, the majority of 
which it expects to pay during 201 1.

Investment and capital expenditure
The Group’s capital expenditure on 
plant and equipment for the year was 
£1.1 million (2009: £0.4 million) and 
included exhibition equipment, office 
fixtures and fittings and computer 
equipment & associated software. 
Venue arrangements
The Group has long-term arrangements 
with its principal venues in its main 
markets setting out ITE’s rights over 
future venue use and pricing.
Expocentr is ITE’s principal venue in 
Moscow and hosts some of its largest 
exhibitions including MosBuild, Moscow 
International Oil & Gas exhibition, Moscow 
International Travel & Tourism, World 
Food Moscow, TransRussia and Moscow 
International Protection & Security 
Exhibition. ITE has an agreement with

rights to conduct its exhibitions at the 
venue on agreed rates until 201 3.
Crocus Exhibition Centre is located on 
the outskirts of Moscow city centre 
and hosts MosBuild+, Expoelectronica, 
Moscow International Motor Show and 
the Moscow International Boat Show. ITE 
has an agreement with Crocus which 
Effective tax rate 
reduced to 23% 29
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
secures the Group’s rights to conduct 
its exhibitions at the venue until 2015.
Lenexpo is located in St Petersburg and 
hosts the recently acquired Interstroyexpo 
and Baltic Building Week events. ITE has 
an agreement with Lenexpo, providing 
rights to hold its exhibitions at the 
venue on agreed rates to 2012.
Atakent Exhibition Centre is the largest 
venue in Almaty, Kazakhstan and hosts 
the Kazakhstan International Oil & Gas 
events and KazBuild exhibitions. ITE’s 
agreement with Atakent confirms its 
rights to hold its exhibitions at the 
venue on agreed rates until 201 7 .
CNR is the principal venue in Istanbul, 
located close to the City’s international 
airport, and holds all but one of the 
Group’s Turkish exhibitions. ITE has an 
agreement with CNR which secures its 
rights to conduct its exhibitions at the 
venue on agreed rates until 2014.
The International Exhibition Centre (IEC) is 
the principal venue in Kyiv and hosts all 
of the Groups Ukrainian events, including 
the newly acquired Aquatherm exhibition. 
ITE has an agreement with IEC which 
secures its rights to conduct its exhibitions 
at the venue until 2012, and is in the 
process of finalising a new agreement to 
extend those rights and rates to 2014.
The Group funds the development of 
venues and facilities where improvements 
will enhance the prospects and profitability 
of its business. The funding can take the 
form of a prepayment of future venue 
fees (‘advance payment’), or a loan 
which can be repaid by cash or by offset 
against future venue fees (‘venue loan’). 
Generally the funding brings rights over 
future venue use and advantageous 
pricing arrangements through long-term 
agreements. Venue loans and advance 
payments are included in the Balance Sheet 
under non-current and current assets.
At 30 September 2010, the Group’s Sterling 
value of the outstanding balances of 
advance payments and venue loans was 
£10.5 million (2009: £4.9 million) as follows:

and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements 30
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Operating performance and Divisional summary
For short-term debt, such as overdraft 
facilities or debt with a term of less than 
six months, fixed or floating rates of 
interest are used. For debt with a term 
of greater than six months, it is policy 
that at least 50% must have fixed rates 
of interest so as to minimise the Group’s 
exposure to interest rate movements. 
As at 30 September 2010, all of the 
Group’s borrowing requirements were 
in the form of overdraft facilities. 
It is Group policy that its cash balances 
are not invested in instruments that would 
put the capital value at risk. All invested 
funds have a determinable rate of interest.
Liquidity risk
The Group policy is to ensure continuity 
of funding for operational needs through 
cash deposits and debt facilities as 
appropriate. The key requirement for 
the business is to maintain flexibility to 
allow the Group to take advantage of 
opportunities that could arise over the 
short-term. The needs of the business 
are determined on a rolling cash flow 
forecast basis, covering weekly, monthly 
and 12 monthly requirements. Short-term 
flexibility is maintained by holding cash in 
current accounts and high liquidity money 
market funds. The Group has overdraft 
facilities in place both to permit currency 
borrowing as part of its foreign exchange 
management and to allow flexibility 
in where it holds its cash balances.
Recent events in the world financial 
markets have highlighted the risks 
associated with holding deposits in 
foreign-domiciled banks. The territories 
in which ITE operates do not all have 
internationally recognised banks and the 
Group has relationships with a number 
of domestic banks. The Group seeks to 
use the territories leading banks and to 
minimise the level of cash held in such 
banks. Of the Group’s total cash balance 
of £33.2 million as at 30 September 2010, 
74% was held in institutions with a rating 
of grade A or above and 19% in B to BBB+.
Going concern
The Group and Company’s business 
activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out 
in the CEO’s statement and Operating 
performance and Divisional summary on 
pages 14 to 25. The financial position of the 
Group and Company, its significant cash 
balance, its cash flow, liquidity position 
and absence of long-term borrowings 
are described in the finance review on 
pages 26 to 31. In addition, in the general 
information section and note 20 of the 
notes to the financial statements the 
Group and Company’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk are referred to. 
After making enquires, reviewing the Group 
and Company’s forecasts and projections 
and taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue its operations for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they have adopted 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Finance Director’s statement 
continued
was €1.16:£1 (30 September 2009: 
€1.09:£1); the exchange rate for the 
US Dollar at 30 September 2010 was 
$1.58:£1 (30 September 2009: $1.59:£1).
During the year, 72% of the Group’s sales 
were priced in Euros, 1 1% in GBP and 4% 
in US Dollars, the balance being in various 
local currencies. Overall 65% of the Group’s 
cash receipts for the period were collected 
in ‘hard’ currency (Sterling, Dollars or Euros) 
and 35% was collected in various local 
currencies, the majority being Rubles.
The Group uses derivative instruments 
and currency borrowings to protect 
itself against the effect of currency 
fluctuations on a proportion of its sales 
and its balance sheet. The Group’s policy 
on derivative instruments is that:
it will hedge no more than 75% 
of the value of anticipated hard 
currency collated sales; and
it will only enter into derivative 
transactions up to 36 months ahead.
At 30 September 2009, the Group had 
entered into forward contracts to sell 
Euros for Sterling between October 2010 
and September 201 3. The value of the 
contracts is €99.7 million at an average 
rate of €1.15:£1. These instruments are 
designated as hedging instruments.
Over the year, the Group has entered 
into currency borrowing arrangements 
to minimise its exposure to foreign 
exchange risk on trade receivables. At 30 
September 2010 the Group had borrowings 
of €10.0 million, and US$2.5 million. 
The cash balance of £23.0 million at 30 
September 2010 is net of these borrowings.
The Group finances its operations through 
cash holdings. The objective of the 
Group is to maximise investment income 
and minimise interest costs, bearing 
in mind its liquidity requirements.  31

Risks and uncertainties
The Group identifies and monitors the key risks and uncertainties affecting the Group and runs the business in a way that minimises the 
impact of such risks where possible.
Operational risks Potential impact Mitigation
Political uncertainty and 
regulatory risk
The Group’s business is principally 
carried out in Russia and the CIS. Changes 
in law or the regulatory environment 
could have an effect on some or all 
of the exhibitions of the Group. 
ITE has reduced the risk by establishing 
its business as independent Russian 
and CIS companies fully contributing 
to the local economy, and the diversity 
of businesses across sectors and 
geography provides protection for the 
longer-term prospects of the Group.
Economic instability 
reduces demand for 
exhibition space
Reduced demand for exhibition space 
would reduce the profits of exhibitions. 
ITE operates across a wide range of 
sectors and countries to minimise 
the exposure to any single market. 
ITE, through its relationships with 
venues and staff has a relatively 
flexible cost structure, allowing 
it to manage its event margins in 
the short and medium-term. 
Commercial 
relationships
The Group has key commercial 
relationships with venues which 
secure the Group’s rights to run 
its exhibitions in the future.
These key relationships are regularly 
reviewed and the Group seeks 
to maintain its exhibition rights 
for at least three years forward 
for significant exhibitions.
Venue availability
Damage to or unavailability of a 
particular venue could impact the 
Group’s short-term trading position. 
The Group carries business interruption 
insurance policies which protect 
profits on our largest 20 events 
against such an event in the short-
term. In the longer-term the Group 
seeks to maintain good relationships 
with its principal venues to ensure 
the continuance of availability.
Competitor risk
Competition has existed in ITE’s markets 
for some years. ITE faces competitive 
pressures on a market-by-market basis. 
In all of its overseas markets, ITE has 
a strong position as an international 
organiser, achieved through effective 
use of its international sales network 
and its established brands for major 
events. A single exhibition or sector 
in a market could have its prospects 
curtailed by a strong competitor 
launch; however, the breadth of 
ITE’s portfolio of events, with its 
geographic and sector diversity, 
reduce the risk of a competitive threat 
to the Group’s overall business.
People
ITE’s employees have long-standing 
relationships with customers and a 
unique knowledge of the exhibitions 
business. Loss of key staff could 
impact the short-term prospects 
of a specific event or sector.
ITE has sought to build loyalty in 
its staff by ensuring remuneration 
is competitive and through a wide 
distribution of the Group’s long-term 
incentive plans. ITE has a good record 
of retaining its key staff through both 
growth and recessionary times.
Financial risk – foreign 
currency risk 
The Group is exposed to movements in 
foreign exchange rates against Sterling 
for both trading transactions and for 
the translation of overseas operations. 
The principal exposure is to the Euro, 
which forms the basis of invoicing and 
to the Ruble which forms the base books 
of the Group’s Russian operations.
The Group seeks to minimise  
exposure by:
Protecting a certain amount 
of euro denominated sales 
with forward contracts. 
Utilising currency overdraft 
facilities to hedge foreign 
currency balance sheet assets.

Governance
Overview
The Board of ITE believes that corporate 
and social responsibility is an important 
part of the Group’s culture and that the 
adoption of good practice will have a 
positive impact on profits and increase 
the long-term value for shareholders. Due 
consideration is given to risks arising from 
social, environmental and ethical issues as 
part of an ongoing risk review process.
Social interaction
The Board of the Company is aware 
of both the benefits to its business of 
engaging with its various constituencies 
in a socially-responsible manner and the 
risks of failing to do so. As an operator 
of internationally-focused businesses 
in emerging markets, the Company 
ensures that it is culturally sensitive in its 
dealings with the local community and 
that its employment and development 
policies are non-discriminatory and 
encourage the employment of local 
nationals at all levels in the Company. 
The Company actively supports its 
employees in their support of local 
community projects. For the first time, 
the London office selected a ‘charity 
of the year’. The charity selected was 
‘Coram’ which is based in London and uses 
music therapy as a form of counselling 
for children. Amongst a number of fund 
raising initiatives, a group of staff from the 
London office donated a day of their time 
to Coram to help maintain the garden at 
the Coram centre. Approximately £5,000 
has been donated to Coram this year.
In Moscow, amounts were donated 
to the ‘Brotherhood of St Alexis’, the 
‘Give Life Foundation’ and the charity 
department of the ‘Russian Church’. 
In Kazakhstan, amounts were donated 
to ‘Akneid’ (a local charity).
In total charitable donations across the 
Group totalled over £35,000 (2009: 
£18,000).
The Group has also donated equipment 
with a value of approximately 
$10,000 to the ‘Special School for the 
Hearing Impaired’ in Uzbekistan.
The Group is looking to increase 
further the number of its offices which 
take part in charitable activities.
Employees 
Employees are selected and promoted on 
the basis of merit and ability, regardless 
of age, gender, race, religion, sexual 
orientation or disability. The Group has 
a policy of encouraging employees, 
especially those from the locations in 
emerging markets, to move around the 
offices of the Group, thus providing 
development opportunities for all staff. In 
addition, employees are assisted in their 
career development through an annual 
appraisal scheme and sponsored training 
is provided where there is a benefit to both 
the individual and the Company. All staff

in the long-term value they help to create.

a safe working environment for employees 
and exhibitors and visitors at the Group’s 
events. Each office is responsible for 
ensuring that their business operates in 
compliance with Group policies and the

relevant local health and safety legislation. 
During the year, all employees in the 
London office have had a ‘refresher’ Health 
and Safety training session. Staff from all 
regions with lead responsibility for the 
operation of the Group’s exhibitions on-site 
also attended an updated training course.
Ethics
Integrity is core to the Group’s values 
which it actively promotes in its dealings 
with employees, shareholders, customers 
and suppliers and with the authorities of 
the countries in which it operates, and 
recognises that reputation is a valuable 
and fragile asset gained over a substantial 
period. The leadership position of the 
Group’s exhibitions and the long-term 
growth of its core shows is a testament 
to the success of its practices.
The Group promotes high ethical standards 
in carrying out its business activities and 
has clear guidelines for dealing with gifts, 
hospitality, corruption, fraud and the use of 
inside information. All ITE staff are required 
to comply with the laws and regulations 
of the country in which they operate. 
The Group is a member of UFI (the 
worldwide exhibition organisers 
association) and through this, the 
attendance figures at our key exhibitions 
are audited by independent services. 
This helps to provide assurance to 
our exhibitors and visitors as to the 
standard of our exhibitions.
The Group aims to provide a high 
quality of service at all its events in 
all locations. The Group operates to a 
strict minimum quality level to ensure 
events are provided to exhibitors and 
visitors at international standards, 
irrespective of where they are held.
The Group ensures that all advertising 
and public communications avoid 
untruths or overstatements.
ITE builds a relationship with 
suppliers based on mutual trust and 
undertakes to pay suppliers on time 
and in accordance with agreed terms 
of business. All information regarding 
the relationship between the Group and 
a supplier must remain confidential.
Environment
As a media services company, the Group 
acknowledges that its business has 
an impact on the environment, albeit 
relatively minor, and ITE recognises 
the importance of following good 
environmental practice. The Company 
is aware that this is an area of increasing 
concern to employees, shareholders and 
customers alike. The Company does not 
manufacture or sell any tangible products 
and has identified the principal areas of 
environmental impact as energy use, waste 
recycling, paper & printing and travel. 
The London and Huddersfield offices 
engaged the services of ‘Carbon Smart’ 
during 2010. ‘Carbon Smart’ assessed 
these offices’ Carbon Footprint. Their 
carbon footprint was found to be 
427 tonnes CO
2
e which equated to 
3.3 tonnes of CO
2
e per employee per 
year. This compares favourably to the 
average UK employee (4 tonnes of 
CO
2
e emissions per year), however, it is 
recognised that improvements can be 
made. The London and Huddersfield 
offices have set themselves a target 
to reduce their carbon footprint by at 
least 5% over the next 12 months. 
The UK operation of the Group has been 
awarded the Carbon Smart Blue Award 
during the year, and is aiming to achieve 
the Silver award in the next 12 months. 
By identifying environmental improvements, 
we expect to see increased efficiencies 
and with that reduced costs and the 
management of environmental issues is 
part of our business strategy to create long-
term value for shareholders. The Group 
already undertakes a number of initiatives 
aimed at reducing its carbon footprint:
The Group encourages the recycling 
of waste paper and office waste and 
plans to increase the recycling rates 
and materials recycled throughout 
the Group. The Group has recently 
introduced a ‘paid-for’ waste recycling 
initiative in our London office.
The Group has installed video-
conferencing facilities at its 
London, Huddersfield, Moscow, 
St Petersburg, Kiev, Istanbul, 
Almaty and Hamburg offices to 
reduce staff travel requirements.
Computers and IT equipment are 
recycled where possible and redundant 
equipment is either sold to staff or 
given to charitable organisations. 
The Group has been reducing its 
printed materials over the last few 
years, with a greater reliance on 
electronic media for its marketing 
materials. However, catalogues and 
delegate packs are still printed and 
the Group is implementing a set of 
operating standards to be followed 
by suppliers aimed at controlling 
paper sourcing and use of materials.
The Group encourages staff to use 
public transport through offering 
season ticket loans for London staff.
The Group is taking advantage of 
recent e-communications legislation 
for communicating with shareholders 
and so will be able to reduce the 
volume of printed materials produced 
with the publication of our Annual 
Report and Interim Statement.
The Group’s activities in staging 
exhibitions and conferences do impact 
on the environment, through waste and 
natural resources usage from materials 
used in assembling exhibition stands 
and travel to exhibitions and conferences 
for exhibitors, delegates and ITE staff. 
Presently, practice in controlling waste at 
different exhibition centres varies widely 
through the different regions in which the 
Group operates. The Group follows current 
best practice in each of its markets by 
observing industry and country legislation.

5.7p (2009: 5.5p).
Capital structure
Details of the Company’s issued share capital and movements during the year are shown in note 21. The Company has one class of 
ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions 
of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 24. The Trustee of the ITE Group Share Trust is not permitted to vote on any 
unvested shares held in the trust unless expressly directed to do so by the Company. A dividend waiver is in place in respect of the 
Trustee’s holding.

The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. No amendments

Board and terms of reference for Board Committees, copies of which are available on request, and the Corporate Governance Statement 
can be found on pages 40 to 43.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as commercial 
contracts, bank facility agreements, property lease arrangements and employees’ share plans. None of these are considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees that provide compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid.

Authority to purchase the Company’s shares
At the Annual General Meeting on 28 January 2010, shareholders authorised the Company to make one or more market purchases of up to 
24,812,270 of the Company’s ordinary shares to be held in treasury at a price between 1p (exclusive of expenses) and 105% of the average 
middle market price of a share for the five business days immediately preceding the date on which the share is purchased. 
No purchases were made during the year and the Directors propose to renew this authority at the 201 1 Annual General Meeting.
Donations
The Group made £35,000 of charitable donations (2009: £18,168) during the year. No political donations were made (2009: Nil).
Employees
The Group’s human resources strategy is to attract and retain talented, high-calibre employees focused on achieving excellent results. The 
Remuneration policy is designed to achieve this aim.
The Group places great importance in the development of its staff to support the business in meeting its objectives. This is reflected in the 
training initiatives in place for staff, both internally and externally. The Group keeps employees informed on matters affecting them and 
on matters affecting the Group’s performance through regular newsletters and through meetings, both formal and informal. Employees 
are able and are encouraged to move around the Group in order to experience the business environment in other offices. The Group 
actively encourages the participation of employees in activities of offices other than their own. The Group distributes long-term incentives 
widely to staff in all offices. At 30 September 2010 approximately 50% of staff held long-term incentives in some form. As a result, the 
Group’s employees identify strongly with ITE’s overall objectives. 
It is the Group’s policy to consider fully applications for employment by disabled persons, bearing in mind a number of factors including 
their suitability and fit for the role, irrespective of any disability. In the event of a member of staff becoming disabled, every effort would 
be made to ensure their continued employment and progression in the Group. It is Group policy that training, career development and 
promotion of disabled employees match that of other employees as far as possible.

Supplier payment policy
The Company’s policy, which is also applied to the Group, is to agree payment terms with suppliers when entering into each transaction to

Directors’ report continued 39
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under Company 
law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors: 
properly select and apply accounting policies;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
Overview
Operating performance  
and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements 40
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Governance
Combined Code compliance
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance and supports the principles laid down in the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2008 (‘the Combined Code’). This statement describes how the 
principles of the Combined Code are applied and reports on the Company’s compliance with the Code’s provisions.
The Directors consider that the Company has been in compliance with the provisions of the Code throughout the financial year under 
review and to the date of this report. 
The Board
The Board of Directors (‘the Board’) currently has seven members, comprising the Non-executive Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance 
Director, an additional Executive Director, and three further independent Non-executive Directors. All of the Directors bring strong 
judgement to the Board’s deliberations. The Board is of sufficient size and diversity that the balance of skills and experience is considered 
to be appropriate for the requirements of the business. The Non-executive Directors are all independent of management and free from 
any business or other relationship, including those relationships and circumstances referred to in provision A.3.1 of the Combined Code 
that could materially interfere with the exercise of independent and objective judgement. The Company considers that the Chairman was 
independent on appointment. The Non-executive Directors were all appointed for an initial three-year term and, thereafter, subject to 
satisfactory performance, may serve one or two additional three-year terms, with a thorough review of their continued independence and 
suitability to continue as Directors if they are to remain on the Board for more than nine years.
The Chairman and Chief Executive
The different roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are acknowledged. A responsibility statement for each of those roles has been 
agreed and adopted by the Board. 
Senior Independent Non-executive Director
The senior independent Non-executive Director, Michael Hartley, is available to shareholders if they have concerns which are not resolved 
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director or for which such contact is inappropriate. 
The Directors
The biographical details of the Board members are set out on pages 34 and 35. The Directors have all occupied, or occupy, senior 
positions in UK and/or non-UK listed companies and have substantial experience in business. The Non-executive Directors do not 
participate in any of the Group’s pension schemes or in any of the Group’s bonus, share option or other incentive schemes. At all times 
there has been a majority of Non-Executive independent Directors on the Board, in compliance with Code provision A.3.2. All Directors 
must stand for election at the first AGM after they are appointed and the Articles of Association provide that all Directors will stand for 
re-election at least every three years. However, the Board has decided to adopt early the recommendations of the Financial Reporting 
Council that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to annual re-election and all the Directors will offer themselves for re-election 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the proper management of the Company. The Board normally meets not less than seven times 
each financial year and has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision making, including responsibility for the overall 
management and performance of the Group and the approval of its long-term objectives and commercial strategy, approval of annual and 
interim results, annual budgets, material acquisitions and disposals, material agreements and major capital commitments, approval of 
treasury policies, and assessment of its going concern position.
Board members receive appropriate documentation in advance of each Board or Committee meeting which normally includes a detailed 
report on current trading and full papers on matters where the Board will be required to make a decision or give its approval. 
There is an established procedure for the preparation and review, at least annually, by the Board of medium-term plans and the annual 
budget. The business reports monthly on its performance against its agreed budget. The Board receives a monthly update on 
performance and reviews any significant variances. All major investment decisions are subject to post-completion reviews.
During the year the Chairman met with the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors present. 
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover, is provided by the Company, in line with normal market practice, for the benefit of Directors in 
respect of claims arising in the performance of their duties. 
Board performance evaluation
The formal annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors was undertaken before the year 
end. This consisted of an internally run exercise led by the Chairman with the assistance of the Company Secretary. The appraisal 
questionnaire used in connection with the process was wide-ranging and included questions outlined in the Combined Code, covering 
both Board and Committee performance.
The appraisal output is used to identify strengths and development areas and confirmed that the Board and its Committees were 
operating effectively. Individual performance was also appraised, based on one-to-one interviews with the Chairman, or in the case of the 
Chairman, with the Senior Independent Director following consultation with both the other Non-executive Directors and the Executive 
Directors. 
Corporate governance report 41
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Independent professional advice
The Board has approved a procedure for Directors to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, if necessary. No 
such advice was sought by any Director during the year. In addition, the Directors have direct access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary.
Training and development
An induction programme is arranged for newly appointed Directors and includes presentations from senior management on the business, 
as well as guidance on their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of a listed company. Business familiarisation involves 
Directors visiting exhibitions in markets in which the Group operates to gain a greater understanding of the Group’s activities and to meet 
senior managers throughout the business. Every Director has access to training as required and is encouraged to continue his own 
development. 
Conflicts of interest 
The Company’s Articles of Association were amended at the 2009 AGM, in line with the Companies Act 2006, to allow the Board to 
authorise potential conflicts of interest that may arise and to impose limits or conditions, as appropriate. The Company has established a 
procedure whereby any decision of the Board to authorise a conflict of interest is only effective if it is agreed without the conflicted 
Directors voting or without their votes being counted and in making such a decision, as always, the Directors must act in a way they 
consider in good faith will be most likely to promote the success of the Company. 
Board Committees 
There are a number of standing Committees of the Board to which various matters are delegated. The Committees all have formal Terms 
of Reference that have been approved by the Board which are available on the Group’s website (www.ite-exhibitions.com). Details are set 
out below:
The Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee comprises Neil England, Michael Hartley and Malcolm Wall and is chaired by Iain Paterson. It meets as 
necessary and is responsible for considering and recommending to the Board persons who are appropriate for appointment as Executive 
and Non-executive Directors. There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board 
which involves the Nomination Committee interviewing suitable candidates proposed by either existing Board members or by an external 
search company. Careful consideration is given to ensure appointees have enough time available to devote to the role and that the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board is maintained. When dealing with the appointment of a successor to the Chairman, the 
senior independent Non-executive Director will chair the Committee instead of the Chairman. When the Committee has found a suitable 
candidate, the Chairman of the Committee will make a proposal to the whole Board and the appointment is the responsibility of the whole 
Board following recommendation from the Committee.
The Committee met three times during the year. Its principal activities were:
Reviewing the size and composition of the Board including the mix of skills and experience
Succession Planning for the Board and senior management
Considering the responses to the questionnaire used for the annual evaluation of the Board and its Committees, prior to review by the 
whole Board.
The Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises Neil England, Michael Hartley and Iain Paterson, and is chaired by Malcolm Wall. The committee 
met five times this year. Full details of its activities and of Directors’ remuneration are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 44 to 48. Those pages detail compliance with the legal requirements with regard to remuneration matters. 
The Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee comprises Neil England and Malcolm Wall and is chaired by Michael Hartley. The Board is satisfied that Michael 
Hartley has appropriate financial expertise to fulfil this role. 
The role of the Audit Committee is to monitor the financial reporting process, the integrity of the Group’s interim and annual financial 
statements prior to their submission to the Board and the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts. It is also responsible  
for reviewing the Group’s internal financial control and risk management systems, advising the Board on the appointment of external 
auditors, overseeing the relationship with the external auditors, approving auditor remuneration, reviewing the Group’s whistle blowing 
procedures, reviewing accounting policies and compliance, and monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal  
audit function.
The Committee met four times during the year. On each occasion the Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, and other members  
of staff, as required, attended by invitation. The external auditors attended all four meetings. Significant areas of work covered by the 
Audit Committee included:
Reviewing the Group’s final and interim financial statements; 
Reviewing results from audits undertaken and progress against the internal audit plan;
Identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the Group; and 
Reviewing the Group’s internal control environment and its effectiveness.

Governance
The Audit Committee regularly monitors the relationship with the auditors and assesses their performance, cost-effectiveness, objectivity 
and independence. It agrees the scope of the audit work and discusses the results of the full-year audit and interim review each year. At 
each Audit Committee meeting the external auditors were able to meet with the Committee without management being present.
It is a specific responsibility of the Audit Committee to ensure that an appropriate relationship is maintained between the Group and its 
auditors. The Group has a policy of controlling the provision of non-audit services by the external auditors in order to maintain their 
independence and ensure that their objectivity and independence are safeguarded. This control is exercised by ensuring non-audit 
projects, where fees are expected to exceed £50,000, are subject to the prior approval of the Chairman of the Audit Committee. In 
addition, where a proposed service is outside the normal scope of non-audit services, the engagement must be approved in advance by 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee. In awarding work for non-audit services, the Group takes into account a range of factors including 
quality of service, cost effectiveness, and historic knowledge of the business or sector. The Committee has scrutinised the internal 
procedures of Deloitte LLP and satisfied itself that the independence and objectivity of the auditors are not affected by the non-audit work 
undertaken. 
Internal audit function 
The Group engages KPMG to perform internal control audits at its main offices. This work is co-ordinated by the Head of Internal Controls 
and Procedures who reports KPMG’s findings directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee considers the Group to have an 
effective independent internal audit function.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness.  
In discharging that responsibility, the Board confirms that it has established the procedures necessary to apply the Combined Code, 
including clear operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority, which are reviewed regularly.
Business performance is managed closely and the Board has established processes, as part of the normal good management of the 
business, to monitor:
Strategic plan achievement, through a regular review of progress towards strategic objectives;
Financial performance, within a comprehensive financial planning and accounting framework, including budgeting and forecasting, 
financial reporting, analysing variances against plan, exchange rate volatility, and taking appropriate management action;
Capital investment and asset management performance, with detailed appraisal, authorisation and post-investment reviews; and
Principal risks and risk management processes, which accords with the Turnbull guidance, and that the significant risks faced by the 
Group are being identified, evaluated and appropriately managed, having regard to the balance of risk, cost and opportunity. 
Risk management process
There is in place an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, which has 
operated throughout the financial year. These are reviewed by the Board at each meeting and also in detail by the Audit Committee once a 
year. The risk framework governs the management and control of both financial and non-financial risks. The adoption of this policy 
throughout the Group enables a consistent approach to the management of risk at both regional and business unit level.
In addition, during the financial year, the Audit Committee received:
Reports from the Head of Internal Controls and Procedures on the work carried out under the annual internal audit plan; 
Risk management reports, including the status of actions to mitigate major risks and the quantification of selected risks; and,
Reports from the external Auditors.
Through the monitoring processes set out above, the Board conducted a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control 
during the financial year. The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. In that context, the review, 
in the opinion of the Board, did not indicate that the system was ineffective or unsatisfactory and the Board is not aware of any change to 
this status up to the approval of this report.

ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Governance
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the Combined Code 
(with due account also taken of the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code). As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the 
report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ remuneration report and to state 
whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. This report 
has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) are the Group’s four Non-executive Directors, Malcolm Wall (Chairman), 
Michael Hartley, Iain Paterson and Neil England. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
recommending to the Board the remuneration and terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman (who absents himself from 
discussions regarding his own remuneration), Executive Directors and key members of senior management; 
measuring subsequent performance as a prelude to determining the Executive Directors’ and key managers’ total remuneration on 
behalf of the whole Board; and
granting awards under the ITE Group’s Performance Share Plans and options under the various ITE Group Share Option Schemes 
outlined below. 
During the year, the Committee consulted with Hewitt New Bridge Street for advice on executive remuneration and the operation of the 
various ITE Group share schemes. Hewitt New Bridge Street has provided no other services to the Company.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Company’s corporate website.
Remuneration policy 
The Company’s principal remuneration policy aim is to ensure that compensation offered is appropriate to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and staff with the ability and experience to deliver the Company’s strategy and grow the business, having regard to 
the prevailing economic conditions and competition for such people in the markets in which the Company operates. 
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to and balances the following factors:
a) the remuneration packages offered to executives in companies competing in the same markets as the Company;
b) the remuneration practice in the markets in which the executive is principally based;
c) the need to align the interests of the executive with those of the shareholders;
d) the performance of the individual executive and of the Company as a whole; and
e) any amounts payable to executives in respect of services performed for the associates of the Company.
The Committee Chairman liaises with the Group’s independent remuneration adviser and others to ensure that pay and employment 
conditions in the Group as a whole are taken into account (in determining salary levels, benefits, pension provision, bonus payments and 
long-term incentive opportunity) when framing the executive remuneration policy.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the 
incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance risks by 
inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not 
encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
In addition, the Committee regularly reviews the executive remuneration policy to ensure that it takes due account of market practice, 
best practice and the specific circumstances of the Company.
The remuneration packages of the executives comprise base salary and benefits, a performance-related bonus and longer-term share-
based incentive arrangements. A significant proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration is, therefore, performance related. 
Policy criteria for various components 
Base salary 
Base salary levels are reviewed annually by the Committee taking into account each Executive Director’s role, experience, performance 
and the markets in which they perform their duties. The base salaries for Russell Taylor and Neil Jones, and the consultancy remuneration 
for Edward Strachan are regularly reviewed and are subject to benchmarking exercises against industry and sector comparators.
During the year under review, Russell Taylor’s base salary was increased to £380,000 p.a. from 1 February 2010, Edward Strachan’s base 
salary and consultancy fees to Kyzyl Tan Consultants Limited was increased to £380,000 p.a. from 1 April 2010, and Neil Jones’ base 
salary was increased to £220,000 p.a. from 1 October 2010. Russell Taylor’s remuneration had not been increased since his appointment 
as CEO in May 2008 and Edward Strachans’ remuneration had not been increased since 1 October 2008. Neil Jones’ remuneration was last 
reviewed on 1 November 2009. 
Report on remuneration 45
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The Committee believes that the Company’s strong performance, the importance of Messrs Taylor and Strachan to the Company’s 
success, and mindful that these rates of increase are broadly reflective of the salary increase throughout the Company, makes these 
increases appropriate. Mr Jones’ salary has been independently benchmarked by Hewitt New Bridge Street.
Details of the Executive Directors’ base salaries for the year commencing 1 October 2010 are also set out under ‘Directors’ service 
contracts’ on page 46 of this report.
Variable bonus
The Executive Directors and certain senior management participate in performance-related annual bonus schemes (“Executive Bonus 
Plan”), which recognise Company objectives to deliver growth of headline profit before tax. For the financial year commencing 1 October 
2010, Russell Taylor’s and Neil Jones’ maximum annual bonus opportunity provided under the Executive Bonus Plan will be 100% and 80% 
of base salary respectively. Neil Jones’ maximum annual bonus potential has been increased from 65% to 80% to align him more closely to 
a market competitive rate. Edward Strachan’s annual bonus opportunity through the Company’s consultancy agreement with Kyzyl Tan 
Consultants Limited (‘Kyzyl Tan’) is on a similar basis to the Executive Bonus Plan, and for the financial year commencing 1 October 2010 
is capped at 100% of the Kyzyl Tan consultancy fee and his remuneration as a Director. The maximum bonus potential for Mr Taylor, Mr 
Strachan and Mr Jones is split between financial targets (80% of potential) and personal targets (20% of potential). For the financial year 
ending 30 September 2010, a bonus equating to 100% of the maximum bonus opportunity will be paid to the Executive Directors under 
the Executive Bonus Plan, reflecting a year in which financial targets for headline profit before tax were exceeded together with the 
delivery of a number of the Group’s strategic objectives.
Long-term incentives 
In recent years the Company has operated Performance Share Plans and Share Option Schemes as its share-based arrangements. 
Performance Share Plans
The Company has operated the ITE Group plc Employees Performance Share Plan 2004 and the ITE Group plc Key Contractors’ 
Performance Share Plan 2004. Awards can be made to executives and senior management over shares worth up to 100% of base salary 
each year, and under the latter scheme to key individuals who are not Group employees. 
Awards were granted in February 2010 to Executive Directors up to 100% of salary subject to aggregate three year headline earnings per 
share targets. Further information regarding these targets can be found on page 48.
This performance condition was chosen by the Committee to incentivise management to deliver sustained headline earnings per share 
performance over the relevant three year period. The targets are based upon a compound rate of growth in headline diluted earnings per 
share calculated to take account of the Company’s biennial business cycle. The 30% award target is based upon a 5.5% compound increase 
in diluted earnings per share, and the 100% award target is based upon a 1 1.5% compound increase in diluted headline earnings per share. 
The targets are calculated for each of the three performance years, taking account of any material events which are not annually recurring 
and aggregated into an ‘Aggregated headline diluted earnings per share target’.
In line with past practice, it is proposed that awards for the year commenced 1 October 2010 be made to Executive Directors in January 
201 1, and that these be subject to aggregate three year headline diluted earnings per share targets as follows: below 40p, 0% of the award 
will vest; at 40p, 30% of the award will vest, and at 45p, 100% of the award will vest. Between 30% and 100% vesting will be calculated on a 
straight line basis.
Shareholding guidelines
Executive Directors are required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards under the 
Plans, until they have built up a shareholding of a value equivalent to at least 100% of annual base salary. Further details of Directors’ 
interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are set out on page 37 of this report.
Share option plans
The Company has operated the ITE Group plc 2009 Discretionary Share Option Scheme. It is not intended that the Executive Directors will 
participate in the 2009 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
Pensions 
The Company offers a stakeholder pension to its employees but currently makes no Company contribution under this scheme. 
Since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in May 2008, the Company makes a contribution equal to 10% of Russell Taylor’s base 
salary to his personal pension scheme. 
Directors’ service contracts 
Executive Directors
Russell Taylor (Chief Executive) and Neil Jones (Finance Director) have UK contracts of employment which reflect market and best practice 
for senior management serving in the UK and have no fixed term. Notice periods and base salary details for all Directors are outlined in 
the tables set out below. Other than the contribution to Russell Taylor’s pension scheme described above, there are no contributions to 
pension schemes. The standard terms provide for medical insurance and life insurance but provide for no other benefits in kind such as 
Company cars.

Governance
In the event of early termination of an Executive Director’s contract, it is the Committee’s policy that (subject to the provisions of each 
contract) the amount of compensation (if any) paid to the Executive Director will be determined by reference to the relevant circumstances 
that prevail at the time. The Committee’s objective will be to avoid rewarding poor performance. Furthermore, the Committee will take 
account of the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate their loss.
Edward Strachan’s remuneration as a Director from 1 October 2010 is £37 ,000. In addition, Edward Strachan is remunerated as a 
consultant through the Company’s agreement with Kyzyl Tan. This contract with Kyzyl Tan is due to expire on 31 March 201 1 when it will 
be renewed, subject to renegotiation. The base consultancy fee under this agreement for the year commencing 1 October 2010 is 
£343,000. Kyzyl Tan is entitled to a bonus based upon the same targets and criteria as the Executive Bonus Scheme, which is capped at 
100% of Kyzyl Tan’s base consultancy fee and Edward Strachan’s remuneration as a Director. Under the Kyzyl Tan contract, Edward 
Strachan is required to reside in the markets where his management responsibilities are based and Kyzyl Tan is entitled to an annual living 
away from home allowance of up to $60,000 for its employee.
Consistent with market practice, there are no service contracts or other employment arrangements with any of the Executive Directors 
with fixed terms or notice periods in excess of one year or terms which would expose the Company to compensation payments in excess 
of one year’s total remuneration.
The dates of each contract, the relevant notice period and base salary for 2010-201 1 are as follows:
Name Date of contract
Notice 
period
Base salary 
2010-201 1

Edward Strachan through Kyzyl Tan Consultants Ltd 25 November 2010 6 months £343,000 April 
Non-executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are entitled to one month’s written notice to terminate their Letters of Appointment but no 
further rights to compensation payments on termination. The effective dates of their Letters of Appointment are as follows: Iain Paterson, 
27 May 2002; Michael Hartley, 20 October 2003; Malcolm Wall, 4 May 2006; and Neil England, 18 March 2008. 
The Non-executive Directors’ fees were subject to an independent benchmarking exercise against relevant comparators, taking account of 
their time commitment and responsibilities. Accordingly, the fees for the year commencing 1 October 2010 for Michael Hartley will be 
£43,500, for Malcolm Wall £43,500 and for Neil England £38,500. Iain Paterson’s fees will be £123,000. 
Executive Directors may accept outside appointments with the prior approval of the Board and provided only that these appointments do 
not prejudice the individual’s ability to fulfill their duties at the Company. Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or 
remitted to the Company will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Group undertakings, revaluation of financial liabilities in relation to minority put options and direct costs relating to completed acquisitions and disposals.
(1) For the Long-term PSP awards granted in June/August 2009 that are exercisable from 31 December 201 3 to 30 December 2019, there 
are two performance targets applying. Half of the Award is subject to a Performance Target based on the Group’s absolute earnings 
per share during the 2012/1 3 Financial Year as follows:
EPS for the 2012/2013 Financial Year Percentage of one half of award that vests
Below 14p Nil
14p 25%
Between 14p and 1 7p Between 25% and 100% calculated on a straight line basis.

The other half of the Award is subject to a Performance Target comparing the Company’s Total Shareholder Return against the FTSE 
All-Share Media Sector between 1 June 2009 and 31 December 201 3. 25% of this portion of the award vests if ITE is at the median, with full 
vesting for upper quartile performance. Between median and upper quartile, an award vests on a straight line basis between 25% and 
100% based on rankings plus interpolation between intermediate rankings.
The cost of all share awards charged to the profit and loss account for the year ended 30 September 2010 was £1.4 million (2009: 
£1.1 million). 
The ITE share incentive plans operate within a standard 10% in ten year dilution limit. This provision takes account of all potentially dilutive 
awards made by the Company under any of its share incentive plans. This is because (as with other London Stock Exchange companies) 
the Company does not operate any form of share incentive on an all employee basis and therefore does not have an internal dilution limit 
of 5% in ten years for discretionary schemes. The Committee continues to be of the view that this approach, which has been previously 
agreed with shareholders, remains appropriate and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate to introduce a dilution limit that relates to 
awards under discretionary/executive schemes only. However, the Committee will keep the dilutive impact of the share incentive schemes 
under regular view to ensure that the interests of shareholders are taken into account.
The maximum number of additional (i.e. in addition to the existing 1 3,678,649 in issue) new share issues possible under the ten year 
dilution limits in the option trust deeds is 1 1,153,321. Additionally the Employee’s Share Trust (ESOT) can hold up to 5% of the Company’s 
issued share capital against share awards.

ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
We have audited the group financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2010 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 25. The financial reporting framework  
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 30 September 2010 and of its profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the directors’ statement contained within the Corporate Governance Section in relation to going concern; and
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of ITE Group Plc for the year ended 30 September 2010 and on 
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated accounts
For the year ended 30 September 2010
General information
ITE Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is given on page 94. The nature of 
the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Divisional summary on pages 18 to 25 and in note 1. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
Impact of new accounting standards
IFRS 8, Operating Segments
IFRS 8 sets out disclosure requirements concerning an entity’s reportable segments, products, services, geographical areas in which it 
operates and its major customers. IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14, Segmental Reporting. The Group has not been significantly impacted by the 
adoption of this standard, see note 1 for further details. 
Amendment to IFRS 3, Business Combinations (revised 2008) and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 
(revised 2008)
The most significant changes to the Group’s previous accounting policies for business combinations are as follows:
Acquisition related costs which previously would have been included in the cost of a business combination are included in 
administrative expenses as they are incurred;
Any pre-existing equity interest in the entity acquired is remeasured to the fair value at the date of obtaining control, with any resulting 
gain or loss recognised in income statement; 
Any changes in the Group’s ownership interest subsequent to the date of obtaining control are recognised directly in equity, with no 
adjustment to goodwill; and
Any changes to the cost of an acquisition, including contingent consideration, resulting from events after the date of acquisition are 
recognised in income statement. Previously, such changes resulted in an adjustment to goodwill. 
The revised standards have been applied to the acquisitions set out in note 10. 
Any adjustments to contingent consideration for acquisitions made prior to 1 October 2009 which result in an adjustment to goodwill 
continue to be accounted for under IFRS 3(2004) and IAS 27(2005). 
£860,000 of transaction costs relating to completed and pending acquisitions made in the period have been expensed that would 
previously have been capitalised on the balance sheet (see note 4). 
Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements
This amendment introduces changes to the way in which movements in equity must be disclosed and requires an entity to disclose each 
component of other comprehensive income not recognised in profit and loss. The amendment also requires disclosure of the amount of 
income and deferred tax relating to each component of other comprehensive income as well as other minor disclosure amendments. 
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the year ended 30 September 2010, and 
these have been adopted but have had no impact on the 2010 Group financial statements:
IFRIC 1 7 ‘Distribution of Non-Cash Assets to Owners’ 
IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of Assets to Customers’
The following interpretations have been issued which are not applicable to the Group since they are only effective for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2010. These are also not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial 
statements:
IFRIC 14 ‘Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement’
IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing liabilities with equity instruments’
Basis of accounting
ITE Group plc is a UK-listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as ‘the Group’. The Company is 
required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by 
the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. In addition, the Group 
has complied with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). 
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses. These estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time and are used to make judgements about 
the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from other sources. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions are reflected in 
the financial statements in the period in which they are made.  59
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future as disclosed in the Directors report on page 36. 
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, except for the 
revaluation of financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company drawn up to 30 
September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost 
of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at 
the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the 
minority interest in excess of the non-controlling interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interest’s in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-
controlling interest’s consist of the amount of those interests as at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling 
interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of their 
interest in the subsidiaries equity are allocated against the interest’s of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding 
obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of 
acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of 
contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in 
the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair 
value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. 
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3(2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during 
the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date – and is subject to a maximum of one year.

Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the 
carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and 
then to other assets of the unit, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss  
on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has 
elected to treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets.
Intangible assets
Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost, acquired trademarks, brands and customer lists are measured at fair value. 
Computer software, trademarks, brands and customer lists have a definite useful life and are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. The estimated 
useful lives are typically between three and seven years, with some trademarks having an estimated useful life of up to 20 years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite 
useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment 
loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the 
following bases:
Leasehold improvements – term of lease
Fixture and fittings – ten years
Plant and equipment – four years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income. 61
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets 
of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of Group’s interest in that 
associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are 
recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of 
acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for 
impairment as part of that investment. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable 
net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case an appropriate provision is 
made for impairment.
Venue advances
Where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either off-setting against future venue hire or by cash 
repayment, the fair value is recognised based on the discounted value of future cash receipts. The loan balance is subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate method’. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in 
profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are recognised at cost as 
prepayments in venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted to 
present value where the effect is material.
Financial instruments
Classes of financial instruments
The Group aggregates its financial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics. The details of financial instruments 
by class are disclosed in note 20 to the accounts.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and derivative 
assets at fair value through profit or loss. The classification is determined by management upon initial recognition, and is based on the 
purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  
the instrument. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its financial assets are to be impaired. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement where there is objective evidence of impairment. Financial assets are derecognised (in full or partly) when the Group’s 
rights to cash flows from the respective assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has neither exposure to the risks 
inherent in those assets nor entitlement to rewards from them.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are 
measured at initial recognition at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value with all 
realised gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of 
cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement.

Financial statements
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
This category includes the following classes of financial assets: trade and other receivables and venue advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is 
impaired. The estimates are based on specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical bad receivables experience. No interest is 
charged on the loans and receivables, due to either their short-term nature or specific arrangements in place, and hence the effective 
interest rate method is not applied. 
Derivative assets
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or little net initial 
investment and is settled at a future date. Derivative assets are classified as at fair value through profit or loss. Derivative assets are 
measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting 
gains and losses recognised in the income statement. These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Group’s risk management 
policies.
Financial liabilities 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: bank borrowings, trade and other payables held at amortised cost 
and derivative liabilities through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. 
Written put options
Any contract with a single or multiple settlement option that contains an obligation for the Group to purchase equity in a subsidiary for 
cash gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the repurchase price. An amount equal to the liability is recorded in equity on 
initial recognition of a written put option. The liability is subsequently remeasured through the income statement.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted 
for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not 
settled in the period in which they arise. Where bank overdrafts are deemed to be integral to the Group’s cash management activities, they 
are presented within net cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement. Overdrafts that are considered to be financing in nature 
are presented as financing activities in the cash flow statement.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade payables are 
derecognised in full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it expires, is cancelled or replaced by a new liability with 
substantially modified terms. Trade and other payables are short-term and there is no interest charged in connection with these, hence the 
effective interest method is not applied.
Derivative liabilities
A derivative is a financial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or little net initial 
investment and is settled at a future date. 
Derivative liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss. Derivative liabilities are measured at initial recognition at fair value 
and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income 
statement. 
These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Group’s risk management policies.
Hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group uses derivative financial 
instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the derivative is 
designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on the 
nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. A derivative is presented 
as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected 
to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
For the year ended 30 September 2010 63
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. At the inception of the hedge and 
on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in the fair values of cash flows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured 
to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and 
qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
income statement, and is included in ‘Finance income/cost’ in the income statement. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the 
income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, in the same line of the income statement 
as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains 
in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group’s use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s financial policies. Further details on these policies can be found in the 
Divisional summary on pages 18 to 25. 
Fair values
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between 
informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The Group determines the fair value of its financial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely accepted valuation 
techniques for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cash flows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer quotes for similar 
instruments and use of comparable arm’s length transactions.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net of 
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is recognised on completion of an event. Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs relating to future 
events are deferred. The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income and prepaid event costs 
respectively. Losses anticipated at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions
Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, revenues and costs 
are recognised in the income statement. 
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after the share of results of associates and profit or loss on disposal of Group undertakings and before 
investment income and finance costs. 
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by 
the balance sheet date. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the  
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the tax  
profit or the accounting profit.
Overview
Operating performance  
and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements 64
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Financial statements
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual rate where 
applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was 
determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and losses 
arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in income for the period. Exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in income for the period except for 
differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity. For 
such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Group’s accounting policies for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance 
sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, 
unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transaction are used. 
Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are 
recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 (the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates), cumulative translation differences for all 
foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero. Consequently, any gain or loss on disposal will exclude translation 
differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate.
Employee Share Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company held by the ESOT 
have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity 
holders.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied IFRS 2 (share-based payment). IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 
that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of 
non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest 
and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on 
such a basis. Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by management 
and have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-generating units to 
which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected 
from the cash-generating unit to perpetuity and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The period used in the 
calculation is based on management’s average expectation of the period over which the value will be derived from the cash-generating 
units. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 September 2010 is £50.6 million and £28.8 million respectively.
Intangible assets
The valuation of intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future cash flows arising from 
customer relationships and trademarks to determine the value of those intangible assets. This involves estimating the period over which 
the customer relationships and trademarks affect future cash flows.
Share-based payments 
The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of 
grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. The key assumptions used in 
calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Group’s share price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free rate of return, and 
expected option lives. Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest; this is 
dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
Taxation 
Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a tax structure which makes the degree of 
estimation and judgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is often dependent 
on the efficiency of legal processes. Such issues can take several years to resolve. The Group takes a considered view of unresolved 
issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the 
accounting estimates and therefore impact the Group’s results and future cash flows.

IFRS 8 introduces the term Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The Executive Board comprising the Executive Directors (Russell 
Taylor (Chief Executive Officer), Neil Jones (Financial Director), Edward Strachan (Executive Director)), Stephen Keen, Alexander Shtalenkov, 
Colette Tebbutt and Suzanne King is considered to be the CODM.
ITE’s reportable segments are strategic business units that are based in different geographic locations, predominantly in the developing 
and emerging markets. Each business unit is managed separately and has a different marketing strategy as determined by the local 
management. The products and services offered by each business unit are identical across the Group. 
ITE Group evaluates performance on the basis of profit or loss from operations before tax expense not including non-recurring gains and 
losses and foreign exchange gains and losses.
The revenue and profit before taxation are attributable to the Group’s one principal activity, the organisation of trade exhibitions, 
conferences and related activities and can be analysed by geographic segment as follows.

10 Goodwill acquired through business combinations
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
2010  
£000
2009  
£000
UK & Western Europe 14,850 10,873
Central Asia & Caucasus 7,437 7,400
Russia 23,231 23,298
Eastern & Southern Europe 3,794 3,048
Rest of the World 1,272 –
50,584 44,619
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in 
use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cash flows during the period. Management 
estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to 
the cash-generating units. The growth rates are based on management forecasts. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based upon the 
most recent financial plans approved by the Board and extrapolates the planned cash flows. Assumed growth rates based on GDP growth 
rates in the local markets and management judgements have been applied for the first three years beyond the detailed plans and a rate of 
3% is applied thereafter. These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for our business in the relevant markets.
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
For the year ended 30 September 2010 71
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
10 Goodwill acquired through business combinations continued
The discount rates applied to the cash-generating units are between 10% and 14%.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and growth rates used. Management believes that no reasonable 
potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
The principal share acquisitions made during the year to 30 September 2010, accounted for under acquisition method, were:

The values used in accounting for the identifiable assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are provisional in nature at balance sheet date. 
If necessary adjustments will be made to these carrying values and the related goodwill, within 12 months of the acquisition date. The 
goodwill arising on acquisition of £4.0 million represents significant expected synergies with other operations of the Group and the 
complementarity achieved with the Group’s existing emerging market strategy.

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2009, there would have been no difference to amount contributed to Group revenue. Profit 
before tax would have remained at £2.0 million. 
Acquisition of Global Expo
On 9 April 2010, the Group completed the purchase of the exhibition assets of Global Expo, a Russian exhibition company based in 
Moscow, which organises the annual Moscow events Meat and Diary expo and CityBuild. The Group paid an initial consideration of 
£1.1 million, with a further payment of circa £1 million due in March 201 1 dependent on the performance of the next editions of 
these events. 
Acquisition of exhibitions in Turkey
On 31 December 2009, ITE has completed its exit from ITF, its 50% associate venture in Turkey by acquiring half of the associate’s events 
for its own portfolio and selling its shareholding in the associate to its former joint shareholder. 
The following exhibitions were acquired;
IMOB, an international furniture exhibition, held annually in Istanbul
Promoturk, an exhibition for corporate gifts, stationery and the giftware market held annually in Istanbul
Ipack, a specialised exhibition for packaging and food processing systems held annually in Istanbul
Gida, an International food products and processing technologies exhibition held annually in Istanbul
Time, a manufacturing technologies exhibition, held in Istanbul
Tatef, an International metalworking technologies exhibition held every two years in Istanbul
The assets acquired are set out in the table below:
£000
Intangible fixed assets 2,583
Sundry debtors 158
Loans and advances 1,083
Current liabilities (1,241)
Net assets acquired 2,583
The fair value of the assets acquired is £2.6 million and consideration for these was the 50% shareholding the Group held in ITF. This 
shareholding was previously held on the Group’s books at a value of £1.2 million and as such gives rise to a gain on disposal of £1.4 million. 
After deducting the respective deferred tax liability, a gain on disposal of £0.8 million was recognised; this is shown on the face of the 
income statement. 
No cash was transferred as part of the transaction.
Acquisition of 25% of Primexpo (the organiser of Interstroyexpo)
On 1 April 2010, the Group completed the purchase of the remaining 25% of Primexpo, the organiser of Interstroyexpo (the leading 
St Petersburg construction event) for €3.4 million paid in cash.

16 Bank overdraft
The bank overdrafts are all repayable on demand. Of the total borrowing, £8.6 million (2009: £7 .5 million) is denominated in Euros and 
£1.6 million (2009: £2.0 million) is denominated in US Dollars. The borrowings are arranged at floating interest rates, thus exposing the 
Group to interest rate risk. The Euro and US Dollar borrowings are taken out to act as a partial hedge against the UK monetary assets in 
those currencies.
The overdraft has been secured by a guarantee between ITE Group plc, ITE Exhibitions & Conferences Limited, International Trade and 
Exhibitions (JV) Limited, ITE Overseas Limited, ITE Enterprises Limited, ITE Moda Limited, RAS Publishing Limited, ITE Moda Footwear 
Limited, ITE Expo UK Limited, ITE Russia LLC UK Limited and a charge over the assets of International Trade and Exhibitions (JV) Limited. 
The average interest rate on the bank overdrafts approximates 2.5% per annum (2009: 1.8%) and is determined by reference to base rate 
plus 1.75%. The Directors estimate the carrying value of the overdrafts approximates their fair value. At 30 September 2010 the Group had 
£10.2 million (2009: £10.5 million) of gross undrawn committed borrowing facilities.

30 September 2010.
The lease provision relates to the spreading of a reduced rent period over the full period of the lease.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £1.9 million (2009: £1.5 million) available for offset against future profits. 
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. 
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £4.5 million (2009: £3.7 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these 
differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that 
such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Maturity of financial instruments 
In 2010, all financial liabilities except the put option and part of the derivative financial instruments (£0.5 million) have a maturity of one 
year or less. The put option is an open option with no fixed maturity date; it has been classified as a long-term financial liability. Out of the 
total of £1.1 million of derivative financial assets, £0.9 million had a maturity of one year or less and £0.2 million has a maturity of one to 
three years. Out of the total of £0.6 million of derivative financial liabilities, £0.5 million had a maturity of one to three years.
In 2009, all financial liabilities except derivative financial instruments have a maturity of one year or less. The put option is an open option 
with no fixed maturity date. Out of the total of £0.3 million of derivative financial assets, £0.2 million had a maturity of one year or less 
and £0.1 million had a maturity of one to two years. Out of the total of £0.8 million of derivative financial liabilities, £0.8 million had a 
maturity of one to three years. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements 
approximate to their fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.

The Group seeks to minimise the effects of foreign currency risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk exposures. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board. Compliance with policies and exposure limits 
is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis. The Group does not enter into financial instruments, including derivative financial 
instruments, for speculative purposes.

Financial risk management
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency and interest rate), 
credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. This note presents Group’s exposure to each of the above risks. Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risks can be found in the Divisional summary on pages 18 to 25. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has put in 
place policies that have been established to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to 
monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings 
of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. Market risk exposures are measured using 
sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward-plus or forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as 
follows:

Forward foreign exchange contracts
As at 30 September 2010 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the Group has committed to 
amounted to €99.7 million (2009: €64.5 million). These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the 
next 36 months and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing the Group to less than six months or more 
than 36 months in the future.
At 30 September 2010, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a net asset of approximately £0.5 million (2009: net liability of 
£0.6 million). These amounts are based on market valuations. 
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against certain currency trade 
receivable balances. These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by management. All foreign exchange 
movements on these borrowings and trade receivables are recognised directly in the income statement.
Interest rate risk management
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, other than cash, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially 
independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowings at floating interest 
rates. This risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate level of floating interest rate borrowings. The Group’s exposures 
to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of this note.

Credit risk management
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its contractual obligations. The Group’s principal financial assets are cash 
and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative financial instruments. These represent the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with 
creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group’s objective is to ensure all 
customers have paid before any service is provided to them. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and unrelated.
The ageing profile of the Group’s trade receivables and the details of the Group’s allowances for doubtful receivables can be seen below.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments arises due to where the liquid funds are held. The territories in which 
ITE operates do not always have banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies such as Moody’s and Fitch. 
The Group aims to minimise the exposure to credit risk by minimising the level of cash held in such banks. The Group’s exposure and 
credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst 
approved financial institutions.

Management review debtors ageing on a contractual basis and also based on when an event has been held. The Group raise invoices on 
events using stage payments. Any overdue amounts, after the stage payment due date, are reviewed and chased. Management also 
review the debts due based on when an event has taken place, as this is typically when the service is provided. Both measures are 
included in the table above as both are used by management to manage outstanding debts.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior experience, specific credit issues and their assessment of the current economic environment. Trade 
receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and the Group’s exposure to 
credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group’s customer base, 
including default risk of the industry and country, in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk. 
The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade receivables when 
there is objective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full. The allowance is recognised and measured as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows, where material discounted at the effective interest rate computed 
at initial recognition. The main component of this allowance is a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposure 
on shows which have taken place but the debt has not been collected in full. This allowance is determined by reference to the specific 
circumstances of each show and past experience.

Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due. Such risk may result from inadequate 
market depth or disruption or refinancing problems. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of 
Directors. They have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and 
long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt facilities  
as appropriate. 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return 
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash 
equivalents, bank overdraft, which is disclosed in note 15 and note 16 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 21 and in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

During the year, the Company allotted 204,500 (2009: 199,800) ordinary shares of 1p each pursuant to the exercise of share options.  
No (2009: nil) ordinary shares were issued in respect of Directors remuneration. The total consideration for the shares issued was  
£1 74,1 10 (2009: £1 1,500).
As detailed in the Statement of changes in equity, the Company purchased no shares (2009; 5,000,000 at a cost of £3.2 million) for the 
Employees Share Option Trust (‘ESOT’).
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on  
1 7 November 1998, shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT). The terms of  
the ESOT allow the trustees to transfer shares to employees who exercise options under the Company’s Share Option Schemes, to grant 
options to employees and to accumulate shares by buying in the market or subscribing for shares at market value. The ESOT is capable of 
holding a maximum of 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The ESOT reserve arises in connection with the Employee Share 
Ownership Trust. The amount of the reserve represents the deduction in arriving at shareholders funds for the consideration paid for the 
Company’s shares purchased by the Trust which had not vested unconditionally in employees at the balance sheet date.
The ESOT held 9,978,386 shares in ITE Group plc at 30 September 2010 (2009: 10,602,886 shares). During the year 327 ,500 share options 
and 1,160,584 nominal share options under the Employees Performance Share Plan were granted against ESOT held shares. The market 
value of the ordinary shares held by the ESOT at 30 September 2010 was £1 7 .8 million (2009: £10.2 million).
The Company has agreed to make available to the ESOT an interest-free loan of up to £12.5 million for the purpose of buying shares.  
At 30 September 2010, the amount of the loan drawn down was £9.2 million. The ITE Group plc Company only profit and loss account  
and balance sheet include the results of the ESOT for the year ended 30 September 2010. 
The trustees have waived their current and future rights to all dividend entitlement on the shares held by the ESOT. 624,500 options were 
exercised by ESOT during the year. Of the total shares held by the ESOT, 7 ,209,148 are under option as at 30 September 2010. Details of 
the options in issue and their exercise dates can be seen at note 24 to the accounts.

negotiated for an average term of two years. Payments for venues represent the non-cancellable amount of contracted venue agreements 
for future events.
The Group also earned rental income of £0.3 million during the year (2009: £0.3 million). 
24 Share-based payments
The Company operate two share option schemes.
Share option plans
The Company operates a share option plan for all employees of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted 
market price of the Company’s share on the date of grant. The vesting period is either three or five years and are exercisable up to ten 
years from granting. The options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Performance share plans
The Company operated a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for executives and staff. Awards under the PSP are at an exercise value of either  
1p or nil. Awards can be made to an employee over shares up to a maximum of 100% of base salary each year based on market value.  
The vesting period is three years and awards are exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant. For conditional awards the vesting is 
automatic on the satisfaction of performance targets. The options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
The awards are also subject to a performance target. Further details of the performance targets can be found in the Report on remuneration.

Financial statements
We have audited the parent company financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2010 which comprise the 
Parent Company Balance Sheet, and the related notes 1 to 10. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2010;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of ITE Group Plc for the year ended 30 September 2010.

Financial statements
Notes to the Company accounts
For the year ended 30 September 2010
1 Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Group going concern disclosure on page 59.
These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and have been applied consistently.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the  
preceding year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets
Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are 
up to 20 years.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors and creditors
Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value. Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to 
profit or loss.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, 
it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying 
timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the 
revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements. Neither is deferred tax 
recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if 
and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on 
retranslation of monetary assets are included in profit or loss for the period. 89
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
1 Basis of accounting continued
Employee Share Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company held by the ESOT 
have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity 
holders.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of 
non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest 
and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’s best estimate.
2 Profit for the year
The loss after tax for the year ended 30 September 2010 was £3.9 million (2009: £124.4 million). As permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
The auditors’ remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

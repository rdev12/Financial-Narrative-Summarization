chairman’s letter
Sir John Peace
Chairman
At this time last year, I reported an historic year for 
Burberry in 2010/11, while expressing some caution  
for the year ahead. For 2011/12, I am pleased to report 
that the team successfully executed an ambitious plan 
despite an uneven external environment, producing 
another record year.
From a strategic perspective, the team focused on reﬁning 
and executing Burberry’s ﬁve core strategies. The brand 
continues to ascend, backed by some of the most forward 
thinking digital marketing in the consumer sector. Ongoing 
design innovation sustains a compelling product proposition. 
With 14% average space growth, retail expansion remains  
on pace in both existing and new markets. The brand is 
actively building a leading presence in the important new 
growth luxury markets. Efﬁciency improves across operating 
functions. These activities produced excellent progress  
for the year, and continued to build a powerful foundation  
for the future.
With this, the Group achieved record ﬁnancial results  
in 2011/12. T otal revenue grew 24% to £1,857m. Operating 
proﬁt increased 25% to £377m. After-tax return on capital 
remained strong at 37%. All of these ﬁgures are on an 
adjusted basis. The Group ended the year with a £338m  
net cash balance. The board has recommended a 25% 
increase in the full year dividend to 25p.
Looking ahead, 2012/13 may present continued challenge. 
Although the global macroeconomic picture has generally 
improved with distance from the ﬁnancial crisis, this is not 
uniformly true. On an economic basis, 2012/13 is likely to  
be less supportive for luxury. China’s growth is slowing, some 
Eurozone countries will see recession and the US recovery  
is gradual. And political tensions in certain regions present 
concerns. Professional observers of the sector are unusually 
divided on its near-term outlook. Against this immediate 
backdrop, longer-term prospects for luxury’s continued 
growth are favourable – supported by democratisation, 
wealth creation, the rise of growth market consumers.
In planning 2012/13, management and the board considered 
these factors. During the year, the board had invested  
in deepening its knowledge of Burberry’s business through 
broader sector analysis, exposure to additional levels  
of management, and in April 2012, a trip reviewing four  
of the Group’s most important markets in Asia. In the end, 
measuring an external environment potentially suggesting 
short-term investment moderation against the brand’s  
long-term opportunity in luxury – particularly in the context  
of aggressive pursuit of market share by sector peers  
– we concluded the beneﬁts of pursuing Burberry’s  
long-term opportunities in luxury should outweigh any 
immediate issues stemming from a difﬁcult environment.  
This approach is further supported by the brand’s 
momentum, management’s track record and the Group’s 
ﬁnancial resources. Accordingly, the team has committed  
to another determined plan, while remaining vigilant and 
prepared to react to external developments.
Before concluding, a brief look further back. July 2012  
marks the tenth anniversary of Burberry as a listed company. 
From its initial £1.15bn market capitalisation in July 2002, 
Burberry is valued in excess of £6bn at the time of this letter 
(May 2012). During these past ten years, the Group has also 
returned £780m to shareholders through share repurchase 
and dividends. 
On behalf of the Board and shareholders, I thank the team 
around the world for their contributions to these results. 
Burberry possesses the right strategy, right culture and  
right team for continued success.
Excellent results with  
a powerful foundation  
for the future    12 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
chief executive officer’s letter
Completing a record year in 2010/11, Burberry entered 
2011/12 with excellent momentum – and a less certain 
external outlook. Following a strong rebound for luxury 
in 2010, the sector’s prospects were less predictable 
amid the macro uncertainty. In this context, management 
planned to drive near-term results by concentrating  
on core strategies, while committing signiﬁcant 
investment to beneﬁt the years ahead, ever watchful  
of a changing environment. In the ﬁnal analysis,  
the luxury consumer broadly remained healthy and the 
team successfully navigated the uncertainties realised 
– Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, natural disaster  
in Japan and sluggish US recovery – to advance its 
long-term objectives: great brand, great growth,  
great company. 
Great brand
Great brands stand for clearly deﬁned attributes which  
are projected to provide a pure, uniform experience across  
all consumer touch points. Our strategies are aimed at 
reinforcing the Burberry brand’s digital luxury positioning, 
ensuring consistency of experience and enriching the depth 
and accessibility of that experience in keeping with evolving 
consumer expectations.
 Correcting legacy issues 
We continued to correct legacy practices inconsistent  
with target positioning. In the wholesale channel, Burberry 
exited doors not aligned with brand status and invested  
in presentation through both enhanced assortments and 
dedicated, customised real estate in key doors. Although 
the outlet store format is primarily an inventory management 
tool, our objective is fewer stores located in the top outlet 
centres in each market. Accordingly, selected outlet stores 
were closed or relocated in the year.
 Transitioning Japan 
We continued efforts to integrate Japan with the modern 
British brand. As part of upgrading today’s premium 
positioning, an additional seven licensed categories were 
exited or downsized during the year, while we continued  
to invest in our early stage retail operation. Reﬁning 
merchandising and marketing strategies to convert this 
legacy market, the team achieved solid sales gains in  
the year in this initial phase of building the brand’s future 
platform in Japan.

A Great Step Forward Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 13
 Launching Burberry Body 
Fragrance is the most widely encountered product  
in the Burberry portfolio. With the creation of Burberry 
Body, the brand added its most elevated proposition  
in this category. Launched simultaneously across digital 
and traditional platforms, the global media campaign, 
featuring the iconic trench coat within a new sensual 
context, communicated the brand’s modern luxury 
positioning to a wide consumer audience.
 Presenting Burberry Bespoke 
Burberry Bespoke also debuted during the year.  
This interactive online experience allows consumers  
to explore the full possibilities of Burberry’s iconic trench 
coat – silhouettes, fabrics, colours, hardware – and design 
a completely personalised edition made at our facility  
in England for delivery within eight weeks. Offering  
over 12 million combinations and the most luxurious of 
features, Bespoke is the highest expression of the brand.
 Integrating the physical and digital 
Burberry’s stores and digital platforms both offer distinct 
consumer advantages. Stores, for example, provide the 
immediacy of physical product, while Burberry World,  
the brand’s digital headquarters, can conjure a product’s 
image from the runway or place it within a customer’s 
purchase history. As part of a seamless brand experience, 
we are working to integrate the beneﬁts of both arenas – 
brand essence to product knowledge to selection to 
service – through a range of activities, including digital 
trunk shows, synchronised product presence, 360 degree 
video view, 24/7 click-to-chat in 14 languages and use of 
iPads in store, blurring the lines between the physical and 
digital. During the year we incorporated our most up to 
date thinking in the London Regent Street store project. 
Scheduled to open in summer 2012, this is Burberry’s 
store of the future. This is Burberry World Live.
Great growth
In serving as stewards of this 156 year old heritage brand, 
management deﬁnes great growth in both qualitative and 
quantitative dimensions. The goal is sustained, proﬁtable 
growth over the long-term fully consistent with the brand 
vision, values and positioning.
 Driving productivity 
During the year, management focused on several 
operational initiatives to drive store productivity –  
among the most potent levers of proﬁtable growth. 
Consistent execution ensured new product ﬂowed  
to reset selling ﬂoors across all mediums monthly  
to continuously engage consumers. Investment in 
replenishment inventory improved availability of core 
product. Continued commitment to sales training and  
the addition of new modules tailored to high growth 
markets enhanced consumer responsiveness globally.  
For the year, comparable store sales increased 14%  
on top of an 11% gain in 2010/11.
 Accelerating retail investment 
The Group accelerated retail expansion with the opening 
of 48 mainline stores and concessions. By strengthening 
the brand’s position in ﬂagship cities around the world,  
we see opportunity to increase sales and mindshare in 
these high potential markets which offer a concentration  
of both sophisticated local and travelling luxury consumers. 
Retail capital investment increased 60% in the year with 
approximately half concentrated in these markets. Larger 
format stores opened in Hong Kong, Paris and Sydney. 
Store renovation activity also accelerated, with emphasis  
on ﬂagship markets.
 Engaging China 
Mainland China is among the world’s largest and fastest 
growing luxury markets today. As the economic trends 
and cultural dynamics indicate that its importance will 
continue to grow, Burberry is investing in China for  
the long-term. Ten mainline and concession stores  
were opened, for a total of 63 stores at year end. At the 
country level, we are adding senior management and 
talent. Marketing efforts intensiﬁed with the brand staging 
one of its most prominent events of the year in Beijing  
in April 2011 and the customisation of content to  
gain a leading position in the local social media arena.  
In stores, we continue to reﬁne formats, assortments  
and develop a targeted service proposition. 14 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
chief executive officer’s letter Continued
 Investing in growth markets 
Burberry is also investing in the smaller markets of the 
future. From regional headquarters in Brazil, the Group 
opened two stores in Central and Latin America, in São 
Paulo and Guadalajara. In India, two stores were opened 
and the Middle East region also added seven stores  
in the year.
 Intensifying product 
Outstanding product is the soul of the brand and  
the object of passionate attention – whether to set  
a new luxury standard in our core outerwear category  
with the creation of Bespoke or to elevate the brand’s 
position in fragrance with Burberry Body. In addition  
to these, menswear received intensive focus during the 
year. At origin Burberry is a male brand, and with rising 
prominence of the male luxury consumer, particularly  
in growth markets, the brand sees further opportunity  
to capitalise on this heritage. During the year, the menswear 
division intensiﬁed efforts in tailoring through new product 
development, sourcing arrangements, marketing activities 
and in-store merchandising and service. The tailoring 
initiative was piloted in selected stores with expansion 
planned for 2012/13. Men’s non-apparel categories are 
among the fastest growing in luxury. Accordingly, the team 
invested signiﬁcantly to elevate and expand assortments  
in this area. In the year, men’s non-apparel was Burberry’s 
fastest growing business.
 Building customer centricity 
In an increasingly digital world, businesses have ever 
greater opportunity to understand their target customer. 
During the year, we accelerated investment in this area  
with the addition of dedicated expertise and technology 
solutions. These are early steps on a multi-year path  
to gaining greater customer insight from which to  
develop the foresight that informs our decision and  
service processes. 
 Leveraging information investment 
While substantial investment in core information systems 
has improved Burberry’s fundamental operating capability 
and enabled rapid growth in recent years, we continue  
to reﬁne and expand use of these tools. In 2011/12,  
this core was further leveraged across the supply chain  
to enhance procurement processes and more precisely 
time the ﬂow of product capsules to stores. In the 
merchandising sphere, intelligence gained from consistent 
global data and reporting sharpened both pre-season 
buying and assortment decisions and in-season 
responsiveness.

Great company
A truly great company is great beyond its customers.  
For employees, it is an inspiring, rewarding place to  
work. While society broadly beneﬁts from the commercial 
contribution of a healthy business, a great company  
more actively applies its resources in favour of greater  
social value. And, if a company achieves these, it should  
also deliver attractive ﬁnancial returns for shareholders.
 Enabling creative thinking 
Today, innovation is vital to every business – and essential 
to luxury. At Burberry, we organise ourselves to maximise 
cross-functional, collaborative interaction – reporting 
relationships that integrate traditionally segregated silos 
(Marketing and IT), governing bodies that pair seasoned 
executives with the next generation of talent (a council  
to dream), and a willingness to deconstruct and evolve  
our structure as needs arise and the business grows  
(a new mobile commerce department). The unconventional 
interaction within this network drives the rich innovation  
– the Tweetwalk (a pioneering fashion show on Twitter), 
Bespoke, the addition of weather to a runway show  
– that fuels our business. 
 Building the social enterprise 
Connecting through constant communication is a key 
aspect of this culture. During the year, we undertook 
development of a sophisticated communications  
platform built around social media architecture to  
more closely connect our nearly 9,500 employees. 
Incorporating interactive tools to enhance access  
to people and information globally, this will be the  
focal point of communication and knowledge internally  
– and extend to external partners next year. 
 Investing in Britain 
As home of the brand, Britain is a special place for 
Burberry. We continue to build the team at our global 
headquarters in London, committing to a second building  
in Westminster during the year. The Group further invested  
in its trench coat manufacturing facility in Yorkshire  
in our effort to build a world-class operation. As part  
of this, we are also funding a training academy and 
apprentice programme to develop skills in the next 
Burberry generation.
 Enhancing social value 
Supporting the Burberry Foundation – dedicated to 
helping young people realise their dreams through the 
power of creativity – is also an integral part of our culture. 
During the year, the Foundation, which receives the  
large majority of the Group’s annual contribution of 1%  
of pre-tax proﬁts – composed of both cash and products,  
such as British-made trench coats and other outerwear, 
small leather goods, handbags, totes and mufﬂers – to 
philanthropic causes, continued to support organisations 
in key communities in which Burberry operates, and 
facilitated Burberry’s ﬁrst global staff volunteering day.  
The Foundation’s success has further raised our aspirations. 
We recognise that constrained governments increasingly 
need businesses with their expertise and other resources 
to play a larger role in society. So we ask ourselves, given 
a brand, talent and culture able to engage the interests  
of consumers around the world, what else can we do? 
What is Burberry’s larger role? This is work for the future.
Great ﬁnancial results
These activities have positioned Burberry well for the years 
ahead, while delivering record ﬁnancial results in the present. 
Revenue increased 23% underlying to £1,857m. A 14% 
comparable store sales gain combined with 11% space 
expansion and a 6% contribution from the China acquisition  
to produce 31% underlying retail revenue growth to £1,270m. 
Wholesale revenue increased 8% underlying (14% excluding 
the China transition) to £478m. Licensing revenue increased 
5% underlying driven by strong performances in fragrance, 
timepieces and eyewear. The business achieved double-digit 
gains across all product divisions and regions. Adjusted 
operating proﬁt increased 25% to £377m with retail/
wholesale operating proﬁt growing 31% on a 25% revenue 
gain – achieving an historical high 16.4% retail/wholesale 
operating margin. Capital investment totalled £153m  
and the Group ended the year with £338m of cash.
A great year
In concluding a great year, I once again thank the global 
Burberry community. This starts with the internal Burberry 
team, and extends equally to our external relationships – 
suppliers, customers and licensing and franchise partners. 
Burberry’s excellent performance springs from the work  
of this amazing community with all its expertise, passion, 
dedication and loyalty. It’s exciting and an honour to work 
alongside all of you on this mission – the opportunity has 
never been clearer. With a solid, balanced foundation in 
place, we can continue to create a great brand with great 
growth, resulting in a truly great company relevant for another 
150 years. I look forward to Burberry’s exciting years ahead.   18 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12

the brand’s virtual communities and motion-reactive 
360-degree technology enhancing customers’ ability 
to explore the collection online.
 Recognising the increasingly central role that technology 
plays in the success of its marketing activities, investment 
in the integrity and efﬁciency of IT systems continued.
Through more coordinated use of brand assets  
and greater integration of its global organisation, 
Burberry has the opportunity to enhance consumer 
responsiveness and operate more efﬁciently  
and effectively. This potential lies in both the  
front and back-of-house operations.
In 2011/12, Burberry was named the fourth-fastest growing 
brand globally by both Interbrand and WPP/BrandZ, behind 
Apple, Google and Amazon. It was included in Interbrand’s 
‘Top 100 Global Brands’ for the third consecutive year, 
received the Luxury Brieﬁng ‘Inspiring Luxury Loyalty’ award 
and was recognised as one of six best practice advertising 
case studies by Asia’s largest search engine, Baidu.
Brand momentum, marketing innovation and product 
excellence underpin this performance.
Brand momentum
The momentum of the Burberry brand lies in pure and 
consistent global articulation. Initiatives underpinning this 
momentum include:
Digital synchronisation
 Burberry.com – or ‘Burberry World’ – enabled more 
consistent brand projection across all customer 
touchpoints.
 Monthly coordination of design, marketing and retail 
activities resulted in seamless brand communication.
 Retail Theatre technology was rolled out to 87 stores, 
enabling distribution of brand content and events, 
while the roll out of iPads to all mainline stores globally 
was completed.
 Burberry World supported retail sales as a global 
inventory pool.

Social media 
 Burberry continued to advance its leading position  
on social media in the luxury sector, more than doubling 
Facebook fans and YouTube views, while tripling its 
followers on Twitter. Visits to the Art of The Trench 
social media site increased by more than 60%.
 Brand content was further leveraged across Chinese 
social media platforms Sina Weibo, Kaixin001, Douban 
and YouKu, and through 10 regional Twitter accounts.
 Tweetwalk, launched in partnership with Twitter,  
enabled followers to see images of the menswear  
and womenswear collections ﬁrst, before they went  
down the runway.
Events
 Burberry leveraged digital technology to increase reach 
and engagement around key brand events. New initiatives 
included the streaming of the AW12 womenswear show 
to iconic outdoor sites at London’s Liverpool Street  
station and Heathrow Terminal 5, and a collaboration with  
Sina Weibo that resulted in nearly 70 million impressions 
for a major brand event in Beijing.
Product excellence
At Burberry everything begins and ends with great 
product, combining a focus on core categories with 
continuous innovation.
Outerwear core
 Leveraging the brand’s unique heritage, together with 
design innovation and excellence, outerwear continued  
as the company’s predominant apparel category and 
primary growth driver.
 Outerwear represented more than half of mainline  
retail apparel sales, underpinned by a robust 
replenishment programme.
Menswear focus
 Burberry made signiﬁcant progress towards reclaiming 
the brand’s menswear foundation by leveraging its core 
strategies across the high-potential men’s apparel and 
non-apparel categories.
 The division relaunched with a tailoring test, diversiﬁed 
outerwear offer, non-apparel extensions and dedicated 
marketing initiatives. Men’s tailoring doubled in the  
year from a low base and men’s non-apparel increased  
by 50% in mainline retail.
Large leather goods
 Innovation in design, materials and shapes drove 
continued strength in large leather goods, particularly  
in the brand’s iconic check, luxury leather and  
Prorsum handbags.
2011/12 saw the continuation of efforts to correct the 
diminishing number of legacy issues that are inconsistent 
with the global luxury positioning of the Burberry brand.  
There was signiﬁcant investment during the year in 
upgrading the brand’s wholesale presence, through  
the addition of shop-in-shops, the closure of accounts  
and exiting from outerwear departments. In Japan, where 
the majority of the Burberry business is still under licence, 
the company continued to terminate various non-apparel 
licences while implementing merchandising and marketing 
activities focused on the global collection.
Total revenue growth (Year to 31 March)

stores or those of its department store or specialty retail customers.

Global licences
Burberry has three global licensing agreements: fragrance 
and beauty (Interparfums), watches (Fossil) and eyewear 
(Luxottica). The company continued to work closely with 
these partners on product development, marketing and 
distribution activities, and conducted regular reviews to 
ensure compliance with the terms of its licence agreements.
By more closely aligning these products to the Burberry 
brand image, the company continued to unlock their potential 
in 2011/12. 
Fragrance and beauty
 The new Burberry Body women’s fragrance launched, 
supported by a synchronised global marketing campaign 
across all platforms and regions, including iconic outdoor 
advertising, high-impact store presentations, television 
advertising and sampling activity launched through 
a partnership with Facebook. Body was the brand’s 
most successful fragrance launch to date, enabling the 
Burberry fragrance portfolio to move from 19th to 9th 
in the United States. 
 The distribution for Burberry Beauty, launched in 2010/11, 
was extended following an encouraging early performance. 
Now available in over 70 wholesale doors worldwide and 
through burberry.com, the range was introduced to the 
ﬁrst Burberry store with the opening of Taipei. 
Eyewear
 A heightened focus on eyewear development  
and distribution resulted in good sales growth over  
the year and a stronger platform for future growth. 
Watches
 Further progress was made towards aligning product and 
distribution activities with the brand’s luxury positioning, 
with a strong consumer response to the enhanced 
product offer.
Intensify and focus on under-penetrated non-apparel 
categories to leverage Burberry design and 
merchandising expertise and iconic branding further 
through investment in product development, marketing 
and supply chain.
In 2011/12, non-apparel was the company’s largest product 
division, contributing 39% of retail/wholesale revenue and 
recording growth of 22%. At around half of non-apparel 
mainline retail sales, large leather goods remain the backbone 
of this category, underpinned by a robust replenishment 
programme.
Men’s accessories
 Men’s accessories was the largest growth driver in 
non-apparel, accounting for over a third of growth. 
Investment in product development and focused marketing 
initiatives resulted in revenues increasing by over 50%. 
Soft accessories
 Continued growth in iconic cashmere and innovation in 
fabrications and prints drove strong double-digit growth 
in both ladies’ and men’s scarves.

ACCELERATE 
RETAIL-LED GROWTH
 The Customer Service team grew considerably with the 
opening of a new centre in Hong Kong to complement the 
existing centres in London and New York. Together these 
specialist facilities support the needs of luxury customers 
24/7 by phone, email and live chat in 14 languages. 
 The extension of a specialised sales and service 
programme to China was completed, alongside training 
to deliver exceptional service to Chinese customers 
internationally.
 Client Services, dedicated to the most loyal Burberry 
customers, grew to a team of 50 worldwide, with 
customised sales programmes across all regions. There 
was further investment in elevating the in-store experience 
for these customers through the increased provision 
of private areas tailored to their elevated service needs.
Real estate investment
 The Burberry retail footprint was further expanded, 
with a heightened focus on ﬂagship cluster investment. 
Flagship cities are characterised by high net worth local 
populations, above average GDP and strong tourism 
ﬂows. Together, these characteristics provide some 
insulation against global macroeconomic volatility.
 A 19% increase in average selling space included the 
opening of new larger format stores in Hong Kong’s 
Canton Road, the Rue Faubourg St-Honoré in Paris, 
and George Street in Sydney. 23 mainline stores were 
opened and there was a continued focus on upgrading 
the Burberry retail presence in key locations, including 
13 major renovations.
Shift company culture and processes from a static 
wholesale model to a dynamic retail model. Retail-led 
growth refers not only to the operation of Burberry’s 
own stores, but also to a fundamental shift in the 
Group’s operating structure.
Burberry was honoured to receive three prestigious retail 
awards when it was named ‘International Retailer of the  
Year’ at both the National Retail Federation of America and 
the Oracle World Retail Awards, and ‘Retailer of the Year’  
at the UK’s Retail Week Oracle Awards. Burberry was  
also recognised for the industry’s best in-store and online 
customer experience by the Luxury Institute. 
Highlights from 2011/12 include: 
Driving productivity
 Burberry continued to invest in all aspects of the retail 
experience during the year, substantially increasing 
productivity in its mainline stores.
 Further integration of physical and digital real estate, 
including through monthly ﬂoorsets, drove consistent 
brand messaging across all mediums.
 Retail disciplines were improved, including in 
replenishment execution and inventory management.
Customer centricity
 Burberry continued to focus on customer service, driving 
consistency and productivity by better connecting with 
customers and cultivating personalised relationships.

and refurbishments.
Total retail sales increased by 31% underlying in the year. Comparable store revenue growth 
increased by 14% (H1: 16%; H2: 12%). Average selling prices increased again in mainline 
stores driven by an increased penetration of London in women’s and men’s apparel. The 
acquired stores in China contributed 6% of the 31% underlying growth, up to the anniversary 
of the acquisition from September 2010. The balance of growth of 11% came from new space.

INVEST IN  
UNDER-PENETRATED MARKETS
Developing India and the Middle East
 This sub-region was developed further during the  
year, with the opening of two new stores in India and  
the formation of a new subsidiary with a local partner  
in Saudi Arabia.
Building Central and Latin America
 Two new stores opened in Central and Latin America 
as Burberry continued to build its presence in this 
high-potential region. The stores, in the key luxury  
hubs of São Paulo and Guadalajara, brought the total 
number in the region to eight.
Entering new markets
 Recognising the potentially more volatile conditions 
in emerging markets, Burberry continued to work with 
franchisees and partners in countries where it has 
more limited experience, beneﬁting from local expertise.
 Burberry signed new franchise agreements, including  
to take the brand into the emerging luxury markets  
of the Baltic states.
Elevating wholesale presence
 Burberry made signiﬁcant investment in its luxury brand 
presence through the wholesale channel, with an intense 
focus to improve real estate and upgrade assortments.
 In the United States, over 30 new women’s, men’s, 
accessories and children’s shop-in-shops were opened 
in key department stores. Upgrading of specialty store 
distribution in Europe continued.
 Burberry continued to build its presence in the high growth 
travel retail channel, particularly with its travel retail partner 
in the Asia region. New Burberry stores opened in Macau’s 
City of Dreams and in the East and West terminals  
at Taiwan’s Kaohsiung airport.
Focus on and invest in under-penetrated markets.  
For Burberry, these consist of both developed markets 
like the United States and Emerging Markets including 
China, India and the Middle East. All distribution 
channels and a variety of business models are used  
to optimise these opportunities. 
Highlights from 2011/12 include: 
Engaging China
 The integration of the company’s China operation  
was ﬁnalised and enhanced merchandising, marketing  
and store service initiatives were leveraged to increase 
comparable store sales by well over 20%.
 An intensiﬁed marketing focus extended reach and 
relevance. Burberry achieved a leading luxury position 
on Chinese social media platforms, launched a simpliﬁed 
Chinese version of burberry.com and was named the 
brand with the second-highest ‘digital IQ’ in China by 
the inﬂuential L2 think tank.
 The capabilities of the team were further developed, 
cultivating full regional functions and expertise. In stores, 
assortments were further elevated and reﬁned to cater 
to the needs of the country’s emerging luxury consumer, 
while the service proposition beneﬁted from  
intensiﬁed investment.

154 stores, 97 are directly operated, of which 63 are in China, ﬁve in Central and Latin 
America, 22 in the Middle East and seven in India. The balance are franchise stores.  42 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12

PURSUE OPERATIONAL 
EXCELLENCE
 Additional investment was made at Castleford to  
support the production of Burberry Bespoke trench  
coats, the majority of which are made in Britain. 
Progressing logistics
 Logistics execution and capabilities were further 
enhanced. European logistics activities were reconﬁgured 
with a new regional distribution hub in Piacenza, Italy 
designed to bring signiﬁcant speed, cost and energy 
efﬁciency beneﬁts.
Information technology
Social enterprise
 Burberry partnered with Salesforce.com to implement 
tools and processes to enable the development of a social 
enterprise, better connecting all constituencies around the 
brand. This included the launch of Burberry Chat, a global 
digital platform dynamically linking associates and partners.
Completing SAP
 The global implementation of SAP was largely  
completed with the installation of China and the Middle 
East. This major multi-year project forms the foundation  
for the company’s global IT infrastructure.
The Group continues to monitor closely all key supplier 
relationships across its global operations. Governance 
processes are in place for all major strategic initiatives, 
supplemented by regular reviews of operational progress 
and performance by senior management. These structures 
are regularly reviewed to ensure they can effectively support 
Burberry’s global growth.
Burberry continues to pursue its goal to be recognised 
as much for operational excellence as for product and 
marketing excellence.
Burberry drove further operational improvements during 
2011/12, with a particular emphasis on merchandising, 
supply chain and information technology.
Merchandising
Technology investment
 Burberry continued to prioritise and leverage technology 
investments across the business. A centralised business 
intelligence team was established with global responsibility 
for data management and reporting, resulting in enhanced 
visibility of metrics including sales, margins and inventory.
Replenishment and planning
 An ongoing focus on replenishment capability and 
practices saw the penetration of replenishment styles 
remain at about half of mainline revenue. Assortment 
planning and execution was further improved. A more 
consistent global buy provided increased supply chain 
efﬁciency and a cohesive brand statement across the 
store base, whilst allowing regional ﬂexibility to respond 
to local preferences.
Supply chain
Investing in UK manufacturing
 Apprenticeship schemes were established at Castleford, 
which produces the brand’s heritage trench coats, and 
Woodrow, which weaves the gabardine fabric used in 
their construction. Together with a new training school 
at Castleford, this will develop the future skill base in 
both locations.

 Average retail selling space increased by 14%,  
with the acquired Chinese stores contributing  
an additional 5% space
In mainline stores in the year, growth was balanced, with 
double-digit increases in all regions and product divisions, 
underpinned by core outerwear and large leather goods, 
which accounted for about half of sales. The penetration  
of replenishment styles remained at about 50% of mainline 
revenue. New merchandising strategies gained traction, 
including knitwear and men’s tailoring (doubling in the year 
from a small base).
Burberry London and Prorsum accounted for around 45%  
of mainline apparel revenue (2011: 40%). Average selling 
prices continued to increase due to product mix, pricing 
increases and better full price sell-through. Digital commerce 
sales, including via iPads in store, continued to outperform.
There was double-digit growth in mainline comparable  
store sales in all four regions.
Asia Paciﬁc
Retail accounted for about 85% of Asia Paciﬁc revenue, 
including a full year’s contribution from the Chinese stores 
acquired in September 2010. 
There was double-digit comparable store sales growth in 
China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, while the Korean 
market was soft. Burberry’s small retail operations in Japan 
selling the global non-apparel collection made solid progress.
Europe
Retail accounted for about two-thirds of Europe revenue. 
There was double-digit mainline comparable stores sales 
growth in the UK, France and Germany, especially in ﬂagship 
markets. Southern Europe, especially Italy, remained weak.
Americas
Retail accounted for about two-thirds of Americas revenue, 
with double-digit comparable store sales growth in the  
year. Space was added mainly in Brazil and Mexico, while 
continuing to rationalise and upgrade US outlets.
Rest of World
Retail accounted for just over half of revenue for Rest of 
World. The largest contributor was Burberry Middle East  
with 17 stores in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and  
Qatar. These delivered double-digit comparable store  
sales growth during the year, with some slowdown in the 
fourth quarter. Five franchise stores in Saudi Arabia were 
transferred into a subsidiary in which Burberry has a 60% 
stake. The business in India, which has seven stores, 
continued to perform strongly. 48 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
FINANCIAL REVIEW Continued
Wholesale 
26% of revenue (2011: 29%); generated from sales  
to department stores, multi-brand specialty accounts, 
Emerging Market franchisees and Travel Retail
 Wholesale revenue increased by 8% underlying  
(9% at reported FX)
 Excluding China, underlying growth was 14%  
(H1: 20%; H2: 7%)
 Outerwear and consistent execution of monthly  
ﬂoorsets drove growth
Wholesale revenue growth was affected by the conversion 
from wholesale to retail of the China operations, the ﬁve 
Saudi Arabia stores and Spanish menswear; as well as  
the acceleration of the planned rationalisation of the brand’s 
distribution in the United States and Europe, especially  
in the second half of the year. Adjusting for all these factors, 
underlying growth for the year would have been over  
20% rather than 8%.
Asia Paciﬁc
The majority of wholesale revenue in Asia Paciﬁc is  
Travel Retail which had another year of good growth,  
partly reﬂecting increased tourism within ﬂagship  
markets in the region.
Europe
Europe remains Burberry’s largest wholesale region, 
accounting for about 40% of group wholesale revenue. 
Outperformance with key department store and other 
partners has more than compensated for the continued 
rationalisation of small, non brand-enhancing specialty 
accounts. 
Americas
Wholesale growth in the Americas exceeded 20% in the  
year, excluding the impact of the accelerated rationalisation  
of the brand’s distribution. With the move from generic 
outerwear departments near completion, upgrading real 
estate within the key department stores to support the 
brand’ s segmentation is a core strategy. Around 30 dedicated 
shop-in-shops were opened, bringing the total to over 80. 
Rest of World
Wholesale revenue in Rest of World, which is mainly  
to franchise partners, saw strong growth, especially  
in the two largest markets of Turkey and Russia.
At the year end, Burberry had 57 franchise stores, up  
by a net one during the year. Five stores in Saudi Arabia  
were transferred to retail, with franchise stores opened in 
markets as diverse as Thailand, South Africa and Croatia. 
Licensing 
6% of revenue (2011: 7%); of which approximately  
two-thirds from Japan (split roughly three-quarters apparel 
and one-quarter from various short-term, mainly non-apparel, 
licences), with the balance from global product licences 
(fragrance, eyewear and timepieces) and European  
wholesale childrenswear
 Licensing revenue in the year increased by 5%  
on an underlying basis (up 10% at reported FX)
 Consistent with full year guidance
At constant exchange rates, royalty income from Japan  
was broadly unchanged from last year. Income from the 
apparel licence increased in line with the 2009 renegotiation. 
This enabled further non-renewals of short-term non-apparel 
licences, reducing proﬁt by about £7m.
Burberry continued to unlock the potential of its global 
licence products, with 20% growth in royalty income.  
This was led by Burberry Body – Burberry’s most successful 
fragrance launch to date. The innovative global digital  
and outdoor advertising campaign that supported the 
fragrance gave the brand unprecedented visibility across  
all its major markets. Further progress was also made  
on aligning the product and distribution of eyewear and  
watches more closely with Burberry’s luxury positioning.
Discussions continue between Burberry and Interparfums 
regarding the potential establishment of a new operating 
model for the Burberry fragrance and beauty business. Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 49
Retail/wholesale adjusted operating proﬁt grew by 31%  
to £286.9m. Burberry, as guided, dynamically managed 
gross margin and operating expenses to enable further 
investment in the business while modestly improving  
the operating margin – up 80 basis points to 16.4%.  
The improvement in the operating margin was second  
half weighted (H1: up 10bp; H2 up 130bp) reﬂecting the 
phasing of investment and costs and the higher absolute 
revenue base in the second half than the ﬁrst half.
Gross margin for the year increased by 320 basis points to 
68.1%. The key drivers were the conversion of China from 
wholesale to retail, its subsequent outperformance, beneﬁts 
from pricing and sourcing and further channel and regional 
mix shifts.
Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were  
51.7%, reﬂecting the shift to retail. As well as general  
inﬂation, the increase in operating expenses is attributable  
to investment in three key areas:
 New space;
 New markets, especially China until the anniversary  
of the acquisition in September 2011, as well as Saudi 
Arabia, Central and Latin America and India; and
 Central functions to support the growth and momentum  
in the business. Investment was increased in areas such 
as marketing, client services, customer insight and IT.

including a further write-down of freehold assets held for sale. 
Total restructuring cash spend was £8.6m. Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 51
Taxation 
In FY 2011/12, Burberry had a tax charge of £101m  
(2011: £83m), giving a tax rate on adjusted proﬁt  
of 26.7% (2011: 27.9%).
The tax rate on adjusted proﬁt for FY 2012/13 is currently 
expected to be between 25-26%.
Net cashﬂow 
Net cash at 31 March 2012 was £338m, up from £298m  
at 31 March 2011. The Group funded £153m of capital 
expenditure and £24m relating to the China and Saudi  
Arabia acquisitions. Other major outﬂows were tax  
(£108m), dividends (£99m) and the purchase of shares  
by the Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) Trust to satisfy 
historic share scheme awards (£61m).
Capital expenditure at £153m (2011: £108m) was below 
guidance, reﬂecting the timing of payments especially on the 
larger projects. The spend was biased towards larger format 
new stores and refurbishments, which accounted for about 
25% of the total in 2012, compared to around 10% for 2011.
Inventory at 31 March 2012 was £311m (2011: £248m),  
an increase of 25% year-on-year. Over half of the growth  
was to support new stores, with the balance largely  
reﬂecting increased replenishment and stock in transit  
due to shipping by sea.
2012/13 outlook 
Retail
In the year to 31 March 2013, Burberry plans a 12-14% 
increase in average retail selling space, with a shift from 
smaller to larger format stores. Burberry expects to open 
about a net 15 mainline stores, biased towards Emerging 
Markets and ﬂagship markets with high tourist inﬂows.
Wholesale
In the six months to 30 September 2012, Burberry  
projects underlying wholesale revenue to increase by  
a mid single-digit percentage, despite further rationalisation  
of the brand’s distribution in both Europe and the United 
States. Double-digit percentage growth is again expected  
in key US department store doors, Emerging Markets 
franchise partners and Asia Travel Retail. 
Licensing
In the year to 31 March 2013, Burberry expects licensing 
revenue at constant and reported exchange rates to  
be broadly unchanged year-on-year. The global product 
licences are again expected to deliver double-digit 
percentage underlying growth. This will be offset by  
the planned termination and downsizing of Japanese  
non-apparel licences.
Retail/wholesale operating margin
In FY 2012/13, Burberry plans to continue to invest in  
areas such as new stores, marketing and IT to drive growth. 
While the phasing of revenue and investment is expected  
to lead to retail/wholesale operating margin being lower  
in the six months to 30 September 2012 than in the same 
period last year, Burberry expects to deliver a further modest 
improvement in the retail/wholesale operating margin  
in the year to 31 March 2013.
Capital expenditure
For FY 2012/13, Burberry is planning capital expenditure  
of between £180-200m. This will be focused on retail 
expansion, with about one-third of the spend planned  
in larger format stores, including Regent Street, London, 
Chicago and Paciﬁc Place, Hong Kong. 52 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12

FINANCIAL REVIEW Continued    56 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
Principal Risks
Effective management of risks is essential to  
the execution of the Group’s ﬁve strategic themes,  
the achievement of sustainable shareholder value,  
the protection of the Brand and meeting corporate 
governance requirements. 
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that  
risks are effectively managed by the Group. The Board  
has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of  
internal control and risk management methodology. 
As part of this review, the Audit Committee considers  
the principal risks facing the Group and the nature and  
extent of these risks. The Group’s Internal Audit and Risk 
Assurance function facilitate a risk assessment process  
in each key business area and global support function to 
review the signiﬁcant risks facing its operations and to record 
the relevant controls and actions in place to mitigate risks.  
The detailed assessments are then consolidated to provide 
input into the overall Group risk assessment. Please refer  
to the Corporate Governance section for further details of  
the Group’s risk management processes and internal controls.
There are areas of the Group’s business where it is necessary 
to take risks to achieve a satisfactory return for shareholders. 
The Board has considered the nature and extent of the 
signiﬁcant risks it is willing to take in achieving the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
The risks set out on the following pages represent the 
principal risks and uncertainties which may adversely impact 
the management of the Group and the execution of its ﬁve 
key strategic themes. The key steps the Group takes to 
address these risks, where they are matters within its control, 
are also described. Such steps will mitigate but not eliminate 
risks. Some of the risks relate to external factors which are 
beyond the Group’s control.
The order of the principal risks is in no way an indication 
of their relative importance, and each of the risks should 
be considered independently. If more than one of the 
events contemplated by the risks set out below occur,  
it is possible that the combined overall effect of such  
events may be compounded. 
When evaluating the Group’s principal risks during the 
ﬁnancial year under review, the following changes have 
been identiﬁed:
 the inability of the Group to absorb commodity  
price increases is no longer viewed as a principal  
risk due to the activities of the Group’s sourcing  
teams during the year;
 the failure by the Group to realise the beneﬁts  
of acquisitions or operations with partners is  
no longer viewed as a principal risk due to the  
successful integration of the Group’s China business  
and its positive performance during the year; and
 in the current macro-economic climate where many 
country economies and ﬁnancial institutions have 
continued to experience severe ﬁnancial difﬁculties 
particularly in the Eurozone, the risk to the Group of 
a major economic downturn has increased. The key 
steps which the Group has taken to mitigate this risk 
are described overleaf.
Risk  58 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
Risk Continued
Risk Impact Mitigation
Economic downturn. The Group’s performance remains strong;  
however, reduced consumer wealth driven  
by adverse economic conditions could lead  
to a reduction in demand, disrupt its supply  
chain or lead to an increase in bad debts,  
all of which would impact sales and proﬁtability. 
The global reach of the Group helps to mitigate 
local economic risks. In addition, the Group’s 
ﬁnancial reporting and review processes are 
designed to highlight any on-going decrease  
in sales. Counterparty credit checks are in place 
for all key customers and suppliers, and ﬂexible 
payment terms are used to assist suppliers  
as required. Group Treasury monitors the credit 
ratings of ﬁnancial institutions which hold Group 
deposits to enable the Group to take appropriate 
action should there be a downgrade in their 
credit ratings. 
Loss of key management or the inability 
to attract and retain key employees.
The loss of key individuals or the inability to recruit 
and retain individuals with the relevant talent and 
experience would disrupt the operation of the 
business and adversely impact the Group’s ability 
to deliver its strategies.
Competitive incentive arrangements exist, with 
speciﬁc initiatives in place designed to retain key 
individuals. Recruitment is on-going and talent 
review and succession planning programmes are 
in place and have been updated during the year.
The Group’s operations depend on IT systems 
and operational infrastructure in order to trade 
efﬁciently. Increasingly technology is also 
being used to stream major events and to 
communicate through social media.
A failure in these systems or a denial of service 
could have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s 
operations and reputation, and potentially  
result in the loss of sensitive information.  
Negative social media campaigns could impact  
on the Group’s reputation.
A number of controls to maintain the integrity  
and efﬁciency of the Group’s IT systems are  
in place, including recovery plans which would  
be implemented in the event of a major failure.  
The IT disaster recovery plans are tested on a 
regular basis. IT security is continually reviewed 
and updated and third party IT security specialists 
are used to regularly test these controls.
Over-reliance on key vendors. The Group relies on a small number of vendors  
in key product categories, and for specialist digital 
and IT services. Failure of one of these businesses 
to deliver products or services would have  
a signiﬁcant impact on business operations.
The Group continues to strengthen its supply 
chain management function to enable it to evolve 
and develop its manufacturing base to reduce 
the dependency on key vendors. The Group has 
strengthened its internal Digital and IT teams during 
the year and continues to facilitate knowledge 
transfer to internal resources. Annual ﬁnancial 
checks are carried out on all key vendors.
Major incidents such as natural catastrophes, 
global pandemics or terrorist attacks affecting 
one or more of the Group’s key locations could 
signiﬁcantly impact its operations.
A major incident at a key location could signiﬁcantly 
impact business operations, the impact clearly 
varying depending on the location and its nature. 
The impact of the loss of a distribution hub would 
clearly differ from a global pandemic, but both 
would impact revenue and proﬁts.
Business continuity plans are in place to 
mitigate operational risks, but cannot ensure 
the uninterrupted operation of the business, 
particularly in the short term. The regional spread 
of the Group’s three key distribution hubs also 
helps to mitigate risk. There is a Group incident 
management framework in place that addresses 
the reporting and management of major incidents, 
and this is tested each year using third party 
specialists in this ﬁeld. Tailored plans have also 
been produced during the year for a number  
of high impact events.
Failure by the Group or associated third 
parties to act in accordance with ethical 
and environmental standards.
A failure to act appropriately could result in 
penalties, adverse press coverage and reputational 
damage with a resulting drop in sales and proﬁt.
A number of initiatives are in place, led by the 
Corporate Responsibility function. These include 
undertaking ethical trading audits and the Ethical 
Trading Initiative, further details of which are set  
out in the Great Brand, Great Company section.  Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 59
Risk Impact Mitigation
The Group’s operations are subject  
to a broad spectrum of regulatory  
requirements in the various jurisdictions  
in which the Group operates. The pace  
of change and the consistency of application  
of legislation can vary signiﬁcantly across  
these jurisdictions, particularly in an 
environment where public sector debt  
is often high and tax revenues are falling.
Failure to comply with these requirements 
could leave the Group open to civil and/or 
criminal legal challenge, signiﬁcant penalties 
and reputational damage.
The Group continually monitors and seeks to 
improve its processes to gain assurance that its 
licensees, suppliers, franchisees, distributors and 
agents comply with the Group’s contractual terms 
and conditions, its ethical and business policies 
and relevant legislation.
Specialist teams at Group and regional level, 
supported by third-party specialists where required 
are responsible for ensuring employees are aware 
of regulations relevant to their roles. A number  
of these teams have been strengthened during  
the year. Assurance processes are in place to 
monitor compliance with results being reported  
to the Group Risk and Audit Committees.
The signiﬁcant growth and pace of change 
within the business puts pressure on both 
internal and external resources.
Failure to effectively manage the pace of change 
will inevitably adversely impact the Group’s 
operations and return on investment.
Governance processes are in place for each major 
strategic initiative and these are supplemented  
by monthly meetings with senior management  
to review operational performance. Management 
and operational structures are continually reviewed 
to ensure that these support the Group’s growth.
A substantial proportion of Group proﬁts  
is reliant upon its licensed business in Japan 
and other key licensed product categories.
The Group expects licensees to maintain 
operational and ﬁnancial control over their 
businesses. Should licensees fail to manage their 
operations effectively or be affected by a major 
incident, the royalty income may decline directly 
impacting the proﬁts of the Group.
To minimise risks in Japan the Group has 
established its own operations in Tokyo, and there 
are minimum royalty payments speciﬁed in its 
licence agreements, including the apparel licence 
with Sanyo Shokai and Mitsui & Company. Under 
its licence agreements, the Group can control 
product development, marketing and distribution. 
Regular licensee royalty reviews take place to 
monitor compliance with licence terms, which 
can manage but not eliminate non-compliance.
The Group operates in a number of emerging 
markets which are typically more volatile  
than developed markets, and are subject  
to changing economic, regulatory, social  
and political developments that are beyond  
the Group’s control. Infrastructure and  
services also tend to be less developed.
Seizure of assets or staff. Related party business 
practice that is inconsistent with the Group’s ethical 
standards and the UK regulatory environment. 
Increased operational costs due to country speciﬁc 
processes driven by the regulatory environment.
The Group uses the services of professional 
consultants to advise on legal and regulatory issues 
when entering new markets, to undertake due 
diligence and to monitor on-going developments. 
The Group has continued to strengthen the teams 
responsible for its emerging markets operations 
and works with franchisees or partners who 
compensate for its relative lack of experience  
in a number of these markets.
Unauthorised use of the Group’s trademarks 
and other proprietary rights.
Trademarks and other intellectual property (IP) 
rights are fundamentally important to the Group’s 
reputation, success and competitive position. 
Unauthorised use of these, as well as the 
distribution of counterfeit products, damages  
the Burberry brand image and proﬁts.
The Group’s global Brand Protection team  
has continued to expand during the year  
to enable the Group to strengthen its brand 
protection efforts in a number of high risk markets. 
Where infringements are identiﬁed (often by 
working in partnership with other luxury brands) 
these are addressed through a mixture of criminal 
and civil legal action and negotiated settlement.
Given the Group’s emphasis on digital innovation 
the team place a particular focus on this area.
IP rights are driven largely by national laws 
which afford varying degrees of protection and 
enforcement priorities depending on the country. 
Consequently, the Group cannot necessarily be as 
effective in all jurisdictions in addressing IP issues.  Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 61

 The company’s innovative wellbeing programme was 
extended, with associates receiving beneﬁts ranging from 
additional annual leave, to free lunch, daily fruit bowls and 
health and sporting activities. Additional initiatives were 
designed and implemented by local teams, ensuring 
the programme offering was sensitively tailored to ﬁt the 
various cultural needs and expectations of nearly 9,500 
associates in 31 countries.
 As part of its commitment to promoting health, safety  
and wellbeing, Burberry continued using a third party  
to undertake audits at its locations throughout the world.  
This was supplemented by the global deployment  
of an incident reporting system during the year that 
incorporated accident and near miss reporting,  
and a series of control processes.
Reward
 Burberry continued to strengthen the link between  
reward and performance across the organisation.  
All associates are now in a bonus or incentive plan  
and share ownership was expanded through the global 
Free Share Plan, through which all associates are eligible 
to become shareholders in the company. Global take  
up of the Sharesave Scheme increased by 70%.
 The Icon Awards programme, which recognises 
exceptional performance at all levels of the company, 
reached its ﬁfth anniversary, with over 7,500 nominations 
received and 81 awards made globally, across categories 
inspired by the Burberry brand, heritage and core values. 
 The Long Service Awards programme recognised 
481 associates celebrating milestone ﬁve-year  
service anniversaries with Burberry. Eleven associates 
celebrated anniversaries of 30 years’ service or more.
Reinvent
 The company launched a full transformation of the global 
Human Resources organisational structure, centralising 
the operations team and creating global Centres of 
Expertise to move the value proposition from the purely 
functional to the strategic and transformational. This more 
integrated structure is enabling the company to develop 
consistent, scalable ways of working across functions 
and regions. 
People
Burberry recognises that its people are its greatest asset 
and constantly strives to attract the best talent worldwide, 
to provide meaningful development opportunities at all levels 
and to reward and recognise high performance. 
Recruit 
 Mid-year, Burberry established a new Resourcing Centre 
of Expertise, with a clear set of immediate and long-term 
targets. By evolving recruitment through a world-class 
resourcing team and leveraging digital across its 
recruitment activities, Burberry now has the potential to 
ﬁll positions faster and to reduce agency fees signiﬁcantly.
 Burberry maintained its commitment to diversity and 
equal opportunities in recruitment. Nationals of over 
100 countries are now employed across all continents, 
with an age span from 16 to 76. The diversity within 
the Burberry community underpins its energy, vibrancy 
and connectedness. 
 Burberry continued to help talented young people  
from all backgrounds onto the career ladder, with a new 
policy for work experience and internships supporting 
the professional development of young people in and 
after education. 
Retain
 Initiatives launched to enhance the development of 
the company’s highest potential associates through 
international networking opportunities, global strategy 
offsites, access to senior executives and leadership 
training workshops, all with the ultimate objective  
of creating next generation leaders for the business. 
A new Retail Exchange Programme enabled high 
achieving sales associates from different countries  
to temporarily swap roles and work locations, enhancing 
cultural understanding and service standards  
in Burberry stores, whilst providing unparalleled  
career development opportunities. Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 63
 Ethical trading was further integrated into Burberry teams’ 
daily decision making, with the Ethical Trading Initiative 
delivering training across the global sourcing and product 
development functions on ethical trading awareness and 
purchasing practices.
Connect
 Burberry extended its rollout of NGO-run conﬁdential 
worker hotlines to select suppliers, complementing its 
ongoing support of functioning and mature industrial 
relations as a sustainable way to protect rights in the 
workplace. Currently, around 18,000 workers globally  
have access to conﬁdential hotlines.
 In partnership with International Resources for Fairer 
Trade and the Centre for Child Rights and Corporate 
Social Responsibility, Burberry introduced new 
programmes to improve working conditions for migrant 
workers, including training in living and communication 
skills and local labour law.
 Burberry continued to connect and collaborate with peers 
and stakeholders, including through its membership of 
the tri-partite Ethical Trading Initiative, Business for Social 
Responsibility and the UN Global Compact.
Ethical trading 
Burberry expects all its suppliers to comply with local labour 
and environmental laws and the Burberry Ethical Trading 
Code of Conduct; to provide their workers with safe working 
conditions and fair pay; and to allow them to exercise their 
right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. 
Burberry is working with its suppliers to make meaningful 
improvements to workers’ employment and workplace 
conditions globally. Further information about Burberry’s 
commitment to good labour practices can be found at 
burberryplc.com.
Engage
 Burberry continued to engage with suppliers through 
its ethical trading programme, including announced 
and unannounced audits; continuous improvement 
programmes; and training and conﬁdential worker hotline 
services. Burberry once again recognised suppliers 
demonstrating leadership in ethical trading through 
awards at its annual Vendor Conference.
 Over 750 audits, supplier visits and training sessions  
were conducted globally.
Develop
 Burberry continued to provide suppliers with practical and 
classroom-based training on the Burberry Ethical Trading 
Code of Conduct and related activities, supported by 
human resource and management system improvement 
programmes. A new approach of ‘Supplier Ownership’ 
further supported suppliers in building their own capacity 
to take greater responsibility for ethical standards in their 
supply chains.

Great Brand, Great Company Continued
Engage
 Burberry continued to encourage its associates to dedicate 
up to four hours of paid leave per month in support of 
Burberry Foundation charity partners. Approximately 40% 
of employees based in locations with active volunteering 
programmes lent their personal talents, business skills 
and experience to inspire young people through more 
than 5,500 hours of volunteering support.
 Employability programmes were established in Hong 
Kong, New York and London, as well as in Yorkshire in 
the UK, where Burberry manufactures its heritage rainwear 
and weaves its traditional gabardine fabric. Delivered 
and supported by Burberry associates, the programmes 
heighten the creative conﬁdence, skills and aspirations  
of unemployed young people through an intensive training 
curriculum followed by up to 6 weeks of practical work 
experience. Already 70% of programme graduates have 
achieved positive outcomes, ﬁnding employment, enrolling 
in training or re-entering education. 
 Burberry associates in 27 locations participated in the 
company’s ﬁrst Global Volunteer Day, dedicating over 
2,000 hours to improving the lives of disadvantaged  
young people in their communities. Projects ranged from 
career workshops to community revitalisation activities.
Inspire
 The company continued to leverage its associates’ talents, 
passions, skills and experience to help young people 
achieve their full potential. More than 200 young students 
globally were mentored by a Burberry associate over the 
last year, in programmes ranging from three months to 
three years. Through these mainly one-on-one mentoring 
relationships, young people broadened their horizons, 
raised their aspirations and were inspired to realise 
their dreams.
Community
Investing and engaging in the communities where Burberry 
employees live and work, while leveraging core business 
competences and values, remains a key objective. 
Invest
 Burberry donated 1% of Group proﬁts before tax to 
charitable causes, the majority to the Burberry Foundation 
(UK registered charity number 1123102). The Foundation 
helps young people develop their skills, conﬁdence  
and connections, and since its establishment in 2008  
has supported 21 charity partners in 12 cities globally. In 
addition to ﬁnancial support, the Foundation made in-kind 
donations ranging from one-off gifts of non-trademark fabric 
and materials to assist young people enrolled in art and 
design courses, to the annual Christmas Coat Donation 
programme, beneﬁting 3,000 disadvantaged young 
people around the world.
 To support the next generation of creative talent, two 
multi-year scholarship funds were launched with the  
Royal College of Art in the UK and Ball State University  
in the United States.
 Following the severe drought affecting East Africa in 2011, 
Burberry and its employees contributed to the Disasters 
Emergency Committee to support the provision of life-saving 
aid. Burberry also continued to support Japan in the wake 
of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami through a 
donation to the Burberry Foundation to be used speciﬁcally 
to assist young people in the most impacted areas.

Sustainability
Burberry is committed to driving more sustainable 
outcomes throughout its global operations and engages 
with the FTSE4Good Index, Carbon Disclosure Project, 
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 
Forest Footprint Disclosure and Forum for the Future.
Product
 Burberry extended its efforts to safeguard high welfare 
standards by taking an active role in wider industry  
efforts to improve visibility in the exotics supply chain;  
site visits to better understand traceability in the fur 
industry; and communication of its Animal Sourcing 
Principles to all tanneries.
 A tannery assessment project was launched in Italy 
using the Leather Working Group protocol, reﬂecting the 
company’s increased focus on monitoring and improving 
the environmental management and traceability in its 
leather supply chain.
 Burberry continues to follow a policy of not knowingly 
using sandblasting for any of its denim products. 
 148 tonnes of European sample and raw material  
waste was shredded and reused in the automotive  
and construction industries. 
Process 
 A dedicated Sea Shipping Task Force worked with  
the Burberry supply chain to divert stock from air to sea, 
resulting in a 32% points increase in stock shipped by sea.
 Burberry reduced further the environmental impact  
of its supply chain activities. At the Castleford facility  
in Yorkshire, the energy used to produce each trench coat 
was reduced by 30%, while the newly-created European 
distribution hub will save an estimated 400 tonnes  
of carbon per year on key outbound lanes.

Property
 Burberry continues to increase its purchase of renewable 
electricity. All of its UK sites and 20% of those in the 
Americas are now powered in this way.
 Elevating the sustainability expertise of the Burberry 
Construction Team is crucial to the continued pursuit of 
more sustainable construction practices and more energy 
efﬁcient buildings. More than 40% of this team now holds 
a sustainable building certiﬁcation.
Governance
A global governance system enables connection and 
integration across Burberry’s global community on people, 
ethical trading, community investment and sustainability 
policies and initiatives.
The Chief Corporate Affairs Ofﬁcer is responsible for  
all ethical trading, community and sustainability matters  
and reports on these to the Group Risk Committee and the 
Board. He also chairs the Global Sustainability Committee 
and sits on the Supply Chain Risk Committee.
The Chief People Ofﬁcer supports the continued evolution of 
Burberry’s unique corporate culture in line with its core values.
Occupational health and safety compliance is reviewed 
tri-annually in stores and annually in ofﬁces and supply chain 
sites. All improvement plans are monitored by the Global 
Health and Safety Committee, which is chaired by the 
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer.

is passionate about attracting, developing and rewarding  
the most talented and skilled individuals, regardless of 
background. The Group encourages its employees to  
work across functions, geographies and cultures to enhance 
understanding and create a connected global community.  
As the Group continues to grow globally, it is building on  
its long-term commitment to diversity and inclusion – 
embracing the cultures of all the countries where we do 
business. Burberry is committed to making the necessary

Directors’ report continued
Employee involvement 
Employee communication 
The Group believes that employee communication is 
important in building strong relationships with, and in 
motivating and retaining, employees. The Group makes 
use of various methods and channels, all of which are 
implemented globally, including, face-to-face brieﬁngs, 
open discussion forums with senior management, email 
and a corporate intranet as well as a new internal social 
media platform, Burberry Chat. These enable all employees 
to connect, consult and collaborate globally, to ensure 
that matters of interest and importance are conveyed to 
employees quickly and effectively. In addition, quarterly 
updates which highlight the Group’s performance and 
its ongoing strategic initiatives are webcast globally. 
Furthermore, development of content such as videos 
and digital webpages to communicate key initiatives, 
events and other brand messages has further enhanced 
internal communication and the Burberry culture.
Employee share ownership 
The Group recognises the importance of good relationships 
with employees of all levels and runs incentive schemes 
and share ownership schemes for the beneﬁt of employees. 
Further details of these schemes are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 83 to 92. 
The Group again intends to grant during 2012/13 free  
share awards or cash-based awards to all eligible  
employees. The Group also intends, where possible,  
to invite employees to take part in the Sharesave Scheme.
Further details on the Group’s approach to employee 
involvement and communications are provided in the 
Great Brand, Great Company section on pages 61 to 65. 
Financial instruments 
The Group’s ﬁnancial risk management objectives and 
policies are set out within note 24 to the ﬁnancial statements. 
Note 24 also details the Group’s exposure to foreign 
exchange, share price, interest, credit and liquidity risks. 
These notes are incorporated by reference and are deemed 
to form part of this report. 
Creditor payment policy 
For all trade creditors, it is the Company’s policy to: 
 agree and conﬁrm the terms of payment at the 
commencement of business with that supplier; 
 pay in accordance with contractual and other legal 
obligations; and 
 continually review the payment procedures and liaise 
with suppliers as a means of eliminating difﬁculties  
and maintaining a good working relationship.
The Company had no trade creditors at 31 March 2012 
(2011: £nil). 
Signiﬁcant contracts – change of control 
Pursuant to the Companies Act 2006, the directors disclose 
that in the event of a change of control in the Company, the 
Group’s £300m Revolving Credit Facility (dated 28 March 
2011) could become repayable. 
In circumstances of change of control of the Company, 
Angela Ahrendts may terminate her employment. Her 
entitlement in respect of remuneration in such circumstances 
is set out on pages 87 to 88 of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and is the same as it would be if her service agreement 
is terminated where the Remuneration Committee determines 
that Angela Ahrendts’ performance does not meet the 
ﬁnancial expectations of the Board or shareholders. 
In circumstances where the Company’s shares cease to be 
listed, Stacey Cartwright may terminate her employment on 
three months’ notice and would be entitled to her base salary 
for a period of nine months following termination. 
Details of the service agreements of the executive  
directors are set out on pages 87 to 88 of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. 
The provisions of the Company’s employee share plans may 
cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest 
upon a change of control.  Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 73
Essential contracts 
The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with 
suppliers (both of goods and services), wholesale customers, 
licensees who manufacture and distribute products using 
the Burberry trademarks, subsidiary partners and franchisees. 
In addition, the Group occupies leasehold premises for  
the purpose of conducting its business. Whilst these 
arrangements are important to the business of the Group, 
individually none of them are essential to the business  
of the Group and do not require disclosure under section 
417(5)(c) of the Companies Act 2006.
Independent Auditors 
In accordance with section 418(2) of the Companies Act 
2006, each of the Company’s directors in ofﬁce as at the 
date of this report conﬁrms that: 
 so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors  
are unaware; and 
 he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to 
have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
The Group’s auditors are PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . 
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
auditors to the Company will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. 
Note 5 in the ﬁnancial statements states the auditors’  
fees both for audit and non-audit work. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Financial review on pages 46  
to 52, along with details of the Group’s cash ﬂows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities. Financial risk management 
objectives, details of ﬁnancial instruments and hedging 
activities, and exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk  
are described in note 24.
The directors have reviewed the Group’s forecasts and 
projections. These include the assumptions around the 
Group’s products and markets, expenditure commitments, 
expected cash ﬂows and borrowing facilities. Taking into 
account reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
and after making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly the directors consider 
it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Annual General Meeting 
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at 
the ofﬁces of Slaughter and May, One Bunhill Row, London, 
EC1Y 8YY commencing at 9.30am on Thursday, 12 July 
2012. The Notice of this year’s Annual General Meeting 
will be available to view on the Company’s website at  
burberryplc.com. 
The directors consider that each of the proposed resolutions 
to be considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the 
best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole 
and are most likely to promote the success of the Company 
for the beneﬁt of its shareholders as a whole. The directors 
unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour  
of each of the proposed resolutions, as the directors intend 
to do in respect of their own shareholdings.

Corporate governance
Dear Shareholder, 
Good corporate governance is important to support the 
delivery of the Group’s ﬁve key strategic themes and ensure 
long term sustainable value for our shareholders. However  
as a Board we believe that good governance is also about 
being a great company and that our role is to support and 
encourage the evolution of the business in ways which reﬂect 
our core values of Protect, Explore and Inspire – both for 
those within the Company and those with whom we connect.
The growth of the Group’s business continues to be dynamic 
despite the current uncertain global economic and political 
climate. Consequently the Board’s focus during the year has 
been on the execution of the Group’s strategy, identiﬁcation 
and mitigation of risk, ensuring that the Group’s controls and 
infrastructure are appropriate in the context of the Group’s 
continuing growth, and that the Group attracts and retains 
the right senior talent (including on the Board) to secure the 
future of the Company.
The Board welcomed Lord Davies’ report entitled “Women 
on Boards”. We are proud of the fact that the Company is 
diverse and not only in terms of gender. Diversity is at the 
heart of our culture and brand which is characterised by a 
democratic and meritocratic ethos. Our Board succession 
planning is focused on ensuring the right mix of skills and 
experience for the Board with due regard for the beneﬁts 
of diversity, including gender.
The debate over good corporate governance continues 
at a national, EU and international level. I believe that this 
dialogue is important and that as a global company it is 
our responsibility to practice high standards of corporate 
governance and to promote such standards wherever 
we operate.
This report sets out the Board’s approach and work  
during the ﬁnancial year 2011/12 and, together with  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 83 to 92, 
includes details of how we applied and complied with the 
principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The Group complied with the provisions of the Code 
throughout the year.
The Board and I will endeavour to ensure the Group’s 
continued success as a dynamic and well governed  
business over the coming year.
Sir John Peace
Chairman
Governance
“The Board is collectively responsible for promoting 
the success of the Company, and is accountable to 
shareholders for ensuring that the Company achieves 
its strategic objectives and is appropriately managed.”
Our Board
The Board currently consists of eight members – the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer and ﬁve independent non-executive directors.  
A list of individual directors and their biographies is  
set out on page 68.
The Chairman, Sir John Peace, has led the Board as 
Chairman since 2002. The Chairman is responsible for 
leading and managing the business of the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness. He sets the agenda for Board 
discussions and ensures that the Board receives accurate, 
timely and clear information, particularly in relation to the 
Company’s performance. He promotes an open culture 
which allows for debate and constructive challenge of the 
executive directors.
The Chairman works collaboratively with the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer, Angela Ahrendts, in setting the Board agenda and 
ensuring any actions agreed by the Board are effectively 
implemented.
During the year, the Chairman maintained regular contact 
and met with the Senior Independent Director and other 
non-executive directors outside of formal board meetings. 
The Chairman also met with the non-executive directors 
without the executive directors being present.
The Chairman is also responsible for the Company’s 
performance to shareholders and has frequent discussions 
with the Company’s main institutional shareholders.
The major commitments of the Chairman are detailed in his 
biography on page 68 and have not changed during the year.
The Senior Independent Director, Philip Bowman, 
supports the Chairman in his role and leads the non-executive 
directors in the oversight of the Chairman. The Senior 
Independent Director is also available as an additional point 
of contact for shareholders.
The Non-Executive Directors provide strong experience 
and independent support to the Board. They assist in the 
development of strategy and provide constructive challenge 
and support to management.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Angela Ahrendts, is 
responsible for the management of the business, developing 
the Group’s strategic direction for consideration and approval 
by the Board and implementing the agreed strategy. The 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is assisted by members of her senior 
management team who meet regularly. Members of the 
senior management team are identiﬁed on page 153. Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 75
 through discussion at Board meetings where management 
are challenged on the performance of the Group;
 by evaluating the Group’s progress on achieving  
its ﬁve strategic objectives; and
 by monitoring, including through the Board Committees, 
the signiﬁcant risks facing the Group.
The matters reserved for the Board’s decision are set 
out in writing and available on the Company’s website  
at burberryplc.com.
Role of the Board Committees
The Board is supported in the activities set out above by 
a number of committees including the following principal 
committees: Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and 
Remuneration Committee. All the non-executive directors 
are members of each of the principal committees of the 
Board. The Board believes this to be appropriate as the 
Board remains relatively small and ensures the linkage 
between the work of the Committees and the Board. 
The terms of reference of each of the principal 
committees can be viewed on the Company’s website 
at burberryplc.com.
The Committees, if they consider it necessary, can engage 
third-party consultants and independent professional advisors 
and can call upon other resources of the Group to assist them 
in developing their respective roles. In addition to the relevant 
committee members and the Company Secretary, external 
advisors and, on occasion, other directors and members  
of the senior management team attend committee meetings 
but only at the invitation of the Chairmen of the Committees.
Set out on pages 80 to 82 are reports from the Audit and 
Nomination Committees. The report of the Remuneration 
Committee is set out on pages 83 to 92.
Role of the Board
“Developing and reﬁning our strategy is key to our 
future success. As a Board we need to understand  
the competitive landscape, monitor emerging trends  
and keep updated on the Group’s operations. 
 
The Company has experienced – and is continuing to 
experience – a period of considerable growth. With this 
success comes a responsibility for the Board to ensure 
we grow in a controlled and sustainable way for our 
shareholders and wider stakeholders, and that we 
understand the risks to achieving this objective.”
The Board is ultimately responsible for the activities of the 
Group – its governance, strategy, risk management and 
performance. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is accountable for, 
and reports to the Board on, the performance of the business.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved 
for its decision which includes:
 the Group’s business strategy;
 the annual budget and operating plans;
 matters materially affecting the reputation or ﬁnancial 
position of the Group;
 major capital expenditure, acquisitions and  
divestments, licensing and franchise transactions  
above deﬁned thresholds; 
 the systems of corporate governance, internal control 
and risk management;
 the approval of the interim and annual ﬁnancial 
statements; and
 the determination of any interim dividend  
and the recommendation of the ﬁnal dividend.
The Board monitors the performance of the Group:

Highlights of Board and Committee activities
The Board has spent time on the following matters 
(amongst others) during the year:
 Continued evolution of the Board’s oversight of the 
strategic plan – the Board participated in a two day 
interactive session with management on strategy. 
Strategic updates are regularly included on the Board 
agenda giving the Board the opportunity to discuss 
progress against the strategic plan and new strategic 
opportunities.
 Continued focus on balancing the prevailing external 
conditions and the achievement of the strategic plan and 
budget objectives – the Board considered the particular 
risks which could impact on the strategy and/or 
business model.
 Continued focus on the evolution of the Company’s risk 
management systems and internal control framework, 
largely through the work of the Audit Committee.
 Monitoring of policies and procedures in relation to the 
UK Bribery Act, health and safety and governance.
 Continued improvement in understanding of the business, 
the competitive landscape and emerging trends – the 
Board engaged with senior management below Board 
level on key areas of the business such as its digital 
evolution and product and licensing development. It also 
obtained external expert perspectives on issues facing 
the business such as the current political and economic 
outlook. In April 2012 the Board visited Asia, one of the 
Company’s key strategic markets, to view its operations 
and better understand the market.
 Continued focus on the retention and incentivisation 
of executive directors and senior management through 
the work of the Remuneration Committee.
 Continued consideration of Board and Committee 
composition and senior executive succession.
Time allocation
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of 
appointment which sets out the terms and conditions of  
his or her directorship. The Chairman and the non-executive 
directors are expected to devote such time as is necessary 
for the proper performance of their duties. This is expected  
to be approximately 20 days each year for basic duties. 
The Chairman and Senior Independent Director are expected 
to spend additional time over and above this to discharge 
their added responsibilities.
During the year the Board held six scheduled meetings  
and one additional meeting, including an in depth two day 
session on strategic matters. The Board spent ﬁve days 
visiting Asia in April 2012. Between meetings directors spend  
a signiﬁcant amount of time on Board and Committee related 
matters. The Board considers that it met sufﬁciently often 
to enable the directors to discharge their duties effectively.
The table below gives details of directors’ attendance at 
Board and Committee meetings during the ﬁnancial year 
ended 31 March 2012.

External directorships
The Board’s executive directors are permitted to hold only 
one non-executive directorship of a FTSE 100 company. 
Details of the directors’ other directorships can be found 
in their biographies on page 68.
Board effectiveness
“As a Board we strive to provide effective leadership that 
supports the Company’s ﬁve strategic themes and accords 
with the Company’s core values – to protect, explore, and 
inspire. To do this we must remain an open, dynamic, 
connected and collaborative team.”
Composition and succession
The non-executive directors are drawn from a wide range  
of industries and backgrounds, including banking and 
ﬁnancial services, hotels and hospitality, marketing, broadcast 
and media. They have appropriate experience of complex 
organisations with global reach including experience  
of the Group’s key markets of Europe, the Americas and 
Asia. Their varied yet relevant experience brings a wealth  
of insight to Board discussions and important support to the 
management team. All the directors will stand for re-election 
at the upcoming Annual General Meeting on 12 July 2012.
The Board aims to continuously refresh its membership  
to ensure that it reﬂects the growth proﬁle of the business. 
However this needs to be balanced over time to ensure that 
it can draw on the valuable experience of its longer serving 
directors, particularly given the signiﬁcant continuing growth 
of the business and the current volatile macro-economic 
and global environment.
In relation to Board Committee succession matters,  
on 22 May David Tyler resigned as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, with effect from the close  
of the Group’s upcoming Annual General Meeting.  
Sir John Peace has also resigned as a member of the 
Committee with effect from the close of the Annual General 
Meeting. The Board has appointed Ian Carter as the new 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. David Tyler  
will continue to serve as a member of the Committee.
Corporate governance continued Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 77
 the Board’s role in overseeing the strategic plan was 
rated highly and had improved signiﬁcantly over the last 
few years;
 the increased use of informal meetings, presentations from 
senior management and the visit to the businesses in Asia, 
were all positive developments;
 the annual cycle of Board and Committee work and 
information provided was appropriate and well planned; 
and
 Board and Committee performance in managing principal 
risks was rated highly.
Following its discussion the Board agreed the following 
recommendations:
 whilst the current composition of the Board was 
considered appropriate, the Board should plan for the next 
few years to build on its relevant skills and competencies. 
It was identiﬁed that the future addition of a director with 
experience of operating in Asia and/or Emerging Markets 
would be beneﬁcial;
 the Board should continue to strengthen its contribution 
and impact on overseeing strategy including by affording 
more opportunities throughout the year to engage with 
senior management responsible for key elements of the 
business and strategy; and 
 the Board should continue to consider its approach to 
assessing Board and Committee effectiveness to ensure 
that the Group’s approach to this remained meaningful 
and reﬂective of the unique and collaborative nature  
of the Board.
The non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Director, also considered the performance of the Chairman 
without the Chairman present. They conﬁrmed that the 
Chairman’s leadership, performance and overall contribution 
were of a high standard.
Information ﬂow and professional development
The Chairman works closely with the Company Secretary 
to ensure that the Board is supplied in a timely manner with 
information in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable 
it to effectively discharge its duties. During the year the 
Company introduced the provision of Board papers and 
additional information via iPad to allow for easy and instant 
access to a wide range of information.
The Board is kept up to date on legal, regulatory and 
governance matters through advice and regular papers 
from the Company Secretary, the General Counsel and 
other advisers. During the year the Board was briefed 
on boardroom diversity, various developments in narrative 
and risk reporting and executive remuneration, compliance 
with the UK Bribery Act 2010, and other developments 
in corporate governance reporting.
During the recent independent investor audit (as referred to 
in “Engagement with shareholders” on page 78 below), the 
view was expressed that the current Board provides a good 
balance and support to the management team.
During the year, the Board (through the Nomination 
Committee) focused on its future composition in relation 
to both executive and non-executive succession planning. 
It concluded that whilst the current composition of the Board 
remained appropriate, the Board should continue to build 
on its relevant skills and competencies for the future. It was 
identiﬁed that the future addition of a director with experience 
of operating in Asia and/or Emerging Markets would  
be beneﬁcial and this is something the Board will focus  
on in the coming months.
Diversity and inclusion
The Board welcomed Lord Davies’ report entitled  
“Women on Boards”. The Company is proud of the fact  
that it is diverse, not only in terms of gender. Diversity is  
at the heart of the culture and brand which is characterised  
by a democratic and meritocratic ethos.
At our Group headquarters in London, 54 different nationalities 
are represented and approximately 70% of the total  
workforce is female. Of the eight directors on the Board,  
three are women including both of the executive directors. 
Approximately 35% of management are female.
The Company continues to focus on its recruitment strategies 
and cultural values to ensure it recruits and retains a talented 
workforce operating in an inclusive and diverse environment. 
Board succession planning is focused on ensuring the right 
mix of skills and experience for the Board with due regard 
for the beneﬁts of diversity, including gender.
Evaluating our performance
The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance  
and that of its committees each ﬁnancial year, with an external 
evaluation once every three years. During the year an 
internally facilitated review by way of an online questionnaire 
was undertaken. Feedback from the evaluation was provided 
in the form of a written report to the Board followed by a 
discussion of the outcomes, led by the Chairman. In 2010/11 
an externally facilitated review of the Board’s effectiveness 
was facilitated by Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review.
Consistent with Dr Long’s ﬁndings last year, the review 
concluded that the Board was highly effective, the size and 
continuity of the Board was felt to encourage open and, 
where necessary, robust debate. The review identiﬁed that 
the Board had a number of key strengths, including:
 the small size and open culture of the Board encouraged 
discussion and debate, fostered by the Chairman who 
is viewed as a strong and positive inﬂuence and a great 
ambassador for the Group;
 the Board operated effectively as currently composed 
with a diversity of skills and very good knowledge  
of the business and management; 78 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
The Company Secretary assists the Chairman in designing 
and facilitating a tailored induction programme for new 
directors and their on-going training. The Chairman reviews 
training needs with directors on an annual basis as part 
of the performance evaluation process.
The Board have direct access to the advice and services  
of the Company Secretary and the appointment and removal 
of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board 
as a whole. Directors may also obtain, in the furtherance  
of their duties, independent professional advice, if necessary, 
at the Group’s expense.
Re-election of directors
At the Annual General Meeting in 2011, all directors offered 
themselves for re-election. Each director was re-elected 
and no director received less than 94% in favour of the 
votes cast. At the Annual General Meeting in 2012, all of 
the directors will again retire and all will offer themselves 
for re-election.
The Board believes that each of the directors standing 
for re-election continue to be effective and accordingly, 
the Board recommends that shareholders approve the 
resolutions to be proposed at the 2012 Annual General 
Meeting relating to the re-election of the directors.
Board tenure
0-5 years
5-10 years
10 years or above
The balance of tenure of service of the directors is set out in 
the diagram above. At the time of the 2012 Annual General 
Meeting, Sir John Peace, Philip Bowman and David Tyler 
will have served on the Board for ten years. The performance 
of Philip Bowman and David Tyler has been subject to a 
rigorous review including with regard to their independence. 
The Board has concluded that they continue to provide 
independent and constructive challenge to the executive 
directors and remain effective non-executive directors. 
As discussed under “Board Composition and Succession” 
above, these directors bring valuable insight, experience 
and balance to the Board’s deliberations. 
Managing conﬂicts of interest
All directors have a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to 
avoid a situation in which they have, or could have, a direct 
or indirect conﬂict of interest or possible conﬂict of interest 
with the Group.
Under the Group’s Articles of Association, the Board has  
the authority to approve such “situational” conﬂicts of  
interest and has adopted procedures to manage and,  
where appropriate, to approve such conﬂicts. Authorisations 
granted by the Board are recorded by the Company 
Secretary in a register and are noted by the Board  
at its next meeting.
A review of situational conﬂicts which have been authorised 
is undertaken by the Board annually. Following the last 
review, the Board concluded that the conﬂicts had been 
appropriately authorised and that the process for 
authorisation continued to operate effectively.
Engagement with shareholders
The Board believes that effective leadership also involves 
maintaining an open and constructive dialogue with 
shareholders and other stakeholders, and seeks to achieve 
this in various ways including at the Annual General Meeting.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Executive Vice President, 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer give live presentations to institutional 
shareholders and analysts immediately following the release 
of the half and full year results which are then made available 
on the Group’s website at burberryplc.com. The Group’s 
Investor Relations department acts as the centre for ongoing 
communications with investors and analysts.
The Chairman also maintains a regular dialogue with major 
shareholders to hear their views and discuss issues of 
mutual importance and communicates their views to the 
other members of the Board. The Senior Independent 
Director and all the other non-executive directors are available 
to meet with shareholders. The Group also carried out an 
independent investor audit of its major investors through 
Makinson Cowell, a capital markets advisory ﬁrm, to gauge 
investor perception.
Effective internal controls
The Group has a clear and consistent strategy as reﬂected 
in its ﬁve key strategic themes. The strategy has been 
developed to exploit identiﬁed opportunities through a 
diversiﬁed business model. Where material risks have been 
identiﬁed within our business, the Group has implemented 
an appropriate internal control environment to endeavour 
to mitigate such risks.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal controls and risk management, and it discharges 
its duties in this area by:
 determining the nature and extent of the signiﬁcant  
risks it is willing to take in achieving the Group’s  
strategic objectives; and
 ensuring that management implement effective systems 
of risk identiﬁcation, assessment and mitigation. 
Corporate governance continued Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 79
and budget are agreed with the Board together with deﬁned 
performance targets and risks to delivery. The plan and the 
principal risks for delivering the strategy also form part of 
the Board’s annual review of Group strategy. The Audit 
Committee also plays a key role by reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal controls and risk management.
Executive management assess risk on a regular basis  
through the Group Risk Committee which meets at least 
three times per year and reports any key ﬁndings to the  
Audit Committee. The Group Risk Committee evaluates  
risk through reports made to it by Internal Audit and  
Risk Assurance and other assurance teams and 
management committees. The Committee beneﬁts  
from cross functional membership encompassing senior 
management of key areas such as IT, Finance, Legal,  
Brand Protection, Company Secretariat, Corporate 
Responsibility, Human Resources, Supply Chain and  
a number of assurance functions. These meetings  
are attended by the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and/or the  
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer as well as the Director of Audit  
and Risk Assurance.
The executive directors also meet with senior management 
on a monthly basis to discuss performance, operational and 
budget issues to identify any emerging risks to achieving the 
strategic plan.
All internal audit activity is conducted by the Internal Audit 
team under the leadership of the Director of Audit and Risk 
Assurance, who reports to the Executive Vice President, 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, but also has an independent reporting 
line to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. In the light of 
Internal Audit’s recommendations, management agrees and 
implements corrective action plans, which are tracked to 
completion by Internal Audit, with the results reported to 
executive management, the Audit Committee and the Board.
As part of the Board’s consideration of the principal risks 
facing the Group, Internal Audit and Risk Assurance facilitate 
a risk assessment process in each key business area and 
global support function to review the signiﬁcant risks facing 
its operations and to record the relevant controls and any 
actions in place to mitigate the risks. The materiality of the 
risk is measured based on ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial criteria, 
and the probability of the risk arising is also mapped. The 
detailed assessments are then consolidated to provide input 
into the Group risk assessment. This process also enables 
Internal Audit and Risk Assurance to engage with senior 
management throughout the business on risk monitoring 
and management.
Financial reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and  
maintaining adequate internal controls over ﬁnancial 
reporting. These controls are designed to provide  
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial 
reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for 
external reporting purposes.
The Audit Committee has been delegated the responsibility 
for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls. 
The Audit Committee uses information drawn from a number 
of different sources to carry out this review including;
 Internal Audit provides objective assurance through 
its annual work plan which is approved by the Audit 
Committee and focuses on the principal risks identiﬁed 
in the risk assessment and key internal controls; 
 regular reports to the Audit Committee from executive 
management and key Group support functions detailing 
their risk management and compliance approaches  
and highlighting any signiﬁcant issues;
 key outcomes from discussions at the Group Risk 
Committee; and
 further objective assurance is provided by external auditors.
The internal control framework has been in operation for the 
whole of the year under review and continues to operate up 
to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The system of internal controls is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of not achieving business objectives, 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
There are areas of the Group’s business where it is necessary 
to take risks to achieve a satisfactory return for shareholders 
so long as such risks reﬂect the Board’s overall appetite for 
risk. It is the Group’s objective to apply expertise to prudently 
manage rather than eliminate such risks including keeping 
them under constant review.
The Board, through the Audit Committee, has reviewed 
the assessment of risks and the Group’s internal control 
framework and has considered the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control in operation in the Group for the 
year covered by the Annual Report and up to the date of its 
approval by the Board. The process followed by the Board 
in reviewing the system of internal controls accords with  
the Turnbull guidance. It also accords with the provisions  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
For details of the principal risks which may adversely impact 
the management of the Group and the execution of its 
growth strategies and the steps the Group takes to address 
these risks (where they are matters within Group control), 
see the Principal Risks section on pages 56 to 59.
Managing risks
The Group has an integrated approach to risk management 
and internal controls to ensure that its review of risk is 
used to inform the internal audit process and the design 
of internal controls.
A detailed three year strategic plan and annual budget 
process provides the principal metrics against which the 
performance of the Group is measured. The strategic plan  80 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
The Group has comprehensive planning, budgeting, 
forecasting and monthly reporting processes in place. 
A summary of Group ﬁnancial results supported by 
commentary and performance measures is provided 
to the Board each month.
In relation to the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial 
statements, the controls in place include:
 a centre of expertise responsible for reviewing new 
developments in reporting requirements and standards 
to ensure that these are reﬂected in Group accounting 
policies;
 a dedicated ﬁnance governance team who are responsible 
for developing the Group’s ﬁnancial control processes and 
procedures and implementing them across the Group; and
 a global ﬁnance structure consisting of employees with  
the appropriate expertise to ensure that Group policies and 
procedures are correctly applied. Effective management 
and control of the ﬁnance structure is achieved through 
the ﬁnance leadership team, consisting of key ﬁnance 
employees from the regional and corporate centre.
The reporting process is supported by transactional and 
consolidation ﬁnance systems. Reviews of the applications  
of controls for external reporting purposes are carried out 
by senior ﬁnance management. The results of these reviews 
are considered by the Board as part of its monitoring  
of the performance of controls around ﬁnancial reporting.
The Audit Committee reviews the application of ﬁnancial 
reporting standards and any signiﬁcant accounting 
judgements made by management.
Control environment 
The Group’s business model is based on a central design, 
supply chain and distribution operation to source products 
to global markets, via retail and wholesale channels.  
This is reﬂected in the internal control framework which 
includes central direction, resource allocation, oversight  
and risk management of the key activities of marketing, 
inventory management, brand and technology development. 
This includes central support in relation to legal, human 
resources, information systems and ﬁnancial practice.
The Group has established procedures for the delegation 
of authorities to ensure that approval for matters that are 
considered signiﬁcant is considered at an appropriate level, 
either because of their value or the impact on the Group. In 
addition the Group has policies and procedures in place that 
are designed to support risk management across the Group. 
These authorities, policies and procedures are being kept 
under review as the Group continues to grow. These include 
policies relating to treasury, the conduct of employees  
and third parties with which the Group conducts business 
and prohibiting bribery and corruption, amongst others.
Accountability and audit
The Board is required to present a balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s position and 
prospects in the Annual Report and in interim and other 
public reports. The Board is satisﬁed that it has met this 
obligation. A summary of the directors’ responsibilities for 
the ﬁnancial statements is set out on page 94 and includes 
a statement regarding the Group’s status as a going 
concern as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Report of the Auditors on page 95 includes a statement 
by the auditors concerning their reporting responsibilities.
Report of the Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder, 
 
The role of the Audit Committee is to monitor the integrity of 
ﬁnancial information and to provide assurance to the Board 
that the Company’s internal controls and risk management 
systems are appropriate and regularly reviewed.
The Committee continues to focus on ensuring that the 
Group’s systems and controls are operating effectively, are 
evolving in line with the Group’s growth and are responsive 
the demands of the external operating environment.  
This will remain a priority for the coming year.
In addition to the usual work of the Committee (as set out 
below), during the year the Committee focused on other 
matters, including:
 evaluating and taking into account any movements in 
Group risks when considering budgets and forecasts that 
support going concern and impairment assessments;
 monitoring and seeking assurance that any effects on the 
Group’s business arising from the volatility in the economic 
environment (including supply of credit, bad debtors and 
reliance on key vendors) are being closely monitored;
 monitoring and seeking assurance of the continual 
improvement of the risk and control environment  
across the Group;
 considering Internal Audit and Risk Assurance ﬁndings 
and recommendations, and monitoring management 
responses and progress on implementing remedial actions;
 monitoring the establishment of the Group’s anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption policies and procedures and the 
on-going evolution of these against best practice; and
 considering the risks of the Group’s dependency on digital 
technology and Group policies to mitigate these risks.
As a Committee we are fortunate that we beneﬁt from  
a constructive and open relationship with management  
and we thank them for their assistance during the year.

External auditors
The Committee oversees the work undertaken by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers. During the year the Committee 
met with the external auditors without members of 
management being present.
Appointment and fees
The Committee has primary responsibility for making a 
recommendation on the appointment, re-appointment and 
removal of the external auditors. The Committee assesses 
on an annual basis the qualiﬁcations, expertise, resources and 
independence of the external auditors and the effectiveness 
of the previous audit process. Over the course of the year, 
the Committee has reviewed the audit process and the quality 
and experience of the audit partners engaged in the audit.
The Committee also reviewed the proposed audit fee and 
terms of engagement for the 2011/12 ﬁnancial year. Details  
of the fees paid to the external auditors during the ﬁnancial 
year can be found in note 5 in the ﬁnancial statements.
PricewaterhouseCoopers have remained in place as auditors 
since prior to the IPO of the Company in 2002. They were  
re-appointed following an audit tender process undertaken 
by the Group for the 2010/11 ﬁnancial year. The external 
auditors are required to rotate the audit engagement partner 
every ﬁve years. The current audit partner commenced  
his engagement for the 2010/11 ﬁnancial year and is not 
subject to rotation until after the audit of the Group’s ﬁnancial 
statements for the 2014/15 ﬁnancial year has been concluded.
During the year, the Committee approved the  
re-appointment, remuneration and terms of engagement  
of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Group’s statutory  
auditor. The Committee recommended to the Board that  
it proposes to shareholders that PricewaterhouseCoopers  
be re-appointed as the Group’s external auditors at the  
Group’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Non-audit services
The Committee recognises that the independence of the 
auditors is an essential part of the audit framework and  
the assurance that it provides. The Committee has adopted  
a policy which sets out certain principles which the Group 
should follow in relation to the engagement of the Group’s 
auditors for non-audit services.
Under the policy, the auditors may provide non-audit services 
that do not conﬂict with their independence, subject to prior 
approval as set out in the policy. Proposed fees above a 
certain level must be approved by the Audit Committee.  
Such fees must be activity based and not success related.  
At the half year and year end, the Audit Committee reviews  
all non-audit services provided by the auditors during  
the period and the fees relating to such services. If during  
the year Group expenditure for non-audit services exceeds  
£1m, all further requests for work must be referred to the 
Chairman of the Committee.

Directors’ remuneration report
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2012 which has been prepared 
by the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) and approved by the Board. 
2011/12 has presented a challenging external environment for Burberry given economic conditions and world events. 
The global economic outlook remains uncertain. The level of executive pay has been under intense scrutiny with various 
reform proposals made across the political spectrum. The Committee understands the public concern where pay is awarded 
in the absence of good performance, but it believes that management should be rewarded where there has been genuine 
achievement and exceptionally where there has been exceptional performance. We believe that this approach is in the best 
interests of Burberry and its shareholders. 
Against this backdrop, Burberry has continued its strong growth trajectory, with another year of record proﬁts. This sustained 
growth is the result of our strategic investment in the Brand.
Shareholders have had exceptional returns. In the ﬁve years to 31 March 2012, Burberry’s share price has increased by 129% 
and Adjusted Proﬁt Before Tax grew by £192m. An investor with 100 Burberry shares worth £653 on 1 April 2007 would at 31 
March 2012 have a shareholding worth £1,676 which represents a 157% return on investment (assuming dividends are 
reinvested in Burberry shares).
The Committee aims to ensure that directors’ and senior executives’ remuneration is globally competitive so as to attract and 
retain high calibre individuals and is strongly aligned to performance and a sustainable increase in shareholder value. Taking 
all the factors into account and the overall levels of reward delivered in the year, the Committee did not make grants to senior 
executives under the Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan (the “RSP”) in 2011/12, nor did it increase the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer’s base salary. In addition, the performance condition for the vesting of the matching shares under the 
Burberry Co-Investment Plan (the “CIP”) was increased so as to be made more challenging.
The Group’s remuneration policy is set out on page 85 and the current intention is that this will continue to be the policy for the 
coming year. However, the Committee reviews the policy on a regular basis, taking into account the performance and growth 
of the business and the global luxury goods sector. The Committee also considers the Group’s policy against regulatory 
developments, shareholder expectations and global market practice.
I have decided to step down as Chairman of the Committee, after ﬁve years in that position. I believe that it is important for  
the Committee to be refreshed from time to time to continue to demonstrate its ongoing independence. While I will continue to 
serve as a member of the Committee, Ian Carter will suceed me as Chairman with effect from the close of the Group’s Annual 
General Meeting in July. I would like to thank shareholders for their support and I am sure that under Ian’s chairmanship the 
Committee will continue its responsive and responsible approach to remuneration which has served shareholders well.
David Tyler
Chairman, Remuneration Committee

Role of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman of the Board and 
monitors the level and structure of senior executive pay. The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Group’s 
website at burberryplc.com. 
The Board reviewed the performance of the Committee in the year. This review concluded that the Committee operated 
independently and effectively. The Board believes that the collective experience of its members enables the Committee  
to give a balanced view on remuneration matters. 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Board as a whole. No director is involved in any discussions 
as to their own remuneration. During the year, the Committee met formally on two occasions. Details of attendance at those 
meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 76.

Directors’ remuneration report continued Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 85
At the invitation of the Committee, except where their own remuneration was being discussed, Angela Ahrendts (Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer), Stacey Cartwright (Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer), Michael Mahony (Chief Corporate 
Affairs Ofﬁcer & General Counsel), Anne-Soline Thorndike (Vice President – Reward and Recognition) and Catherine 
Sukmonowski (Company Secretary) attended Committee meetings during the period under review and provided advice 
that materially assisted the Committee.
In 2011, the Committee appointed Towers Watson as advisor. Towers Watson provides advice on the ongoing operation 
of employee and executive share plans together with advice on executive remuneration. A term of the engagement between 
the Committee and Towers Watson is that any additional consulting services provided by Towers Watson to management  
are reported on a regular basis to the Committee. Where an actual or potential conﬂict may occur, such work is agreed  
by the Chairman of the Committee prior to commencement. Since appointment, Towers Watson has provided market 
benchmarking information to management in relation to a small number of roles which fall below the remit of Committee 
review. Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group, which is responsible for the development  
and maintenance of the voluntary Code of Conduct that clearly sets out the role of executive remuneration consultants  
and the professional standards by which they advise their clients.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee believes the Group’s remuneration should be internationally competitive and strongly linked to performance, 
taking into account the global markets in which it operates. The Group’s remuneration policy is based on the following 
principles:
 Shareholder value: remuneration should be closely aligned with long term value creation for shareholders through 
thoughtful selection of performance measures (as described on the following pages), emphasis on variable pay and 
delivery of a signiﬁcant proportion of remuneration in shares, some of which are expected to be retained in accordance 
with the Group’s shareholding policy;
 Linked to success of the business: the overall remuneration framework should provide a balance between short and 
long term business objectives. Variable pay for executive directors includes (1) an annual cash bonus based on Adjusted 
Proﬁt Before Tax as per the audited income statement (‘Adjusted PBT’), and (2) long-term share-based incentives linked 
primarily to increases in shareholder value and growth in Adjusted PBT; and 
 Competitive in the global talent market: total remuneration should be sufﬁcient to attract, motivate and retain exceptional 
talent within the global luxury goods sector. Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is therefore 
benchmarked against Burberry’s main global competitors and comparable UK companies. The Committee recognises that, 
for each executive, the relative importance of each of these benchmarks may be different. Beneﬁts are based on competitive 
market practice for each executive, depending on individual circumstances. 
The principle of shareholder alignment is reﬂected throughout the organisation through our all employee share plans, which  
are where possible extended to all eligible Burberry employees globally. 
During its deliberations on executive remuneration, the Committee considered the reward framework for all employees 
worldwide, ensuring that the principles stated therein are consistent with the executive remuneration policy. Merit increases 
awarded to executives also occur within the broader all employee structure, and executive share plans are extended through 
the organisation to senior executives and high potential employees where appropriate. Details of the remuneration policy  
for the Chairman and non-executive directors are set out on page 91.
Remuneration structure
Remuneration is structured such that for executive directors and other senior executives, performance-related elements 
represent the majority of total potential remuneration. 86 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
Key elements of senior executive remuneration 
Purpose Horizon Policy
Base salary
To recognise the responsibilities, 
experience and ability of our talent 
in a competitive environment, 
keeping our people focused on 
and passionate about the Brand.
1 year Salaries are benchmarked against global companies of similar size and/or global reach within the 
luxury goods sector and/or companies which have had a signiﬁcant increase in brand perception,  
and to a lesser extent comparable UK companies.
Increases for the executive directors and other senior executives are set within the same framework 
and same ranges as other employees, taking into account employees’ individual performance and 
overall contribution to the business during the year, as well as the external economic climate.
Annual bonus
To reward senior executives for 
achieving ﬁnancial targets linked 
to the strategic plans agreed by 
the Board.
1 year Targets are set by reference to internal budgets, external expectations and long-term ﬁnancial goals. 
Bonuses for executive directors are currently based on Adjusted PBT. The Committee believes that 
linking incentives to proﬁtability helps reinforce the Group’s strategy and long term growth objectives. 
Targets are calibrated using benchmarks that include broker earnings estimates for Burberry and its 
competitors, latest projections for the then current year, budget, strategic plan, and long term ﬁnancial 
goals. Actual bonus awards are subject to the discretion of the Committee.
The maximum bonus for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is 200% of base salary.
The maximum bonus for the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer is 150% of base salary.
Co-Investment Plan
To incentivise consistent 
performance and further align 
senior executives’ interests with 
those of shareholders, 
by encouraging share ownership. 
This is a critical retention tool.
3 years Executives may voluntarily defer all or part of their annual bonus and invest in Burberry shares  
with a contingent award of matching shares.
The ratio for matching shares depends on performance during the year:
 In a year of maximum performance, deferrals are matched at a ratio of 2:1 for executive directors.
 In a year of target performance, the ratio is 1:1.
 Below target performance, the match does not operate.
Matching shares are subject to a performance condition. 25% of the award may vest if growth in 
Adjusted PBT achieves 5% per annum over the three year period, with full vesting where Adjusted PBT 
exceeds 10% per annum over the three year period with vesting occuring on a straight line basis 
between these points.
Restricted Share Plan
To focus executives on 
sustainable long-term 
performance.
3, 4 and 5 
years
The level of vesting is determined at the end of a three year performance period:
 Adjusted PBT growth: currently 25% vesting for growth of 5% per annum through  
to 100% vesting for growth of 15% per annum.
 For senior executives, TSR against a comparator group: 25% vesting for median TSR rising to 100% 
vesting for TSR equal to the upper quartile. The TSR group for this award comprised, Coach, 
Compagnie Financière Richemont, Estée Lauder, Fossil, Geox, Hermès International, Hugo Boss, 
Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo 
Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tod’s.
The Committee chose TSR relative to a group of Burberry’s peers because it felt that this is an 
objective measure of the Group’s success and aligns with shareholder interests. Growth in Adjusted 
PBT was chosen as it continues to be the primary measure used by management and the Committee 
believes strong growth in pre-tax proﬁt is key to delivering superior shareholder returns.
Once the level of performance has been determined, vesting is phased: half of the award vests  
on the third anniversary of grant, 25% on the fourth, and the remaining award on the ﬁfth.

Purpose Horizon Policy
All-Employee Share Plans
To encourage employee share 
ownership at all levels.
Ongoing Burberry operates two all employee share plans:
 The Sharesave Scheme offers eligible executive directors and eligible employees an opportunity  
to enter into a three or ﬁve year savings contract to save a portion of their salary which can be used  
to purchase Burberry shares at up to a 20% discount to the market price at the date of invitation.
 Grants of shares are made annually to all eligible employees under the Burberry Share Incentive  
Plan (“SIP”) and International Freeshare Plans. The executive directors elected not to participate  
in these plans.
Shareholding Policy
To ensure continued alignment 
with the interests’ of shareholders.
Ongoing Senior executives are expected to achieve an interest in Burberry shares equivalent to at least:
 three times base salary for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
 one and a half times base salary for the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
 one times base salary for other senior executives
Senior executives are expected to retain a proportion of the shares acquired on the exercise of options 
and awards until such guidelines are met.
Beneﬁts
To protect the well being of 
employees, allowing them to 
focus on the Brand.
Ongoing Beneﬁts for executive directors include pension, private medical insurance, life assurance, long-term 
disability insurance and clothing allowances.
A one-off award was granted to Angela Ahrendts following consultation with shareholders during 2010 and the details  
of this award are set out in detail on page 90.

Service agreements
Angela Ahrendts
Angela Ahrendts relocated from the US to the UK and commenced her employment with Burberry as an executive  
director on 9 January 2006 under a service agreement dated 10 October 2005. She was appointed Chief Executive  
Ofﬁcer on 1 July 2006 for an indeﬁnite period.
The terms of her service agreement were negotiated when she was appointed. If Burberry terminates Angela Ahrendts’ 
service agreement in circumstances other than for poor performance she would be entitled to 12 months’ salary and 75% 
of her annual maximum bonus opportunity. She would also receive her pension contribution for 12 months together with 
overseas allowances and, if applicable, relocation expenses. Any unvested awards under the Restricted Share Plan and 
unvested Matching Share awards under the Co-Investment Plan will vest but only on a time apportioned basis and subject 
to the achievement of the relevant performance conditions. 88 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
If Burberry terminates the agreement without cause but in circumstances where the Committee determines that Angela 
Ahrendts’ performance or that of the Group does not meet the ﬁnancial expectations of the Board or shareholders, her 
entitlements in respect of salary and bonus will be reduced so that she will receive 12 months’ salary and 37.5% of her 
maximum bonus opportunity. Angela Ahrendts may terminate the service agreement on six months’ notice.
The Committee considered that these termination provisions were required to secure the appointment of a Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer of the calibre of Angela Ahrendts from the small pool of sufﬁciently specialised candidates from around the world.
Stacey Cartwright
Stacey Cartwright is employed by Burberry as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer under a service agreement 
dated 17 November 2003. Her term of appointment commenced on 1 March 2004 for an indeﬁnite period. 
Burberry may terminate Stacey Cartwright’s appointment by giving 12 months’ notice. In such circumstances she will  
be entitled to payment of salary and other beneﬁts for a period of 12 months. Stacey Cartwright may terminate the service 
agreement on six months’ notice. Upon termination, all share awards would be treated in accordance with the rules  
of the relevant plan.
On 1 April 2011, Stacey Cartwright was appointed as a non-executive director of GlaxoSmithKline plc. It has been agreed  
that fees earned in connection with this appointment may be retained by her. From 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012 this 
was £75,000.

The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan
No awards were made to executive directors under the RSP in 2011/12.
The third and second tranches of awards made in 2006 and 2007 vested during the year. Their performance conditions were 
tested in 2009 and 2010 respectively (with 57.5% of each grant lapsing). Please see page 86 for details of the performance 
conditions.
The Burberry Co-Investment Plan
Awards made in 2008 vested in full during the year. For the year ended 31 March 2012, Angela Ahrendts and Stacey 
Cartwright intend to invest the whole of their bonus after the deduction of tax into Burberry shares under the Co-Investment 
Plan. 25% of an award may vest if growth in Adjusted PBT achieves 5% per annum over three years, 100% may vest 
if Adjusted PBT growth exceeds 10% per annum, with vesting occurring on a straight line basis between these points. 
None of the award will vest if Adjusted PBT growth is below 5% per annum. 90 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
The Burberry Exceptional Performance Share Plan
The EPP is a one off long term incentive plan introduced in 2007, the purpose of which was to incentivise senior management 
to achieve stretching goals and to help provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance. The second tranche of the 
EPP vested in the year. The award was subject to performance conditions, with maximum vesting occurring if:
 Burberry’s TSR outperformed the median TSR of a group of luxury peers by at least 7% per annum over the four-year 
period to 31 March 2011; and 
 Growth in Adjusted PBT exceeded 75% over the ﬁve-year performance period to 2011.
The TSR group for this award comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financière Richemont, Estée Lauder, Fossil, Geox, 
Hermès International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, 
Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tod’s.
Both conditions were met in full for the tranche vesting in the year (in 2010/11, 69.5% of the ﬁrst tranche of the award lapsed). 
No further awards will be made under the EPP .
One-Off Grant to Angela Ahrendts
Following consultation with the Company’s largest shareholders in 2010, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer was granted an option 
over 500,000 shares which will vest on 1 April 2015 subject to strategic and ﬁnancial objectives linked to the long-term growth 
of the Company being achieved including:
 the development of the business measured against the strategic plan approved by the Board;
 Burberry’s Adjusted PBT performance;
 the personal contribution made by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer;
 shareholder value delivered in the context of the luxury goods market;
 and any other performance factors which are appropriate in assessing the fairness of vesting the award to the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer and the shareholders.
The Committee considered the one-off grant to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, in the context of:
 continued progress along the ﬁve strategic themes including:
 – Burberry continues to climb in Interbrand’s Top 100 Global Brands;
 – launching Burberry Body;
 – growth in non-apparel revenue;
 – strong progress in building the Brand’s retail presence globally;
 – the performance of the Burberry business in China following its acquisition; and
 – increases in gross margin through supply chain efﬁciencies and the introduction of monthly ﬂow.
 Adjusted PBT growth of 26% in the 2011/12 year;
 The outstanding leadership demonstrated by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer; and
 the continuing share price outperformance compared to peers.
The Committee resolved that the objectives had been achieved in full during 2011/12.
The Sharesave Scheme
In order to encourage employee share ownership at all levels, the Group offers a Sharesave Scheme. The Sharesave Scheme 
offers eligible employees an opportunity to enter into a three or ﬁve year savings contract to save a portion of their salary which 
can be used to purchase Burberry shares at up to a 20% discount to the market price at the date of invitation.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
 
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
(the EU), and the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: 
 
 select suitable applicable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent Company financial statements respectively; and 
 prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business. 
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 68 confirm that, to the best their knowledge: 
 
 the Group financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group; and 
 the Directors’ Report contained on page 70 includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
  Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 95
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF BURBERRY GROUP PLC
 
 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2012 which comprise the Group  
Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Group Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 94, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report. 
 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2012 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;  
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and  
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 
 the directors’ statement, set out on page 73, in relation to going concern;  
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and 
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration. 
 
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2012 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

notes to the financial statements
 
 
1. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group plc and its subsidiaries (the Group) is a global luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer. The Group also licenses 
third parties to manufacture and distribute products using the ‘Burberry’ trade marks. All of the companies which comprise the Group 
are owned by Burberry Group plc (the Company) directly or indirectly. 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs), IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations and parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as modified 
by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
There have been no new standards, amendments and interpretations issued and made effective for the financial period commencing 
on 1 April 2011 that have had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. 
 
As at 31 March 2012, the following new and revised standards, amendments and interpretations, which may be relevant to the Group’s 
results, were issued but not yet effective:  
 
IFRS 9 Financial instruments  
This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and introduces 
new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard is applicable for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2015 and has not currently been endorsed by the EU. Any potential impact of this new standard will 
be quantified closer to the date of adoption. 
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 
This standard establishes the principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements and replaces similar 
principles set out in IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2013 and has not currently been endorsed by the EU. Any potential impact of this new standard will be quantified 
closer to the date of adoption, but it is not considered likely to have a material impact.  
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements 
IFRS 11 updates the approach currently set out in IAS 28 Investments in associates by focusing on the rights and obligations 
of the arrangement rather than its legal form. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 
and has not currently been endorsed by the EU. The adoption of this new standard is not considered likely to have a material impact 
on the financial position or financial performance of the Group. 
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities 
This standard requires disclosure of information about the nature of, and risks associated with, the Group’s interests in other entities, 
as well as the impact of these interests on the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The standard  
is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and has not currently been endorsed by the EU. Any potential 
impact of this new standard will be limited to disclosure which will be assessed closer to the date of adoption. 
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 
This standard aims to provide a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure 
requirements to be used across all IFRSs. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013  
and has not currently been endorsed by the EU. Any potential impact of this new standard will be quantified closer to the date 
of adoption, but it is not considered likely to have a material impact. 
 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group’s annual financial statements comprise those of Burberry Group plc (the parent Company) and its subsidiaries, presented 
as a single economic entity. The results of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using 
consistent accounting policies across the Group.  
 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control 
is transferred out of the Group. Where there is a loss of control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the results 
for the portion of the reporting period during which the Group had control. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised profits 
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements. The Group treats transactions 
with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference 
between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. 
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

1. Basis of preparation (continued) 
Key sources of estimation and judgement  
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires that management make certain judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. If in the future 
such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from 
actual circumstances, the original estimate and assumptions will be updated as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change. 
 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key areas where the estimates and assumptions applied 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below: 
 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been 
determined based on value-in-use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from 
the continuing operation of the cash generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. 
Refer to note 10 for further details of goodwill balances. 
 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit 
is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. 
Refer to note 11 for further details of property, plant and equipment. 
 
Income and deferred taxes 
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes in  
each territory. There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination  
is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. 
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income 
tax and deferred tax provisions and assets in the period in which such determination is made. Refer to notes 7 and 13 for further details of 
income and deferred tax balances. 
 
Put option liability over non-controlling interest 
The calculation of the fair value of the put option over the non-controlling interest in the Group’s business in China is based on the 
contractual agreement and requires the application of key assumptions around both the future performance of the Group’s business 
in China and the future performance of the Group, the Burberry Group plc market capitalisation at the date of exercise and the risk free 
rate in China. Refer to notes 18 and 24 for further details of the put option liability. 
 
Inventory provisioning 
The Group manufactures and sells luxury goods and is subject to changing consumer demands and fashion trends. As a result 
it is necessary to consider the recoverability of the cost of inventories and the associated provisioning required. When calculating 
the inventory provision, management considers the nature and condition of the inventory, as well as applying assumptions around 
anticipated saleability. Refer to note 15 for further details of the carrying value of inventory. 
 
Impairment of trade receivables 
The Group is required to make an estimate of the recoverable value of trade receivables. When assessing impairment of trade receivables, 
management considers factors including the ageing profile of debtors as well as any specific known problems or risks. Given global 
economic conditions and the range of countries the Group trades in, unanticipated future events may occur that could impact 
the appropriateness of the assessment made as to the recoverability of the Group’s trade receivables. Refer to notes 14 and 24 
for further details on the net carrying value and credit quality of trade receivables.   Notes to the financial statements continued
Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 103
 
 
2. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies of the Group are: 
 
a) Revenue 
Revenue, which is stated excluding Value Added Tax and other sales related taxes, is the amount receivable for goods supplied  
(less returns, trade discounts and allowances) and royalties receivable. 
 
Wholesale sales are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, with provisions 
made for expected returns and allowances. Retail sales, returns and allowances are reflected at the dates of transactions with customers. 
Provisions for returns on retail and wholesale sales are calculated based on historical return levels. Royalties receivable from licensees 
are accrued as earned on the basis of the terms of the relevant royalty agreement, which is typically on the basis of production volumes.  
 
In arrangements where the Group acts as a purchasing agent to facilitate the procurement of Burberry branded products on behalf of its 
licensees, the purchases and sales from the supplier to the licensee are not recorded as transactions by the Group. Any costs incurred 
by the Group are recorded as operating expenses and any agency fees receivable are recorded as operating income. 
 
b) Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.  
The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance, has been identified 
as the Board of Directors.  
 
c) Business combinations 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Contingent payments are remeasured at fair value through the Income Statement. All transaction costs are expensed to the Income 
Statement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially 
at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition  
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than  
the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement. 
 
d) Share schemes 
The cost of the share based incentives received by employees (including executive directors) is measured with reference to the fair value 
of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to determine the fair value of the 
award made. The impact of performance conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant, except for conditions 
linked to the price of Burberry Group plc shares i.e. market conditions. Vesting conditions which relate to non-market conditions are allowed 
for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to vest. The estimate of the number of options expected to vest is revised 
at each balance sheet date.  
 
The cost of the share based incentives is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the awards, with a corresponding increase 
in equity. 
 
The proceeds received from the exercise of the equity instruments awarded, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, 
are credited to share capital and share premium.  
   Notes to the financial statements continued
104 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
 
 
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
e) Leases 
The Group is both a lessor and lessee of property, plant and equipment. Determining whether an arrangement is or contains a lease  
is based on the substance of the arrangement. Leases in which substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of  
an asset are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
 
Gross rental expenditure/income in respect of operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases. 
Certain rental expenses are determined on the basis of revenue achieved in specific retail locations and are accrued for on that basis. 
 
Amounts paid to/received from the landlord to acquire or transfer the rights to a lease are treated as prepayments/accrued income 
on the lease contract. Lease incentives, typically rent free periods and capital contributions, are held on the Balance Sheet in accruals 
and deferred income and recognised over the term of the lease.  
 
Finance leases where the Group is a lessee are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of fair value of the leased asset 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Interest is charged to the Income Statement and credited to the lease liability using 
the effective interest rate method. Lease liabilities are held in other creditors on the Balance Sheet. The capitalised leased assets are held 
in property, plant and equipment on the Balance Sheet, and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the 
leased asset.  
 
f) Dividend distributions 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividend becomes 
a committed obligation. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised 
when paid. 
 
g) Pension costs 
Defined contribution schemes 
Eligible employees participate in defined contribution pension schemes, the principal one being in the UK with its assets held in an 
independently administered fund. The cost of providing these benefits to participating employees is recognised in the Income Statement 
and comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year. 
 
Defined benefit schemes 
Eligible employees of the Group participate in defined benefit schemes in France and Taiwan.  
 
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes represents the Group’s share of the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised 
past-service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method. 
 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income. 
 
h) Intangible fixed assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill on acquisition 
is recorded as an intangible fixed asset. Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date. Adjustments are also made to align the accounting 
policies of acquired businesses with those of the Group.  
 
Goodwill is assigned an indefinite useful economic life. Impairment reviews are performed annually, or more frequently if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed 
in future periods. 
 
Trade marks and other intangible assets 
The cost of securing and renewing trade marks and the cost of acquiring other intangible assets such as key money is capitalised 
at purchase price and amortised by equal annual instalments over the period in which benefits are expected to accrue, typically 
ten years for trade marks, or the term of the lease. The useful economic life of trade marks and other intangible assets is determined 
on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement and the nature of the asset. 
 
Computer software 
The cost of acquiring computer software (including licences and separately identifiable external development costs) is capitalised 
as an intangible asset at purchase price, plus any directly attributable cost of preparing that asset for its intended use. Software costs 
are amortised by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives, which are up to five years. 
   Notes to the financial statements continued
Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12 105
 
 
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
i) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment, with the exception of assets under the course of construction, is stated at cost or deemed cost, based 
on historical revalued amounts, less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value. Assets in the course of 
construction are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and transferred to completed assets when substantially all of the activities 
necessary for the asset to be ready for use have occurred. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs attributable 
to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
 
Depreciation 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost or deemed cost, less residual value, of the assets in equal 
annual instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: 
 
Land Not depreciated 
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years 
Leaseholds – less than 50 years expired  Over the unexpired term of the lease 
Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 3 – 8 years 
Retail fixtures and fittings 2 – 5 years 
Office equipment 5 years 
Computer equipment Up to 5 years 
Assets in the course of construction Not depreciated 
 
Profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 
Profits and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and net book value 
at the date of sale. Disposals are accounted for when the relevant transaction becomes unconditional. 
 
j) Impairment of non-financial assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that 
are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds 
its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes 
of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units).  
 
k) Investment properties 
Investment properties are freehold properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment properties are stated at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value. Cost includes the original purchase price plus any directly 
attributable transaction costs. Investment properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of up to 50 years.  
 
l) Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical 
area of operations that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Discontinued 
operations are presented on the Income Statement as a separate line and are shown net of tax. 
 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather 
than through continued use, and a sale within the next twelve months is considered to be highly probable. Assets classified as held for sale 
cease to be depreciated and they are stated as the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. 
   Notes to the financial statements continued
106 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
 
 
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
m) Inventories 
Inventories and work in progress are valued on a first-in-first-out basis at the lower of cost (including an appropriate proportion of production 
overhead) and net realisable value. Where necessary, provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard 
to the nature and condition of inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability. 
 
n) Taxation 
Tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items which are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date. 
 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, 
no deferred tax will be recognised. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability 
is settled. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.  
 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
o) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably 
estimated. When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated based on the present value 
of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The present value is calculated using forward market interest 
rates as measured at the balance sheet reporting date, which have been adjusted for risks reflected in future cash flow estimates. 
 
Property obligations 
A provision for the present value of future property reinstatement costs is recognised where there is an obligation to return the leased 
property to its original condition at the end of an operating lease. Where a leased property is no longer expected to be fully occupied 
or where the costs exceed the future expected benefits, an onerous lease provision will be recognised for that portion of the lease 
excess to the Group’s requirements and not fully recovered through sub-leasing, or through value-in-use.  
 
Restructuring costs 
Provisions for costs associated with restructuring programmes are recognised when a detailed formal restructuring plan has been approved 
and communicated. Examples of restructuring related costs include employee termination payments, contract termination penalties and 
onerous contract payments. 
 
p) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued 
or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

q) Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow expire or substantially all risks and rewards 
of the asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled 
or expires.  
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for  
derivatives, which are classified as held for trading, except where they qualify for hedge accounting and are held at fair value. 
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, accruals and borrowings. 
 
The Group classifies its instruments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss and loans 
and receivables. Loans and receivables include trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Derivatives are classified 
as held for trading, unless in a hedging relationship, and are held at fair value.

(1) Hedge accounting is applied to cash flow hedges to the extent it is achievable. 
 
The Group’s primary categories of financial instruments are listed below:  
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less, held with banks 
and liquidity funds. Bank overdrafts are recorded under current liabilities on the Balance Sheet. 
 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date. 
Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group  
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised 
in the Income Statement.  
 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date. 
Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, inclusive of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised  
cost and the difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has  
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date. 
 
Put option liabilities over non-controlling interest 
Put options over shares in subsidiaries held by non-controlling interests are recognised initially at fair value through equity when granted. 
They are subsequently re-measured at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in the Income Statement 
as other finance expenses and income.   Notes to the financial statements continued

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
q) Financial instruments (continued) 
Derivative instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain trading 
transactions. The principal derivative instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge highly probable cash flows 
in relation to future sales, royalty receivables and product purchases. To manage interest rate risk the Group manages its proportion of fixed 
and floating rate borrowings to within limits approved by the Board using interest rate swap derivatives. It designates foreign currency 
borrowings in a net investment hedge of the assets of overseas subsidiaries. 
 
When hedge accounting is applied the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments 
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments that are used in hedging 
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method 
of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature 
of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities 
or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges); or (3) classified as held 
for trading. 
 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income Statement 
immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is deferred in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement. Amounts deferred in other comprehensive income are recycled in the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item 
affects the Income Statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction 
is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss 
that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income Statement within ‘other gains/(losses) - net’. If a derivative instrument 
is not designated as a hedge, the subsequent change to the fair value is recognised in the Income Statement within operating expenses 
or interest depending upon the nature of the instrument. 
 
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations through foreign currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the retranslation 
of the borrowings are recognised in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to the Income Statement when the foreign 
operation that was hedged is disposed of.   Notes to the financial statements continued

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
r) Foreign currency translation  
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling 
which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency. 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies within each entity in the Group are translated into the functional currency at the monthly 
average exchange rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are held at the year end, are translated 
into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised 
in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise, except where these exchange differences form part of a net investment 
in overseas subsidiaries of the Group, in which case such differences are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve.  
 
Translation of the results of overseas businesses 
The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into the Group’s presentation currency of Sterling each month at the weighted average 
exchange rate for the month according to the phasing of the Group’s trading results. The weighted average exchange rate is used, 
as it is considered to approximate the actual exchange rates on the date of the transactions. The assets and liabilities of such undertakings 
are translated at the year end exchange rates. Differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies, 
and on the translation of their results, are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve.  
 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the closing rate. 
 
The principal exchange rates used were as follows:

Hong Kong Dollar 12.38 12.11 12.41 12.49 
Korean Won 1,775 1,786 1,811 1,763 
 
The average exchange rate achieved by the Group on its Yen royalty income, taking into account its use of Yen forward foreign exchange 
contracts on a monthly basis approximately twelve months in advance of royalty receipts, was Yen 133.1: £1 in the year to 31 March 2012 
(2011: Yen 143.7: £1). 
 
s) Adjusted profit before taxation and exceptional items 
Exceptional items include those items that are largely one-off and material in nature. The Group presents these items in note 5 
to the accounts in profit before taxation. Fair value movements on options held over equity interests, which are held for the purpose 
of future business developments, rather than speculative purposes, are also considered to be exceptional items and are separately 
presented in the Income Statement. These items are added back/deducted from profit/loss before taxation to arrive at adjusted 
profit/loss before taxation. These items and their related tax impacts are added back/deducted from profit attributable to equity 
holders of the Company to arrive at adjusted earnings per share. These measures are disclosed in order to provide additional 
consideration of the underlying performance of the Group’s ongoing business.

3. Segmental analysis 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors. The Board reviews the Group’s internal reporting 
in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports 
used by the Board. 
 
The Board considers Burberry’s business through its two channels to market, being Retail/Wholesale and Licensing. Retail/Wholesale 
revenues are generated by the sale of luxury goods through Burberry mainline stores, concessions, outlets and digital commerce 
as well as Burberry franchisees, prestige department stores globally and multi-brand specialty accounts.  
 
The flow of global product between Retail and Wholesale channels and across our regions is monitored and optimised at a corporate level 
and implemented via the Group’s inventory hubs situated in Asia, Europe and the US. Licensing revenues are generated through the receipt 
of royalties from Burberry’s partners in Japan and global licensees of fragrances, eyewear, timepieces and European childrenswear. 
 
The Board assesses channel performance based on a measure of adjusted operating profit. This measurement basis excludes the effects 
of exceptional items. The measure of earnings for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Board includes an allocation of corporate 
and central costs. Interest income and charges are not included in the result for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Board.

Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. In addition, account 
is taken of any options and awards made under the employee share incentive schemes, which will have a dilutive effect when exercised.

Impairment testing of goodwill

The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or where there is an indication that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount 
of all cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis. Value-in-use calculations for each cash generating unit are based 
on projected three year pre-tax discounted cash flows together with a discounted terminal value. The cash flows have been discounted 
at pre-tax rates reflecting the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country specific tax rates and risks. Where the cash 
generating unit has a non-controlling interest which was recognised as its proportionate interest in the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
subsidiary at the acquisition date, the carrying amount of the goodwill has been grossed up, to include the goodwill attributable to the  
non-controlling interest, for the purpose of impairment testing the goodwill attributable to the cash generating unit. The key assumptions 
contained in the value-in-use calculations include the future revenues, the margins achieved, the assumed life of the business  
and the discount rates applied. 
 
The value-in-use calculations for the initial review have been prepared using management’s approved financial plans for the year ending 
31 March 2013 as the source for the first year cash flow. These plans contain management’s best view of the expected performance 
for the year ended 31 March 2013, based on the performance achieved in the current year and management’s knowledge of the market 
environment and future business plans. 
 
In China and Korea, which contain the most material goodwill balances, the cash flows included in the value-in-use calculation 
for the following two years and for the terminal value have assumed no growth beyond that contained within the financial plan 
for the year ending 31 March 2013. The Group carries out an initial review for indication of impairment using conservative growth 
assumptions beyond the first year cash flow. Should this initial review indicate that impairment may have arisen, a further review 
will be carried out, using more detailed assumptions, to confirm and then quantify any potential impairment. This approach is considered 
appropriate by management due to the amount of headroom between recoverable amount and carrying value of goodwill at present. 
 
The adjusted weighted average cost of capital rates for China and Korea were 14.4% and 12.5% respectively (2011: 13.5%; 14.1%). 
No impairment has been recognised in respect of the carrying value of the goodwill balance in the year as, for each cash generating unit, 
the recoverable amount of goodwill exceeds its carrying value. 
 
As the initial review using conservative assumptions does not indicate that impairment may have arisen, management do not consider 
it appropriate to conduct a further sensitivity analysis because a reasonably possible change in assumptions would not result 
in an impairment.  Notes to the financial statements continued

There is no impact on the depreciation charge for the year as a result of this reclassification. 
 
During the year to 31 March 2012, a net impairment charge of £3.8m (2011: £nil) was identified as part of the annual impairment review. 
 
Where indicators of impairment were identified, the impairment review compared the value-in-use of the assets to the carrying values at 
31 March 2012. The pre-tax cash flow projections were based on financial plans approved by management and extrapolated beyond the 
budget year to the lease exit dates using growth rates and inflation rates appropriate to each country’s economic conditions. The pre-tax 
discount rates used in these calculations were between 10.8% and 16.7% (2011: between 12.2% and 18.5%), based on the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country-specific tax rates and risks.  Notes to the financial statements continued

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related benefit through the future 
taxable profits is probable. The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of £20.3m (2011: £15.2m) in respect of losses and temporary 
timing differences amounting to £57.8m (2011: £45.1m) that can be set off against future taxable income. There is a time limit for the 
recovery of £13.0m of these potential assets (2011: £9.0m) which ranges from seven to ten years (2011: eight to ten years). 
 
Included within other temporary differences above is a deferred tax liability of £0.6m (2011: £0.6m) relating to unremitted overseas earnings. 
No deferred tax liability is provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries where the Group is able to control 
the remittance of earnings and it is probable that such earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable future, or where no liability would arise 
on the remittance. The unrecognised deferred tax liability on unremitted earnings is £2.0m (2011: £1.0m).  Notes to the financial statements continued

with the remainder due at various stages after this. The entire balance is non-interest bearing. 
 
The individually impaired receivables relate to balances with trading parties which have passed their payment due dates or where 
uncertainty exists over recoverability. As at 31 March 2012, trade receivables of £28.0m (2011: £18.4m) were impaired. The amount 
of the provision against these receivables was £7.6m as of 31 March 2012 (2011: £12.1m). It was assessed that a portion of the receivables 
is expected to be recovered. Individually impaired receivables of £2.1m (2011: £3.7m) relate to the discontinued Spanish operations.

was a cost of £4.4m (2011: credit of £17.9m).  
 
In the year to 31 March 2012, the Group reversed £1.5m (2011: £4.6m) of previous inventory writedowns in relation to the stock held 
in the discontinued Spanish operations. The cost of inventories physically destroyed in the year is £8.3m (2011: £6.6m). 
 
16. Derivative financial instruments 
The Group Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency. To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, 
the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts. 
These transactions are recorded as cash flow hedges. 
 
Cash flow hedges 
The Group’s foreign currency denominated transactions arise principally from royalty income, sales and purchases. The Group manages 
these exposures through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.

Following the acquisition of the Burberry retail and distribution business in China, Sparkle Roll Holdings Limited, a non-Group company, 
retains a 15% economic interest in the Group’s business in China. Put and call options exist over this interest stake which are exercisable 
after 5 years from acquisition date in the case of the call option, and 10 years from acquisition date in the case of the put option. 
The net present value of the put option has been recognised as a non-current financial liability under IAS 39. 
 
The key assumptions in arriving at the fair value of the put option are the future performance of both the Group’s business in China 
and the future performance of the Group, the Burberry Group plc market capitalisation at the date of exercise and the risk free rate 
in China.

At 31 March 2012, 30,027 of the 0.05p ordinary shares in issue are held as treasury shares (2011: 77,215). 
 
The Company has a general authority from shareholders, renewed at each Annual General Meeting, to repurchase a maximum of 10% 
of its issued share capital. During the year to 31 March 2012, no ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company under this authority 
(2011: nil).  
 
The cost of own shares held by the Group has been offset against retained earnings, as the amounts paid reduce the profits available 
for distribution by the Company. As at 31 March 2012 the amounts offset against this reserve are £41.9m (2011: £2.8m). In the year 
to 31 March 2012 the Burberry Group plc ESOP trust has waived its entitlement to dividends of £0.2m (2011: £nil). 
 
During the year profits of £5.0m (2011: £1.7m) have been transferred to capital reserves due to statutory requirements of subsidiaries. 
The capital reserve consists of non-distributable reserves and the capital redemption reserve arising on the purchase of own shares.

22. Financial commitments 
The Group leases various retail stores, offices, warehouses and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. 
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. The Group has commitments relating to future minimum 
lease payments under these non-cancellable operating leases as follows:

Total  640.3 535.3 
 
The financial commitments for operating lease amounts calculated as a percentage of revenue (‘revenue leases’) have been based 
on the minimum payment that is required under the terms of the relevant lease. Under certain revenue leases, there are no minimums 
and therefore no financial commitment is included in the table above. As a result, the amounts charged to the Income Statement 
may be materially higher than the financial commitment at the prior year end.  
 
The total of future minimum payments to be received under non-cancellable leases on investment properties and subleases on land 
and buildings is as follows:

24. Financial risk management 
Other than derivatives, the Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, external borrowings, trade 
receivables, and trade and other payables arising directly from operations. 
 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks (including foreign exchange risk, share price risk and interest rate 
risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. 
 
Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury to reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable 
needs and to invest in cash assets safely and profitably. This is done in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. Group Treasury 
does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements. The policies of the Group treasury 
department are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. 
 
Market risk 
Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures. 
 
The Group’s Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency. To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, 
the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts 
(see note 16). The Group’s accounting policy in relation to derivative instruments is set out in note 2. 
 
The Group’s treasury risk management policy is to hedge anticipated cash flows in each major foreign currency that qualify as ‘highly 
probable’ forecast transactions for hedge accounting purposes within the current or previous year. 
 
The Group monitors the desirability of hedging the net assets of overseas subsidiaries when translated into Sterling for reporting purposes. 
It has not entered into any specific transactions for this purpose within the current or previous year. 
 
At 31 March 2012, the Group has performed sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of non-Sterling currencies strengthening/weakening 
by 20% (2011: 20%) against Sterling with all other variables held constant. The effect on translating foreign currency denominated net  
debt, receivables, payables and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss would have been to increase/decrease post-tax  
profit for the year by £3.0m (2011: decrease/increase  £0.1m). The effect on translating forward foreign exchange contracts designated 
as cash flow hedges and Sterling denominated loans held in overseas subsidiaries would have been to increase/decrease equity 
by £12.1m (2011: £11.4m). 
 
The following table shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the year end in currencies other than the local 
currency of operation, after accounting for the effect of any specific forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage currency exposure. 
Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and amounts to be received or paid in cash. Foreign exchange differences 
on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are recognised in the Income Statement. 
 
Net foreign currency monetary assets/(liabilities) held in currencies other than the local currency of operation:

24. Financial risk management (continued) 
Share price risk 
The Group is exposed to employer’s national insurance liability due to the implementation of various employee share based incentive 
schemes. 
 
To reduce exposure to fluctuations in the employer’s national insurance liability due to movements in the Group’s share price, the Group 
has a policy of entering into equity swaps at the time of granting share options and awards. The Group does not seek hedge accounting 
treatment for equity swaps. The Group monitors its exposure to fluctuations in the employer’s national insurance liability on an ongoing basis. 
An increase/decrease in the share price of 50.0p would have resulted in an increase/decrease in profit after tax of £0.8m. 
 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash, short-term deposits and external borrowings. 
 
The external borrowings are linked to the LIBOR rate, while cash and short-term borrowings are affected by local market rates around 
the Group. The borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. To manage interest rate risk the Group 
manages its proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings to within limits approved by the Board using interest rate swap derivatives. 
The Group has no outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 March 2012.  
 
The interest rate risk profile of the Group’s floating rate financial liabilities by currency is as follows: 
 
 
As at  
31 March  
2012 
£m 
As at  
31 March  
2011 
£m 
Sterling – 0.2 
Other currencies 3.9 2.1 
Total financial liabilities 3.9 2.3 
 
The floating rate financial liabilities at 31 March 2012 and 2011 exclude cash pool overdraft balances of £204.7m (2011: £166.1m) 
which are offset by cash balances for the purpose of interest calculations. At 31 March 2012, if interest rates on borrowings had been 
100 basis points higher/lower (2011: 200 basis points) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 
£nil (2011: £nil) lower/higher, as a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings. 
 
The fixed rate financial liabilities consist of amounts owed under a finance lease of £1.8m (2011: £2.3m). 
 
The floating rate financial assets, being short-term deposits, are £284.3m as at 31 March 2012 (2011: £231.2m). At 31 March 2012, 
if interest rates on short-term deposits had been 100 basis points higher/lower (2011: 100 basis points), with all other variables held 
constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £2.8m (2011: £2.3m) higher/lower, as a result of higher/lower interest income 
on short-term deposits. 
 
The Group has no other significant floating rate foreign currency borrowings and therefore is not exposed to movements in foreign currency 
interest rates. 
 
Credit risk 
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The trade receivables balance is spread across a large number of different 
customers with no single debtor representing more than 8% of the total balance due. The Group has policies in place to ensure that 
wholesale sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit 
cards. In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not 
significant and default rates have historically been very low. An ageing of overdue receivables is included in note 14. The carrying amount 
of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure to the Group.  
 
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short-term deposits and certain derivative 
instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal 
to the carrying value of these instruments. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial 
institution and only deposits funds with independently rated financial institutions with a minimum rating of “A”. 
 
The Group has deposited €0.2m (2011: €1.1m), CHF 0.3m (2011: CHF 0.3m), BRL 0.6m (2011: BRL 0.6m), INR 0.2m (2011: INR 0.2m) 
and TWD nil (2011: TWD 10.0m) which is held as collateral at a number of European banks.  Notes to the financial statements continued
130 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12
 
 
24. Financial risk management (continued) 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s financial risk management policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet foreseeable needs and close out 
market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping 
committed credit lines available. For further details of this, see note 20.  
 
All short-term trade creditors, accruals, bank overdrafts and borrowings mature within one year or less. The carrying value of all financial 
liabilities due in less than one year is equal to their contractual undiscounted cash flows. 
 
The maturity profile of the contractual undiscounted cash flows of the Group’s non-current financial liabilities is as follows:

In more than four years, but not more than five years 1.2 0.6 
In more than five years 184.0 151.2 
Total financial liabilities 195.9 157.4 
 
Other non-current financial liabilities relate to lease liabilities, property-related accruals and the put option liability over non-controlling 
interests. The put option liability is subject to a contractual cap of £200m. 
 
Capital risk 
The Group manages its capital (defined as net cash plus equity excluding non-controlling interest) to ensure that entities in the Group 
are able to operate as going concerns and optimise returns to shareholders. At 31 March 2012, the Group had net cash of £338.3m 
(2011: £297.9m) and total equity excluding non-controlling interest of £867.3m (2011: £713.6m). The Group has access to a facility 
of £300m which was undrawn at 31 March 2012 and a facility of Yen 145m, of which Yen 100.8m was drawn down at 31 March 2012. 
For further details refer to note 20. 
 
Cash is used to fund the continued investment in the Group and growth of the global brand. It is also used to make routine outflows 
of capital expenditure, tax and dividends. The Group's dividend policy sets its payout target as 40% of adjusted diluted EPS. 
The Board reviews the Group’s dividend policy and funding requirements annually. 
 
The Group is in compliance with the financial and other covenants within its committed bank credit facilities, and has been in compliance 
throughout the financial year. 
 
25. Employee costs  
Staff costs, including the cost of directors, incurred during the year are as shown below. Directors’ remuneration, which is separately 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 83 to 92 and forms part of these financial statements, includes the notional 
gains arising on the exercise of share options and awards but excludes the charge in respect of these share options and awards recognised

Share options granted to directors and employees 
The Group has a number of share options and share awards schemes for its directors and employees. Details of each of these schemes 
are set out in this note. The share option and award schemes have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Senior 
Executive Restricted Share Plan and the Exceptional Performance Share Plan, both of which have market-based performance conditions 
attached, have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with a discount applied to this value, based on information 
obtained by running a Monte Carlo simulation model on the scheme.  
 
Where applicable, equity swaps have been entered into to cover future employer’s national insurance liability (or overseas equivalent) 
that may arise in respect of these schemes (refer to note 24). 
 
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme  
In the financial year ended 31 March 2007, a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave) offering Burberry Group plc ordinary shares 
was introduced for employees. 
 
On 24 June 2011, further options were granted under this scheme with a three-year and five-year vesting period offered to employees. 
The savings contract commencement date for this grant was 1 September 2011. These options are exercisable for a period of up to six 
months from 1 September 2014 and 1 September 2016 for the three-year and five-year schemes respectively, with vesting dependent 
on continued employment, as well as a saving obligation over the vesting period. The exercise price for these options is calculated at a 20% 
discount to market price over the three dealing days preceding the invitation date. Three day averages are calculated by taking middle 
market quotations of a Burberry Group plc share from the London Stock Exchange.  
 
The fair value per option for the grant was determined as £2.85. The key factors used in determining the fair value were as follows: 
   
Share price at contract commencement date  £13.83 
Exercise price  £10.49 
Life of award  Equivalent to 
vesting period 
Dividend yield  2.20% 
Expected volatility  44.8% 
Risk free interest rate  1.23% 
 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical annualised standard deviation of the market price of the shares over 
a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the life of the option. 
 
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their weighted average exercise prices are as follows:

The Burberry Exceptional Performance Share Plan  
In 2007, awards in respect of a total of 4,210,000 ordinary shares were made to executive directors and senior management under 
the Exceptional Performance Share Plan which was introduced as a one-off long-term incentive plan.  
 
The awards vest in two stages: 50% are exercisable after three years and 50% are exercisable after four years. The vesting of these share 
awards is dependent on two performance conditions. The award is based 50% on relative TSR and 50% on growth in profits over the three 
and four year performance periods to 2010 and 2011. No awards vest unless Burberry’s TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group 
or growth in adjusted PBT per share exceeds 50% over the four year performance period to 2010 or 75% over the five year performance 
period to 2011. The vesting of these share awards is also dependent on continued employment over the vesting period. The exercise price 
of these share awards is £nil. 
 
At 1 April 2011, 1,987,962 share awards were outstanding. Of these awards, 2,812 lapsed and the remaining 1,985,150 were exercised 
during the year ended 31 March 2012 at a weighted average share price of £14.86 (2011: £9.22). No more share awards remain outstanding 
in relation to the Burberry Exceptional Performance Share Plan.

On 8 December 2010, options in respect of 850,000 ordinary shares were granted as a one-off award. 
 
The options are due to vest on 1 April 2015. Strategic and financial objectives linked to the long term growth of the Group must be met 
in order for 500,000 of the options to vest. The vesting of all of the options is dependent on continued employment for the vesting period. 
The exercise price of these share options is £nil.

Burberry Saudi Company Limited 
On 19 June 2011, the Group formed Burberry Saudi Company Limited (Burberry Saudi), a company registered in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia, with Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair & Co SLSC, a third party company registered in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Burberry Saudi will 
manage the Burberry retail business within the Saudi Arabian market. 
 
Burberry has a 60% interest in the issued share capital of the company, the majority of the voting rights and the power to appoint 
the majority of the directors. Burberry Saudi has been consolidated as a subsidiary as at 31 March 2012. The non-controlling interest 
in the consolidated net assets of this company has been identified as a separate component of equity. 
 
On 19 June 2011, the distribution agreement with the existing franchise partner in Saudi Arabia expired, and Burberry Saudi acquired 
the Burberry retail business from that franchisee.  
 
Details of the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows: 
 
 £m 
Cash consideration 10.0 
Total purchase consideration 10.0 
Fair value of net identifiable assets acquired 4.3 
Goodwill 5.7 
 
The goodwill arising on the acquisition, which is included within intangible assets, is attributable to the acquisition of the Saudi Arabian 
business assets and the benefits expected from further expansion in this region. The goodwill recognised relates to equity attributable 
to the owners of the company and to the non-controlling interest and is not tax deductible. 
 
The assets and liabilities arising from the acquisition are as follows:  
 
 
Fair value 
£m 
Inventories 1.4 
Property, plant and equipment 3.0 
Liabilities (0.1) 
Net identifiable assets acquired 4.3 
Net identifiable assets acquired attributable to non-controlling interest 1.7 
 
The Group incurred transaction costs of £0.1m in respect of the acquisition. 
 
The acquired Saudi Arabian retail assets generated revenues of £9.1m and a profit of £2.7m to the Group for the period from acquisition 
to 31 March 2012. 
 
Pro forma full year information 
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2011, it would have contributed approximately £1.8m of Group revenue in addition to that 
noted above, while the Group operating profit impact in addition to that noted above would have been neutral for the year ended 
31 March 2012.

On 1 September 2010, Burberry (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd, a wholly owned Group company incorporated in the People’s Republic 
of China, took control of key store assets and inventory across 50 retail stores. Daily operations at 43 of the stores fully transferred

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 94, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.

In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:  
 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2012; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and  
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the parent Company financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent Company financial statements.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:  
 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or  
 the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or  
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

notes to the company financial statements
 
A. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group plc (‘the Company’) is the parent Company of the Burberry Group. Burberry Group plc is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and its principal business is investment. 
 
Burberry Group is a global luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer. Retail/Wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of luxury 
goods through Burberry mainline stores, concessions and outlets as well as Burberry franchisees and prestige department stores globally. 
Licensing revenues are generated through the receipt of royalties from Burberry’s licensees in Japan and global licensees of fragrances, 
eyewear, timepieces and European childrenswear. All of the companies, which comprise Burberry Group, are controlled by the Company 
either directly or indirectly.  
 
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, with the exception of those 
financial instruments which are included in the financial statements at fair value, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006.  
 
B. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.  
 
Share schemes 
Employees in Burberry Group (including executive directors) receive certain share incentives relating to Burberry Group plc shares. 
 
The cost of the share incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant.  
The Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to determine the fair value of the award made. The impact of performance conditions 
is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant, except for conditions linked to the price of Burberry Group plc shares, 
i.e. market conditions. Vesting conditions which relate to non-market conditions are allowed for in the assumptions about the number 
of options expected to vest. The estimate of the number of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date. 
 
The cost of the share based incentives is notionally recharged to the relevant entity via a capital contribution. A corresponding increase 
is recognised in equity. 
 
The proceeds received from the exercise of the equity instruments awarded, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited 
to share capital and share premium. 
 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividend becomes 
a committed obligation. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised 
when paid. 
 
Investments in Group companies 
Investments in Group companies are stated at cost, less any provisions to reflect impairment in value. 
 
Impairment of assets 
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset’s net realisable value and value-in-use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (income-generating units).  
 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future 
have occurred at the balance sheet date. 
 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax 
is measured on an undiscounted basis.  148 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12

B. Accounting policies (continued) 
Derivative financial instruments 
Financial instruments are reported and measured in accordance with FRS 25 and FRS 26 respectively. The Company used the exemption 
not to present FRS 29 disclosures in the notes to the entity financial statements as full equivalent disclosures are presented within 
the consolidated financial statements.  
 
Equity swap contracts are marked to market with gains and losses arising on these contracts recognised in the profit and loss account. 
 
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are held at the year end, are translated into Sterling at the exchange 
rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period 
in which they arise.  
 
Related party transactions 
FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ requires the disclosure of the details of material transactions and balances between the reporting entity 
and related parties. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under the terms of FRS 8 not to disclose details of transactions 
with entities that are wholly owned subsidiaries.

Profit for the year on ordinary activities, but before dividends payable, was £37.9m (2011: £8.7m). As permitted by Section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. 
 
The Company has a general authority from shareholders, renewed at each Annual General Meeting, to repurchase a maximum of 10% 
of its issued share capital. During the year to 31 March 2012, no ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company under this authority.  
 
The cost of own shares held by the Group has been offset against the profit and loss account, as the amounts paid reduce the profits 
available for distribution by the Company. As at 31 March 2012 the amounts offset against this reserve are £41.9m (2011: £2.8m). 
In the year to 31 March 2012 the Burberry Group plc ESOP trust has waived its entitlement to dividends of £0.2m (2011: £nil). 
 
The capital reserve consists of the capital redemption reserve arising on the purchase of own shares.  150 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011/12

Unauthorised brokers (boiler room scams) 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports. These are typically from overseas-based 
‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders offering to sell them 
what often turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares in US 
or UK investments. These operations are commonly known 
as boiler rooms.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
 Make sure you get the correct name of the person 
and organisation
 Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA  
before getting involved by visiting: fsa.gov.uk/register/
 Report the matter to the FSA either by calling  
0845 606 1234 or visiting: fsa.gov.uk/pages/
consumerinformation
 If the calls persist, hang up.
If you deal with an unauthorised ﬁrm, you will not be 
eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by 
completing an online form at fsa.gov.uk/Pages/Doing/
Regulated/Law/Alerts/form.shtml.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the company 
endorses will be included in company mailings.

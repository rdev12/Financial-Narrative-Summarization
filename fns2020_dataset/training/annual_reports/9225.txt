Chairman’s statement Peter Erskine, Chairman, looks  
at the Group’s performance  
over the last 12 months and  
how it’s positioned for the future.
Dear Shareholder,
In writing to you for the first time as Chairman of Ladbrokes 
I am very aware that 2009 represents the toughest year for 
the Company since 1994/5 when the National Lottery was 
introduced. I was attracted to joining Ladbrokes not only 
because of its track record but also because of the growth 
potential it offers – both in terms of building upon our UK 
presence and extending the brand as new markets regulate. 
Ladbrokes is the most recognised betting and gaming brand  
in the UK and also enjoys a good international reputation. 
Although 2009 has been a challenging year it does not  
change my belief in this Company’s potential. 
Peter Erskine
Chairman
fit for the  future 2009 – A challenging year
Twelve months ago, when I joined the Company, it was  
expected that the industry should be relatively recession  
resilient compared to other consumer facing businesses. 
However, as the year progressed, it became apparent that the 
changes to our customer demographic have made the business 
more economically sensitive and we have seen a resultant 
decline in the amounts being staked. In addition to this, sporting 
results have been in the customers’ favour, with a gross win 
margin for the UK Retail business and eGaming Sportsbook 
business of at least one percentage point less than 2008. 
Following this significant margin weakness combined with the 
accumulating effect of financing, trading risks and the overall 
challenges in forecasting this business, in October, the Board 
concluded that it was no longer prudent to pursue a strategy of 
purely organic debt reduction. The rights issue was successfully 
completed in late October with 95% valid acceptances. I firmly 
believe that this financial strength will underpin the Company’s 
future growth.
37932_pp001-009.indd   4 25/02/2010   19:39 Ladbrokes plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
05
Importantly, the Group is demonstrating an increased focus 
on operational excellence. I believe that the wide-ranging 
programme of operational and strategic initiatives that we  
have put in place will start to show increasing benefits through 
the course of this year and beyond.
Strategy 
Our customer base and core markets are changing and our  
long-term strategy continues to evolve and adapt. The three 
strands of our strategy, UK Retail, eGaming and International 
remain as before, with the focus upon seamless execution and 
consistent delivery.
Over the following ten pages I have set out what our short- and 
long-term priorities are and I am confident that this wide-ranging 
programme of operational and strategic initiatives will gain 
traction through the current year. In addition, the actions  
we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet through the 
rights issue, have left us with a robust financial position. 
Consequently, we look forward positively with a heightened 
sense of momentum.
People
I have spent much time in the different businesses since 
last January and have been impressed by the strengths and 
commitment of the people. You will see in our Corporate 
Responsibility section on page 32, the importance that we  
place on our people. 
In November we strengthened the Board with the appointment 
of Sly Bailey, Chief Executive Officer of Trinity Mirror plc and 
Darren Shapland, Chief Financial Officer of J Sainsbury plc, as 
non-executive directors. Both are highly experienced executives 
with a track record of significant achievements and I believe that 
their extensive knowledge of retail and media will be of significant 
benefit as we take the business forward.
Nicholas Jones and Henry Staunton who have been non-executive 
directors since 2002 and 2006 respectively have decided to 
retire at the coming Annual General Meeting and we thank them 
for their significant contribution. Darren Shapland has been 
appointed a member of the audit committee and will become  
the committee’s Chairman on Henry Staunton’s retirement. 
In January 2010, following almost 20 years with the Company, 
it was announced that Chris Bell is to step down as Chief 
Executive. He will not be standing for re-appointment at this 
year’s Annual General Meeting. Chris and the Board agreed 
that it was an appropriate time to seek new leadership for the 
business. Chris’ commitment to Ladbrokes has been invaluable 
and to ensure continuity he has agreed to stay on in his role and 
do all to support the Company during the transition. The search 
process for his successor is ongoing and we shall update the 
market in due course.
Dividend
In line with the disclosure at the time of the rights issue the  
Group will not be paying a final dividend (2008: 7.71 pence  
per share, as adjusted for the bonus element of the rights issue).  
The total dividend for 2009 is therefore 3.5 pence (2008:  
14.15 pence) per share, or 2.98 pence (2008: 12.05 pence)  
per share as adjusted for the bonus element of the rights issue.
The Board intends to resume a progressive dividend policy,  
from the 2010 interim dividend onwards, with a target dividend 
cover of approximately 2.0 times underlying earnings excluding 
High Rollers.
Summary
In the period from 1 January to 16 February Group net  
revenue (excluding High Rollers) declined 4.6% against the  
prior period in 2009, with the severe weather conditions leading 
to a high level of UK and Irish horse race abandonments and 
football match postponements. Despite this, lower gross profits 
tax and operating costs resulted in January’s operating profit 
being ahead of last year and our internal plan.
In UK Retail OTC amounts staked were down 11.2% with net 
revenue down 5.8%, reflecting a stronger margin and lower 
free bets. Average gross win per machine per week was down 
4.0% against the comparative period last year. The trial of new 
machines is well underway and early results are promising. 
eGaming net revenue was down 0.5% overall with Sportsbook 
showing 8.0% growth. 
Since the start of the year, the High Rollers business has 
contributed a further £8.6 million of operating profit. 
With a strengthened balance sheet we remain confident in our 
ability to emerge from the economic downturn with a stronger, 
more focused business with good growth opportunities and we 
are committed to rising to the challenges that lie ahead.

SHORT
OVERVIEW
There are certain areas we can prioritise 
which will deliver upside to Ladbrokes in 
a relatively short period of time.
Cost control
The Group has a high ﬁ xed cost base and so 
the priority of cost control in a deteriorating 
economic environment was well recognised. 
Our focus on cost saving initiatives has 
intensiﬁ ed and we have achieved year on year 
costs reductions of 1.0% in UK Retail and 0.6% 
in eGaming in 2009. We have also put in place 
additional initiatives to deliver further cost 
savings in 2010:
We recognised that there was an opportunity 
to improve our machine offering and to 
introduce competitive tension into the estate. 
We have therefore implemented the following 
initiatives in the second half of 2009:
  Pay freeze across the Group. 
   UK Retail: Premium pay buyout will deliver a £12m 
annualised saving from Q4 2010.
   eGaming: step change in the cost proﬁ le with move 
of our Sportsbook to Gibraltar, with a £7.5m beneﬁ t 
through savings on gross proﬁ ts tax and levy 
payments partially offset by some additional costs. 
   eGaming: £3.9m of identiﬁ ed savings to partially 
mitigate the costs of expanding abroad. 
   Core Telephone Betting: initiatives (including closing 
Liverpool call centre) to deliver £2.7m saving. 
   Core Telephone Betting: recent decision 
to further reduce our cost base by routing 
calls into certain shops.
These cost initiatives mean 
that we expect to reap 
the full beneﬁ t of our strong 
operational gearing when 
the recovery materialises.
   New improved “Revolution” platform (offering 
enhanced graphics, utility and 20 new games) was 
installed on the current Barcrest terminals (rolled 
out during Q4 2009).
   Began trialling Global Draw machines in 78 shops 
(rolled out during Q3 2009).
   Began trialling Inspired Gaming software platform 
in 81 shops (rolled out during Q3 2009).
The new shape of the estate will be decided during 
Q2 2010, based upon performance in a Q1 2010 trial, 
and is expected to be implemented during the second 
half of 2010.

Maximise OddsOn Focus on cash 
In 2008 we launched our OddsOn! loyalty 
programme which now accounts for around
40% of Over the Counter amounts staked. 
The enhanced understanding of our retail 
customers is unparalleled in the retail betting 
industry. During the year we have made the 
following changes to how we use the card 
and how we will do so going forward:
The importance of cash remains key as we look 
to continue to pay down debt. In addition to the 
rights issue, which gives us a strong ﬁ nancial 
base, we announced the following changes:
    We have moved from recruitment focus to 
targeted marketing.
   Greater analysis and usage of retail customer 
understanding.
   Reduced the number of free bets during the course 
of 2009 with a change to the award scheme in July.
   Freebet costs in UK Retail are expected to fall 
from £16.3 million in 2009 to £10 million in 2010.
   Intention to maximise the opportunity of OddsOn! 
as medium for improved cross channel Customer 
Relationship Management. For example, shops are 
now technically eGaming afﬁ liates with a campaign 
incentivising OddsOn! users to deposit in eGaming.
    Exit Italy Retail – a process which is ongoing. 
We shall report on progress in due course.
     In November 2009 the Casino was closed and in 
January 2010 the operating licence was sold for net 
proceeds of £4.3 million.

Overview How we measure our progress Our objectives
Grow net revenue
The Group intends to do this in two ways: 
  by continually seeking to improve both the 
OTC and machine offering. The Group seeks  
to expand and improve the betting  
opportunities available to customers while 
maintaining the integrity of the Group’s risk 
management systems; and
  by promoting brand loyalty amongst its 
customers. It is widely recognised that  
location remains one of the key variables for  
a customer’s decision to enter a betting shop. 
The Group is exploring ways to promote  
brand loyalty even if perhaps their closest 
betting shop is that of a competitor.
Continually improve 
the cost base 
In 2009 the UK Retail business succeeded  
in reducing costs by 1%. The majority of the  
savings were delivered through the staff cost  
line where the Group has worked very hard  
to streamline the business. Costs remain  
a key area of focus for the team who are  
continuing to seek to control costs against  
an inflationary backdrop.
 Improve the shop  
estate footprint 
The Group is focused on the profitability  
of the estate and through the continued process  
of relocation, refurbishment and the closure  
of loss making shops seeks to improve the  
current footprint. The Group also seeks to  
open new shops which offer attractive returns  
on investment.

Growing the estate OddsOn programme
targeted marketing
During 2008/09 we developed and tested an updated shop  
format for use in new licence developments and existing shop 
refurbishments that reduced capital costs by 10%, reduced 
carbon emissions by in excess of 20% and generated promising 
levels of shop profit contribution. Using a more sophisticated 
method of site identification, with census, sociodemographic and 
OddsOn! data, we are planning on opening 50 shops in 2010  
at a cost of c£10 million. We also plan to relocate and refurbish  
a further 70 shops. The investment in new licences is expected  
to pay back within two to three years.
In June 2008 Ladbrokes became the first retail bookmaker to 
offer a large scale system driven loyalty programme in its betting 
shops. Ladbrokes believes it gives the Group a competitive 
advantage in terms of customer understanding and the ability to 
adopt a more sophisticated customer relationship management 
programme with its retail customers. As per page seven, there 
have been some recent modifications to the OddsOn! 
programme, including a change in the point award scheme and 
a move from its initial recruitment focus to targeted marketing. 
For example, we are now able to encourage customers who  
visit the shops on Saturdays but not Sundays to make an extra 
visit over the weekend, and we can measure the response.  
We are also trialling the use of OddsOn! on machines and 
cross-channel with eGaming.
Premium pay buyout
During 2009 the Group bought out premium pay for shop staff.  
In exchange for a one-off cash payment the staff agreed to 
receive normal pay on Sundays and Bank holidays, where they 
had been receiving double time.
The nature of the cash payments means that the savings from  
moving to single time will only be seen from Q4 2010, when the 
annualised benefit of circa £12 million will begin to come through.

How we measure our progress Our objectives
Enhance the customer’s  
online experience 
The Group intends to do this by continually 
improving its existing products, exploring/
developing more product verticals, improving 
the customer interface and enhanced Customer 
Relationship Management.
Maximise brand awareness  
and the multi-channel offering
Ladbrokes has the most recognised betting  
brand in the UK (see page 27). This is a competitive 
advantage which must be capitalised upon. 
Ladbrokes advertises through television and 
online promotion and we are also targeting new 
marketing opportunities through social media such 
as Facebook and T witter. In addition, there are 
opportunities to maximise the brand across the 
various channels including Retail and eGaming and 
through exciting new channels such as mobile.
Expand internationally 
European regulation is changing quickly –  
page 16 touches upon the current international 
regulatory environment. Given the uncertainty in 
some countries there is a balance to be achieved 
between delivering top line growth and the quality 
of those earnings. Ladbrokes’ strategy is currently 
relatively prudent with a targeted approach to 
countries which are legalising online betting and/ 
or gaming or where the risk reward of entry is 
deemed acceptable. Entry may be organically 
under the Ladbrokes brand, through partnerships 
(which offer local knowledge, a high profile  
brand or government connections) or through 
consolidation. Entry strategies are dependent  
upon circumstances.

Our joint venture, Sportium, is now the clear

doubled in size during the course of 2009.) 
The business needs scale to deliver improved 
proﬁ tability so in 2010 we intend to increase 
the estate in Madrid to 92 corners and 14 
shops. We are also developing a dialogue with 
other autonomous regions to persuade them 
to license retail betting.
Sell Italy Retail 
The tender for Italian retail licences in 2006/7 was viewed 
as an attractive growth avenue. However, given the subsequent 
competitive and regulatory environment and the capital necessary 
to gain sufﬁ cient scale, the Board recognised the need to limit 
the exposure and in August 2009 announced the decision to exit

The tender for Italian retail licences in 2006/7 was viewed 
as an attractive growth avenue. However, given the subsequent 
competitive and regulatory environment and the capital necessary 
to gain sufﬁ cient scale, the Board recognised the need to limit 
the exposure and in August 2009 announced the decision to exit

OVERVIEW
The rate of growth of the 
industry is impacted by 
changes in regulation. 
This page is not a full summary of regulation in every country but 
a brief overview of what’ s on the agenda in regions which are, at 
present, most relevant or potentially interesting for Ladbrokes. 
(This is not a full list and may obviously change. It does not cover 
all potential changes but highlights key developments.) 
Belgium
Online: A draft law on remote gambling, which currently limits 
online licences to ofﬂ ine licensees only, has been approved by the 
Belgian government and awaits the signature of the King. 
Denmark
Online: It is expected that a draft law will be presented in February 
2010, having already been notiﬁ ed to the European Commission. 
This would then open up the market, in early 2011, to sportsbetting, 
casino and poker.
Finland
Online: Current exclusive rights framework for three state owned 
monopolies became subject to EC infringement proceedings in 
2006. In response Finland initiated a reform process in 2007 
which is still underway; the two stage reform process has 
been delayed.
France
Online: Current proposals to regulate poker, sportsbetting and 
horserace betting with taxes of 2%, 6.2% and 5.2% of amounts 
staked respectively. Amendments due to be debated in French 
senate in late February. 
Germany
Online: Moves are now underway, following the election, to bring 
forward alternatives to the current Interstate Gambling Treaty – 
which has a blanket ban on internet gambling. Awaiting ECJ 
judgements to referred gambling cases in the hope that clarity 
will be provided on legal status of country’s monopolistic, state 
based approach. 
Ireland 
Republic of Ireland Retail: Turnover tax maintained at 1%.
Remote: Dept. of Justice held a consultation in 2009 exploring 
modernising current regulatory framework – conclusion outstanding.
Northern Ireland Retail: Dept. of Social Development requested 
submissions for a Strategic Review of Gambling Policy, Practice 
and Law.
Italy 
Online: Regulation currently allows: horseracing and sports betting, 
national number games, lottery products and tournament poker. 
New proposals have been made to expand offering to cash poker 
and casino games with industry expectation for later this year. 
Norway
Online: Expected to implement ﬁ nancial transaction blocking 
system in the near future.
South Africa
Online: Sportsbetting licensing at the regional level which enables 
access. National Gambling Amendment Bill will enable the 
National Gambling Board to issue licences to websites offering 
online casino games.
Spain 
Retail: Regulation on regional basis – currently Basque and 
Madrid regions are the only to have legislated. Further regions 
are considering introducing licensed retail betting.
Online: The national regulator is also actively considering 
proposals to license online gambling. 
Sweden 
Online: Sweden is currently considering reforms to its gambling 
legislation, including more stringent advertising restrictions and 
blocking measures. The Government is expected to announce a 
draft bill shortly. It is expected to involve a partial licensing system 
for sports betting only.
The Netherlands
Online: An advisory committee has been set up to explore 
whether the country should regulate online – it is intended to ﬁ nish 
in March 2010.
UK
Retail: HM Treasury exploring moving machine taxation from 
AMLD/VAT to GPT, Category B stakes and prizes review 
expected in 2010, 3rd Prevalence Study to be published 
towards end of 2010.
Remote: DCMS consultation expected in 2010 to explore 
regulation of offshore operators targeting UK customers.
USA
Online: Currently illegal following signing of UIGEA in 2006. 
There have been developments at a Federal Level although 
majority of industry participants think regulation at a State level 
is likely to come ﬁ rst. States which are exploring this include 
New Jersey, Florida and California.

Is 2009 the most challenging year Ladbrokes has seen? 
Well I can’t vouch for performance prior to the 1990s but it’s 
certainly been one of the toughest years since I joined the 
Company in 1991. It’s up there with 1994/1995 when the 
National Lottery was introduced. 
Why has it been so difficult? 
In late 2008 we, and the industry, held the view that we would 
trade through the economic storm as the industry had in 
previous recessions … with relative resilience. As 2009 
progressed it became apparent that our business is more 
exposed to consumer cyclicality and therefore things have 
become much more challenging as the recession has taken  
hold and unemployment has risen.
Why do you think it’s shown greater cyclicality? 
The customer demographic has moved over the years to more 
naturally mirror the UK demographic norm. This graphic shows 
the shape of our current UK Retail customer base.
Following almost 20 years with 
Ladbrokes and nine at the helm, 
Christopher Bell will be stepping 
down as CEO in the summer.  
He gives his perspective on 2009.

What about the sporting results for the year? 
The sporting results certainly have not helped us in 2009. Using 
UK Retail as an example, the horseracing margin over the year 
has been slightly lower than we would naturally expect, down  
0.1 percentage points versus the five year average. However,  
the bigger impact was in football where, in the third quarter,  
an unusually low proportion of draws in the English Premier 
League resulted in a football win margin of only 0.2% for the 
quarter against a five year average of 21.4%. This meant that  
the total gross win margin for UK Retail was a full 0.7 percentage 
points lower than the five year average.
What has the business been doing to improve the 
performance of the Group? 
You will have seen on page 6 what our short-term priorities are –  
many of these initiatives were put in place during 2009 and  
we will continue to build upon them in 2010. With pressure on 
the top line and a high fixed cost base we quickly recognised  
the need to reduce costs. The machine and OddsOn! initiatives 
are to promote growth in the top line in an efficient manner,  
while the decisions to move our Sportsbook offshore, exit Italy 
and sell the Casino were to improve the overall efficiency of  
the Group.
What’s happening with regulation? 
Page 16 gives you an overview of the key regulatory 
development/agenda items in various countries.
In the UK, there are a number of ongoing consultations with both 
the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (‘DCMS’) and HM 
Treasury (‘HMT’). The timing of proposals resulting from these 
consultations is likely to be affected by the timing of the UK 
General Election. 
DCMS completed a pre-consultation on the scope of its review 
of Category B gaming machine stakes and prizes in September 
2009. Details of the planned review have yet to be published. 
In October 2009 HMT completed a consultation into the 
introduction of a gross profits tax on gaming machines to replace 
the existing gaming machine taxes (AMLD and VAT). Conclusions 
from the consultation have yet to be announced. 
In January 2010 DCMS announced a consultation to explore 
new licence requirements for overseas-based betting and 
gaming operators. Full details of the consultation are expected  
to be announced in March 2010. 
In January 2010 the panel, commissioned by the sports minister 
Gerry Sutcliffe, to examine the issue of sports betting integrity, 
published its report, with a number of recommendations, 
including the creation of a Sports Betting Intelligence Unit within 
the Gambling Commission. Ladbrokes welcomes the report  
as a proportionate response to an issue that is often  
significantly overstated. 
During 2009 it was agreed the Horseracing Levy would remain 
at 10% of gross win on British horseracing until April 2011. 
Negotiations for the following year’ s scheme will begin in March 2010. 
The 3rd British Gambling Prevalence Survey is to be published 
before the end of 2010 and fieldwork has already begun. When 
last published in 2007 the survey revealed that the level of problem 
gambling in the UK had remained at the same level as in 2000.
In Europe there are a number of regulatory developments in key 
markets and Ladbrokes is actively assessing these opportunities 
and its options for market-entry.
What is your view of the future? 
Until unemployment begins to fall I expect it will remain a 
challenging environment to operate in. However, given we have 
seen cyclicality in our performance during 2009, as the economy 
improves, we expect our performance to do likewise.  
I don’t have a crystal ball to predict when that will be but 
internally we feel the Group has good momentum moving into 
2010. The initiatives we put in place in 2009 will continue to 
develop which coupled with our strengthened balance sheet will 
leave us in a strong position to deliver in the coming months  
and to continue to grow in the coming years.

The UK betting industry
In January 2010 a new report by Deloitte revealed the 
important economic impact made by the betting industry 
on the British economy. Analysis in the report shows that 
the total contribution to the British economy from the British 
betting industry is £6 billion GVA (a measure of economic 
output analogous to GDP) and 100,000 jobs. This is 
equivalent to 0.5% of GDP and 0.3% of total employment.
  The ‘direct’ contribution (businesses providing betting 
products and services) is £3 billion GVA and 40,700 full  
time jobs
  The ‘indirect’ economic impact (of supporting businesses 
in the supply chain) is £3.1 billion in GVA terms and 
supports around 62,300 jobs
The retail betting industry alone is estimated to contribute 
£2.2 billion of GVA – which consists of:
 £700 million in wages paid to staff; 
 £800 million in profits (before interest and tax) and 
  £700 million is generated in taxes (excluding VAT which for 
retail betting amounts to £207 million).

BUSi NeSS review The tough environment of 2009 
has highlighted opportunities 
for improvement. We have made 
considerable progress on costs 
and there are a variety of other 
operational initiatives which will 
allow us to make progress in 2010.
Amounts staked for the OTC business declined 7.2% year 
on year. With the exception of Q3, when the business saw a 
low gross win margin and reasonable customer recycling, the 
trend in amounts staked has deteriorated through the year as 
the economic environment has worsened and unemployment 
has continued to rise. In Q4 the amounts staked for the OTC 
business were down 10.4% versus the corresponding period 
last year, although it is worth noting that the rate of decline 
in December improved from November despite a number of 
horserace cancellations. Analysis of our OddsOn! data and its 
proportion of activity suggests we have not seen a material 
decline in footfall over the period.
OTC gross win for the period declined by 12.4% to £427.4 
million with a gross win margin for the year of 15.9%, a full 
one percentage point lower than 2008. A weak horse margin 
contributed to this decline, however it was largely driven by 
football where the margin was 5.9 percentage points lower 
than 2008. In Q4 the proportion of drawn games and favourites 
winning moved to give an above average football margin but it 
still fell behind the fourth quarter of 2008. Our focus remains on 
overall OTC gross win contribution and we see no reason why 
we should not return to a more normalised margin in the medium 
term (five year average in 2004-2008 of 16.6%). 
OTC net revenue declined 13.9% to £412.5 million after 
adjusting for free bets. High levels of OddsOn! promotional and 
customer recruitment activity in the first half meant that OTC 
customers enjoyed £11.8 million of free bets versus £2.0 million 
in the comparative period in 2008. In the second half of 2009 the 
revised points award scheme and more targeted marketing led 
to a reduction in free bets to £3.1 million (H2 2008: £6.6 million).
As we have previously stated the development of our OddsOn! 
programme is a two to three year project and now the focus 
is on highly targeted campaigns aimed at driving revenue from 
specific customer activities and we are actively exploring cross-
channel opportunities. In 2010 we are guiding to £10 million of 
freebets which includes activity around the World Cup. We look 
forward to maximising the recruitment potential offered by the 
tournament and await with interest to see which team wins.
The average gross win per gaming machine per week was 
up 0.4% to £685 (2008: £682). During the year there were 
on average 7,892 terminals versus 8,044 terminals last year. 
Total machine gross win fell 1.3% during the year to £282.5 
million. The proportion of B3 (£1 stake: £500 jackpot) content 
being played has continued to increase to approximately 20% 
and there has been a corresponding uplift in margin by 0.15 
percentage points to 3.2%.

Off-course betting – UK 
The off-course betting market was established in 1961 in 
Great Britain, when the UK Government legalised off-course 
betting shops in Great Britain. The number of shops grew 
rapidly, by 1987 there were approximately 10,300 licensed 
betting offices (‘LBOs’) in Great Britain. Since then, the 
sector has experienced consolidation and a reduction in the 
number of betting shops. By 1994, there were 9,670 LBOs 
in Great Britain and in 2009 there are estimated to be 8,800 
shops. It is estimated William Hill has approximately 26.0%, 
Ladbrokes has approximately 24.0%, while Coral, Betfred 
and Totesport account for approximately 18.0%, 8.0% and 
6.0% respectively of LBOs in Great Britain. 
Although the number of adults regularly betting in shops in 
Great Britain has not changed materially, increasing from 
approximately 2.1 million in 2001 to 2.3 million in 2008, the 
introduction of the National Lottery in 1994 has contributed to 
changing social attitudes towards gambling. This, combined 
with the increased variety of gambling products offered 
(football, for instance, has become an increasing proportion 
of Ladbrokes’ UK OTC gross win), has led to growth in the 
market. Gambling is now a well-established and popular activity 
in the United Kingdom, representing more than 0.8% of total 
consumer spend in 2006.
Earlier in the year the focus was upon machine content and  
the first half saw the introduction of six new B2 and B3 games. 
As the year progressed it became apparent that the performance 
lagged that of competitors, so the decision was made to further 
improve the current Barcrest machines with a new ‘Revolution’ 
platform (which offers upgraded software, graphics, functionality 
and games) and to introduce competitive tension with trials 
of Global Draw and Inspired Gaming machines. The machine 
performance has experienced the usual disruption while 
customers get used to the new products, however in Q2  
2010 we expect to be in a position where we can decide  
what the future shape of the estate will be to optimise the 
machine performance.
The second half of 2010 should start to demonstrate that our 
machine initiatives can close the gap with the competition and 
enhance our key measure of absolute gross win per shop.
Total UK Retail net revenue fell by 9.2% over the year to  
£656.7 million.
Total costs (excluding gross profits tax) fell 1.0% in the year to 
£462.4 million driven primarily by staff efficiencies with the total 
employee hours worked reduced by 1.1 million (6%). The Group 
also bought out premium pay which will deliver approximately 
£12 million of cost savings per annum effective from Q4 2010. 
On a like for like shop basis 2010 operating costs are expected 
to be flat year on year.
Operating profit for the year was down 28.4% at £134.5 million. 
At 31 December 2009 there were 2,088 shops and 46 on-site 
trading outlets in Great Britain. During the year there were 14 
openings, 17 shop closures, six on-site outlet closures, 22 
relocations and 77 shop refurbishments. At the end of the year 
there were 7,903 machines. In 2010 the Group plans to open 50 
new shops which are expected to cost circa £10 million in capital 
expenditure. The planned shop openings have been carefully 
researched with appropriate site identification a key factor. Our 
analysis suggests that new licences and the planned relocations 
and refurbishments should deliver attractive returns and further 
strengthen our UK market position.

Business review In March the OddsOn! programme  
was launched in the Irish shop  
estate.
Off-course betting – Republic of Ireland 
Regulated under the Betting Act of 1931, the number of 
LBOs in the Republic of Ireland has increased since 2000 
from approximately 700, to approximately 1,200. Sports and 
horse betting is allowed in registered premises throughout 
the week (but not in the winter evenings unless there is an 
Irish horse race meeting). However, gaming machines are 
not available. Estimates suggest off-course betting grew by 
more than 110.0% between 2002 and 2006 and in 2007 
accounted for in excess of approximately 60.0% of the  
land based gambling revenue. It is a highly fragmented 
market with approximately 43.0% of LBOs controlled 
by Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and Boyle Sports with the 
remainder comprising smaller chains (each with less than  
5.0% share) and independent shops.

The environment in Ireland is particularly challenging with more 
than 95 shops closing across the industry during 2009. 
Like for like OTC amounts staked at constant currency declined 
8.6%. The OTC gross win margin was down 1.5 percentage 
points and consequently the like for like OTC gross win at 
constant currency fell 20.1%. In March the OddsOn! programme 
was launched in the Irish shop estate and quickly achieved 
more than 30.0% of amounts staked through the card. The free 
bets awarded reduced from £3.0 million in the first half during 
the recruitment phase to £1.6 million in the second half as we 
focused on targeted marketing.
Overall gross win in Ireland was down 5.7% at £86.3 million with 
the benefit of the Eastwood acquisition and favourable exchange 
rates more than offset by weakness in the amounts staked and a 
much lower gross win margin. 
Given the challenging environment, cost control remains a key 
area of focus. Like for like constant currency costs fell 4.7% while 
sterling operating costs in Ireland rose by 9.2% to £64.2 million 
(2008: £58.8 million) due to foreign exchange appreciation and the 
additional costs of the Eastwood and McCartan acquired shops. 
At 31 December 2009, there were 207 shops in the Republic of 
Ireland and 78 shops in Northern Ireland. Ten shops were closed 
during the year and we opened nine shops. 
In the Republic of Ireland, the Justice Department is considering 
modernising the 1931 Betting Act in conjunction with the 1956 
Gaming and Lotteries Act and the proposed legalisation of 
casinos. The consultation process has now finished and we 
await the conclusion of that review. 
The Department of Finance deferred plans to double betting 
tax from 1% of turnover to 2% pending a review of taxation 
arrangements for telephone and online betting.
In Northern Ireland submissions have been requested by the 
Department of Social Development for a Strategic Review of 
Gambling Policy, Practice and Law.

Gross win in Belgium increased 24.4%, as a full year’s 
contribution from additional shops acquired in December 2008 
was partially offset by a low margin. The costs for the business 
rose to reflect the increased costs associated with the higher 
amounts staked in the estate and the legal requirement to index 
employee costs, which this year rose 4.5%. Operating profit 
declined 3.2% to £3.0 million. The total number of shops at  
31 December 2009 was 298 following 23 closures and 13 shop 
openings during the year.

Bet volumes, the levels of amounts staked and gross win per 
outlet are all ahead of our expectations. At 31 December 2009 
the Madrid estate numbers 78 corners and five stand alone 
shops. The economic environment in Spain is difficult but the 
performance is very encouraging and Sportium is the clear 
market leader in Madrid. Start up losses are better than planned 
and we expect to be generating positive cash flows by the end 
of 2010. Moreover, we anticipate regulatory change in other 
regions in 2010 which will provide opportunity to build scale 
through the now proven, low capital, corner model. 
Off-course betting – Belgium
In Belgium, companies may operate sports betting  
operations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance 
and are liable to pay taxes in Belgium. Ladbrokes estimates 
that the licensed shop numbers have fallen to approximately 
375. In addition to the licensed shops, which are restricted  
to offering bets on horses, dogs and sports and which are 
also subject to protective distance restrictions, there are 
thought to be approximately 1,000 additional unlicensed 
operators. These operators, through a loophole in the law, 
can take sports bets and are not subject to protective 
distance restrictions.
The economic environment in Spain 
is difficult but the performance is  
very encouraging.
Off-course betting – Spain
In Spain, only Madrid and the Basque region have regulated 
the off-course betting market so far.

Business review 2009 has been a tough year  
for us. However we have a 
strategy for delivering strong 
returns over the medium-term 
through capitalising on our

exploiting selective international

Despite good growth in players in the eGaming business (active 
customers increased 5.6% in the year), the challenging economic 
climate has impacted revenues as customers reduced their 
spending, particularly those with higher staking patterns. With 
72% of eGaming net revenue derived from UK customers, this 
economic impact combined with aggressive Sportsbook price 
competition and a difficult poker market resulted in a 6.7% decline 
in revenue to £160.7 million. Without a major football tournament 
in 2009 the number of sign-ups grew 0.5% but average player 
yields fell from £237 to £210. 
Faced with aggressive price competition from competitors 
operating from offshore low tax environments, we took the 
decision to compete for horseracing and football business 
by offering enhanced prices and, from August, ‘best odds 
guaranteed’ for horseracing. This ensured we continued to grow 
our customer volumes and the amounts staked in the Sportsbook 
grew 10.7%. The pricing actions coupled with the adverse 
sporting results in Q3 resulted in a gross win margin of 6.5%,  
1.3 percentage points below 2008 and consequently net revenue 
fell 9.7% to £55.7 million. Active players grew by 6.0% despite the 
absence of a major football tournament. A key growth area is  
Bet in Play and amounts staked on our extensive range and 
depth of in-play markets grew by 32.0% over the year and now 
accounts for 41.3% of non-horseracing turnover. In November, 
two months ahead of schedule, we completed the relocation 
of our Sportsbook business to Gibraltar. This move enables the 
business to compete more effectively with other operators. 
Casino saw good levels of activity during 2009 with active players 
up 14.5%, delivered through online recruitment activity and an 
effective TV campaign in the UK. Real money sign ups increased 
27.8%. However, yields fell 14.0% because of a sharp reduction 
in spend by high staking VIP customers. As a result casino net 
revenue fell 2.1% to £52.0 million. The focus has been upon

improving our customer relationship management, particularly  
with our higher staking players. We continue to offer a very high 
level of choice, introducing an average of 12 new games every 
month in addition to launching a new live dealer casino  
in December 2009. 
Poker net revenue fell 18.3% during 2009 to £23.7 million as 
European sites continue to struggle to compete against those 
sites which accept US customers and consequently enjoy greater 
liquidity. Active players fell 6.2% with player yields falling 12.1% 
during the year. Our operational focus changed during the year 
to reach out to the casual, recreational player under our ‘poker to 
the people’ campaign which focuses on simplifying the offering 
to present Ladbrokes as the destination to learn to play the game 
and hone your skills. Quarter on quarter player volumes returned 
to growth in Q4. 
Games net revenue of £17.0 million was down 3.4%. Bingo net 
revenues have grown 13.9% to £12.3 million with successful TV 
advertising, sponsorship of the Australian soap, Neighbours, and 
the supporting promotional programme improving the average 
monthly active player days by 18.0% and improving the yield by 
18.4% to £122.
Operating costs of £107.0 million represent a small 0.6% 
reduction over 2008. This was despite the additional costs 
associated with enhanced live streaming content and the roll out 
of seven new European language sites.
Operating profit of £46.1 million was down 16.3%.
For 2010 the eGaming focus is upon both strengthening our 
leading position in the UK and expanding internationally in 
regulating markets. In January we launched the latest version 
of the Sportsbook which provides improved navigation to more 
markets and more live streaming content, an intelligent bet slip to 
encourage more multiple betting and increased personalisation. 
In January 2010 the business also received its Italian poker 
licence and advertising and promotion has begun to maximise the 
opportunity presented by inclusion in what is fast becoming the 
largest poker market outside of the US. 
In Europe the regulatory environment presents opportunities 
for Ladbrokes to enter new markets. Having now received our 
tournament poker licence in Italy, we are excited about the 
prospect of the introduction of cash poker games and casino 
gaming later in the year. In Spain we continue to work closely 
with the regulator in Madrid to acquire a regional licence for online 
sports betting as well as awaiting details of proposed national 
Spanish regulation. 
Outside of Europe we are announcing a partnership with our 
existing African partner, KaiRo, and have applied for a Western 
Cape licence to operate online sports betting in South Africa.  
We are also exploring opportunities in Australia.
Online gambling 
Online gambling has grown rapidly since it was established 
in the late 1990s, and increased broadband penetration 
and changing social attitudes towards gambling are widely 
expected to continue to drive growth in the market. In May 
2009 syndicated online gambling research estimated that 
online betting and gaming engaged approximately 2.6 million 
adults in the UK, with 1.1 million adults betting or gaming 
at least once a month. According to H2 Gaming Capital, 
between 2007 and 2012, the global gross gambling yield 
online will increase at a compounded annual growth rate of 
12.7% for Sportsbook, 17.6% for casino products, 10.2%  
for poker products and 18.7% for bingo products. 
The Group faces competition in its online operations 
from some bookmakers (such as William Hill, Coral and 
Paddy Power), exchanges such as Betfair and other online 
operators based elsewhere in the United Kingdom and 
overseas (including PartyGaming, 888.com and bwin)  
that are specifically targeting the United Kingdom and 
Europe. Competition in the online marketplace has and  
is expected to continue to intensify as new operators enter  
the market and existing operators improve and expand  
their product offerings. The competitive environment  
remains subject to change depending on regulatory  
and technological developments. 
Focus changed during 2009 to reach 
out to casual poker players under 
‘poker to the people’ campaign.

Profit from High Rollers was £66.9 million (2008: £80.1 million).
The Core Telephone Betting business has had a challenging 
year with the increasing difficulty of competing with offshore low 
tax operators, the continued shift of customers to the internet 
and poor sports results. Excluding High Rollers, net revenue 
was down 42.5% at £15.7 million with a gross win margin of 
just 5.4% compared to 7.6% in 2008. Unique active customers 
fell 11.2% to 96,300 (2008: 108,400), with average monthly 
active player days down by 11.9% and call volumes down  
by 9.5%. 
Operationally, we have taken mitigating actions as the call 
volumes have declined. Excluding High Rollers, operating costs 
of £16.6 million fell 17.8% with agent cost per call rising only 
1.8% to 58 pence despite the material drop in call volumes.  
In November we announced our proposal to close the Liverpool 
call centre which will contribute towards £2.7 million of cost 
savings in 2010. In addition we have taken the decision to 
introduce technology and training which will allow us to route 
calls to certain shops and further drive call handling efficiencies, 
whilst maintaining our fast response times and high quality 
service levels for our customers. 
Overhead costs
Our international team, although primarily focused on the 
opportunity presented by the People’s Republic of China,  
also continue to explore a number of growth opportunities 
around the world. The cost of international development in  
2009 was £2.6 million (2008: £4.9 million).
Corporate costs, before non-trading items, were 2.7% lower  
at £14.5 million (2008: £14.9 million).
Discontinued operations
In August the Board announced its intention to sell Italy Retail. 
The decision was made given the revenue growth being 
achieved was below expectations (due to the continued 
presence of a number of illegal shops, the increased competition 
in the market place and the withdrawal of the protective distance 
rule) plus the estate needed significant investment to achieve 
critical mass and the risk attached to achieving an acceptable 
return from that investment was not deemed to be attractive.  
The estate is well invested and the sale process is ongoing.
In November the Group also closed the Casino and in January 
2010 the operating licence was sold for net proceeds of  
£4.3 million. 
Capital structure 
In July the Group repaid the €464.5 million (£351.0 million) 
Eurobond and during the year extended £30 million of bank 
facilities from 2011 to 2013 and sourced an additional £30 
million of 2013 facilities. In October the Group completed a rights 
issue to raise £274.6 million. The cash proceeds were used to 
pay down debt and the Group took the opportunity to cancel 
£55 million of 2011 bank facilities. At 31 December 2009, the 
net debt for the Group was £694.2 million and the Group had 
£428.1 million of undrawn committed bank facilities available.
The net debt to EBITDA ratio for the Group at 31 December 
2009 was 2.5 times (3.3 times after adjusting for High Rollers).
On 18 February 2010 the Group announced a tender offer (the 
‘Tender Offer’) for its £250 million 7.125% Notes due 2012 (the 
‘2012 Notes’) and a proposal to issue new sterling-denominated 
fixed rate notes (the ‘New Notes’), with an expected maturity of 
seven years, to institutional investors. The rationale for the Tender 
Offer and New Notes is to extend the Group’s debt maturity 
profile. Purchases of the 2012 Notes under the Tender Offer will 
be conditional upon the successful completion of the issue of the 
New Notes.
Following approval by shareholders at the 2009 Annual General 
Meeting, the cancellation of the Company’s share premium 
account was confirmed by the court and became effective  
on 31 July 2009. Following this, the Company’s distributable 
reserves at the year end were £2.1 billion.

The Ladbrokes brand
Ladbrokes remains the leading front of mind betting/gambling 
brand among British adults (over 18 years of age). 33% of all 
adults spontaneously cited Ladbrokes before any other brand, 
the nearest competitor was at 16%. Nearly half (45%) of all 
British adults cited the Ladbrokes betting brand spontaneously. 
During 2009 the Ladbrokes brand has been active across all 
channels, with TV support for Casino, Bingo, and for the first 
time in the industry, Ladbrokes’ in-shop machines. 
In the second half of 2009 a full brand review programme was 
initiated by the Board to further strengthen our market leading 
position and ensure the Ladbrokes brand is best placed to grow 
across all products in the years ahead. The brand review will 
lead to a new communication positioning for the business in the 
first half of 2010 and into the summer’s Fifa World Cup.
Technology
T echnology remains a central pillar of Ladbrokes’ strategy and is 
pivotal to providing the best solutions and services in the betting 
and gaming industry. Irrespective of whether customers are playing 
on one of Ladbrokes’ websites, using the call centre or in-store, 
Ladbrokes’ industry-leading technology infrastructure and operating 
platform are critical in determining the quality of a customer’ s overall 
experience. We have created a system which integrates the core 
competencies of being a retailer (providing our customers with a full 
breadth of products), a bank (odds/managing risk) and a media 
company (providing dynamic and static content across various 
channels) with the additional complexity of doing so in absolute 
real-time. 
Our technological infrastructure enables: 
 
 on average, three new betting opportunities every minute; 
 
almost 20,000 bets per minute at peak times; 
 
over 37,000 live markets per week;
 
over 8 billion transactions annually; and 
 
 over 4.5 million customers to gain access to our betting and 
gaming content around the globe. 
Overlaying this are compliance requirements of the industry and 
differing regulatory regimes adopted by the various countries in  
which we operate. Security and compliance is paramount in the 
overall design and operation of every Ladbrokes environment,  
with advanced, real-time, integrated security systems installed 
to protect personal, financial and transactional data. 
Ladbrokes partners with best-of-breed third parties, qualified in  
the development and delivery of specific services across 
channels. These suppliers are integrated into the overall 
infrastructure and services that guarantee the delivery and 
support of our sophisticated technology platforms, which are 
deployed consistently at installations throughout the world. 
Our customers remain at the centre 
of our IT strategy.
During 2009 ladbrokescasino.com 
ran a number of TV advertising 
campaigns in the UK.

Trading summary – Continuing operations
Revenue 
Revenue from continuing operations decreased by £119.0 million 
(10.3%) to £1,032.2 million (2008: £1,151.2 million). Excluding 
High Rollers activity, revenue decreased by £89.2 million (8.5%) to 
£963.7 million (2008: £1,052.9 million) mainly as a result of reduced 
OTC performance in the UK Retail estate.
Profit before finance costs, tax and non-trading items 
Profit before finance costs, tax and non-trading items decreased 
by £95.4 million (28.8%) to £235.4 million (2008: £330.8 million). 
Excluding High Rollers activity, profit before finance costs, tax and 
non-trading items decreased by £82.2 million (32.8%) to £168.5 
million (2008: £250.7 million) reflecting decreased profits across  
all channels. 
Finance costs 
The net finance costs of £44.1 million were £21.1 million lower than 
last year (2008: £65.2 million) reflecting both lower interest rates 
and lower average net debt.
Profit before tax 
The decrease in trading profits partially offset by lower finance costs 
in the year has resulted in a 28.0% decrease in profit for continuing 
operations before taxation and non-trading items to £191.3 million 
(2008: £265.6 million).
Non-trading items before tax
£17.2 million of non-trading losses before tax includes a  
£6.1 million impairment charge and a £6.2 million loss on closure 
of shops in the UK and Irish Retail estate as well as £3.9 million of 
restructuring costs incurred across the Group. Additionally there is 
a £1.0 million loss (2008: £0.1 million gain) relating to net unrealised 
gains and losses on derivatives and on retranslation of foreign 
currency borrowings. 
Taxation
The Group taxation charge for continuing operations before non-
trading items of £28.6 million represents an effective tax rate of 
15.0% (2008: 14.5%). 
Discontinued operations
The £10.8 million trading loss in discontinued operations includes the 
loss before finance costs, tax and non-trading items from Italy Retail 
of £9.9 million (2008: £6.9 million) and from the Casino business of 
£0.9 million (2008: £1.1 million). A non-trading impairment charge of 
£64.1 million (£59.6 million net of tax) has been recognised against 
the carrying value of the Italy Retail business together with a £0.6 
million loss on disposal of assets. The resultant carrying value of Italy 
Retail at 31 December 2009 was £26.7 million. The Casino business 
was closed on 12 November 2009 and the operating licence was 
sold for net proceeds of £4.3 million on 22 January 2010. The total 
net loss recognised on the closure of the casino and sale of the 
operating licence was £6.0 million.

Earnings per share (EPS) – Continuing operations
EPS (before non-trading items) decreased 32.6% to 21.7 pence

Following this, the Company’s distributable reserves at the year end 
were £2.1 billion.
Rights issue
On 8 October 2009 the Group announced a fully underwritten 1 for 
2 rights issue at a price of 95 pence per share. The Group raised 
proceeds of £274.6 million, net of issue costs of £11.0 million.
Restatement of consolidated income statement and 
segment information note 
The Group has restated its comparative year ended 31 December 
2008 consolidated income statement and segment information 
note to reflect Italy Retail as a discontinued operation and for the 
adoption of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Details of these restatements can be found in notes 2 and 37

Reconciliation of gross win to revenue
The Group reports the gains and losses on all betting and gaming 
activities as revenue in accordance with IAS 39, which is measured 
at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from 
customers less fair value adjustment for free bets, promotions and 
bonuses. Gross win includes free bets, promotions and bonuses, as 
well as VAT payable on machine income.

responsibilities
 
     The Board holds the overall responsibility 
for risk management as an integral part of 
strategic planning
 
        The Executive Committee (made up of 
Executive Directors and senior executives) 
makes recommendations on the overall 
approach to risk management and identifies the 
key risks. The Executive Committee is assisted 
by a Risk Committee made up of Group and 
Divisional senior executives
 
      The Audit Committee is responsible for 
assessing the scope and effectiveness of the 
systems established to identify, assess, manage 
and monitor risks
 
     Each key risk is assigned Executive 
Director ownership
Risk methodology
 
     The Risk Committee considers the following 
impact areas in assessing risk: legal and 
regulatory, betting and gaming compliance, 
financial management and bookmaking, 
reputation, technology, data integrity and 
fraud protection, customers and employees 
 
     For each key risk the likelihood, 
consequence, mitigating controls and 
actions, risk owner and forecast residual risk 
are identified by the Risk Committee
 
     The overall risk level is quantified and 
assessed to ensure that the appropriate 
mitigation measures and future actions have 
been identified
Risk management process
 
     The key risks and uncertainties are assessed 
by the Risk Committee using a bespoke  
risk methodology and reviewed by the 
Executive Committee
 
     At each Board meeting any changes to key 
risks are identified and all key risks are 
reviewed formally by the Board twice yearly
 
     The risk management processes are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee annually
 
     Risk management forms an integral part of 
the Group’s internal control, planning and 
approval processes

BUSi NeSS review We pride ourselves on 
offering sophisticated betting 
and gaming products to a 
modern market. We value our 
reputation for fairness and 
integrity, behaving responsibly 
throughout all our operations. 
We also recognise the 
importance of good employee 
relationships and high levels of 
customer satisfaction. 
Our internal codes of conduct require business professionalism, 
honesty and integrity in all that we do. We seek to comply with 
all relevant legislation and to maintain good relationships with all  
our stakeholders.
A leader in our sector
Ladbrokes is committed to being among the leaders of our 
sector in responsible business practice. The Ladbrokes brand 
is recognised and trusted wherever we do business. This is 
something we strive to maintain.
During 2009 our high standards of Corporate Responsibility 
(‘CR’) were recognised by many index and award bodies. 
We were pronounced leaders in our sector in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) and for the 7th year in succession 
were included in the FTSE4Good Indices.
We have again been listed as one of Britain’s Most Admired 
Companies and in October, we won the PricewaterhouseCoopers 
Building Public Trust Award (BPTA) for Sustainability Reporting. 
The BPTA award recognises the greatest depth and relevance of 
sustainability reporting in the FTSE 250.
Strategic aims
The following CR issues have been identified as key to 
supporting our business growth and form the pillars of our  
CR strategy:
   
maintaining high ethical and socially responsible standards 
throughout our operations;
   
promoting responsible gambling behaviours across our 
business and the industry as a whole;
   
keeping our customers satisfied, well informed about and 
interested in the products and services we offer;
  attracting a diverse workforce and sustaining high levels 
of competence, motivation and loyalty to the business;
      
minimising the risks from our third-party relationships – business 
partnerships, joint ventures or within our supply chain;
  minimising the financial and reputational impact of 
non-compliance with CR legislation;
     minimising health, safety and security risks to our business, 
our employees and the general public from our operations;
  understanding global environmental agendas and minimising 
the impact of increasing environmental costs on our 
operations; and
     being a good corporate citizen and a respected neighbour 
in our communities.
We monitor our performance through appropriate KPIs reflecting 
each pillar of our CR strategy. Further detail on these is given 
in our separate CR report. Our progress has been good and 
remains aligned to our strategic aims.
Stakeholder engagement
Our stakeholders are all those people who have influence over 
our business and the industry we work in, and in turn those  
who we influence during our operations. Ladbrokes has a  
wide range of stakeholders from our shareholders, employees 
and customers, through to our regulators and problem  
gambling charities.
We believe that we should engage with our stakeholders and  
stay informed of their opinions. This knowledge is vital to 
the long term development of our business. We have a 
comprehensive programme in place to make sure that we 
engage at all levels in our organisation, more details of which  
are given in our separate CR Report.
In particular, we keep abreast of the policies and standards of the 
most significant of our investors and the research organisations 
which support them. We review their reports on Ladbrokes and 
engage in an ongoing dialogue where appropriate.
We also participate in a number of CR indices and disclosure 
schemes, providing information on the Group’s CR activities  
and taking note of their feedback on our submissions.
High standards
For many years we have supported the Association of British 
Bookmakers (ABB) and the Remote Gambling Association 
(RGA) in establishing industry-wide corporate responsibility 
standards and promoting self-regulation.
We are meeting regulatory requirements in all countries 
where we are licensed to operate and in particular those of 
the UK Gambling Commission. We continue to support the 
Commission’s three key licensing objectives to:
  keep crime out of gambling;
  ensure gambling is conducted fairly and openly; and
   
protect children and vulnerable people from being harmed 
or exploited by gambling.

All relevant personnel are trained to meet the required 
standards. To monitor compliance we have a comprehensive 
programme in place, headed by our Compliance Director and 
overseen by our Compliance Committee. This programme is 
subject to internal audit.
Responsible gambling 
Ladbrokes continues to work with its peers and national 
governments to improve responsible gambling behaviour  
across the industry.
We have our own systems in place to ensure that our 
customers are well informed, for example: about our products, 
about problem gambling issues and for our online customers, 
about their own gambling history.
We provide inherent protection to try to limit the possible 
financial impacts on our customers from excessive gambling, 
e.g. daily and weekly deposit limits and appropriate customer 
due diligence.
We protect the young and the vulnerable through, for example, 
clear marketing standards, strict age limits, online age 
verification checks and self-exclusion arrangements.
For most people, gambling is an enjoyable and harmless leisure 
pursuit. However, for a small number of people gambling can 
become a behavioural problem. Ladbrokes has a responsibility 
to help tackle problem gambling, understand its causes and 
promote its treatment. We make our employees aware of the 
symptoms of problem gambling and train them in how  
to respond. 
Ladbrokes was a founding member of the GREaT Foundation, 
formerly known as the Responsibility in Gambling Trust (RIGT),  
the Independent Betting Adjudication Service (IBAS) and, 
through GREaT, supports GamCare and the Gordon Moody 
Association (formerly Gordon House). 
We developed our front-line training programmes with the 
help of GamCare and we have trained all of our employees in 
responsible gambling practice.
A key role for GREaT is to develop a national public education 
and awareness strategy as part of the overall prevention of 
problem gambling agenda. The gambleaware website  
continues to perform well and the logo or website address 
www.gambleaware.co.uk is carried on all our websites  
and advertising.
Satisfied customers
We provide our customers with an enjoyable, efficient, secure, 
fair and socially responsible service and all our employees are 
trained to support this commitment.
We are keen to drive brand loyalty and all that the brand stands 
for, including trust and integrity. We seek customer views  
and encourage feedback on our employees and our services. 
We continually assess our performance through third-party 
audits (e.g. mystery shopper surveys) and monitoring customer 
complaints. Our mystery shoppers scores are consistently 
above 83% customer satisfaction. We are constantly receiving 
good customer feedback. We have been recognised again 
by the national WOW! Awards for good customer service and 
Angie Bowers from one of our Liverpool shops won the national 
Betting Shop Manager of the Year 2009.
Our customer loyalty card – OddsOn! – continues to grow 
with 260,000 new customers signing up in 2009 and a total of 
770,000 customers altogether. Through OddsOn! we have given 
back to our customers over 2.4 million free bets, with 1.8 million 
of those in 2009.
Engaged workforce
As our business becomes more sophisticated and technology 
driven, we need to ensure that we sustain a high level of 
competence across the business and increase our capacity  
to respond to changing market needs.
We recognise that our employees represent a centre of 
excellence for the industry – one which we wish to maintain.
A key part of our human resources strategy is to be a modern, 
attractive and fair employer and to value and recognise 
employee loyalty.
We work hard to engage with our employees, most specifically 
through our UK Staff Council.
Ladbrokes also provides clear opportunities for development 
and progression; all of which helps to maintain high levels of 
employee satisfaction and minimise turnover. Over the past year, 
all of our recruitment and training processes have been renewed 
to equip us for the fast changing industry we now operate in. 
During 2009 we launched our new management development 
programme “Aspire”, this complements our retail “Get Set” 
programme for shop staff. 
Our rewards and benefits programmes are proving to be best in 
class initiatives, having won a number of prestigious awards this 
year. These include: 
  
Employee Benefits Awards 2009 – Grand Prix Award and the 
award for the Most effective motivation and incentive strategy;
   
Personnel Today Awards 2009 – Award for excellence in HR 
Through Technology; and
   
HR Excellence Awards 2009 – Most compelling motivation 
scheme.
All our development programmes link directly to our business 
strategy and are paying dividends in enhanced performance.
Protecting our supply chain
We have a responsibility to assess the social, ethical and 
environmental risks associated with our business partnerships, 
joint ventures and product sourcing.

This year we have fully integrated our Environmental, Socially 
Responsible and Ethical Purchasing Policy into our central 
procurement process.
A safe and secure place to work
We aim for best practice health and safety standards throughout  
all our operations and we support a proactive culture of risk 
management. Ladbrokes has teamed up with Liverpool City 
Council as part of a pioneering UK scheme for better health 
and safety regulation. The Council will now act as a single point 
of contact – a Primary Authority – on health and safety issues 
affecting all Ladbrokes shops across the UK.
Our health and safety record in 2009 was good. We had no 
fatalities or major injuries across our business and following  
117 health and safety inspector visits in the UK alone, there 
were no enforcement notices or notified non-compliances.
Furthermore we had no prosecutions or convictions for health  
and safety offences.
One of the important risks to the health of our employees 
and our customers comes from breaches of security on our 
premises, such as robbery and theft. We have invested heavily 
in CCTV which is installed across all of our UK Retail estate, 
both to help reduce the number of incidents and to help protect 
employees and customers.
This year we have led the development of the Safebet Alliance  
– a voluntary code of robbery security standards for London 
Bookmakers. The code has been developed jointly by the 
industry and the Metropolitan police with input from other 
stakeholders including local councils and trade unions.
In addition, we carefully monitor and seek to minimise the  
financial impacts of health and safety related claims from across  
our business.
A new carbon strategy
Our main environmental focus is on energy efficiency, resource 
use and waste management. 
Working with the Carbon Trust, we have now developed a 
company wide Carbon Strategy. This will put us in a good 
place to meet the requirements of the UK Carbon Reduction 
Commitment legislation which comes into force in April 2010. 
We have also identified cost savings through a number of 
energy efficiency and waste recycling initiatives which will be 
implemented across the UK Retail estate. 
We have been working with Greenstar to manage our retail 
shop waste. This service has now been rolled out to the whole 
of the country. Greenstar have been monitoring our waste and 
trialling a shop recycling scheme called GreenSpace in the 
Nottingham area, which was rolled out to the rest of the country 
in 2009. We are also making sure that our suppliers share our 
environmental commitment by working together to reduce our 
overall Carbon Footprint. 
Our ultimate goal is to reduce our UK Carbon Footprint by 21%  
by 2013.
A good corporate citizen
We strive be a valued member of the communities in which we 
operate. We recognise the links our employees have to their 
own communities and through Ladbrokes in the Community 
Charitable Trust (LICCT) we support their activities by giving 
something back.
LICCT has raised over £4.8 million for good causes since it was 
established in 2003. The funds have been raised by employees 
all around the country. During 2009 LICCT donated over 
£650,000 to charitable and community causes across the UK.
In addition, Ladbrokes has donated over £700,000 to 
community safety, citizenship and problem gambling charities.
Over 1,700 of our staff were involved in our joint initiatives with 
Cancer Research UK, including Race for Life, Run for Moore 
and Run 10k. These three events alone raised over £125,000.
Governing well 
Our aim is to embed CR policies and processes within the day 
to day operation of our business. The Chief Executive, who sits 
on both the Executive Committee and the Board, is ultimately 
responsible for CR matters. The Chief Executive is supported by 
the CR Team who provide an overview and advisory function for 
the business.
Overall governance of CR is the responsibility of the Executive 
Committee and the Board. CR and governance issues are given 
full consideration by the Executive Committee and the Board 
when defining the Ladbrokes business strategy.
CR risks are regularly reviewed by the business and are 
considered by the Board, as appropriate, as a part of the 
corporate risk review process described earlier in this report. 
CR matters are reported to the Board on a regular basis (as a 
minimum quarterly) thus forming part of the Board calendar, along 
with tailored director briefings and where appropriate, training.
The Board reviews the key CR issues and agrees the annual 
CR strategy. Board members are provided with adequate 
background information to support their decision making. The 
Remuneration Committee also takes account of CR issues 
when determining executive remuneration and benefits. CR 
governance and management processes are subject to internal 
audit and the reporting process is externally reviewed by our  
CR advisors, Acona Ltd.
Our full CR Report
For further details of our CR policies and performance, please 
refer to our 2009 CR Report which is available on the 
Company’s website, www.ladbrokesplc.com.
Further information on our approach to responsible business is also 
included in the Directors’ Report on page 43 of this Annual Report.

The Board continues to be committed to high standards of corporate 
governance. The Board strives to provide the right leadership, strategic 
oversight and control environment to produce and sustain delivery  
of value to all of the Company’s shareholders. The Board applies 
integrity, principles of good corporate governance and accountability 
throughout its activities and each director brings independence of 
character and judgement to the role. All of the members of the Board 
are individually and collectively aware of their responsibilities to the 
Company’s stakeholders.
The following describes the Board’s approach to corporate  
governance and how the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
has been applied.
Compliance statement
In 2009 the Company was subject to and complied with the provisions 
set out in section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
that was published in June 2008 by the Financial Reporting Council 
and which is available via a link on its website www.frc.org.uk.
Board
The Board currently comprises the non-executive Chairman, four 
executive directors and seven independent non-executive directors. 
The Chairman has a primary responsibility for the running of the Board 
and for ensuring effective communication with shareholders. The Chief 
Executive is responsible for the operations and for the development  
of strategic plans and initiatives for consideration by the Board.  
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by 
the Board. Mr N M H Jones acts as Senior Independent Director, the 
principal roles and responsibilities of which are described elsewhere.
The other significant commitments of the Chairman during 2009 are 
detailed in his biography on page 36.
The Board schedules eight meetings each year, but arranges to meet 
at other times, as appropriate. There was a full attendance at the 
twelve meetings held in 2009. In addition, the Chairman met during  
the year with the non-executive directors without the executive 
directors present.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for  
its decision and approval. These include the approval of the strategic 
and annual profit plans, key public information releases (e.g. financial 
statements), dividends, major acquisitions and disposals, material 
contracts, treasury and other Group policies. The section ‘Internal 
control’ on page 40 contains further information on how the  
Board operates.
The Company seeks to ensure that the Board is supplied with 
appropriate and timely information to enable it to discharge its duties. 
The Board requests additional information or variations to regular 
reporting as it requires. A procedure exists for directors to seek 
independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties,  
if necessary. All directors have access to the advice and services  
of the Company Secretary.
All directors receive an induction on joining the Board. A combination of 
tailored Board and committee agenda items and other Board activities, 
including briefing sessions, assist the directors in continually updating 
their skills and the knowledge and familiarity with the Company  
required to fulfil their role both on the Board and on Board committees. 
In addition, external seminars, workshops and presentations are made 
available to directors. The Company provides the necessary resources 
for developing and updating directors’ knowledge and capabilities.
The Chairman conducts an appraisal with each director. The Senior 
Independent Director, having consulted with the other directors, 
conducts an appraisal interview with the Chairman. Each director 
completes a questionnaire on the effectiveness and processes of the 
Board and its committees. The results are considered by the Board and 
the individual committees.
Whilst all directors are expected to bring an independent judgement  
to bear on issues of strategy, performance, resources (including key 
appointments) and standards of conduct, the independent non-
executive directors were selected and appointed for this purpose.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board through 
the Chairman on all governance matters.
Appointment and replacement of directors
A person may be appointed as a director of the Company by the 
shareholders in general meeting by ordinary resolution (requiring a 
simple majority of the persons voting on the relevant resolution) or by 
the directors; no person, other than a director retiring (by rotation or 
otherwise), shall be appointed or re-appointed a director at any general 
meeting unless he or she is recommended by the directors or not less 
than seven nor more than 35 clear days before the date appointed for 
the meeting, notice is given to the Company of the intention to propose 
that person for appointment or re-appointment in the form and manner 
set out in the Company’s articles of association.
Each director who is appointed by the directors (and who has not been 
elected as a director of the Company by the members at a general 
meeting held in the interval since his or her appointment as a director  
of the Company) is subject to election as a director of the Company  
by the members at the first Annual General Meeting following his or  
her appointment. Each director is subject to re-election by the members 
at the third Annual General Meeting following his or her election or last 
re-election by the members in general meeting (or at such earlier 
Annual General Meeting as the directors may decide). The independent 
non-executive directors understand that the Board will not automatically 
recommend their re-election by shareholders. The Chairman and the 
independent non-executive directors are appointed for a specified term 
of approximately three years, subject to re-election.
The Companies Act allows shareholders in general meeting by ordinary 
resolution (requiring a simple majority of the persons voting on the 
relevant resolution) to remove any director before the expiration of his 
or her period of office, but without prejudice to any claim for damages 
which the director may have for breach of any contract of service 
between him or her and the Company.
A person also ceases to be a director if he or she resigns in writing, 
ceases to be a director by virtue of any provision of the Companies  
Act, becomes prohibited by law from being a director, becomes 
bankrupt or is the subject of a relevant insolvency procedure, or is 
requested to resign by notice signed by all the other directors or if the 
Board so decides following at least six months’ absence without leave 
or he or she becomes subject to relevant procedures under the mental 
health laws.

Powers of the Company’s directors
The Company’s articles of association specify that, subject to the 
provisions of the Companies Act, the memorandum and articles  
of association of the Company and to any directions given by 
shareholders by special resolution, the business of the Company is to 
be managed by the directors, who may exercise all the powers of the 
Company, whether relating to the management of the business or not.
Board committees
The Board has four standing committees, all of which have written 
terms of reference clearly setting out their authority and duties.  
The terms of reference of the audit, nomination and remuneration 
committees, which are reviewed annually, can be viewed on the 
Company’s website (www.ladbrokesplc.com). The executive 
committee, the risk committee and the compliance committee referred 
to elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts 2009 are not formal 
board committees.
Audit committee
The members of the committee are:
Appointment Committee
 date Role
Mr H E Staunton 1 September 2006 Chairman
Mr N M H Jones 16 May 2003 Member
Mr D M Shapland 16 February 2010 Member
Ms C P Wicks 1 June 2004 Member
All members of the committee are independent non-executive 
directors. Appointments to the committee are made by the Board  
at the recommendation of the nomination committee, which consults 
with the Chairman of the audit committee.
The Board has satisfied itself that the members of the committee have 
recent and relevant financial experience.
The committee is provided with sufficient resources to undertake  
its duties. It has access to the services of the Company Secretary  
(who acts as secretary to the committee) and all other employees.  
The committee is able to take independent legal or professional  
advice when it believes it necessary to do so.
The committee meets as required, but not less than three times a year. 
There was full attendance at the four meetings held in 2009. Although 
other directors, including the Group Finance Director, attend audit 
committee meetings, the committee also meets for private discussions 
with the external auditor, who attends all of its meetings, and can do  
so with the internal auditor.
The main role and responsibilities of the committee in 2009 were to:
    monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Company;
     review the Company’s internal financial control and risk 
management systems;
     monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit 
function; and
     oversee the Company’s relationship with the external auditor 
including the recommendation to the Board of its appointment  
and remuneration.
Should the committee’s monitoring and review activities reveal any 
material cause for concern or scope for improvement, it will make 
recommendations to the Board on action needed to address the issue 
or make improvements.
The main activities of the committee in 2009 were as follows:
     with the assistance of reports received from management and the 
external auditor, the critical review of the significant financial reporting 
issues in connection with the preparation of the Company’s financial 
and related formal statements;
  assessing the scope and effectiveness of the systems established 
to identify, assess, manage and monitor financial and non-financial 
risks; and
 monitoring the integrity of the Company’s internal financial controls.
The committee does so by reference to:
(a) summaries of business risks and mitigating controls;
(b)  regular reports and presentations from the head of key risk 
functions, internal audit and external audit; and
(c)  the results of the system of annual self-certification of compliance 
with key controls and procedures;
  monitoring and reviewing the plans, work and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function, including any actions taken following any 
significant failures in internal controls;
  reviewing, with the external auditor, its terms of engagement, the 
findings of its work, and at the end of the audit process reviewing its 
effectiveness; and
 reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external auditor.
The external auditor reports to the committee on the actions taken to 
comply with professional and regulatory requirements and with best 
practice designed to ensure its independence. The committee has 
agreed a policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply 
non-audit services, the application of which it monitors. The policy, 
which can be viewed on the Company’s website (www.ladbrokesplc.
com), specifies services that may not be provided and contains a  
level of cost at which committee approval is required enabling the 
committee to satisfy itself that auditor objectivity and independence  
are safeguarded.
Finance committee
This committee meets as required to deal with all routine business that 
excludes matters that are specifically reserved to the Board or to 
another committee and specific matters delegated to it by the Board 
requiring attention between scheduled Board meetings. Any two 
directors can conduct the business of this committee.
Nomination committee
The members of the committee are the Chairman of the Board and two 
or more independent non-executive directors. The current members of 
the committee are:
Appointment Committee
 date Role
Mr P Erskine 18 February 2009 Chairman
Mr N M H Jones 16 May 2003 Member
Mr C J Rodrigues 18 May 2007 Member
Appointments to the committee are made by the Board.
The committee is provided with sufficient resources to undertake  
its duties. It has access to the services of the Company Secretary  
(who acts as secretary to the committee) and all other employees.  
The committee is able to take independent legal and professional 
advice when it believes it necessary to do so.
The committee meets as required but not less than twice a year.  
Two meetings of the committee were held in 2009 and all the members 
of the committee (constituting the membership of the committee at the 
time of each meeting) were in attendance.

Governance The main role and responsibilities of the committee are to:
  review the structure, size and composition of the Board (which 
includes an objective and comprehensive evaluation of the balance  
of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board) and make 
recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes;
  consider succession planning for the directors and other senior 
executives and make recommendations to the Board;
  identify and nominate for the approval of the Board candidates 
to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise;
  review the leadership of the Company to ensure the continued ability 
of the Company to compete effectively in the marketplace;
  recommend candidates for the role of Senior Independent Director 
and for membership of the audit and remuneration committees, in 
consultation with the Chairmen of those committees; and
  make recommendations to the Board concerning the re-appointment 
of non-executive directors at the end of their specified term of office 
and the re-election by shareholders of any director under the 
retirement by rotation provisions.
The committee performed the above activities as necessary in 2009.
During 2009 two non-executive directors, Mrs S Bailey and  
Mr D Shapland were appointed (both with effect from 18 November 
2009). The structure, size and composition (including skills, knowledge 
and experience) of the Board were reviewed. Descriptions of the roles 
and capabilities required were prepared and suitable candidates were 
identified by external advisers.
Remuneration committee
Details of the remuneration committee, including membership, are set 
out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 56, which 
should be read in conjunction with this section of this report.
Internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the system of internal control 
operating throughout the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness.  
No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Group’s system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and to provide the Board with reasonable assurance that 
potential problems will normally be prevented or will be detected in a 
timely manner for appropriate action.
The Company has had procedures in place throughout the year and  
up to 18 February 2010, the date of approval of this Annual Report, 
which accord with the Internal Control Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code published in September 1999.
The Board has delegated the detailed design of the system of internal 
control to the executive directors.
The control framework and key procedures during 2009 were as follows:
  the Group operates through two principal divisions, Retail and 
Remote Betting and Gaming. Responsibilities for managing business 
risks arising were defined by the Board;
  the executive directors met regularly together and with other senior 
executives (the executive committee) to consider Group financial 
performance, business development and Group management issues. 
Divisional management comprised executives with appropriate 
functional responsibilities. Divisional management met regularly  
to manage their respective businesses; 
  the Board established corporate strategy and Group business 
objectives. Divisional management integrated such objectives into 
business strategies for presentation to the Board with supporting 
financial objectives; 
  there was an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by the Group. Major business 
risks and their financial implications were appraised by the executive 
committee to which a committee of Group and divisional executives 
(the risk committee) reported. This was an integral part of the strategic 
planning process. The appropriateness of controls was considered by 
executives, having regard to cost/benefit, materiality and the likelihood 
of risks crystallising. Key risks and actions to mitigate those risks were 
considered at each regular Board meeting and were formally reviewed 
and approved by the Board twice yearly;
  divisional budgets, containing financial and operating targets, capital 
expenditure proposals and performance indicators, were reviewed by 
the executive directors and supported divisional business strategies. 
The Group profit plan was approved by the Board;
  reports on Group and divisional performances were regularly provided 
to directors and discussed at Board meetings. Performance against 
both budgets and objectives together with management of business 
risks, were reviewed with divisional management, as were forecasts 
and material sensitivities. The Board regularly received reports from 
key executives and functional heads covering areas such as 
operations, forecasts, business development, strategic planning, 
human resources, legal and corporate matters, compliance, health 
and safety and corporate responsibility; 
  there was a Group-wide policy governing appraisal and approval 
of investment expenditure and asset disposals. Major projects were 
reported on at each regular Board meeting. Post investment audits 
were undertaken on a systematic basis and were formally reviewed  
by the Board twice yearly;
  key policies and control procedures (including treasury, compliance 
and information system controls) are documented in manuals having 
Group-wide application. Operating companies also used procedure 
manuals that integrated with Group controls;
  a system of annual self-certification of compliance with key controls 
and procedures was operated throughout the Group;
  the Group had an internal audit function, outsourced to Deloitte LLP , 
which reported to management on the Group’s operations; and 
  to underpin the effectiveness of controls, it was the Group’s policy to 
recruit and develop management and staff of high calibre, integrity 
and with appropriate disciplines. High standards of business ethics 
and compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies were 
demanded from staff at all levels.
The role of the audit committee in reviewing the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control is explained in the section ‘Audit committee’ 
on page 39.
The Board also conducts an assessment of the effectiveness of the 
internal control system. The assessment takes account of all significant 
aspects of internal control including: risk assessment; the control 
environment and control activities; information and communication;  
and monitoring.

Relations with shareholders
There is a regular programme of meetings with major institutional 
shareholders to consider the Group’s performance and prospects.  
In addition, presentations are made twice yearly after the 
announcement of results, the details of which, together with the 
Group’s financial reports and announcements, can be accessed via  
the Group’s internet site. The Chairman met in 2009 with several 
institutional investors and their representative bodies in addition to 
results presentations and the Annual General Meeting. Other directors 
are available to meet the Company’s major shareholders if requested.
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they 
have concerns, which contact through the usual channels of Chairman, 
Chief Executive and Finance Director has failed to solve or for which 
such contact is inappropriate. 
The Board receives a monthly market report from the Company’s 
brokers who also present to the Board annually. A twice-yearly 
presentation is made to the Board reporting on the programme of 
meetings with major institutional shareholders and a report on investor 
relations is given at each Board meeting. Principles of ownership, 
corporate governance and voting guidelines issued by the Company’s 
major institutional shareholders, their representative bodies and 
advisory organisations are circulated to, and considered by, the Board.
The Company corresponds regularly on a range of subjects with its 
individual shareholders who have an opportunity to question the Board 
at the Annual General Meeting. For further information on our relations 
with shareholders please refer to Shareholder Information on pages 
126 and 127.
Rights attaching to the shares and restrictions on voting  
and transfer
The Company’s share capital is £287.0 million divided into 
1,012,941,175, ordinary shares of 28
1
⁄ 3p each. Subject to any 
suspension or abrogation of rights pursuant to relevant law or the 
Company’s articles of association, the ordinary shares confer on their 
holders (other than the Company in respect of its treasury shares):
(a)  the right to receive out of profits available for distribution such 
dividends as may be agreed to be paid (in the case of a final 
dividend in an amount not exceeding the amount recommended by 
the Board as approved by shareholders in general meeting or in the 
case of an interim dividend in an amount determined by the Board) 
– all dividends unclaimed for a period of 12 years after having 
become due for payment are forfeited automatically and cease  
to remain owing by the Company;
(b)  the right, on a return of assets on a liquidation, reduction of capital 
or otherwise, to share in the surplus assets of the Company 
remaining after payment of its liabilities pari passu with the other 
holders of ordinary shares; and
(c)  the right to receive notice of and to attend and speak and vote in 
person or by proxy at any general meeting of the Company – on a 
show of hands every member present or represented and voting has 
one vote and on a poll every member present or represented and 
voting has one vote for every share of which that member is the 
holder; the appointment of a proxy must be received not less than 
48 hours before the time of the holding of the relevant meeting or 
adjourned meeting or in the case of a poll taken otherwise than at  
or on the same day as the relevant meeting or adjourned meeting 
be received after the poll has been demanded and not less than  
24 hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll.
These rights can be suspended. If the member, or any other person 
appearing to be interested in shares held by that member, has failed  
to comply with a notice pursuant to section 793 of the Companies Act 
2006 (notice by company requiring information about interests in its 
shares) the Company can suspend (until one week after the default 
ceases) the right to attend and speak and vote at a general meeting 
and if the shares represent at least 0.25% of their class the Company 
can withhold any dividend or other money payable in respect of the 
shares and refuse to accept certain transfers of the relevant shares.  
In addition following certain action by a gambling industry regulator  
(as more specifically set out in the Company’s articles of association) 
the Company may suspend all or some of the rights attaching to all or 
some of the shares held by any relevant shareholder to attend and to 
speak at meetings and to vote, to receive any dividend or other money 
payable in respect of the shares, and to the issue of further shares or 
other securities in respect of the shares.
The Trustee of the Ladbrokes Share Ownership Trust, which is used in 
connection with certain of the Company’s employee share ownership 
plans, held 232,500 ordinary shares in the Company at 31 December 
2009 which are not voted by plan members and which it can vote in its 
absolute discretion.
A member may choose whether his or her shares are evidenced by 
share certificates (certificated shares) or held in electronic 
(uncertificated) form in CREST (the UK electronic settlement system). 
Any member may transfer all or any of his or her shares subject in the 
case of certificated shares to the rules set out in the Company’s articles 
of association or in the case of uncertificated shares the regulations 
governing the operation of CREST (which allow the directors to refuse 
to register a transfer as therein set out); the transferor remains the 
holder of the shares until the name of the transferee is entered in the 
register of members. The directors may refuse to register a transfer of 
certificated shares in favour of more than four persons jointly or where 
there is no adequate evidence of ownership or the transfer is not duly 
stamped (if so required). The directors may also refuse to register a 
share transfer if it is in respect of a certificated share which is not fully 
paid up or on which the Company has a lien provided that, where the 
share transfer is in respect of any share admitted to the Official List 
maintained by the UK Listing Authority, any such discretion may not be 
exercised so as to prevent dealings taking place on an open and 
proper basis, or if in the opinion of the directors (and with the 
concurrence of the UK Listing Authority) exceptional circumstances so 
warrant provided that the exercise of such power will not disturb the 
market in those shares. Whilst there are no squeeze-out and sell out 
rules relating to the shares in the Company’s articles of association, 
shareholders are subject to the compulsory acquisition provisions in 
sections 974 to 991 of the Companies Act 2006 and can be required 
by the Company to transfer their shares following certain action by a 
gambling industry regulator (as more specifically set out in the 
Company’s articles of association).

Significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate  
upon a change of control following a takeover bid 
The agreements between Ladbrokes Group Finance plc, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of the Company, and 14 separate banks for the 
provision by the banks of revolving credit facilities of up to £825 million 
on a committed basis provide that the banks may give notice of 
cancellation if a change of control occurs. On cancellation the amounts 
drawn would be immediately repayable. In the context of a takeover 
bid, the acquirer would normally arrange substitute facilities.
The agreement between Ladbrokes International Limited (“LI”), a wholly 
owned subsidiary of the Company, and Prima Poker Limited (“PP”), 
pursuant to which PP granted to the operator a non-exclusive licence 
to use an interactive gaming system and provides various poker related 
services to the Company, provides that PP may give notice of 
termination if a change of control occurs. On termination LI must  
pay a turnover related fee on a notional maximum 24 months use  
of the licence. An equivalent provision (for a similar poker service) is 
included in the agreement between Ladbrokes Betting & Gaming Italia 
S.r.l., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Prima Networks 
Limited, save that the turnover related fee is based on a notional 
maximum of 18 months use of the licence.
The agreement between LI and Microgaming Systems Anstalt (“MGS”), 
pursuant to which MGS granted to the operator a non-exclusive licence 
to use an interactive casino system and provides various casino related 
services to the Company, provides that MGS may give notice of 
termination if a change of control occurs. The agreement includes two 
separate provisions. The first provision entitles MGS to terminate the 
agreement if the party acquiring control operates or has an interest in a 
competing or similar network software provider. The second provision 
entitles MGS to terminate the agreement if LI or any affiliate of LI is 
acquired by a competitor of MGS, and LI must pay a turnover related 
fee on a notional maximum 24 months use of the licence.
Amendment of the Company’s articles of association
The Company’s articles of association may be amended by the 
members of the Company by special resolution (requiring a majority  
of at least 75% of the persons voting on the relevant resolution).

Branch registration
The Company is registered as a foreign company in Australia. 
Corporate responsibility
A report on Corporate Responsibility (CR) is on the Company’s website 
(www.ladbrokesplc.com) and highlights, which the following should be 
considered in conjunction with, are given on pages 32 to 35.
The processes described in the section ‘Internal control’ on page 40 
applied to CR, as did the practices described on page 38 for ensuring  
the Board is supplied with appropriate and timely information and for 
assisting the directors to update their knowledge. In addition to 
business presentations regularly made to the Board at which CR was 
considered as appropriate, the Board conducts an annual CR review 
and Board members regularly receive CR updates. CR performance  
is included in divisional accountability systems and remuneration 
arrangements. The remuneration committee in determining executive 
remuneration takes into account CR matters as described in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 45.
The risks and opportunities relating to CR in 2009 primarily revolved 
around the reputation of the Group and the quality of its brands.
Of particular importance was the promotion of responsible gambling 
and the protection of children and the vulnerable. CR also impacted  
(i) the performance of the Group’s employees on whom the Group relies 
for the provision of high quality services to customers and (ii) the health 
and safety of these employees and the customers they serve.
Performance indicators continued to be developed in accordance with 
Group-wide CR. No breaches of CR policies and procedures material 
to the Group were identified by the Board in 2009.
The identification and management of CR issues, the CR reporting 
framework and accuracy of any associated data has been reviewed by 
the Company’s CR adviser, Acona Group AS.

Governance Employee policies
The Board values two-way communication between senior 
management and employees on all matters affecting the welfare  
of the business. As well as regular management roadshows and  
visits to operating units, conferences and meetings, communication  
is via the intranet and other multimedia formats.
Throughout the Group via the Staff Council, opinion surveys and 
feedback programmes, employees are encouraged to be involved in 
the running of the business. The Company’s Annual Report is made 
available to staff and, together with regular staff magazines, provides 
employees with a greater awareness of the Group’s performance as 
well as the financial and economic factors that affect it.
In addition, those employees who are eligible are also encouraged  
to become involved in the Group’s performance through participation  
in share schemes.
During 2009, the Company offered free shares for a value of up  
to £250 to employees as they completed one year’s service with  
the Group.
Throughout the Group, the principles of equal opportunities are 
recognised in the formulation and development of employment policies.
It is the Company’s policy to give full and fair consideration to 
applications from people with disabilities, having regard to their 
particular aptitudes and abilities. If an employee becomes disabled, the 
Company’s objective is the continued provision of suitable employment, 
either in the same or an alternative position, with appropriate adjustments 
being made if necessary. Employees with disabilities share equally in 
the opportunities for training, career development and promotion.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
The Company continues to maintain Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance. In accordance with the Company’s articles of association, 
the Company has entered into a deed of indemnity to the extent 
permitted by law with each of the directors.
Charitable donations
During 2009, in addition to donations made to overseas charities, 
Group companies donated £827,600 to UK charitable organisations.
Supplier payment policy
The Company agrees payment terms for its business transactions 
when goods and services are ordered. It ensures that suppliers are 
aware of the terms of payment and the relevant terms are included in 
contracts where appropriate. Subject to satisfactory performance by 
the supplier, arrangements are adhered to when making payments.  
At the year end, the Company had no trade creditors.
Going concern
In assessing the going concern basis, the directors considered: the 
Group’s business activities and the financial position of the Group as 
described in pages 4 to 35; and the Group’s financial risk management 
objectives and policies as included in note 25 to the consolidated 
financial statements on pages 87 to 89.
The directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that it  
is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
its financial statements.

d irectors’  
remunera tion report Introduction
The Board entrusts the Remuneration Committee with the  
responsibility for the policy in respect of the executive directors  
and senior executives.
In respect of other employees, the executive directors have been 
delegated responsibility to operate within the remuneration strategy  
and policies framework established by the Board.
Remuneration Committee composition
The Remuneration Committee comprises independent non-executive 
directors and the non-executive Chairman of the Board, namely:
Appointment Committee
 date Role
Mr C J Rodrigues 29 0ctober 2003 Chairman
Mr H E Staunton 18 May 2007 Member
Mr J F Jarvis 19 July 2006 Member
Sir Ian Robinson 19 July 2006 Member
(resigned from the
Committee 15 May 2009)
Mr P Erskine 18 February 2009 Member
Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board at the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee, which consults  
with the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee normally invites the Chief Executive, the HR director 
and the Reward and HR Services director to attend committee 
meetings concerning proposals relating to the remuneration  
of the executive directors, other than when their personal  
remuneration is discussed. The Company Secretary acts  
as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met four times in 2009. There was full attendance  
in the year. The Committee retained independent remuneration 
consultants (Deloitte LLP) and has taken advice during the year  
from them in relation to executive remuneration matters. Deloitte LLP 
also provides the Company with outsourced internal audit and 
miscellaneous tax services. SJ Berwin LLP , one of the Company’s 
corporate lawyers, has also provided material assistance. 
In forming the remuneration policy, the best practice provisions set out 
in The 2006 Combined Code have been followed and the Guidelines 
issued by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National 
Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) have been noted.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy, strategy and structure remained unchanged in 
2009 and no changes are currently proposed in respect of 2010. 
The Committee believes the policy remains appropriate and relevant to 
support the Company’s commercial objectives and it continues to be 
aligned with the interest of shareholders. Any minor amendments to 
remuneration arrangements have been made to react to market 
practices and pressures and these have been detailed in the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the relevant year.
Key policy elements are to:
  ensure Ladbrokes’ remuneration strategy is appropriate for a betting 
and gaming business;
  provide a remuneration framework that enables the Company to 
retain and motivate key individuals in order to drive the business 
forward; and
  ensure the remuneration arrangements remain strongly aligned with 
shareholder value creation.
Those elements are underpinned by the key principles of the 
remuneration strategy for executive directors, which should:
 support the business strategy;
 be aligned with the creation of shareholder value;
 be clear and simple;
 reward good performance;
 accord with best practice; and
 encourage and require employee share ownership. 
The Committee has discretion to consider corporate performance on 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues when setting the 
remuneration of executive directors. The Committee considered that 
ESG risks are not being raised by the incentive structure for senior 
management inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Remuneration mix
All elements of the remuneration package are regularly reviewed to 
ensure that the total provision links individual and business 
performance and aligns executives’ to shareholders’ interests. 
The mixture of fixed and variable remuneration remains unchanged  
at both target and maximum performance. This is broken down  
as follows:
  at target performance – 40% is fixed and 60% is variable 
remuneration; and
  at maximum performance – 20% is fixed and 80% 
is variable remuneration. 
The Company offers benefits including pension, company cars and  
a fuel allowance, private healthcare and life assurance. Incentives and 
benefits are non-pensionable.

Governance Base salary
The Company policy is to set base salaries at a competitive level. The 
Committee annually reviews the base salaries of the senior executive 
group, including executive directors, taking into account business and 
personal performance. Data is also normally provided by independent 
remuneration consultants with regard to market practice of companies 
of similar size and complexity.
In 2009, the annual salaries of the executive directors were not 
increased as part of the annual pay review. In the case of Mr R J Ames, 
his annual salary was increased as a direct result of his appointment to 
the Board on 1 January 2009; his annual salary will be further reviewed 
during 2010.
The Committee resolved that in 2010, the annual salaries of the 
executive directors would not increase as part of the annual pay review.
Annual bonus
Executive directors participate in the senior executive annual bonus 
plan and Deferred Bonus Plan. These are focused upon the profit plan 
as agreed by the Board and the achievement of key personal objectives. 
Stretching profit targets were set by the Board under the annual bonus 
plan at the start of the 2009 financial year. As the core business did not 
achieve the targets set under the plan, no bonus payments have been 
made to executive directors in respect of 2009 performance.
Bonus arrangements in 2009 and 2010
The annual and Deferred Bonus plans are structured as follows:
  the maximum bonus opportunity is 150% for executive directors 
and 170% for the Chief Executive;
  approximately 75% of the total bonus opportunity is based on 
financial performance, assessed by reference to profit, and the 
remaining 25% on personal performance objectives;
  personal performance objectives are agreed and approved by the 
Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year;
  the minimum threshold (below which no payments are made) is 95% 
of the profit plan;
  maximum awards will be delivered for achieving 105% of the 
profit plan;
  the minimum threshold must be achieved for the core business before 
25% of gains or losses from High Rollers can be counted towards the 
achievement of targets and the determination of the  
overall bonus awards;
  one third of any annual bonus earned will be delivered in shares 
allocated conditionally upon continued employment (subject to certain 
exceptions) until the third anniversary of the award; shares awarded 
under the plan will be purchased in the market.
Longer term incentives 
The Committee keeps the Company’s long-term incentive plans under 
regular review to ensure they remain appropriate in fulfilling their 
objectives and that the performance conditions continue to represent 
the best way to drive the creation of shareholder value. 
The Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) remains the sole long-term 
incentive for executive directors.
Below Board level the Company continues to utilise share option plans, 
where appropriate, within a flexible incentive and retention framework.
Performance Share Plan (PSP) –  
the arrangements for 2009 and 2010
The awards under the PSP are focused on a select group of 
participants (11 individuals in 2009), including the executive directors 
and a number of key senior executives, as determined by the 
Committee from time to time. 
The PSP is structured as follows:
  annual awards are normally made up to a maximum of 175% of base 
salary for executive directors; awards were made at this level in 2009;
  awards of up to 250% of base salary may be made in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. recruitment or retention) at the Committee’s discretion;
  at the end of the performance period, participants will normally be 
entitled to receive the value of the reinvested dividends that would be 
accrued on the number of shares that ultimately vest;
  vesting of awards is subject to the achievement of performance 
targets over a three-year performance period; awards lapse on  
a participant ceasing to be employed, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise;
  50% of the award will be based on the Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) performance of the Company relative to a select comparator 
group of industry peers;
  the proposed comparator group in 2010 is: 888 Holdings; bwin; Boyd 
Gaming; Enterprise Inns; Lottomatica; Mitchells and Butlers; OPAP; 
Paddy Power; PartyGaming; Punch Taverns; Rank Group; Sportingbet; 
Whitbread and William Hill; this remains unchanged from 2009;
  50% of the award will be subject to the achievement of an absolute 
EPS growth target;
  using TSR and EPS performance conditions is consistent with market 
practice and despite continued difficult trading conditions no variation 
to the performance targets is proposed.

Share option schemes
Executive directors no longer participate in share option schemes. 
However, the schemes remain in place for eligible employees below 
executive director level and remain unchanged from 2009. The plans 
are as follows:
  a UK scheme approved by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC ) 
(‘1978 scheme’); and 
 an international scheme (‘international scheme’)
The options are subject to an EPS performance condition under which 
EPS growth in a three year period must exceed the increase in RPI by 
the following tiered targets:
EPS growth % 
Performance level           vesting levels
RPI + 9%                                                            2/3rds
RPI + 12%                                                       5/6ths
RPI + 15%                                       full vesting
Awards prior to 2008 included gains and losses from High Rollers  
in the performance of EPS growth. 
Other share schemes
The Company operates a Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’), which is used 
from time to time as an attraction and retention vehicle for key 
management positions. However, executive directors are not eligible to 
participate in this plan.
All-employee incentive arrangements
There are two share plans currently in operation in which all UK 
employees, subject to minimum service requirements, are eligible  
to participate.
The share plans are operated to strengthen and widen employee share 
ownership. These are summarised below.
Savings related Share Option Scheme
The Company offers a Savings related Share Option Scheme, which is 
approved by HMRC (‘the 1983 scheme’), and is linked to a Save-As-
You-Earn contract under which participants save a regular monthly sum 
by deduction from earnings up to £250 per month for either three or 
five years. Subject to common service criteria, the 1983 scheme is 
open to all UK employees (including executive directors).
Options are normally exercisable during a period of six months 
following the expiry of three and five years (as previously selected by 
the participant) from the dates of grant and there are no performance 
conditions. Option prices are calculated by reference to the average 
mid-market quotation of shares as shown by the Stock Exchange Daily 
Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the date of 
grant, discounted by up to 20% per share.
Share Incentive Plan
The Company offers a Share Incentive Plan, approved by HMRC. The 
plan is open to all UK employees (including executive directors) who 
have completed at least 12 months’ service. To encourage employee 
participation, the Company provides a match of one bonus share for 
every two salary shares purchased by employees. The bonus shares 
are held conditionally upon satisfaction of a one-year service 
requirement. The maximum monthly contribution by employees has 
been set at £75 per month.
Rights issue
Adjustments to share options/awards
To take account of the effects of the rights issue completed in October 
2009, adjustments were made at that time to awards and options held 
under the Company’s employee share schemes.
For the PSP , RSP and Deferred Bonus Plan, the number of shares 
under award was appropriately adjusted. In the case of the share 
option plans (1978 scheme, international scheme and 1983 scheme), 
both the number of options under award and the exercise price  
were adjusted.
Under the Share Incentive Plan, all participants received the right to buy 
one new share for every two shares already held in the plan. All of the 
executive directors took up their rights under the rights issue, and as a 
result, new shares were allotted to each individual. Ladbrokes shares 
previously held under the Share Incentive Plan will continue to be held 
in the plan on the same terms.
The treatment outlined above was in accordance with the relevant 
scheme rules. Adjustments in respect of the 1978 scheme and the 
1983 scheme were approved by HMRC.
Review of performance conditions under PSP and other share 
option schemes
In January 2010, the performance conditions under the PSP and  
the other share option schemes were reviewed by the Committee  
and appropriate adjustments were made to reflect the dilutive effect  
of the rights issue.
In relation to awards with an EPS performance condition under  
the PSP and the other share option schemes (1978 scheme and 
international scheme), the relevant EPS target has been appropriately 
adjusted in accordance with IAS 33 for awards outstanding at the time 
of the rights issue.
For the TSR performance condition under the PSP , historic share  
prices prior to the rights issue were reduced by a factor of 1.17454, 
determined by dividing the closing share price on the last trading  
day before the rights issue (£1.7140) by the theoretical ex-rights  
price (£1.4593).
Performance graph
As the Company is a constituent company of the FTSE250, the 
FTSE250 index provides an appropriate indication of market 
movements against which to benchmark the Company’s performance. 
The chart below summarises the Company’s TSR performance against 
the FTSE250 index over the five-year period ended 31 December 2009.

Retirement benefits
Following the A-Day pensions review, the pre-A-Day Revenue limits 
regime has been maintained as the framework for the Ladbrokes 
Pension Plan (LPP), including an LPP-specific Earnings Cap.
Executive directors and senior executives have a choice between:
(i)  subject to the discretion of the Company, membership of the 
Executive Section of the LPP plus a cash supplement of up to 30% 
of base salary above the Earnings Cap; or 
(ii)  a cash supplement of up to 30% of base salary in lieu of 
membership of the LPP .
Further details of the retirement benefits of individual executive directors 
are set out on page 54.
Executive directors’ shareholding guidelines
Personal shareholding guidelines require executive directors to build up 
over time personal shareholdings equivalent in value to at least one 
year’s base salary. It is intended that the specified ownership level will 
be achieved through the retention of shares earned under the 
Company’s incentive plans.
Service contracts
In line with the Company’s policy, all executive directors are employed 
on conventional one-year rolling contracts as follows:
Date of Company Director
Name Contract notice period notice period
R J Ames  1 January 2009 1 year 6 months
C Bell 20 December 2006 1 year 6 months
J P O’Reilly 1 January 2007 1 year 6 months
A S Ross* 1 January 2007 1 year 6 months
B G Wallace 5 March 2007 1 year 6 months
New appointments to the Board will also normally be made on a 
one-year rolling contract.
*Mr A S Ross did not seek re-election at the 15 May 2009 Annual 
General Meeting, but retained his executive director’s terms and 
conditions until 20 July 2009. Thereafter he has been employed as a 
consultant working three days a week for the Company. His daily rate 
of £1,061 remains unchanged in 2010 as do his benefits of a mobile 
phone, company car, private fuel and private medical cover. This 
arrangement will conclude on 19 July 2010.
Payments to outgoing executives
The Company normally expects executive directors, in case of a breach 
of contract, to mitigate their loss. In any specific case that may arise, 
the Committee will carefully consider any compensatory payments 
having regard to performance, age, service, health and other 
circumstances that are relevant.
The Company announced on 12 January 2010 that Mr C Bell is to step 
down as a director of the Company. In order to ensure continuity whilst 
a successor is found, he will continue in his role as Chief Executive.
In accordance with his contract, Mr C Bell will receive salary, pension 
contributions and benefits for the duration of his 12 month notice 
period. His notice period commenced on 1 February 2010. Payments 
will be made on a phased basis, subject to mitigation. He will only be 
eligible for a pro-rata bonus in respect of the period worked in 2010, 
subject to performance.
In addition, the Company can call upon Mr C Bell’s services on a 
limited consultancy basis following his departure. The extent, if any, to 
which the Company takes up this arrangement will be disclosed in the 
relevant Annual Report and Accounts.
All outstanding awards under the PSP will lapse upon cessation of 
employment. All share awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan will vest 
in accordance with the scheme rules.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are retained on the terms set out in their letters 
of appointment. They do not have service contracts with either the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries. The appointment of a non-
executive director is terminable without notice.
The standard letter of appointment for non-executive directors is 
available for inspection upon request.
The Committee determines the fees of the Chairman of the Board  
and the Board as a whole determines the remuneration of each of the 
non-executive directors. Non-executive directors receive fees that are 
set relative to median market practice and are regularly reviewed.  
There was no increase in the remuneration of the Chairman or other 
non-executive directors as at 1 January 2010.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for annual bonus, share 
incentives, pension or other benefits.
The annual fees are payable as follows:
Role Fee
Chairman £250,000
Deputy Chairman £60,000
Board member £43,000
Audit Committee Chairman £10,000
Remuneration Committee Chairman £10,000

 Annual basic salaries on 1 January 2009 were: Mr C Bell £650,000; Mr J P O’Reilly £500,000; Mr A S Ross £275,850, Mr B G Wallace £494,400 
and Mr R J Ames £275,000.
The Board unanimously agreed that basic salaries would not be increased in respect of the annual salary review as at 1 January 2010.
The following executive directors serve elsewhere as non-executive directors and retained fees in 2009 as follows: Mr C Bell £64,720;  
Mr J P O’Reilly £42,500; Mr A S Ross £9,135; and Mr B G Wallace £5,917 . 
(ii) 
The annual bonus plan is focused on the annual profit plans as agreed by the Board and the achievement of key personal objectives. For 2009, 
the core business did not achieve the targets set under the plan. Therefore no bonus payments have been made to executive directors in respect 
of 2009 performance and no deferred shares were awarded.
(iii)
 In respect of the awards made on 21 May 2007 under the PSP , awards lapsed in their entirety. The Company did not achieve median TSR against 
the selected comparator group and consequently this portion of the award will not vest. In respect of the EPS growth, the plan did not achieve the 
minimum performance targets and consequently no part of this portion of the award will vest.
(iv)
Mr A S Ross was an executive director until 15 May 2009; all information in the table is up to and including that date. 
(v) 
Sir Ian Robinson was Chairman until 15 May 2009.
(vi) 
The increase in the total fees to non-executive directors between 2008 and 2009 related to the transition between Sir Ian Robinson and Mr P Erskine 
and the introduction of two new non-executive directors.

*Number of options and exercise prices have been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of the rights issue, details on page 47.
1. All options granted in 2006 or earlier have either met the applicable performance conditions or have lapsed in accordance with the plan rules.
2.  For options granted in 2004 and in previous years, if the performance conditions were not met over the first three years, shareholders approved  
limited retesting, measured from the original base and for a maximum of a further two years, subject to more demanding performance 
conditions. If these performance conditions were not met over the first five years, the grant lapsed.
3.  The Company decided to withdraw retesting provisions from all options granted in 2005 and onwards to bring performance conditions in line 
with best practice.
4.  The mid-market price of the Company’s shares on 31 December 2009 was 137.50 pence (31 December 2008: 185.00 pence). The highest 
price of the shares during the financial year was 244.50 pence (2008: 338.50 pence). The lowest price of the Company’s shares during the 
financial year was 119.60 pence (2008: 139.00 pence).

Retirement provision
Messrs C Bell, J P O’Reilly and R J Ames are members of the Executive Section of the LPP , details of which are set out in note 31, page 96 of the 
Annual Report 2009. In respect of base salary above the LPP-specific Earnings Cap, Mr C Bell, Mr J P O’Reilly and Mr R J Ames receive a 30% 
cash supplement.
Mr A S Ross was no longer accruing pension benefits or receiving any pension-related cash supplement during the period from 1 January 2009 to 
31 August 2009 as he had passed his nominal pension retirement date. He is a member of the Executive Section of the LPP and started receiving 
his pension from the LPP on 1 September 2009. His LPP benefits were increased between his 60th birthday and the date he started to receive 
the benefits to reflect the delay in payment. The increase used late retirement factors which apply to all members of the LPP , and were set by the 
Trustees of the Plan (not Ladbrokes) to be broadly financially neutral. For the period from 1 January 2009 to his retirement, the increase added 
£2,000 above inflation to Mr Ross’ pension. He also received a retirement lump sum of £392,000 in 2006.
Mr B G Wallace is not a member of the LPP and has received a cash supplement of 30% of base salary in lieu of membership of the LPP since he 
re-joined the Group on 5 March 2007. The pension benefits he accrued during his previous employment with the Group were transferred to 
non-Group pension arrangements in 2006 and so are not included in these disclosures. 
The transfer value figures below have been provided by the independent actuarial advisers appointed by the Trustees of the LPP , in accordance 
with the LPP’s agreed transfer value policy. The accrued pension benefit is an annual figure. The transfer value represents the amount that would 
be paid to another pension scheme if this accrued pension benefit were to be transferred away from the LPP (although Mr Ross is no longer able 
to make such a transfer as he is in receipt of a pension from the LPP). A transfer value represents a liability of the LPP but not a sum paid or due 
to the individual. 
Listing rules and Schedule 7A disclosures
Set out below are details of the pension benefits, payable on retirement at age 60 (age 65 in the case of Mr R J Ames), or in payment in the case 
of Mr A S Ross, to which each of the directors shown is entitled at 31 December 2009. Mr A S Ross received a retirement lump sum of £392,000 
in 2006; the figures shown below relate to his residual pension after adjustment for this lump sum. The other figures shown below, including 
the accrued pensions, are the total pension entitlements in respect of all Pensionable Service with the Company including any service with the 
Company prior to becoming a director. 
For executive directors other than Mr A S Ross, the transfer value increase over the year includes the effect of each executive director’s increase in 
pensionable salary, completing a further year of service and being a year closer to their nominal pension retirement date. For Mr A S Ross, the 
transfer value increase over the year includes the effect of moving from the transfer value assumptions for non-pensioner members to those for 
pensioners. For all executive directors, the change in transfer value over the year also reflects changes in market conditions.

1	 Corporate	 information
Ladbrokes plc (the Company) is a limited company incorporated and 
domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded. 
The address of its registered office and principal place of business is 
disclosed in the corporate information section of the Annual Report on 
page 128.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together, ‘the Group’) for the year ended 31 December 
2009 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
directors on 18 February 2010. 
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 6, page 69.
2	 Basis	 of	 preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted for use in the European Union. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling.  
All values are in millions (£m) rounded to one decimal place except 
where otherwise indicated.
To assist in understanding its underlying performance, the Group  
has defined the following items of income and expense as non-trading 
in nature:
  profits or losses on disposal or impairment of non-current assets 
or businesses;
 unrealised gains and losses on derivative financial instruments; 
 business restructuring costs;
 litigation and transaction costs; and
 derecognition of deferred consideration on acquisitions.
The non-trading items have been included within the appropriate 
classifications in the consolidated income statement.
The Group has restated its comparative consolidated income 
statement for the year ended 31 December 2008 to reflect Italy  
Retail as a discontinued operation and to reflect the bonus element  
of the rights issue announced on 8 October 2009. Refer to note 37, 
page 105, for further details.
3	 Changes	 in	 accounting	 policies	
The Group has adopted the following new standards and interpretations 
for the year ended 31 December 2009:
IFRS	 8	 –	 Operating	 segments
This standard requires disclosure of information about the Group’ s operating 
segments and replaces the requirement to determine primary (business) 
and secondary (geographical) reporting segments of the Group. The 
adoption of the standard did not have any effect on the financial position 
or performance of the Group. The Group determined that the reportable 
segments were the same as the business segments previously identified 
under IAS 14 Segment Reporting, apart from showing Core Telephone 
Betting and High Rollers as separate reportable segments. The Group 
has also adopted the amendments to IFRS 8, which were included in  
the 2009 Improvements to IFRSs. Additional disclosures about each 
of these segments are shown in note 6, page 69, including restated 
comparative information.
IAS	 1	 (Revised)	 –	 Presentation	 of	 financial	 statements
The revised standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity. 
The statement of changes in equity includes only details of transactions 
with owners, with non-owner changes in equity presented as a single 
line. In addition, the standard introduces the statement of comprehensive 
income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked 
statements. The Group has elected to present two statements. 
The International Accounting Standards Board’s Annual Improvements 
Project was published in May 2008, with the majority of changes being 
applicable from 1 January 2009. The project made minor amendments 
to a number of standards, primarily with a view to removing 
inconsistencies and clarifying wording. The amendments to these 
standards did not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial 
position or performance of the Group. 
4	 Summary	 of	 significant	 accounting	 policies
Basis	 of	 consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements 
of the Company and its subsidiaries at 31 December each year.  
The underlying financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for 
the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting 
policies. Control is achieved where the Company has the power  
to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity  
so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Subsidiaries are consolidated, using the purchase method of accounting, 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease  
to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred from 
the Group. 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities  
of a subsidiary are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition.  
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the 
separately identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements  
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with  
those used by the Group.
Use	 of	 assumptions,	 estimates	 and	 judgements
The preparation of financial information requires the use of assumptions, 
estimates and judgements about future conditions. Use of available 
information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation 
of estimates. Actual results in the future may differ from those reported. 
In this regard, management believes that the accounting policies 
where judgement is necessarily applied are those that relate to: the 
measurement and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets; 
the measurement of pension and other post employment benefit 
obligations; the determination of the initial fair value of betting and 
gaming transactions; the recoverable amount of trade receivables; and 
the valuation of financial guarantee contracts.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, 
or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
Further information about key assumptions concerning the future and 
other key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below.
Indefinite life intangible assets
The Group determines whether indefinite life intangible assets are 
impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of 
the ‘value in use’ of the cash generating units to which the intangible 
assets are allocated. Estimating a value in use amount requires 
management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows 
from the cash generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Further 
details are given in notes 15 and 16, pages 80 and 81 respectively.

4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Pension and other post employment benefit obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post employment 
benefits is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation 
involves making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates
of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future 
pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such 
estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Further details are given 
in note 31, page 96.
Betting and gaming transactions
Betting and gaming transactions are measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable from customers. This is normally 
the nominal amount of the consideration but on certain occasions, the 
fair value is estimated using valuation techniques, taking into account 
the credit profile of customers in determining the collectability of the 
consideration. In addition, where there are indicators that any trade 
receivable is impaired at the balance sheet date, management makes 
an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Further details are given 
in note 20, page 84.
Income tax
The Group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions. Significant 
judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes  
due to uncertainty of the amount of income tax that may be payable.
Further details are given in note 11, page 75.
Financial guarantee contracts
The valuation of financial guarantee contracts and related indemnities 
requires use of assumptions of the risks of default of the guaranteed 
entities and the credit profiles of the counterparties. Further details are 
given in note 26, page 90.
Investments in joint ventures 
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a 
long-term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one  
or more other venturers under a contractual agreement. 
The Group’s share of results of joint ventures is included in the  
Group consolidated income statement using the equity method  
of accounting. Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Group 
consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of net assets of the entity less any impairment 
in value. The carrying value of investments in joint ventures includes 
acquired goodwill.
If the Group’s share of losses in the joint venture equals or exceeds its 
investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise further 
losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made payments 
on behalf of the joint venture. 
Investments in associates
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term 
interest and is able to exercise significant influence over the financial 
and operational policies but does not have control or joint control over 
those policies. 
The Group’s share of results of associates is included in the Group 
consolidated income statement using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in associates are carried in the Group consolidated 
balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s 
share of net assets of the entity less any impairment in value. The 
carrying value of investments in associates includes acquired goodwill.
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess 
of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest 
in the net fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of 
acquisition. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, 
goodwill is not amortised but reviewed annually for impairment and 
as such, is stated at cost less any provision for impairment of value. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed. On acquisition, any 
goodwill acquired is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose 
of impairment testing. Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating 
unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the 
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the 
carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal of the operation. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and those 
acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately 
from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial 
recognition. The costs relating to internally generated intangible assets, 
principally software costs, are capitalised if the criteria for recognition 
as assets are met. Other expenditure is charged against profit in the 
year in which the expenditure is incurred. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives of these 
intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.  
Where amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives, this 
expense is taken to the consolidated income statement through the 
‘depreciation and amounts written off non-current assets’ line item. 
Useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment 
annually, either individually, or at the cash generating unit level. 
A summary of the policies applied to the Group’s intangible assets  
is as follows:

or loss arising (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) included in the 
consolidated income statement in the year of disposal.

4	 Summary	 of	 significant	 accounting	 policies	 continued
Property,	 plant	 and	 equipment
Land is stated at cost less any impairment in value. Buildings, plant  
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line 
basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Buildings – 50 years or estimated useful life of the building, or lease, 
whichever is less, to estimated residual value. 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – four to 10 years as considered 
appropriate to write down cost to estimated residual value.
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
values may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where 
the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the 
assets or cash generating units are written down to their recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount of plant and equipment is the 
greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash 
inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised  
in the consolidated income statement in the ‘depreciation and amounts 
written off non-current assets’ line item.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal, with any gain or loss arising (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
item) included in the consolidated income statement in the year  
of disposal. 
Leases
Leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and 
benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised  
at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or,  
if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction 
of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly 
against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the benefits and risks of 
ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease 
payments, other than contingent rentals, are recognised as an expense 
in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the 
lease term.
Recoverable	 amount	 of	 non-current	 assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication 
that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of impairment 
exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the recoverable amount. 
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use 
and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not 
generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other 
assets or groups of assets.
Non-current	 assets	 held	 for	 sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale  
are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale 
if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met 
only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management 
must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify  
for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date  
of classification. 
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash at bank and in hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of less than three months, 
net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial	 assets
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to the 
contracts that give rise to them.
The Group classifies financial assets at inception as either loans and 
receivables or as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. On 
initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at fair value net 
of transaction costs; subsequently, the fair values are measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any allowance 
for impairment. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
comprise derivative financial instruments and guarantees provided to 
the Group. Financial assets through profit or loss are measured initially 
at fair value with transaction costs taken directly to the consolidated 
income statement. Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured, 
and gains and losses from changes therein are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.
Trade receivables are generally accounted for at amortised cost. The 
Group reviews indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis and where 
such indicators exist, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount.
Financial guarantees provided to the Group are classified as financial 
assets and are measured at fair value by estimating the probability of the 
guarantees being called upon and the related cash inflows to the Group.
Financial	 liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise interest bearing loans and borrowings, 
derivative financial instruments, antepost bets and guarantees given 
to third parties. On initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured 
at fair value plus transaction costs where they are not categorised as 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss include derivative financial instruments 
and guarantees.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured 
initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken directly to the 
consolidated income statement. Subsequently, the fair values are 
remeasured and gains and losses from changes therein are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement.
All interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at 
fair value net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. After 
initial recognition, fixed rate interest bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method.

4	 Summary	 of	 significant	 accounting	 policies	 continued
Financial	 guarantee	 contracts
Ladbrokes has provided financial guarantees to third parties in respect 
of lease obligations of certain of the Group’s former subsidiaries 
within the disposed hotels division. Financial guarantee contracts 
are classified as financial liabilities and are measured at fair value by 
estimating the probability of the guarantees being called upon and the 
related cash outflows from the Group.
Derecognition	 of	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows 
from the assets has expired or when Ladbrokes has transferred its 
contractual right to receive the cash flows from the financial assets or 
has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party, and either:
  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or
  substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been retained nor 
transferred but control is not retained.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, 
cancelled or expires.
Derivative	 financial	 instruments	 and	 hedge	 accounting	
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as cross currency 
swaps, foreign exchange swaps and interest rate swaps, to hedge its 
risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently  
at fair value. The gains or losses on remeasurement are taken to 
the consolidated income statement except where the derivative is 
designated as a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge. Fair 
values of over-the-counter derivatives are obtained using valuation 
techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option  
pricing models. 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as assets where their 
fair value is positive, or as liabilities where their fair value is negative. 
Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are 
only offset if the transactions are with the same counterparty, a legal 
right of offset exists and the parties intend to settle the cash flows  
on a net basis.
The derivative financial instruments taken out as hedges were 
designated and documented as hedges on the date that the relevant 
derivative contract was committed to, as one of the following:
 a hedge of the fair value of an asset and liability (fair value hedge);
  a hedge of the income/cost of a highly probable forecasted 
transaction or commitment (cash flow hedge); or
 a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity (net investment hedge).
In relation to fair value hedges that meet the conditions for hedge 
accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument 
at fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income 
statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the 
hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item 
and recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
In relation to cash flow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge 
accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in 
equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
For all cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in 
equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the 
same year in which the hedged cash flow affects the consolidated 
income statement.
In relation to net investment hedges, the post-tax gains or losses on 
the translation at the spot exchange rate of the hedged instrument are 
recognised in equity. The portion of the post-tax gains or losses on 
the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in 
the consolidated income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting or as a result of a management decision to cease hedging. 
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until, in the case of a 
hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction occurs or, in the case of 
net investment hedging, until the Group disposes of its investment in the 
foreign entity being hedged. Where a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity 
is transferred to the consolidated income statement for the year.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are 
taken directly to the consolidated income statement for the year.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. 
Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date 
and are discounted to present value where the effect is material using  
a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding  
of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Foreign	 currency	 translation
The presentation and functional currency of Ladbrokes plc and the 
functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries is sterling (£). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in sterling at the 
foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated  
at the foreign currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
All foreign currency translation differences are taken to the consolidated 
income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency 
borrowings that provide a post-tax hedge against a net investment in a 
foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the 
net investment, at which time they are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange 
differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in  
a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date  
of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value  
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the  
date when the fair value was determined.

4	 Summary	 of	 significant	 accounting	 policies	 continued
The main functional currency of the overseas subsidiaries is the  
Euro. At the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas 
subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated 
at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. The post-tax 
exchange differences arising on the retranslation, since the date  
of transition to IFRSs, are taken directly to a separate component  
of equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative 
amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign entity  
is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Income	 tax	
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all 
temporary differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax  
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences:
  except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor the tax profit; and
  associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences and carry forward of unused tax assets and unused 
tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary differences and carry 
forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised: 
  except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the 
time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the 
tax profit; and
  in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, deferred tax assets are 
only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the deductible 
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and 
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part 
of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or 
the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised 
in equity and not in the consolidated income statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount  
of sales tax except:
  where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services 
is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales 
tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as 
part of the expense item as applicable; and
  receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales 
tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables  
in the consolidated balance sheet.
Pensions	 and	 other	 post	 employment	 benefits
The defined benefit pension fund holds assets separately from the Group. 
The pension cost relating to this fund is assessed in accordance with 
the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. 
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Any past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the 
benefits have already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight 
line basis over the average period until the benefits vest. The retirement 
benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value 
of scheme assets less the value of the defined benefit obligations as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged  
to the consolidated income statement in the period to which the 
contributions relate.
For defined benefit schemes, management makes annual estimates 
and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future changes in salaries, 
employee turnover, inflation rates and life expectancy. In making these 
estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided 
by external advisers, such as actuaries. Where actual experience differs 
to these estimates, actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly  
in equity. Refer to note 31, page 96, for details of the values of assets 
and obligations and key assumptions used.
Equity	 instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds 
received net of direct issue costs.
Treasury	 shares
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted 
from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, 
sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments.
ESOP	 trusts
Where the Group holds its own equity shares through ESOP trusts 
these shares are shown as a reduction in equity. Any consideration  
paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown  
in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and no gain 
or loss is recognised within the consolidated income statement or the 
statement of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of these shares.
Share	 buybacks	 in	 the	 close	 period
During the ‘close’ period, the period between the year end and the 
preliminary annual results announcement, the Company is prevented 
from purchasing its own shares by the UK Listing Authority’s Listing 
Rules, except under certain allowed contingent purchase agreements 
with third parties. In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation, a financial liability is recognised when the Company 
enters into such an agreement, representing the purchase price  
of the shares the Company may be required to purchase.

Dividends
Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the year 
end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been 
approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Revenue
Continuing operations 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable from customers for goods and services provided in the 
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales 
related taxes.
For licensed betting offices, on course betting, Core Telephone 
Betting, High Rollers, eGaming Sportsbook businesses and online 
casino operations (including games and other number bets), revenue 
represents gains and losses, being the amount staked and fees 
received, less total payouts, and the fair value of reward points issued 
plus fees received, from betting activity in the period. Open betting 
positions are carried at fair market value and gains and losses arising 
on these positions are recognised in revenue.
Revenue from the online Poker business reflects the net income (rake) 
earned from Poker games completed by the period end.
In the case of the greyhound stadia, revenue represents income arising 
from the operation of the greyhound stadia in the period, including 
sales of refreshments.
Discontinued operations
Italy Retail and Casino revenue represented gains and losses, being  
the amount staked less total payouts, from betting activity in the period.
Finance	 costs	 and	 income	
Finance costs and income arising on interest bearing financial 
instruments carried at amortised cost are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method. 
Finance costs include the amortisation of fees that are an integral part 
of the effective finance cost of a financial instrument, including issue 
costs, and the amortisation of any other differences between the 
amount initially recognised and the redemption price.
Net gains and losses in respect of mark-to-market adjustments  
on financial instruments carried at fair value, fair value adjustments to 
the carrying value of hedged items that form part of fair value hedges 
and foreign exchange adjustments are included in non-trading items  
in the consolidated income statement.
Net gains and losses on financial guarantees are included in discontinued 
non-trading items.
Share-based	 payment	 transactions	
Certain employees (including directors) of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of equity settled share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for 
shares or rights over shares (equity settled transactions).
The cost of equity settled transactions is measured by reference to 
the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair value is 
determined using a binomial model, further details of which are given in 
note 32, page 99. In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is 
taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked  
to the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc (market conditions).
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting date). 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at 
each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the 
opinion of the directors of the Group at that date, based on the  
best available estimate of the number of equity instruments, will 
ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not 
the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are satisfied.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional  
share dilution in the computation of earnings per share as shown  
in note 13, page 77.
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee 
share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives 
and senior employees. Shares in the Group held by the employee share 
trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet 
as a deduction from equity. Refer to consolidated statement of changes 
in equity.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 
2 Share-based Payment in respect of equity settled awards and has 
applied IFRS 2 only to equity settled awards granted after 7 November 
2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2006.
Future	 accounting	 developments
IFRS 3R Business Combinations and IAS 27R Consolidated and 
Separate Financial Statements were issued in January 2008.  
The Group is required to adopt these standards for the year ending 
31 December 2010. IFRS 3R introduces a number of changes in the 
accounting for goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period 
that an acquisition occurs, and the future reported results.  
IAS 27R requires that change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary 
is accounted for as an equity transaction. Therefore, such changes 
will have no impact on goodwill, nor will it give rise to a gain or a loss. 
Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses 
incurred by the subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary. 
The changes introduced by IFRS 3R and IAS 27R must be applied 
prospectively and will affect future acquisitions and transactions with 
minority interests.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRICs in issue but not yet effective that will 
have a significant impact for the Group.

6	 Segment	 information
Management has determined the Group’s operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors  
to make strategic decisions. 
The Group’s continuing businesses are organised and managed according to the nature of the services provided, which permits aggregation of 
the Group’s operating segments into five reportable segments. The Group’s reportable segments are:
 
UK Retail: comprises betting activities in the shop estate in Great Britain.
 
Other European Retail: comprises all activities connected with the Ireland (North and South), Belgium and Spain shop estates.
 
eGaming: comprises betting and gaming activities from online operations.
 
Core Telephone Betting: comprises activities relating to bets taken on the telephone, excluding High Rollers.
 
High Rollers: comprises activities relating to bets taken on the telephone from High Rollers.
The discontinued operations comprise Italy Retail, Casino and Hotels in 2009 and 2008. 
The Board assesses the performance of operating segments based on a measure of profit before interest and tax. This measurement basis  
excludes the effect of non-trading income and expenditure from the operating segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

In addition to salary, employees may qualify for various benefit schemes operated by the Group. Eligibility for benefits is normally determined 
primarily according to an employee’s length of service and level of responsibility. The amounts of some benefits are proportionate to individual salary.
Benefits may include paid leave for holidays, maternity and illness, as well as insured benefits. The latter can cover private healthcare for the 
employee and their immediate family, long-term disability, personal accident and death in service cover. Company cars, including fuel benefits,  
are provided predominantly to meet job requirements but also to certain executives.
The principal benefit schemes are:
(i) Pensions
 (a) Ladbrokes Group Stakeholder Pension Plan 
   New employees in the UK are offered membership of Ladbrokes Group Stakeholder Pension Plan, a defined contribution pension scheme. 
Subject to meeting certain eligibility and employment grade criteria, Ladbrokes matches employees’ contributions up to a maximum of 15% 
of base salary.
 (b)  Ladbrokes Pension Plan  
In the UK, Ladbrokes sponsors a defined benefit pension scheme, which has been closed to new entrants since 2007. A number of 
different historic benefit scales apply. For new entrants since 2002 (up until the Plan closed to new entrants), the following scale of benefits 
is provided:
  
  
Executive Section Members, who contribute 5% of Pensionable Salary, receive a pension from age 65 of one-fortieth of Pensionable 
Salary for each year of Pensionable Service; and
  
  
Ordinary members, who contribute 4.5% of Pensionable Salary, receive a pension from age 65 of one-eightieth of Pensionable Salary 
for each year of Pensionable Service.
 Senior executives subject to the Earnings Cap:
  Following the A-Day pensions review, the pre-A-Day Revenue limits regime has been maintained as the framework for the Ladbrokes Pension 
Plan (LPP), including a LPP-specific Earnings Cap. 
 Executive directors and senior executives have a choice between:
 (i)  subject to the discretion of the Company, membership of the Executive Section of the LPP plus a cash supplement of up to 30% of base 
salary above the Earnings Cap; or
 (ii) a cash supplement of up to 30% of base salary in lieu of membership of the LPP .
(ii) Share-based payments
Details of employee share schemes operated by the Group are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 45 that forms part of the 
Annual Report 2009.
Details of options granted in 2009 and outstanding at 31 December 2009 are shown in note 28, page 93.

The Group has further tax losses at 31 December 2009 of £74.2 million (2008: £82.1 million) that are available indefinitely for offset against future 
taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is 
insufficient certainty that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of temporary differences may be deducted. There are no 
significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures.

13	 Earnings	 per	 share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to shareholders of the Company of £74.4 million  
(2008: £200.7 million) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year of 751.4 million (2008 restated: 706.2 million). The weighted 
average number of shares outstanding and the dilutive impact for 2008 have been restated to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue.  
Further details of the rights issue are provided in note 28, page 93. Earnings in 2008 have been restated to reflect Italy Retail as a  
discontinued operation. 
At 31 December 2009, there were 902 million 28
1
/ 3 pence ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares (933.8 million including treasury 
shares). At 31 December 2008, there were 600.6 million 28
1
/ 3 pence ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares (632.4 million including 
treasury shares).
At 31 December 2009, 15.5 million (2008: 11.3 million) shares were deemed anti-dilutive for the purpose of calculating adjusted earnings per share.
The calculation of adjusted earnings per share before non-trading items is included as it provides a better understanding of the underlying performance 
of the Group. Non-trading items are defined in note 2, page 63 and disclosed in notes 7, 11 and 14, pages 71, 75 and 78, respectively.

Italy Retail is a cash generating unit within the Other European Retail segment and is now classified as a discontinued operation. Its recoverable amount was 
determined as its fair value less costs to sell, based on expected net sales proceeds. Following this, an impairment loss of £64.1 million has been recorded against 
goodwill (£4.5 million) and licences (£59.6 million) held within intangible assets (including £27.8 million recorded before the reclassification as a discontinued operation 
– see note 15, page 80).

for Ireland.
Goodwill	 and	 intangible	 assets	 included	 in	 continuing	 operations
Goodwill relates to the consideration exceeding the fair value of net assets of business combinations including the deferred tax liability arising  
on statutory licence acquisitions.
Licences comprises the cost of acquired betting shop licences. The acquired betting shop licences are not amortised as they are considered  
to have an indefinite life for a combination of reasons:
 
Ladbrokes is a leading operator in well-established markets;
 there is a proven, sustained demand for bookmaking services; and 
 existing law acts to restrict entry.
Ladbrokes has a very strong track record of renewing its betting permits and licences at minimal cost. 
Software relates to the cost of software acquisition and the capitalised costs in respect of internally generated software.
Customer relationships relate to contracted relationships acquired as part of a business combination.

16	 Impairment	 testing	 of	 goodwill	 and	 indefinite	 life	 intangible	 assets
The Group tests annually for impairment and at each reporting date if there are indications that goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are 
impaired, by comparing the carrying amounts of these assets with their recoverable amounts (being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use).
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a group of CGUs exceeds its carrying amount, the group and any goodwill allocated  
to that group would be regarded as not impaired. Goodwill has been allocated as follows:
2009 2008
 £m £m
Goodwill
UK Retail 35.4 35.4
Other European Retail 13.2 13.5
Italy Retail – 5.5
During 2009, following the decision to sell Italy Retail, an impairment charge of £4.5 million was recognised. Of the remaining £1.0 million, goodwill 
totalling £0.6 million was disposed of and there was a foreign exchange adjustment of £0.4 million. No additional impairments were identified.
Licences
Licences have been allocated to the individual UK and Other European Retail CGUs that are expected to benefit from the assets. Each CGU 
represents the lowest level within the Group at which the licences are monitored for internal management purposes. The carrying value of licences 
at 31 December 2009 was £507.2 million (2008: £579.0 million). 
Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These are based on budgets approved by management for 
the next five years extrapolated thereafter using a 2.5% growth rate (2008: 2.5%). This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate 
for the relevant markets.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The key assumptions taken into account by management are the amounts staked, the gross win margin and the discount rate applied. The 
estimated amounts staked and gross win margin are based upon historic experience, management’s best estimate of future trends and 
performance taking account of industry sources. The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10.5% (2008: 10.3%).
The recoverable amounts of certain individual UK and Other European Retail CGUs were below their carrying amounts at 31 December 2009 and 
accordingly an impairment loss of £3.2 million has been recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2009 
within the non-trading ‘Depreciation and amounts written off non-current assets’ line item.
The recoverable amount of individual CGUs is sensitive to changes in cash flows or discount rate. Change in the cash flow projections or the discount 
rate would trigger a further impairment loss. For example, a reduction in projected cash flows of 10% and an increase of 1% in the discount rate 
would have resulted in a further impairment loss of approximately £0.8 million. 
Customer	 relationships
Customer relationships of £40.5 million (2008: £40.5 million) have been allocated to a CGU within the eGaming operating segment.
The recoverable amount of the CGU within the eGaming segment is considerably in excess of the carrying amount of the customer  
relationships and accordingly no impairment charge was required.

25	 Financial	 risk	 management	 objectives	 and	 policies
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service for the provision of finance and the management and control of liquidity, foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates. The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Group’s treasury exposures to reduce risk in 
accordance with policies approved by the Board. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, financial guarantee contracts, cash and short-term 
deposits, together with certain derivative financial instruments. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s 
operations. The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables and accruals that arise directly from  
its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The purpose of 
these transactions is to assist in the management of the Group’s financial risk and to generate the desired effective currency and interest rate profile.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken other than 
betting and gaming transactions. The Group’s exposure to antepost betting and gaming transactions is not significant.
The Group has a £2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme that is used to increase the flexibility of funding with regards to source, 
cost, size and maturity. At 31 December 2009, following the repayment of the €464.5 million bond, one public Eurobond issue remained under 
this programme, a £250 million 7.125% bond, maturing July 2012. Several loan notes have also been issued under the programme in a variety 
of currencies. At 31 December 2009, the Group had one remaining loan note with a carrying value of £16.4 million. Funds raised via the EMTN 
programme have been used to repay bank debt.
The main financial risks for the Group are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees 
policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial 
instruments. 
Interest	 rate	 risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equivalents.
The Group’s policy for the year ended 31 December 2009 was to maintain a minimum of 25% (2008: 25%) of net debt at fixed interest rates  
to reduce its sensitivity to movements in variable short-term interest rates. At 31 December 2009, after taking account of interest rate and cross 
currency swaps, £457.3 million or 63.9% (2008: £451.3 million or 40.3%) of the Group’s gross borrowings were at fixed rates.
Interest on financial instruments at floating rates is re-priced at intervals of less than six months. Interest on financial instruments at fixed rates  
is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest	 rate	 sensitivity	
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this 
movement is applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.

Foreign	 currency	 risk
The Group carries out operations through a number of foreign enterprises and has foreign exchange exposure to the Euro, arising from foreign 
currency assets. The Group’s exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is monitored and reviewed regularly. 
Until 30 June 2009 the Group sought to mitigate the effect of its structural currency exposure arising from the translation of foreign currency 
assets through Euro drawings under its committed facilities. The Group ceased formal net investment hedging on 30 June 2009.
The total carrying value of the Group’s foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 2009 was £17.6 million (2008: £593.3 million), of which £16.4 million 
(2008: £475.0 million) was swapped into sterling.

Exchange rate sensitivity
The impact of 10% and 20% movements in the exchange rates between sterling and the Euro is shown below:

0.7 7.6 21.6 9.0
(1)
The movement is a loss where sterling strengthens and a gain where it weakens.
The impact on equity relates primarily to unhedged foreign exchange exposure arising on translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities.
These sensitivities have been calculated before adjusting for tax and have been estimated by applying the percentage movement to the carrying 
value of financial assets and liabilities denominated in Euros at the year end.
Credit risk
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable 
balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Any changes to credit terms are assessed and authorised by senior management on an individual basis. 
The Group’s High Rollers division consists of individuals who place sizeable stakes. The Group manages this activity and the associated risk 
exposure by utilising senior management expertise to manage the levels of stakes placed. Of the £13.7 million (2008: £4.5 million) trade 
receivables balance, £12.6 million (2008: £3.7 million) relates to the Group’s Core Telephone Betting and High Rollers divisions. 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial 
instruments and a loan to a joint venture, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal 
to the carrying amount of these instruments. Credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is managed by 
restricting those transactions to banks that have a defined minimum credit rating and by setting an exposure ceiling per bank. 
The Group also has exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts provided by the Group. This risk is partly mitigated by the 
indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation for any loss incurred in connection with these guarantees. For further detail of these guarantees 
refer to note 26, page 90.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range of 
maturities. The Group’s policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium-term and long-term committed borrowing facilities to meet 
the medium-term funding requirements. At 31 December 2009, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £428.1 million (2008: 
£510.4 million). Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 2.6 years (2008: 2.8 years).
The total gross contractual undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities, including interest payments, fall due as follows:

Hedging	 activities
Hedging of net investments in foreign operations
The Group ceased to designate its committed Euro borrowings as a partial hedge of the net investments in its European subsidiaries  
from 30 June 2009. 
At 31 December 2009, the Group had foreign currency borrowings of £nil (2008: £117.6 million) and foreign exchange swap contracts with a nominal 
value of £nil (2008: £(0.1) million) designated as net investment hedges in respect of the currency translation risk arising on foreign operations. 
Pre-tax losses of £10.4 million (2008: £17.8 million) (post-tax losses of £7.5 million (2008: £12.8 million)) arising on the translation of these 
borrowings have been deferred in reserves.
The Group continued to hold cross currency swaps until their maturity in July 2009. These swaps did not qualify as net investment hedges under IAS 
39 but were economic hedges of the Group’s foreign currency borrowings. The fair value of the Group’s cross currency swaps at 31 December 
2009 is £nil (2008: an asset of £109.1 million). The fair value of the Group’s foreign exchange swaps at 31 December 2009 is a liability of £0.1 
million (2008: an asset of £2.8 million).
Fair value hedges
The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to manage its fair value exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings by swapping 
borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates in accordance with the policy of the Group. Contracts with nominal values of £16.2 million (2008: 
£451.0 million) have fixed interest receipts and floating interest payments based on LIBOR. Contracts hedging the €464.5 million bond matured in 
July 2009. The fair value of the swaps at 31 December 2009 is an asset of £0.4 million (2008: asset of £4.7 million). 
Cash flow hedges
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its cash flow exposure. At 31 December 2009, the Group had contracts for interest rate swaps with 
nominal values of £199.0 million (2008: £199.0 million) maturing between January 2011 and January 2012. These contracts have floating rate 
receipts and fixed rate payables. The fair value at 31 December 2009 was a liability of £9.2 million (2008: £11.2 million) that has been deferred  
in equity in retained earnings.
There is no ineffectiveness recognised in the consolidated income statement arising from cash flow hedges.
Capital	 management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a credit rating that enables the Group to raise funds at an 
economic interest rate and to maintain healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value. The Group manages 
its capital structure (net debt and equity – see note 27 and the consolidated statement of changes in equity, pages 93 and 61, for further details) 
and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the 
dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. 
The Group monitors capital using a net debt to EBITDA ratio. The target range is less than 3.0 (2008: 3.5 to 3.75) times net debt to EBITDA ratio.  
The ratio at 31 December 2009 was 2.5 (3.3 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers) and at 31 December 2008 was 2.6 (3.3 adjusted to 
remove profit from High Rollers).

Fair	 value	 of	 financial	 instruments
Derivatives used for hedging and assets and liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value.
The fair value of cash at bank and in hand approximates to book value due to its short-term maturity. The fair value of the £250.0 million 7.125% 
bond at 31 December 2009 was £261.6 million (2008: £237.3 million). The amortised cost of interest bearing loans and borrowings, with the 
exception of the £250.0 million 7.125% bond and the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities approximates to fair value. 
The hierarchy of the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value is as follows:
2009
Level	 1 Level	 2 Level	 3 Total
	 £m £m £m £m
Assets	 measured	 at	 fair	 value
Derivatives – 0.4 – 0.4

Trade and other payables – – (4.6) (4.6)
Other current financial liabilities – – (1.7) (1.7)
Total – (8.9) (15.6) (24.5)
The Group classifies all derivatives as level 2 financial instruments, as their fair value is determined based on techniques for which all significant 
inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Financial guarantee contracts, included within other non-current financial liabilities, are classified as level 3 financial instruments, as their fair value 
is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data. Further information about financial guarantee 
contracts, including sensitivities, and a reconciliation of changes in fair value in the year, is included below.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
n otes to the Consolidated 
finan Cial statements Continued 26	 Financial	 instruments	 continued
Other current financial liabilities are deferred revenues associated with the fair value of reward points issued. Included in trade and other payables 
are £4.6 million of antepost liabilities; both are classified as level 3 financial instruments as their fair value is measured using techniques where 
the significant inputs are not based on observable market data. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in the consolidated 
income statement.
No financial instruments are classified as level 1, for which fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
During the year ended 31 December 2009 there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements.
Financial	 guarantee	 contracts
The Group has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. The Group 
received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC), at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Group may subsequently 
incur under these third party guarantees. The guarantees expire between 2010 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a combination of 
minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is £933.0 million (31 December 2008: £943.1 million),  
with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount. Included in the maximum liability exposure is £517.2 million (31 December 2008: 
£528.5 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £415.8 million (31 December 2008: £414.6 million) in relation 
to the minimum contractual based element. The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable 
agreements into which the Group has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2009 is £407.7 million (31 December 2008: £430.1 million). Included in the  
net present value of the maximum exposure is £201.0 million (31 December 2008: £219.1 million) in relation to the turnover based element  
of the hotel rentals and £206.7 million (31 December 2008: £211.0 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Group monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations. 
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the 
event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
The financial guarantee asset has been valued on a similar basis to the liability, taking account of the credit profile of the counterparty, HHC, to assess 
the likelihood of HHC continuing to be solvent at the time of any future potential claim under the indemnity.
At 31 December 2009 the Group has recognised a financial liability of £9.3 million (31 December 2008: £9.0 million) in respect of these guarantees.

The change in the year in the fair value of the financial guarantees liability has been recognised in the consolidated income statement and 
classified in discontinued operations.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate. A rate of 2.2% has been used at 31 December 2009 (2008: 2.0%). A 0.5 
percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by £1.7 million.

29	 Employee	 share	 ownership	 plans
The Ladbrokes Share Ownership Trust (‘LSOT’) is used in connection with the Company’s Deferred Bonus Plan and the Restricted Share Plan 
(‘the Plans’). The LSOT may also be used in connection with the Company’s other share-based plans, including the Ladbrokes plc International 
Share Option Scheme. The trustee of the LSOT, Computershare Trustees (CI) Limited, purchases the Company’s shares in the open market, 
as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the anticipated liabilities of the Group, with financing provided by the Company. Under the Plans, 
awards of shares are made either in the form of conditional shareholdings or nil priced options (for certain non-UK executives) once the bonuses 
for the year ended 31 December have been finalised. Awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan will vest two years (or three years in respect of 
awards made from 2008 onwards to executive directors and certain senior executives) after the award date. Awards made under the Restricted 
Share Plan will vest in their entirety after three years (employees can elect for 50% of the award to vest after two years). Shares in the LSOT have 
been conditionally gifted to employees. Shares are forfeited by employees who leave, other than for specified reasons, within the vesting period. 
All expenses of the LSOT are settled directly by the Company and charged in the financial statements as incurred. The number of ordinary shares 
held in trust for both periods presented has been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue. Further details of the rights issue are 
provided in note 28, page 93.
The Ladbrokes Share Incentive Plan (‘LSIP’) is currently used in connection with the Company’s OWN share plan (‘the OWN plan’) and Freeshare 
share plan (‘Freeshare’). The trustee of the LSIP , Computershare Trustees (CI) Limited, purchases the Company’s shares in the open market, as 
required, using: (i) deductions made from the salaries of participants in the OWN plan; (ii) dividends paid on the shares held by the LSIP and (iii) 
financing provided by the Company to make awards of Freeshares to employees with more than one year’s service. Under the OWN plan, to 
match those shares acquired using participants’ salary deductions, one additional share is issued by the Company to the LSIP for every two held 
per employee. These shares are forfeited by employees who leave, other than for specified reasons, within the one year conditional vesting period. 
At 31 December 2009, the LSIP held 1,055,597 shares, all of which are held on behalf of the OWN plan and Freeshare participants. All expenses 
of the LSIP are settled directly by the Company and charged in the financial statements as incurred.

Defined	 contribution	 schemes
The total cost charged to the consolidated income statement of £1.0 million for continuing operations (2008: £0.7 million) and £0.7 million for 
discontinued operations (2008: £nil) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme.
Defined	 benefit	 plans
The Group’s only significant defined benefit retirement plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, which is a final salary pension plan for UK employees. 
Assets are held separately from those of the Group. Although the Group is responsible for the operation of this arrangement, professional advisers 
are appointed to assist the trustees in running it.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 September 2007. 
The results of the actuarial valuation were updated to 31 December 2009 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits. The value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method, as 
required by IAS 19.

The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the long-term expected rates of return on each of the major asset 
classes invested in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes over the long term. The sources used to determine the best  
estimate of long-term returns include bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts’  
or government’s expectations. At 31 December 2009, the long-term expected rates of return on equity instruments and debt instruments 
were assumed to be 8.2% pa and 4.6% pa, respectively, for the plan. The equivalent assumptions at 31 December 2008 were 7.4% pa and  
4.1% pa respectively.
The post retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard PNA00 mortality table with medium cohort projection, which 
takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience. The assumption used implies that the expected future lifetime 
of members aged 65 in 2009 is 85.8 years for males and 87.8 years for females. For members with large pensions a longer lifetime is assumed 
(89.2 for males and 91.0 for females). The post retirement mortality assumption has been updated slightly since 2008 when expected future 
lifetimes were generally assumed to be 85.7 years for males aged 65 and 87.7 years for females, with longer lifetimes assumed for members with 
large pensions of 89.1 years for males and 90.9 years for females.

Changes to the assumptions will impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income statement  
in respect of the plan. For the significant assumptions, the following sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact for the year ended  
31 December 2009, excluding the impact on the associated deferred tax items:
2009 2008
 £m £m
– 0.5% pa decrease in the discount rate would have the following approximate effect:
   Increase in the current service cost (excluding employee element) 0.5 0.6
   Decrease in the balance sheet asset at 31 December 18.1 17.3
   This ignores the potential positive impact that a general fall in bond yields may have on the value of the bond 
assets held by the plan.
– 1.0% pa decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have the following approximate effect:
   Increase in the amount charged to staff costs 2.2 2.2

32	 Share-based	 payments
Ladbrokes plc has a performance share plan, an approved and an unapproved share option plan, a sharesave, a share incentive plan, a restricted 
share plan and an annual bonus plan. The plans and the various performance conditions are discussed in more detail below. All of the plans listed 
below are equity settled share-based payment plans.
In October 2009 the Company raised proceeds of £274.6 million, net of issue costs of approximately £11.0 million, through a rights issue as 
explained in note 28, page 93. The number of shares allocated to employees under the Group’s share schemes has been adjusted to reflect the 
bonus element of the rights issue. The terms of the Group’s employee share schemes were adjusted such that participants of the various plans 
were no better or worse off as a result of the rights issue. Consequently, no additional expense was or will be recognised as a result of changes  
to the Group’s employee share schemes. 
(i)	 Annual 	 bonus	 –	 deferral	 into	 shares
 An award under the bonus plan will vest for each annual bonus year as set out below.
 2009 and 2008 
  For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment,  
after three years. For other employees, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment,  
after two years.
 2007 
  For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after three 
years. For other employees, half of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after two years. 
 2006 
 Half of the gross annual bonus was delivered in shares that vested, subject to continued employment, after two years.

(ii)	Sharesave 	 –	 related	 share	 options	 scheme
This is a sharesave scheme with options granted at a 20% discount to market value. The scheme operates with either a three or five years’ 
saving with vesting after this time.
(iii)	 Share	 incentive	 plan	
 (a)  Under the OWN plan, employees can contribute up to £75 per month to acquire Ladbrokes plc shares. For every two shares purchased, 
the Group provides a match of one additional share. 
 (b) Under the Freeshares plan, an award of up to £250 in value is made to participating employees on reaching one year’s service.
(iv)	 Share	 options
  The options granted are all market value options with a three year vesting period. Vested options lapse if they have not been exercised within 
10 years of the date of grant. All options have an EPS growth based performance condition.
(v)	 Restricted	 share	 plan
  An award under the Restricted share plan will vest in its entirety after three years. However, employees can elect for 50% of the award to vest 
after two years. 
(vi)	 Performance	 share	 plan	 (‘PSP’)
  An award under the PSP consists of a conditional allocation of shares that will vest, subject to the achievement of performance conditions,  
at the end of the three year period. The performance conditions are set out below. 
 2007, 2008 and 2009 awards
  The 2007, 2008 and 2009 awards have two separate performance conditions; half of the award vests based on TSR and half of the award 
vests based on EPS.
 2006 awards
  The vested 2006 awards had two separate performance conditions; half of the award vested based on TSR and half of the award vested 
based on operating profit growth.
For a more detailed description of each of the above plans, refer to pages 45 to 56 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of share options. The number of share options prior to  
26 October 2009 and the corresponding weighted average exercise prices have been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue. 
Details of the rights issue are given in note 28, page 93.

137.5 pence (31 December 2008: 185.0 pence). The total value of these shares is £33.8 million (2008: £35.3 million).
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £1.73 (2008: £2.56). The weighted 
average fair value of options granted during the year was 33.0 pence (2008: 44.0 pence). The weighted average remaining contractual life for the

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous four years. The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised an expense of £3.9 million (2008: £3.2 million) relating to equity settled share-based payment transactions.

33	 Commitments	 and	 contingencies
Operating	 lease	 commitments	 –	 Group	 as	 lessee
The Group has a number of lease agreements that, pursuant to their economic substance qualify as non-cancellable operating lease agreements. 
These primarily relate to rents payable on land and buildings. The terms of the leases vary significantly but can broadly be summarised as follows:
Lease terms
Shop leases are typically 15 years with a tenant only break clause at 10 years and rent reviews every five years. Other leases are typically between 
three and 10 years.
Determination of rent payments
Rent payments are based on the amount specified in the agreement.
Terms of renewal
The agreements are not terminated automatically after expiry of the lease term and in the majority of cases, lease extension options have been 
agreed upon and in many other cases, there will be an opportunity to negotiate lease extensions with the lessor.
Restrictions
There are no restrictions imposed upon the Group, concerning dividends, additional debt or further leasing under any of the existing lease arrangements, 
although there were occasionally non-financial restrictions on leases preventing the Group from opening or operating another competing hotel for 
a specified number of years.
Subleases
The Group does sublease areas of leased properties and receives sublease payments from third parties.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under Company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of 
the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
  state whether the applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained by the financial statements;
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website and legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’	 statement	 pursuant	 to	 the	 Disclosure	 and	
Transparency	 Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in pages 
36 and 37 of this Annual Report, confirm that, to the best of each 
person’s knowledge and belief:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
  the directors’ report contained in the Annual Report includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Group web site, www.ladbrokesplc.com. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

We have audited the Group financial statements of Ladbrokes plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2009 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows  
and the related notes 1 to 37. The financial reporting framework  
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  
by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Sections 495, 496 and 497 of the Companies  
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility  
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions  
we have formed.
Respective	 responsibilities	 of	 directors	 and	 auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 109, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us  
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope	 of	 the	 audit	 of	 the	 financial	 statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Opinion	 on	 financial	 statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2009 and of its profit for the year then ended;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion	 on	 other	 matter	 prescribed	 by	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters	 on	 which	 we	 are	 required	 to	 report	 by	 exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
  the directors’ statement, set out on page 109, in relation to going 
concern; and
  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.
Other	 matter
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial 
statements of Ladbrokes plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that  
is described as having been audited.

1	 Basis	 of	 accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention except as otherwise stated. They have been drawn up to 
comply with applicable UK accounting standards. 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing  
a cash flow statement under the provisions of FRS 1 (revised).  
The required consolidated cash flow statement has been included 
within the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2008 has been restated to 
reclassify £185.3 million of amounts due to Group companies, due  
after more than one year, to investments in shares in Group companies.  
This had no effect on the Company’s net assets.
2	 Change	 in	 accounting	 policies
There have been no changes in accounting policies during the year.
3	 Summary	 of	 significant	 accounting	 policies
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision  
for impairment.
The Company assesses these investments for impairment wherever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of 
impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable 
amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the value of the 
investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the profit and loss account.
Financial	 assets
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party  
to the contracts that give rise to them.
The Company classifies financial assets at inception as either financial 
assets at fair value or loans and receivables. On initial recognition, 
loans and receivables are measured at fair value. Financial assets at fair 
value comprise guarantees provided to the Company. Financial assets 
at fair value through profit or loss are measured initially at fair value, 
with transaction costs taken directly to the profit and loss account. 
Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured and gains and losses 
from changes therein are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Financial guarantees provided to the Company are classified as 
financial assets and are measured at fair value by estimating the 
probability of the guarantees being called upon and the related cash 
inflows to the Company.
Derivative	 financial	 instruments	
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently 
at fair value. Derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and as 
such, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken 
directly to the profit and loss account for the year.
Fair values of over-the-counter derivatives are obtained using valuation 
techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option  
pricing models. 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as assets when their fair 
value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative. 
Financial	 liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise guarantees given to third parties. On 
initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at fair value plus 
transaction costs where they are not categorised as financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss are measured initially at fair value, with transaction 
costs taken directly to the profit and loss account. Subsequently, the 
fair values are remeasured and gains and losses from changes therein 
are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Financial	 guarantee	 contracts
The Company has provided financial guarantees to third parties 
in respect of lease obligations of certain of the Company’s former 
subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. 
Financial guarantee contracts are classified as financial liabilities and  
are measured at fair value by estimating the probability of the guarantees 
being called upon and the related cash outflows from the Company.
Derecognition	 of	 financial	 assets	 and	 liabilities
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows 
from the assets has expired or when the Company has transferred its 
contractual right to receive the cash flows from the financial assets or 
has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party, and either:
  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or
  substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been retained 
nor transferred but control is not retained.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, 
cancelled or expires.
Taxation
Deferred tax is recognised as an asset or liability, at appropriate rates, 
in respect of transactions and events recognised in the financial 
statements of the current and previous periods that give the entity  
a right to pay less, or an obligation to pay more, tax in future periods. 
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent it is probable that 
there will be suitable taxable profits from which they can be recovered.
No provision is made for any taxation on capital gains that would arise 
from the future disposal of any fixed assets shown in the financial 
statements at valuation, except to the extent that at the balance sheet 
date there is a binding sale agreement.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Foreign	 currency	 translation
The presentation and functional currency of the Company and the 
functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries, is sterling. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in sterling at the 
foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
foreign currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
All foreign currency translation differences are taken to the profit and 
loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency 
borrowings that provide a post-tax hedge against a net investment in a 
foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the 
net investment, at which time they are recognised in the profit and loss 
account. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences 
on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in  
a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date  
of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value  
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the

Pensions
The Company is the principal employer of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, a funded defined benefit group plan. The pension cost relating to the plan 
is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected credit unit method.
Actuarial gains or losses are taken to equity in the period in which they arise.
Any past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that benefits have already vested and otherwise, is amortised on a straight line basis 
over the average period until the benefits vest.
The defined benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of defined benefit obligations 
as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost. If necessary, the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the amount that can be recovered through 
reduced Company contributions in the future plus any refunds that have been agreed at the balance sheet date.
Equity	 instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Share-based	 payments
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair value 
is determined using a binomial model, further details of which are given in note 32 of the consolidated IFRSs financial statements. In valuing equity 
settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc 
(market conditions). 
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance 
conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting date). The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date, based on the best available estimate of the 
number of equity instruments, will ultimately vest. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which 
are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
ESOP	 trusts
Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an ESOP trust these shares are shown as a reduction in equity. Any consideration  
paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and no gain or  
loss is recognised within the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses on the purchase, sale or cancellation  
of these shares.
Treasury	 shares
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, 
sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.
4	 Profit	 and	 loss	 account	 of	 the	 parent	 Company
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the parent Company has not been separately presented  
in these financial statements. The parent Company loss for the year was £532.4 million (2008: loss of £269.6 million).

Financial	 guarantee	 contracts
The Company has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division.  
The Company received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC), at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Company 
may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees. The guarantees expire between 2010 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise  
a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is £933.0 million (31 December 2008: £943.1 million), with a 
maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount. Included in the maximum liability exposure is £517.2 million (31 December 2008: £528.5 million)  
in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £415.8 million (31 December 2008: £414.6 million) in relation to the minimum contractual 
based element. The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Company  
has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2009 is £407.7 million (31 December 2008: £430.1 million). Included in the net present 
value of the maximum exposure is £201.0 million (31 December 2008: £219.1 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and  
£206.7 million (31 December 2008: £211.0 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations. 
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event  
of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
The financial guarantee asset has been valued on a similar basis to the liability, taking account of the credit profile of the counterparty, HHC, to assess  
the likelihood of HHC continuing to be solvent at the time of any future potential claim under the indemnity.
At 31 December 2009 the Company has recognised a financial liability of £9.3 million (31 December 2008: £9.0 million) in respect of these guarantees.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate. A rate of 2.2% has been used as at 31 December 2009 (2008: 2.0%). A 0.5 
percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by £1.7 million.

15	 Pensions
The Company’s main pension plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 September 2007. 
The results of the actuarial valuation were updated to 31 December 2009 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS 17.  
The defined benefit obligations and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the plan. The table also sets out at 31 December 2009, 31 December 2008 
and 31 December 2007, the fair value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 liabilities, 
the surplus (or deficit) of assets compared to the FRS 17 liabilities, the related deferred tax liability (or asset) and the net pension asset (or liability).

Net pension asset £10.8m £15.0m £25.4m
The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the expected rates of return on each of the major asset classes invested 
in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes at the balance sheet date, using the figures shown above. The sources used to determine 
the expected rates of return include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts’  
or government’s expectations.
The contributions made by the employers in 2009, in respect of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, were £7.0 million (2008: £6.0 million).
The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 20.5% of pensionable payroll, plus an additional £133,333 per month to remove the shortfall 
in funding identified at 30 September 2007 and £62,500 per month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the plan. These lead to an 
expected contribution of £7.1 million in 2010. As the plan is closed to new entrants and, under the method used to calculate pension costs  
in accordance with FRS 17, the service cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase over time as the average age  
of the membership increases.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected 
to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under Company law the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of the Company and of the profit or loss of  
the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
  state whether the applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained by the financial statements;
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Company financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website and legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’	 statement	 pursuant	 to	 the	 Disclosure	 and	
Transparency	 Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in pages 
36 and 37 of this Annual Report, confirm that, to the best of each 
person’s knowledge and belief:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company; and
  the Directors’ Report contained in the Annual Report includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company website, www.ladbrokesplc.com. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Ladbrokes 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2009 which comprise the Balance 
Sheet and the related notes 1 to 18. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Sections 495, 496 and 497 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility  
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions  
we have formed.
Respective	 responsibilities	 of	 directors	 and	 auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities  
set out on page 123, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope	 of	 the	 audit	 of	 the	 financial	 statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion	 on	 financial	 statements
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2009;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion	 on	 other	 matters	 prescribed	 by	 the	 Companies	 Act	 2006
In our opinion:
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent Company financial statements.
Matters	 on	 which	 we	 are	 required	 to	 report	 by	 exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where  
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
  the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Other	 matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 
Ladbrokes plc for the year ended 31 December 2009.

Dividend	 information
As stated in the rights issue documentation, the directors are not 
recommending the payment of a final dividend. Therefore the total 
dividend recommended for 2009 will be the interim dividend of  
3.5 pence per share (paid on 1 December 2009). 
The Board intends to reinstate dividend payments at the Interims with  
a target dividend cover of two times.
Ladbrokes are keen to encourage all its shareholders to have their 
dividends paid directly into a Bank or Building Society Account. If you 
wish dividends to be paid directly into your bank account through 
the BACSTEL-IP (Bankers Automated Clearing Services) system, 
you should apply online at www.investorcentre.co.uk or contact our 
Registrar for a dividend mandate form.
The table below details the amounts of interim, final and total dividends 
declared in the last five years. Please note that these dividend figures 
have not been adjusted for the share consolidation in April 2006 and 
the rights issue in October 2009.

When dividends are paid to shareholders, the depositary makes the 
equivalent payment in US Dollars to ADR holders. For enquiries,

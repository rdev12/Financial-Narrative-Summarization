Building momentum
Innovation Group at a glance
We have been serving the worldwide insurance sector  
for over 20 years. Over that time we have come to believe  
that the business of insurance should be viewed and run  
as an end-to-end optimised, collaborative and integrated 
process, rather than a series of individual and unconnected 
actions. We apply this belief in all our work.
Our industry-leading business process and data services, our innovative and effective 
software products, our extensive repair networks, and our fixed price commercial models 
come together to give insurers market-leading cost efficiencies and the ability to provide 
a great customer experience.
Business process services
We offer an unrivalled and complete 
portfolio of software and services that can 
be deployed throughout a business, or on 
a service-by-service basis as required.
Our proven end-to-end solutions cover Policy 
& Fleet management; Claims, Incident & Risk 
management, as well as a full range of specialist 
services such as big data business analytics and 
fraud management.
Software
Our software business only develops software 
for the insurance market. We apply deep sector 
knowledge with an acute awareness of the 
challenges facing the industry, from changes 
in customer behaviour to the adoption of 
new technologies.
All of our software is designed to improve business 
agility, provide more flexible underwriting 
capabilities, enhance risk management and give 
customers a superior experience. 03

Structuring for growth
Chairman’s statement
In our last Annual Report, I said that our strategy 
was bearing fruit. I am pleased to report that we 
have continued to perform well and have met 
our profit expectations. We have now provided 
our shareholders with five years of revenue 
and adjusted profit growth – a record I am  
very proud of. 
In our last Annual Report, I said that our strategy 
was bearing fruit. I am pleased to report that we 
have continued to perform well and have met 
our profit expectations. We have now provided 
our shareholders with five years of revenue 
and adjusted profit growth – a record I am very 
proud of.
In addition, I am delighted to say that the  
three acquisitions we made during the year 
following our successful fund raising in March 
are integrating well, and last, but not least, we 
have reintroduced a dividend in order to share 
our success with our shareholders.
“ We have been able to produce  
increased revenue and adjusted profit  
by delivering higher value services  
and gaining market share.”
All of this has been achieved in the face of a 
market environment that has evolved differently 
to our expectations. We had thought that as the 
world’s economies emerged out of recession, 
increased economic activity would bring about 
higher claims volumes but this has not yet 
materialised to any great extent.
We have been able to generate increased 
revenue and adjusted profit by delivering more 
and higher value services and gaining market 
share based on our service levels, processes 
and technology together with the impact of  
the three acquisitions completed in the year. 
However, there have been few adverse weather 
events that lead to increased claims in the 
countries and markets which we served over the 
last year, and weather in Europe in particular was 
benign, further depressing claims volumes. We 
have also faced fiscal headwinds as currencies 
weakened against the pound. Despite all this 
our business model continues to prove itself 
in terms of both profit and cash generation. 
The Group is net cash positive which allows us 
to continue to invest in both acquisitions and 
our own research & development. By doing this 
we broaden the solutions we are able to offer  
to our customers. 05

It is important to note that the Group remains 
committed to sustainability. At the recent 
UN Climate Talks, we were a signatory to a 
declaration that committed us to report 
on climate change information on a regular 
common basis.
We continue to invest in our people and of 
special note this year was our Centurion training 
programme that gave one hundred colleagues 
intensive exposure to our improved and 
updated methodologies and frameworks. 
Already we are seeing significantly better 
delivery capability from this.
The Board has also been considering how to 
structure the leadership of the business and to 
deal with succession planning. We believe the 
following changes will significantly aid our 
growth plans in the years ahead and enable  
us to further drive shareholder value. 
Effective from 1 January, Jane Hall will assume 
the commercially and operationally focused  
role of Chief Executive – Business Services.  
In this role Jane will be responsible for the 
performance of all of our international services 
businesses. I am delighted that Jane, as one of 
our most capable and committed executives, 
has elected to take up this position. Lewis Miller, 
currently MD of our North American BPS 
business and prior to that Finance Director of 
that business, will succeed Jane on 1 March 
2015. Jane will perform both roles until that  
time and will then step down from the Board.
Jane will work alongside Paul Nichols, who is 
already Chief Executive – Insurer Business 
(Technology) and has made good progress  
in developing and growing our global software 
business since his appointment in March.  
In the role of Group Chief Executive, Andy 
Roberts will continue to lead the Group until  
31 December 2015 at which time he will take 
 up a part-time role. Both Jane and Paul will 
report to Andy Roberts.
These are exciting times for our Group. At the 
close of a fifth successive year of revenue and 
adjusted profit growth, I would like to extend my 
personal thanks – and those of the Board and 
wider team – to Andy and Jane for their 
exemplary efforts in bringing us to this point  
so that we can embark on the next exciting 
chapter for the company and our shareholders.
Finally, as previously reported, I have indicated 
that I will be stepping down as Chairman. The 
search for my successor is now well underway 
and with these changes agreed I intend to had 
over to my successor at the Company’s AGM.
I would like to thank my fellow Board members, 
our management team, our advisors and our 
staff, who have worked hard to transform 
Innovation Group into an success story.

Momentum continues
Chief Executive’s review
Innovation Group is clearly on a growth path 
under a stable and strong management team. 
Our task now is to build on these foundations 
and achieve our top three market share 
ambition in each operating region and grow 
our newly separated software business.
The results in this report come from very good 
operational and sales momentum. This is in turn 
based on the stability and quality of our regional 
management. I believe that we now have the 
best team of senior management we have had 
in the business since I first became involved, all 
aligned towards achieving our strategic goals. 
This clarity of purpose is already resulting in 
a consistency of results and a depth of 
engagement with the market that is building a 
strong pipeline of new and extended business.
This engagement is vital as the market is 
changing rapidly with more use of mobile 
technologies, data analysis and customer 
self-service. We are at the forefront of these 
changes, both through our own R&D with our 
Insurer software business, and also by working 
with partners such as Wunelli and Symbility. 
As well as technology leadership, we also aim 
to lead the market through innovative business 
models such as fixed price claims, backed up by 
partnerships with major reinsurers.
This year also saw us add the ability to manage 
both wet and dry perils in our property claims 
business in the UK. We will expand this capability 
into our other operating regions over the 
coming year, giving insurers access to a 
complete range of motor and property policy 
and claims services.
We are now well placed to grow strongly and 
consistently in all areas of our business.
With clear opportunities in both divisions of our 
business and with a strong pipeline in all regions, 
I look forward to the year ahead with confidence.

Chief Executive’s review
How we generate value
Our Business Model
Typically, and unlike some of our 
competitors, we only report our fee for 
handling the claim, rather than the gross 
claims cost as we act under delegated 
authority from our clients. This provides 
earlier cash settlements from our clients 
and a positive cash flow model. 
Where we do carry risk, for example in the 
sale of parts in our German motor business, 
and on-risk service and maintenance plans 
in South Africa, we recognise revenue gross 
of claims cost. 
All of our software products have been 
designed to improve agility, provide more 
flexible underwriting capabilities, enhance 
risk management and give customers the 
experience they deserve. 
The key components of the Insurer suite 
are Insurer Policy, Insurer Claims and 
Insurer Analytics.
Business Structure
We operate a regional structure consisting 
of 6 regions operating in 12 countries. 
These regions are mature, well regulated 
insurance markets, where we believe there 
remains significant scope for further 
penetration for our services and 
technology into both existing and 
new clients.
We add to our product set, either 
 through internal research and 
development or the identification of 
strategic and bolt-on acquisitions. 
Our acquisition criteria is as follows:
• increases the volume of incidents handled; 
• makes us more efficient at handling 
incidents;
• broadens our product set, so we can  
sell different services to more  
customers; and
• increases our share of the margin within 
the supply chain.
Core Competitive Advantages
We believe our ability to deliver both 
Software and Business Process Service 
solutions to our customers makes our 
value proposition extremely strong.
Our own use of our Insurer technology in 
our BPS operations – Enterprise – provides 
us significant operational leverage.
We generate service revenues in three ways: 
1. Transaction fees, where we receive a fee per claim for handling 
motor and property claims on behalf of our clients; 
2. Sale of goods, where we sell motor parts and paint for use within 
the supply chain and attract a margin either as agent or principal; 
3. Revenue shares , where we use ‘risk and reward’ models to 
deliver quality service at the most efficient price to our 
customers and generate revenue based on cost savings.
We generate software revenues in three ways: 
1. Licence fees, for use of our software as a perpetual licence,  
a fixed term licence or on a transactional basis; 
2. Implementation fees, for the implementation of our software  
by our internal delivery team or chosen partners; 
3. Recurring fees, such as software maintenance & licence rental 
and data centre hosting. 
Sector Focus
We focus on motor and property general insurance, across personal and commercial lines, as well as fleet, lease management companies 
and motor manufacturers. 09

Since 2010, Innovation 
Insurer has been recognised 
with 17 awards within six 
different award categories
T elematics
Digital
The Future of Data 
Innovation Group Says 
Innovation Group Says 
One of the fastest growing areas of innovation is in the 
field of telematics, which uses wireless devices to record 
data about driving behaviour to enable insurers to develop 
more accurate pricing for their policies and improve claim 
assessments. The telematics market is still relatively small 
although it’s set to increase as tracking capabilities are 
added in cars. The challenge for insurers then becomes 
how they manage a telematics claim.
The explosion in the provision of digital technology – social, 
mobile, analytics, cloud – is changing the way in which  
brands interact with their customers. 
Through digital technology – mainly smartphones – 
customers making a claim expect the same level of 
technology-led digital service that they get from elsewhere. 
In particular they want to know what is going on at every 
stage of a claims process and to interact  
with those involved.
All technological change generates large volumes of data 
– the question is how is that data stored, analysed, used 
and archived, and how can the future ready insurer optimise 
their business? Arguably, the big data revolution has yet 
to arrive for the insurance industry. Much insurance data 
remains unstructured and unorganised, meaning insurers 
are yet to see the full value of that data. Insurance 
companies are certainly behind their retail counterparts. 
Supermarkets have been building profiles of their 
customers for years. How insurers treat their data and how 
much value they can extract from them will come to shape 
their ability to remain competitive. 
Innovation Group believes 
that telematics will change 
the way insurance is sold. 
How insurers manage their 
systems in relation to all 
the new types of data will 
determine whether they 
can build a successful 
strategy around telematics. 
We provide the software, 
services and processes 
to enable them to flexibly 
update their systems whilst 
continuing to provide 
excellent customer service.
Innovation Group provides a 
number of different software 
and service packages that 
analyse and manage data for 
the insurer, enabling them 
to focus on what they need 
to do with the data output 
in order to drive customer 
acquisition and retention. 11

The Future of Selling 
Flexibility
Innovation Group Says 
Innovation Group Says 
Innovation Group Says 
The digital revolution has led to a shift in the balance of 
power from the industry to consumer. Consumers are able 
to discuss their insurance purchases with hundreds of 
thousands of other consumers before making a decision, 
thanks to social platforms like Twitter or Facebook. 
Some have said that the circle of trust that existed 
between consumers and insurers has been broken. 
However, consumer loyalty is the new frontline of 
competition for insurers, and relationships need to be 
managed more closely than ever to ensure that loyalty 
is embedded into the buying cycle from day one.
Consumers are demanding greater flexibility. The rigid, 
annualised policies that currently dominate the industry are 
increasingly looking unsuited to the lifestyles (and finances) 
of drivers and homeowners today. 
Transparency and a willingness to meet and serve the 
consumer where they are on digital channels will be 
increasingly important. The question now is: will insurers 
take note of this shift in public sentiment and adjust their 
product portfolios and their practices accordingly?
Because customer 
experience and service is a 
strategic differentiator for 
insurers, Innovation Group 
works to deliver touchpoints, 
be they human, online, or 
through our repair networks, 
with empathy, efficiency 
and total quality. We also 
deliver smart technology 
that allows the insurers to 
develop their marketing 
packages in order to ensure 
customer retention. 
Our solution is to make the 
customer journey much 
smoother. We provide a single 
point of entry for insurers, 
customers and others involved 
in a claim, so they can access 
all of the various services. 
In our Property business, our 
software enables us to provide 
pre-paid cards to customers 
for major DIY chains. The wait 
for money and upfront costs 
are eradicated, and the insurer 
benefits from a smoother clear-
out of their claims backlog.
Innovation Group is able to 
provide flexible solutions 
which allow insurers to not 
only respond to the market 
challenges but also to grow. 
We target our sales resource 
towards the segments of the 
insurance market that are 
likely to have the greatest 
need and the greatest 
propensity to take advantage 
of our software and services. 
The next decade is set 
to be the most disruptive 
yet for the insurance 
industry. Response to 
market developments 
is happening against  
a backdrop of 
technological change 
that is overhauling 
traditional insurance 
models. 12

Key risks and uncertainties 
Group strategic report
We operate a risk identification framework at a regional level, 
which assesses risks and categorises them as strategic, financial, 
operational and environmental risks. The risks are ranked to 
identify those risks that require assessment by the Board based 
on the potential exposure and likelihood of occurrence. All of these 
risks have controls and actions identified to mitigate them and 
these are reported on every month as part of the executive 
review process. 
Below is a summary of the key risks we have identified based upon 
the current market context and trends that we see developing,  
the linkage and potential impact on our strategic objectives as  
well as a commentary as to how we manage these as a Group. 
In common with all businesses we face 
a number of risks and uncertainties in 
relation to the achievement of our stated 
strategic objectives. It is vital that we 
understand and mitigate these risks and 
uncertainties so we can achieve our defined 
strategy, maximise value for , and protect 
the interests of all of our stakeholders. 
Description of 
identified risk
Link to strategic objective  
and potential impact if we  
fail to mitigate the risk
How management mitigates 
the identified principal risk
Failure to retain our 
competitive advantage
There is a risk that our software 
becomes obsolete in a competitive 
market place if we do not 
understand the wants and needs 
of the insurance carriers in each 
of the regions we operate in.
Our BPS business has relatively 
low barriers to entry. Product 
offerings and service levels 
must be continually improved 
through process and technology 
to avoid competition being 
based solely on price.
Strategic objective – Growth from 
sales of innovative solutions to 
existing and new clients.
Strategic objective – Growth 
based on our reputation for 
high-quality customer service.
Impact – If we are unable to 
maintain competitive advantage, 
our ability to gain and maintain 
market share will be impaired. 
We will continue to perform research and development 
and invest in our product offerings to ensure the 
Innovation Insurer product suite remains technologically 
competitive. Our product and road map is regularly 
validated by industry analysts and insurance consultants 
and we will continue to perform strategic acquisitions 
and partnerships which enhance our product set.
Our own BPS business uses “Enterprise” (our internal 
version of Innovation Insurer) to process claims. Enterprise 
will be continually upgraded to benefit from improved 
functionality in the product. We continue to invest in 
developing or acquiring ‘point’ solutions in both our Motor 
and Property divisions which will improve processes 
and give better efficiencies in the claims value chain.
Risk of acquisitions 
underperforming
The Group looks to undertake 
acquisitions which enhance 
our offering or increase the 
volume of claims entering our 
business, funded by the use of 
our credit facility, or through 
the issuance of shares as 
consideration. In all cases, the 
Group undertakes acquisitions 
which are identified as earnings 
accretive for our shareholders. 
There is a risk that an acquisition 
fails to perform as expected 
due to unforeseen issues, 
poor integration with the 
Group or underperformance 
against forecasts. 
Strategic objective – Growth 
through strategic and bolt-
on acquisition activity.
Impact – The failure of any 
acquisition to perform to plan will 
significantly impact our ability to 
deliver significant returns to our 
shareholders. Underperformance 
of acquisitions also increases the 
risk of impairment of goodwill or 
any intangible assets recognised 
as part of the acquisition. 
Detailed business plans are submitted to the Board for 
approval of all acquisitions costing most than £1m. These 
include integration plans (where appropriate) and projections 
of the acquisition on the basis that it is part of the Group. 
The Group Finance team will engage external advisors 
to perform due diligence, where the specifics of the 
acquisition is such that specialist advice is required. 
All acquisitions are budgeted for separately post 
acquisition, especially in the case where any element of 
consideration is dependent upon future performance. 
The integration of each acquisition with the rest of the 
Group is managed carefully with appropriate senior 
management involvement to minimise the disruption to 
acquired employees and customers and to ensure the 
maximum benefit is gained from identified synergies. 13

Description of 
identified risk
Link to strategic objective  
and potential impact if we  
fail to mitigate the risk
How management mitigates 
the identified principal risk
Dependence on key 
clients and suppliers
The Group’s revenues depend in 
part on maintaining technology 
and BPS agreements with key 
insurance industry clients. There 
is a risk that key customers 
might cancel material contracts 
or decide to take technology 
or BPS services in-house. 
The Group relies on its 
relationships with its supplier 
networks. There is a risk that 
these key suppliers do not 
cost effectively satisfy their 
obligations to the Group.
Strategic objective – Growth 
from sales of innovative solutions 
to existing and new clients.
Strategic objective – Growth 
based on our reputation for 
high-quality customer service.
Impact – The loss of key customer 
contracts could result in a 
materially adverse effect on the 
Group’s ability to deliver planned 
financial results to shareholders.
A significant failure of delivery by 
the Group’s supplier networks 
could result in damage to 
the Group’s reputation and 
client relationships as well 
as adversely impacting on 
the results of operations.
We will continue to invest in our product offerings to ensure 
the Innovation Insurer product suite remains technologically 
competitive. Our product and road map is regularly 
validated by industry analysts and insurance consultants.
We will continue to invest in Enterprise and our internal  
processes to ensure we continue to deliver real value to  
our customers.
Supplier networks will continue to be managed to ensure the  
efficiency and cost effectiveness of these operations for  
our customers. 
Revenue may be significantly 
affected by weather conditions
The majority of the Group’s 
BPS services revenue is 
derived from handling motor or 
property claims. We therefore 
run the risk of significant claims 
fluctuations due to extreme or 
abnormal weather conditions. 
Through climate change, 
catastrophic (CAT) events are more 
unpredictable and are increasing 
in frequency and geographical 
range of occurrence. The claims 
process needs to undergo 
significant transformation to allow 
insurers to respond to customers 
more quickly and effectively.
Strategic objective – Growth 
from sales of innovative solutions 
to existing and new clients.
Impact – In order to become 
and remain a go-to partner 
for the customer base in our 
chosen target markets, we must 
be able to respond in an agile 
manner to changes in claims 
volumes which are triggered by 
changes in climatic conditions. 
Inability to prove this capability 
will reduce our ability to grow 
market share, impacting our 
future revenue growth and hence 
reduce the potential to provide 
returns to our shareholders. 
We continue to be able to respond quickly so as to  
handle any change in volumes whilst still maintaining  
high levels of customer service.
Part of our customer model is to provide overflow in 
times of their need. Therefore we have to be able to 
respond quickly to changes in required capacity. We have 
tested surge plans in place so as to satisfy our customers 
that we are able to cope with this additional volume. 
 Innovation Group will continue to develop a capability  
to deal with CAT events, using its global footprint to provide  
24/7 coverage to respond timely and effectively on  
behalf of clients.
Credit facilities and 
banking covenants
We have a £50.0m revolving credit 
facility which has a number of 
financial covenants. There is a risk 
of the Group breaching covenants 
if financial performance is not met. 
Strategic objective – Growth 
through strategic and bolt-
on acquisition activity.
Impact – A level of debt is required 
to fund significant earnings 
enhancing acquisitions, be they 
either strategic or bolt-on. 
Breach of covenants or removal 
of our credit facility would 
significantly impact our ability 
to perform acquisitions which 
support our strategic goal. 
At 30 September 2014, we had a net cash position of £56.9m 
and an undrawn revolving credit facility of £26.7m, out of a 
total available facility of £50.0m. The revolving credit facility 
expires in September 2019. As such, all debt drawn down 
under this facility is presented as a non-current liability. 
Financial covenants are reviewed as part of any significant 
acquisition and as part of the annual budget process. As 
part of this process, we prepare detailed profit and cash flow 
forecasts to assess these covenants on a forward looking 
basis so as to test the risk of breach. In addition, as per the 
terms of the covenants, they are tested every quarter with 
the results provided to our corporate bankers. There have 
been no covenant breaches nor are there any forecasted.
This is not an exhaustive list and other factors may impact the Group. 14
The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Group operational and 
fi n a nc ia l   r e vi e w
Group strategic report
The Group also has a number of operational 
KPIs that are used to manage the business on a 
day by day basis, many of which are woven into 
service level agreements within our customer 
contracts. Examples of these include:
• Number of claims notified within a time  
period (daily/weekly/monthly) – BPS;
• Number of claims closed within a time  
period – BPS;
• Average settlement value per claim – BPS;
• Size of sales pipeline – BPS and Software;
• Customer satisfaction – BPS and  
Software; and
• Utilisation of staff – Software.
It is considered impractical to separately 
report on these operational KPIs within the 
Group’s Annual Report and Accounts because 
although the KPI measurement may be the 
same, the targets will vary by region, driven 
predominantly by individual contractual service 
level requirements. 
The financial KPIs noted above are linked to the 
operational KPIs in a manner which mean that 
tracking the financial KPIs is considered to be a 
reasonable proxy for some of these operational 
KPIs. For instance, transactional revenue is 
driven by the number of claims handled in 
a period. 
These KPIs are considered to be relevant to the 
strategic goals as stated on the following bases: 
Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”)
Management has determined a number of KPIs, 
which are used to track progress throughout 
the year against our strategy. Prior period 
financial information is presented both at 
previously reported values and on a constant 
currency (“CC”) basis, using 2014 exchange 
rates to retranslate these reported numbers. 
We have done this so we may present the 
underlying performance of the business without 
the effect of translation. 
The Group’s Financial KPIs are:
• Revenue;
• Adjusted EBITDA;
• Adjusted Profit;
• Adjusted earnings per share; and
• Cash conversion as a percentage of 
adjusted EBITDA.
These measures have been selected as they are 
deemed to be most appropriate in measuring 
what is required to generate an increase in 
shareholder value and are consistent with 
previous years. Certain of these KPIs also form 
the basis of senior management reward, 
therefore ensuring that this is aligned with 
shareholder value creation. The Group’s 
performance against these KPIs is referred  
to as part of the following financial review. 
The definition of these terms and the method 
of calculation of them are outlined further in 
Appendix 2 on page 128.
How will we reach our strategic goal Relevance of KPIs to how we will achieve our strategic goal
Growth based on our reputation for  
high-quality customer service
On a day to day basis, our operations measure 
customer and client satisfaction as part of our 
service level agreements.
If we do not provide excellent service, then we 
run the risk of the loss of a client or a reduction 
in the volume of claims that we are asked to 
handle, thereby impacting revenue growth, 
profitability and generation of cash. 
Growth from sales of new innovative  
solutions to existing and new clients
We continually assess our sales pipeline in order 
to ensure that we have enough opportunities to 
support our growth targets. We use a Group 
wide standard methodology to consistently 
measure the size of opportunity.
Sales growth is measured by our ability to 
increase revenue. We measure and report 
revenue growth as a KPI.  15

How will we reach our strategic goal Relevance of KPIs to how we will achieve our strategic goal
Strategic and bolt-on acquisition activity Success of acquisition activity is measured  
by the returns we are able to generate through 
the integration of the acquired business into  
the Group and hence the level of adjusted  
profit generated. Part of the acquisition  
process is the submission of forecasts for 
revenue, profitability and cash generation;  
and identification of expected synergies  
(growth, strategy, leverage) to be gained  
from the acquisition. 
We separately track the performance of 
acquisitions, for at least the first full year post 
acquisition (unless that business is merged into 
another operation) so as to ensure we are able 
to compare the returns generated to that 
originally forecast in the acquisition process. 
Unless already budgeted for within that financial 
year (due to proximity of acquisition to the year 
end), all performance targets used to pay an 
incentive in the year of acquisition are increased 
to reflect the expected contribution from the 
acquisition target used to justify the acquisition.
 
Overall Group performance
Achievement against approved budget
The Board approved a budget for the Group in 
October 2013. On an overall basis, the Group 
achieved its adjusted profit and cash conversion 
targets set under this budget, but missed the 
revenue target due predominantly to the 
performance of our North American region and 
currency depreciation across all overseas 
territories and most particularly in South Africa.
Revenue (KPI)
Overall the Group achieved 3% growth in 
revenues to £209.8m (2013: £204.4m).
The Group aimed to achieve 21% year on year 
growth in overall group revenue at constant 
currency through a mixture of organic and 
in-organic (acquired) growth in all of its territories. 
Revenue growth at constant currency was  
10%, comprising an increase in BPS revenues  
of 7% to £179.0m (2013: £167.5m) and an 
increase in software revenues of 31% to  
£30.8m (2013: £23.6m). The Group’s 
underperformance against the constant 
currency target was primarily the result of lower 
than originally anticipated claims volumes in  
some regions linked to benign weather and 
lower than expected implementation revenues 
in the software business.
Excluding revenue from the acquisitions made 
in the year, which amounted to £7.6m, organic 
growth at constant currency was 6%.

●● Revenue

The Group operates internationally and results 
for the year are subject to movements in 
currency exchange rates. Approximately  
74% (2013: 77%) of the Group’s revenues are 
generated in currencies other than Sterling.  
The Group has a policy of not hedging 
translation movements that arise, although 
material transactions are hedged at the point 
they become more likely than not to occur. 
During the 2014 financial year the value of the 
Group’s overseas earnings has been impacted 
by the strengthening of Sterling against each  
of the Group’s main foreign currencies.  16

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and 
Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“AEPS”) (KPI)
The Group aimed to achieve 37% year on year 
growth in adjusted profit at constant currency. 
Over performance of this KPI when compared 
to revenue growth indicates strong operational 
leverage in the BPS business and an increase in 
high margin software licence revenue. Growth in 
reported adjusted profit, adjusted EBITDA and 
AEPS were 38%, 33% and 41% respectively 
against revenue growth of 10%.

Adjusted EBITDA 37.0 29.8 27.8
The improvement in the Group’s adjusted profit 
before tax is principally the result of the 
following significant items:
• Increased profits from the revenue sharing 
arrangements in the UK subsidence business;
• Increased volumes through the Group’s 
partnership with AXA in France;
• Sales of one-off licences increased by £3.0m 
year on year, mainly in Asia Pacific and the UK;
• Increased implementation revenues from 
software sales across the Group;
• Increased margins in a number of divisions 
from improved operational leverage; and 
• Contributions from acquisitions made in the 
current year of £3.0m; offset by
• Increased amortisation of non-acquired 
intangibles of £1.1m.
 
The regional improvements noted above are 
further expanded upon as part of the 
Regional review. 
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
recognised under business combinations 
increased from £3.9m in 2013 to £5.1m in 2014. 
This increase is due to the full year impact of the 
2013 acquisitions as well as the additional 
acquisitions made during the current year – 
being Crashworth (February 2014), LAS (March 
2014) and Driven Solutions (September 2014). 
No impairment charge (2013: £0.8m) has been 
recognised against acquired intangible assets. 
The cost of share based payments was £2.1m 
(2013: £3.2m). The main driver of the reduced 
charge was the lower share price towards the 
end of the year, which reduced both the number 
of shares expected to vest and the absolute 
value of the awards, particularly in respect of the 
2011 Plan. The associated employer’s national 
insurance charge was at a similar level to the 
prior year. The Group made three further 
awards under the PSP scheme during the year 
and issued discounted share options to staff 
under the Group’s Sharesave scheme.  17

During the year, the Group incurred net 
exceptional costs of £5.7m (2013: £0.4m),  
this was the principal reason for the reduction  
in the Group’s profit before tax year on year. 
The exceptional costs comprised:
• A charge of £1.3m for deal costs relating  
to acquisition activity in the year; 
• A charge of £0.2m relating to additional 
payments of contingent consideration due  
on acquisitions of previous subsidiaries;
• A charge of £2.6m relating to restructuring 
the BPS business in Europe predominantly 
relating to the integration of the LAS and 
Crashworth acquisitions into the UK business;
• A charge of £0.6m relating to restructuring 
the Technology business in North America 
and the UK following the appointment of  
Paul Nichols in March 2014; and
• A charge of £0.9m relating to restructuring 
the BPS business in North America, Asia 
Pacific and South Africa.
During the year the Group paid £1.2m (2013: 
£nil) in post acquisition compensation which  
is recorded as an expense in the income 
statement rather than in goodwill as it is 
dependent on the continued employment  
of the vendor in the UK Motor business. 
During the year the Group incurred a debit to 
revenue of £0.2m (2013: £nil) in connection  
with the warrants to the disposal of 30% of  
our French subsidiary to AXA in April 2013.

The decrease in profit before tax together 
with the share placement in the year has 
resulted in a 1% decrease in basic earnings 
per share (“EPS”) to 0.77p (2013: 0.78p).  
The significant increase in adjusted profit offset 
by the dilutive effect of the share placement in 
the year has resulted in a 30% improvement 
in adjusted earnings per share (“AEPS”) to  
1.87p (2013: 1.44p).

The reduction in basic EPS is the result  
of significant costs of acquisitions and 
restructuring activity performed to position  
the Group’s UK and US BPS operations and  
the software business so as to maximise  
future shareholder return. The increase in 
adjusted EPS demonstrates the continued 
growth in underlying profitability of the Group. 
Commentary on the adjusting items is as 
described on pages 16 and 17 as part of the 
reconciliation from profit before tax to  
adjusted profit before tax. 
Group – Cash and Cash Conversion (KPI)
The Group ended the year with net cash of 
£56.9m (2013: £26.9m) comprising gross cash 
of £79.3m (2013: £50.7m) and debt of £22.4m 
(2013: £23.8m). On 22 September 2014,  
the Group entered into a new £50.0m,  
multi-currency revolving credit facility expiring 
in September 2019 with Barclays Bank plc.  
At the year end £26.7m of the facility was 
undrawn. Included within gross cash is £16.2m 
(2013: £16.7m) of cash available for use within 
our South African business; this continues to  
be subject to the normal government imposed 
exchange controls for that country. 18

Operating cash inflow, adjusted for exceptional 
and taxation payments represents a conversion 
of cash relative to adjusted EBITDA of 88% 
(2013: 90%). Cash Conversion is a Group KPI  
and demonstrates the Group’s ability to convert 
profits into cash either for reinvestment into the 
business or for dividend distribution. This target 
is set at 85% to allow for the funding of growth in 
the business.

Operating cash inflow was £22.9m (2013: 
£19.1m) after the payment of exceptional  
cash costs of £4.1m (2013: £1.4m) relating  
to exceptional charges in the current year  
and those accrued from previous years. 
The net cash outflow from investing activities 
was £51.2m (2013: £13.5m). This includes 
interest received of £0.9m (2013: £0.9m), 
payments for business combinations net of 
cash received of £40.8m (2013: £6.8m), cash 
received on sale of a non-controlling interest in 
a subsidiary of £nil (2013: £3.0m) and fixed asset 
additions of £11.1m (2013: £10.8m) of which 
£5.0m (2013: £3.7m) is the capitalisation of 
costs relating to the ongoing development and 
regionalisation of the Group’s core Innovation 
Insurer product and Innovation Enterprise.
Financing cash inflow of £61.0m (2013: inflow 
£3.3m) includes interest paid of £1.1m (2013: 
£0.8m), repayment of borrowings of £0.4m 
(2013: £1.7m), new bank loans of £1.0m  
(2013: £5.6m), dividends paid to minorities of 
£3.2m (2013: £2.3m), receipts from sale of 
shareholding in subsidiary undertakings where 
control has been retained of £nil (2013: £2.9m) 
and net proceeds from issue of shares of 
£64.7m (2013: £0.4m).
Group – Tax
The Group’s tax charge was £2.2m (2013: 
£4.3m). The Group’s adjusted tax charge of 
£4.1m (2013: £5.9m) is calculated by adding  
back the deferred tax credit recognised against  
IFRS acquired intangible asset amortisation  
of £0.9m (2013: £1.0m), the tax effect of 
exceptional costs of £0.9m (2013: £0.1m), the 
tax effect of post acquisition compensation of 
£0.2m (2013: £nil), the tax effect of the gain on 
disposal of £0.1m (2013: reduction of £0.2m) 
and deducting the movement in deferred tax  
on share based payments of £0.2m (2013: add 
back of £0,2m).  19

When expressed as a percentage of adjusted 
profit, this represents an adjusted effective tax 
rate of 15% (2013: 27%). This is much lower  
than the guidance given at the half year due  
to the recognition of £2.1m of previously 
unrecognised deferred tax assets in the UK  
and USA which have been crystallised by the 
creation of deferred tax liabilities on acquired 
intangibles. No other significant deferred tax 
assets have been recognised in the year. 
The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate is  
driven by a number of factors, such as:
• Split of profitability between the Group’s 
operating regions with differing tax charges; 
• Ability to efficiently group relieve tax losses; 
and
• Recognition of deferred tax assets where  
it is anticipated that these will be utilised  
in the future particularly in the UK and 
North America. 
The Group continues to carry forward significant 
unrecognised tax losses in certain UK and  
US entities, this is outlined in further detail  
on page 89 of note 10 to the accounts. 
Group – Trade and other Debtors 
Trade debtors have increased by £8.8m from 
£28.8m to £37.6m. The year end balance 
includes £2.5m of trade debtors acquired with 
Driven (see note 17) and approximately £4.0m  
in respect of a licence sale in the Australian 
software business. The underlying level of trade 
debtors is in line with the improved levels of 
revenues seen across the Group in the year.
Total accrued income has increased by  
£2.1m from £25.1m to £27.2m. This is primarily 
due to the acquired accrued income in the  
LAS and Driven businesses. During the year  
the Group crystallised £8.0m in relation to  
the revenue sharing arrangements in the UK 
Property business.
Group – Trade and other creditors
Trade creditors have increased by £5.8m from 
£35.2m to £41.0m. This is primarily due to the 
acquired trade creditors within the LAS and 
Driven businesses. 
Total deferred income has increased by £2.5m 
from £16.7m to £19.2m. This is primarily due to 
an increase in deferred income in South Africa 
from higher activity and the acquired deferred 
income within the Driven business. 
Group – Acquisition activity 
During the year the Group completed three 
acquisitions for a maximum total cost of 
£51.3m, all of which will be payable in cash. 
£4.8m of this balance was deferred at the 
year end. 
The revenue and adjusted profit before tax 
contributions from these acquisitions in the 
year to 30 September 2014 were £7.6m and 
£3.0m respectively. Further details on these 
acquisitions are included in the following 
Regional Review, on pages 20 to 25, and in

BPS and Software. It has grown significantly in 
profitability over recent years driven by the 
exceptional performance of the UK subsidence 
business and through the impact of acquisitions.
Revenue
The UK reported revenue growth of 17%. 
Overall organic growth was 2% with the 
non-organic growth due to the in-year 
acquisition of Crashworth and LAS and the 
impact of a full year’s revenue from GVS 
acquired in 2013. 
Our Property business had year on year revenue 
growth of 28%. Organic revenue improved by  
7% due to the impact of the contract win with  
a Tier 1 insurer in October 2013. Although the 
subsidence business experienced a lower than 
normal year for new claims notifications; strong 
progression of existing open claims once again 
enabled us to generate high margin revenue  
due to the revenue sharing arrangements. We 
continue to focus on minimising indemnity and 
other costs incurred within the settlement of 
these claims, whilst ensuring we continue to 
meet the requisite standards of excellent 
customer service.
The acquisition of LAS in March 2014 was a 
strategically important step for the Group.  
LAS provides its customers with a full suite of 
outsourced services that handle claims across a 
range of property-related perils including storm, 
burst pipes, flood, fire, theft and accidental 
damage. The vast majority of LAS’s revenue 
comes from water-related claims: also known  
in the insurance industry as wet perils. The 
addition of wet perils skills and capabilities 
increases the addressable market claims spend 
of the UK Property business from £100m, 
(our existing subsidence or dry perils market),  
to £1.3bn. The combination of the two 
businesses is expected to generate significant 
revenue opportunities and the restructuring 
performed since acquisition has delivered 
significant operational synergies for the UK 
Property business as a whole.
Our UK Motor business grew by 2% on a year  
on year basis, reflecting a contraction in the 
existing business of 16% offset by the impact  
of acquisitions with a full year’s results from 
GVS, acquired in April 2013, and eight months 
results of Crashworth, acquired at the end of 
January 2014. The main reason for the lack of 
organic growth was the loss of certain customer 
contracts. However, the acquisition of 
Crashworth has transformed the UK Motor 
business into the second largest manager of 
vehicle repair claims in the UK, allowing clients 
to benefit from increased efficiencies. The 
combination of the two businesses under the 
leadership of Chris Ashworth, the founder of 
Crashworth and a leading figure in the UK motor 
claims industry for the last 20 years, is expected 
to deliver significant growth in the future. 
The UK Software business grew by 10% on  
a year on year basis, largely as the business 
benefitted from two one-off licence sales that 
generated £1.0m of revenues in the year. Both 
of these one-off licence sales converted annual 
licence rental into a perpetual licence for the 
Group’s historic Huon product. The combined 
annual licence retail income stream from these 
two customers was £0.6m and these revenue 
streams had been expected to be terminated  
by the customers in the near future. 21

Germany’s main revenue stream is the provision 
of BPS solutions to the Motor industry across 
both insurance and fleet, this is augmented by a 
smaller property business. 
Revenue
The Motor division in Germany grew revenue 
by 2 % year on year, or 5% at constant currency 
to £52.1m. The repair management business 
experienced volumes of claims below prior year 
levels due to the benign weather conditions 
experienced throughout the year. Overall 
revenue was flat in this business but is expected 
to grow significantly from the contract win with 
Zurich announced in October 2014.
The Fleet business had several new client 
wins and has rebuilt revenue to prior year levels 
despite having lost a significant fleet customer 
at the end of 2013.
Revenue in the motor division also includes 
£29.2m (2012: £27.3m) from the sale of parts 
which attracts very low EBITDA margins but 
grew quite strongly in the year with higher 
conversion rates from the Group’s own network. 
The Property division saw revenue growth of 
3% year on year, or 7% at constant currency to 
£5.8m. Volumes of claims were relatively flat as 
there were no significant weather events.
Adjusted Profit
Adjusted profit for the year improved by 3%, 
or 7% at constant currency to £9.2m. This was 
achieved through the revenue growth noted 
above, from continued cost efficiencies and 
from efforts to reduce cancellation rates. 
The first UK sale of Insurer Claims in the year 
followed the first UK sale of Insurer Policy at the 
end of 2013. These two implementations are 
important to the UK Software business as they 
will both offer solid reference sites to support 
the strong pipeline.
Adjusted Profit
Adjusted profit for the year increased slightly at 
£9.4m compared to £9.1m in the previous year. 
The increase in adjusted profit as compared to 
the previous year is the result of the following:
• Profits relating to the in-year and prior 
year acquisitions; 
• Profits in UK property generated through 
high margin revenue shares; and
• Profit of £1.0m from one-off licence sales  
offset by £0.9m loss from software 
implementation projects.

Rest of Europe
Group strategic report
The Rest of Europe operations solely provide 
Motor BPS solutions to insurers and fleets. We 
use our own software, Enterprise, to manage 
repairs on behalf of both insurers and fleets 
across all regions, France, Belgium and Spain 
and we believe that the benefits of this are clear 
within the profits and profit margins generated 
by this part of the Group. 
Revenue
Revenue grew by 12% or 16% at constant 
currency to £17.0m, all of which was organic.
Last year the Group announced a strategic 
partnership with AXA France (“AXA”) which saw 
a subsidiary of AXA acquire a 30% shareholding 
in Nobilas France in return for AXA significantly 
increasing the volume of claims channelled 
through Nobilas France into the future. This 
partnership has proved very successful and has 
driven an increase in revenue in Nobilas France 
of 13% at constant currency.
The significant revenue growth in Belgium since 
the acquisitions in 2012 has continued in the 
year with revenue up 15% at constant currency. 
We continue to penetrate the broker and insurer 
market and we continue to see this as an area of 
exciting potential.
Revenue in our Spanish business has increased 
by 29% year on year at constant currency with 
the Group’s proposition being attractive to 
insurers and fleets seeking to reduce operating 
and indemnity costs. 
Adjusted Profit
Adjusted profit increased year on year by 42%  
or 46% at constant currency to £3.2m in 2014. 
This organic profit growth has been generated 
through the continued revenue growth as 
described above and the ability of these 
businesses to generate economies of scale, 
partly through the use of Enterprise.  23

South Africa
South Africa’s main revenue stream is the 
provision of BPS solutions to the Motor  
industry. The largest contributor of revenue  
is the administration of warranty and service & 
maintenance products from a strong customer 
base of both motor manufacturers and  
finance houses. 
Revenue
On a constant currency basis, the business  
has again performed strongly, with revenue 
increasing by 7% (2013: 10%). Reported 
revenues in our South African business 
decreased from £39.1m in 2013 to £34.5m  
in 2014. This was caused by the significant 
weakening of the South African Rand on a  
year on year basis. 
The increase in revenues on a constant 
currency basis has been driven by new contract 
wins both in the service plan and warranty 
businesses and also in the smaller insurance 
division. Revenues were also impacted in the 
year by £0.5m through the agreement of price 
increases with a customer. The contract win 
with Fonesure announced in October 2013 did 
not perform as expected and the Group exited 
this arrangement during the year. 
It should be noted that the 2013 reported 
revenue for South Africa included £2.2m 
relating to the Travel Insurance business 
disposed of in June 2013. Therefore organic 
growth on a like for like constant currency 
basis was 14%.
Adjusted Profit
Adjusted profit fell from £8.3m in 2013 to  
£7.5m in 2014, a fall of 10%. On a constant 
currency basis the region improved adjusted 
profit by £0.6m, an increase of 9%. The increase 
in profitability on a constant currency basis was 
the result of increased revenues in the motor 
division as detailed above.
As in the previous financial year, we have 
recognised a profit share in regards to  
our Associate – Guardrisk. In total this  
has contributed £0.1m in the current year  
(2013: £0.8m). Of this figure, £nil (2013: £0.6m) 
was generated from a revision of the  
expected reserves required to settle out  
all claims within the cell. 24

North America
Group strategic report
Our North American region generates  
revenue across all product lines, being Motor 
BPS, Property BPS and Software. The largest 
contributor is Motor. The North American 
market remains our largest opportunity in 
regards to improvement in market share  
across the Group. 
Revenue
Reported revenue in North America grew by  
4% on a year on year basis, or 11% at constant 
currency to £27.0m. Overall organic growth  
was 1% or 8% at constant currency.
Performance from our Motor BPS division saw 
reported revenue decrease by 1% year on year, 
or increase by 5% at constant currency to 
£10.7m. However, reported revenue included 
£0.8m from acquisitions, organic revenue 
decreased by 9% year on year, or 3% at constant 
currency to £9.9m. The fall in organic revenues 
resulted from a number of loss making 
contracts being terminated as part of the 
business restructure in 2013. By the end of 2014 
the Motor business had rebuilt revenues to prior 
year levels through winning new business.
Driven Solutions Inc. (“Driven”) was acquired  
in August 2014. Driven provides customers  
with access to a national towing and roadside 
assistance network and the acquisition 
broadens the Group’s product set in the region. 
The acquisition of Driven is expected to 
enhance the results of the Motor business as a 
whole in the region by increasing margins from 
the supply chain. 
The Property business contracted by 24% on a 
year on year basis, or 19% at constant currency 
to £2.5m. This was as a result of a number of 
loss making contracts being terminated as part 
of the business restructure in 2013 and a 
customer taking business back in house.
The Software business grew by 26% on a year 
on year basis, or 34% at constant currency to 
£11.2m (2013: £9.0m). This growth was 
generated from continuing implementation 
revenue associated with sales of Insurer in the 
current and prior years. Licence revenues were 
flat at £1.4m (2013: £1.4m). 
Adjusted Profit
The region recorded an adjusted loss of £0.3m 
which was an improvement of £0.9m from 2013 
as a result of the following:
• Impact in the prior year of the termination  
of a number of loss making contracts;
• Improved margins on software 
implementation revenue; and
• Adjusted profit from acquisitions of £0.1m. 25

A s ia   P ac i fi c
The Asia Pacific region generates revenue 
across all product lines being Motor BPS, 
Property BPS and Software, the largest 
contributor being Motor.
Revenue
Revenue in our Asia Pacific business fell by 10% 
on a year on year basis from £21.4m to £19.2m. 
However, on a constant currency basis there 
was growth of 3%. 
The business had a difficult start to the year 
following the last minute withdrawal by a 
prospective customer of a significant new 
contract which would have underpinned both 
software and BPS revenues for a number  
of years.
Motor BPS revenue contracted by 25% year  
on year, or 14% at constant currency to £10.1m 
as a result of a number of customers taking 
claims management back in-house. There was 
no significant weather event for the third year 
running which prevented any significant growth 
from existing business. Property BPS revenue 
contracted by 39% year on year, or 30% at 
constant currency to £2.6m as a result of a key 
client moving their business offshore. However, 
the pipeline has been re-built and two significant 
new deals have been concluded that are 
expected to drive double-digit revenue and  
profit growth in the Motor division over the  
next few years. 
The Software division benefitted from a  
one-off licence sale of £3.9m. This was the 
conversion of an annual licence rental into a 
perpetual licence for the Group’s historic Huon 
product. This annual licence rental was worth 
approximately £1.0m per annum and as the 
contract was expected to be terminated before 
2020, the Group settled for the equivalent of 
four years rental. Underlying performance from 
this division was below target for the year due to 
the lack of any new sales of the Insurer product.
Adjusted Profit
Adjusted profit was up £1.0m on a year on year 
basis, or £1.2m at constant currency. This is  
due to the one-off licence sale in the year  
noted above which contributed incremental 
revenues of £3.9m resulting in adjusted profit  
of £1.5m after the relevant software royalty 
back to the Centre.  26

Assuring IntegriSure’s 
insurance excellence
The mission
The insurance industry, like most other 
industries, is not exempt from the tremendous 
influence that technology has on day-to-day 
operations. The challenge is to harness the 
potential of these new technologies to support 
efficient and effective services to the end-user 
that enable client retention and provide a 
flexible framework for ongoing growth and 
change. As a global provider of business process 
services and software solutions, Innovation 
Group has been associated with specialised 
short term insurance provider, IntegriSure, for 
almost a decade. This relationship necessitates 
the constant development and refinement of 
client interfacing solutions that reflect 
technological advancements. 
The solution
Innovation Group has been instrumental in 
developing client solutions in conjunction  
with IntegriSure that are based on advanced 
web technology. The ability to transact online 
has become an essential part of modern day 
business. IntegriSure’s E-centre positions the 
company at the forefront in the adoption of 
cutting edge technology and offers clients the 
opportunity to view and track policy and claims 
information online in real-time. 
IntegriSure’s Web Quote System, developed in 
partnership with Innovation Group, has given 
the organisation not only a competitive edge 
but has proven to be a sustainable contributor 
of sales to the business and is an integral part  
of their offering to potential clients. 
“Having a long-term relationship with a business 
partner such as Innovation Group ensures 
stability and sustainability for both businesses. 
Working closely with the software development 
and insurance services teams has resulted in 
the achievement of shared organisational 
objectives,” says IntegriSure’s Head of Systems 
and Support, Marlene Lennox. “Together we 
are able to create synergistic solutions to 
business challenges.” 
Innovation Group’s provision of insurance 
services; such as assessing, legal recoveries and 
the handling and disposal of salvage on behalf of 
IntegriSure ensures that the cycle of insurance 
activities runs smoothly without interruption  
or delay. Continued innovation is applied 
throughout to improve results and reduce  
the cost of claims. 
The result 
IntegriSure’s appetite for technology-based 
solutions, coupled with Innovation Group’s 
ability to help develop these product offerings, 
allows the partnership to consistently improve 
the front-end of their services which has a 
positive knock-on effect on market share and 
customer satisfaction. The key differentiator 
between the software services developed by 
Innovation Group and those offered by other 
service providers, centres around bespoke 
solutions. Products are conceived and 
customised through extensive consultation  
and needs analysis allowing for the delivery of 
specialised software that fulfils industry as well 
as individual organisational requirements. 
“Our software development team at Innovation 
Group has become an extension of our own 
Systems and Business Support team,” says 
Lennox. “In terms of performing business 
analytics and software development functions, 
the group’s dedicated resources allocated to 
our account ensure rapid implementation of 
system solutions in our ever-evolving 
environment.”
Supporting a targeted approach 
IntegriSure, established in 1998, is an 
Authorised Financial Services Provider that 
offers specialised short term insurance and 
other value added products for niche markets. 
Their range of tailor-made products are 
underwritten by South Africa’s leading insurers. 
IntegriSure Executive Chairman, Arnold van der 
Linde, saw the benefits associated with doing 
business with a responsible market when other 
insurance companies were still concerned with 
high-risk demographics.  27
The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Financial 
statements
Strategic 
report
Corporate 
governance
Van der Linde took the view that clients falling 
within the responsible definition are, generally, 
more established and pose a lesser risk. They 
take the time to safeguard their valuables 
properly, tend to spend more time at home and 
drive more responsibly. Another advantage is 
that they are more informed in terms of the 
insurance product options available to them and 
appreciate the necessity of fully investigating 
them before purchase. 
“The factors that make this demographic a 
valuable market segment also influence the 
type of service that is required. It is imperative 
that these clients have access to accurate 
information wherever and whenever they want 
it,” says Innovation Group’s Chief Information 
Officer, Christine Sheffield. “This is why the 
software deployed has to deliver a successful 
and reliable experience.” 
Data that is meaningful
Traditionally, players within the short-term 
insurance industry have built their applications 
and systems in a silo, from the ground up.  
The result is that the industry has generated 
vast amounts of data, but the challenge of 
consolidating data stored in several different 
databases often means that data analytics is 
not as effective as it could be.
“IntegriSure runs a software system that allows 
data to be accessed bi-directionally and all of 
the data is stored on a single database. This 
means that data is readily available and can  
be used more advantageously for analytical  
and actuarial purposes” explains Sheffield. 
“Existing data can be used to gather new 
insights into consumer behaviour, attitudes 
and demographics.” 
Reducing the cost of claims
Certain supply chain initiatives, when 
administered efficiently, can significantly reduce 
the cost of claims. For this reason, Innovation 
Group provides a number of insurance services 
on behalf of IntegriSure. These services range 
from assessing to the handling and disposing 
of salvage. 
It is through creative consultation with clients 
and a resolute belief in new technology that 
Innovation Group is able to offer fully 
customisable solutions.
Setting the trend 
Innovation Group’s commitment to enabling 
clients to become Future Ready and to comply 
with industry regulation and legislation is 
demonstrated by the processing of the first live 
batch of insurance policies through the STRIDE 
industry switch in 2013. 
STRIDE was formed as an industry initiative  
to enable binder holders and insurers to share 
data, in the ACORD standard format, through  
a secure electronic connection, to optimise 
data sharing, processing and reuse. 
Innovation Group (the Solution Provider), 
Santam (the Insurer) and IntegriSure (the Binder 
Holder) reached an historical milestone as they 
co-ordinated multiple development teams 
across different technology platforms to 
standardise the integration of data via the 
STRIDE switch provided by ASTUTE. 
“We are steadfast in our dedication to creating 
pioneering solutions for the Short Term 
Insurance Industry,” remarks Sheffield.  28

Heritage 
Progressive is a leading car insurer in the  
USA, one of the top five by market share and 
awareness. Established in 1937 Progressive  
has a long heritage as a car insurer. Its brand  
is heavily based on the value proposition of 
competitive pricing with high service levels. 
Aggressive use of comparative pricing features 
heavily in Progressive’s marketing campaigns 
and on its website.
Progressive is also known for innovation.  
One of its most notable achievements is early 
development of an online presence and selling 
the first car insurance policy via the Web, in 
1996; a world first.
Challenge of a start-up 
Establishing an Australian operation in 2009 
meant applying start-up thinking. Progressive’s 
brand and reputation were unknown by 
Australian consumers. With no infrastructure  
in place and no supply chain network, start-up 
was an accurate description, according to 
Simon Lindsay, Progressive’s Country  
Manager for Australia.
Sensing an opportunity to enter the  
Australian car insurance market, Progressive 
chose an online-only business model. This  
helps differentiate their offering to prospective 
customers. With little awareness of the 
Progressive brand the Australian start-up  
had to get the value proposition right in order  
to succeed.
Pricing risk and offering premiums competitive 
with established market players was one part of 
the value proposition Simon and his team had to 
get right. Implementing an online-only channel 
for policy sales and administration keeps 
overheads low. It’s a cost effective method for a 
start-up compared to the cost of establishing 
call centres. Being exclusively online for policy 
sales and administration also helps reinforce  
the value proposition to policy holders.
The other part of Progressive’s value 
proposition is service quality. With insurance, 
service delivery occurs when claims are made. 
Until then it’s largely a promise, an expectation 
of what will be delivered, if the need arises. 
Simon and his team sought an Australian  
based claims service provider with a strong 
commitment to quality to deliver a claims 
service worthy of the Progressive brand.
Exhaustive investigations led to the selection  
of a claims service provider but this was just the 
beginning. The claims service provider had to 
work closely with Simon’s team to effectively 
deliver Progressive’s value proposition to the 
Australian market. Starting from scratch means 
there were no previous reference points from 
which to start. The experience and capabilities 
of the service provider were critical as was their 
ability to adapt processes to suit Progressive’s 
exacting requirements. Leveraging a proven 
claims-service provider’s capabilities; one 
offering scalable solutions, addressed some  
of Progressive’s start-up challenges.
Measure the service measure the success
Progressive uses a service rating system  
known as the Net Promoter Score
®
 (NPS).  
It measures satisfaction after a service event 
using customers’ likelihood to recommend  
or promote the service to others as a measure 
of how they actually valued the service 
experienced.
Customers will reward an insurer with loyalty  
if they experience good service. A good  
NPS score indicates the claims service met  
or exceeded expectations and therefore is a 
good indicator of customer loyalty. Deliver poor 
service, as indicated by low NPS ratings and 
policy renewals will be negatively impacted, 
along with reputation. For Progressive in 
Australia, NPS is one measure of the claims 
service provider’s effectiveness. 29

From start-up to challenger –  
living up to the promise 
Progressive is now a fast-growing brand in the 
Australian car insurance market; a challenger 
brand to others. Progressive is experiencing 
good growth in new policy sales as well as  
strong renewal rates. Consistently good  
NPS ratings indicate the service delivered by 
their claims provider, Innovation Group, is 
successfully living up to Progressive’s value 
proposition and service promise.
Reflecting on the journey from start-up to 
challenger, Simon commented: “Introducing a 
new car insurance brand in Australia’s mature 
market meant we faced many challenges and 
many risks. Innovation Group helped us address 
some of those risks”. Progressive relies on 
Innovation Group’s infrastructure, flexible 
processes and extensive experience in critical 
aspects of car insurance claims processing.
Progressive’s Australian advertising campaigns 
use a character, Kitty and a store setting to 
represent their website to prospective 
purchasers. Using humour, Kitty explains the 
Progressive value proposition of saving money 
and time buying car insurance online, to people 
browsing the site, shown in the ads as visiting 
the Progressive store. The claims service must 
reflect the same convenience Kitty promises in 
the ads. Simon emphasises: “The service quality 
can’t be compromised”.
In a show of confidence that Progressive is 
delivering on its value proposition to customers, 
customer comments from claims survey 
responses are posted on the Progressive 
Australia website (www. progressiveonline.com.
au/customer-rating.aspx). This also indicates 
confidence in Innovation Group.
Progressive continues to benefit from a  
close working relationship with Innovation 
Group. “As our competencies and capabilities 
evolve, Innovation Group works closely with  
us, adapting to our changing needs; more  
like a partner than a service provider”,  
Simon explained.
Progressive’s marketing campaigns are 
generating good results. Combined with strong 
renewals, Progressive is increasing its share of 
the Australian car insurance market.
“As a challenger brand in the Australian car 
insurance market, we fight for new customers 
by presenting a superior value proposition 
based on combining lower cost car insurance 
policies with swift, dependable claims-service. 
Getting that right means we generate strong, 
loyal promoters within our customer base. 
Innovation Group helps us get it right.”
– Simon Lindsay Country Manager, Australia

Sustainability at our Core
Corporate responsibility and sustainability
“ Sustainability needs to 
be core to our business 
strategy and not just a 
bolt -on consideration, 
building our strategy 
around not just what we 
do but also the way we 
do it. As referenced by 
the Chairman in his 
statement, our recent 
signature of the “CDSB 
Statement on Fiduciary 
Duty and Climate 
Change Disclosure”, 
which was submitted by 
leading businesses to 
UN Climate Change 
talks in September, is an 
important commitment 
which underpins our 
strategic intent.”
Andrew Roberts
Chief Executive Officer
Innovation Group plc
Innovation Group has set out a vision for  
itself which is to have ‘Sustainability at our Core’. 
A brief summary of the eight principles that 
underpin this are set out below. 
In addition, the Group has produced a separate 
Sustainability report for financial year ended 
30 September 2014.
For the full report on the actions we are taking  
to realise our vision, as well as the risks and 
opportunities these represent to the business, 
please see link below.
  Our Sustainability report can be found at: 
www.innovation-group.com/sustainability
The following documents are also available  
at this link:
• GHG Emissions Inventory report (providing 
further details about our carbon emissions, 
including the methodology used, as well as a 
summary of our carbon abatement plan and 
carbon offsets purchased).
• UN Global Compact Communication  
on Progress.
• Sustainability policy.
• Anti-Bribery policy.
• Code of Conduct.
Theme 1: Impacts on society
The Group recognises that it must act in a 
responsible and ethical manner which respects 
the societies in which we operate. We have 
developed and implemented relevant policies, 
procedures and training to ensure that we 
protect these communities. We also run a 
number of charity giving and community 
programmes across the Group and have 
established objectives to support local 
communities in our Sustainability Strategy.
Acting with integrity is one of our core values 
and is central to everything we do as a Group. 
Fraud, bribery and corruption are not only illegal 
but also represent a significant reputational and 
financial risk. It is Innovation Group’s policy to 
conduct business in an honest way, and without 
the use of corrupt practices or acts of bribery  
as a means to obtain an unfair advantage.  
Our Anti-Bribery policy is available on our 
website and mandatory Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption training has been rolled out globally.
Our business principles concerning all human 
rights issues e.g. discrimination, child labour 
and forced labour are documented in the 
Company Code of Conduct available online. 
These commitments are reaffirmed in our 
Sustainability report as well as in our submission 
to the United Nations Global Compact.
Theme 2: Impacts on  
the environment
We consider that our business poses relatively 
low risk to the environment and societies in  
which we operate. Some specialist Divisions  
within the UK business do present a slightly  
higher risk where we own elements of the  
supply chain (e.g. arboriculture, ground works  
and drainage services). However, in the UK 
business, and Stuttgart office in Germany,  
we have Environmental Management Systems 
in place to ensure than we understand our 
significant aspects and minimise our impact  
on the environment. 
We aim to comply with all applicable environmental 
legislation and other requirements, to prevent 
pollution and to continually improve our 
performance globally. Our full Sustainability  
policy, which meets the requirements of ISO 
14001, can be found on our website.

Theme 3: Carbon emissions
Carbon is our number one Sustainability 
concern. Any organisation working in the 
insurance sector is well aware that climate 
change is already having, and will continue to 
have, a profound impact on our sector. Our 
stakeholder engagement activities have 
confirmed that this issue is a matter of great 
concern to many key parties including our CEO, 
our senior management team, employees 
and customers.
We have aligned our carbon reporting process 
to the requirements of both the Green House 
Gas Protocol and the Climate Disclosure 
Standards Board (‘CDSB’) Climate Change 
Reporting Framework. We have adopted a 
financial control approach to setting the 
boundary of our carbon footprint and FY13 
has been set as our base year1.
The quantity of emissions in tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) resulting from 
activities for which the Group is responsible has 
been calculated for year ended 30 September 
2014 and is detailed in Appendix 3 on page 130:
Our Scope 1 & 2 emissions for year ending 
30 September 2014 were 10,180 tCO 2e 
compared with 10,734 tCO 2e1 for our base year 
ended 30 September 2013. Our intensity 
performance for FY14 was 3.45 tCO 2e per FTE. 
This is a 15.7% reduction against our base year 
intensity ratio of 4.09 tCO2e per FTE¹. This is 
particularly good news as it appears that we 
have not only achieved the target we set to 
reduce our emissions by 6% per FTE by FY15 
but we have also achieved the 15% per FTE 
reduction target we set for FY20 3. However,  
as noted below, we will be carrying out an 
independent external audit in early 2015 to 
further validate this data. We also observe that 
the milder weather in many of our locations 
have contributed to this achievement and are 
not complacent about the need to seek out 
further measures to deliver a sustained 
reduction in our overall emissions.
Note 1 – This base year figure has been recalculated from the figures  
in our FY13 Annual Report and Accounts. The recalculated figure  
now includes emissions for Crashworth Limited and LAS Claims 
Management Limited which were acquired on 31 January and 13 March 
2014. The recalculation has been completed in line with the GHG Protocol 
guideline. We have recalculated under the fixed base year approach where 
emissions sources from an acquired company are included both with their 
emissions in the base year (when the acquiring company didn’t control 
these sources yet) and in the current years. Emissions have also been recalculated for the entire year (all-year option), rather than only for the remainder 
of the reporting period after the structural change occurred (the pro-rata option). Further detail is available in our GHG Emissions Inventory report at this 
link: http://www.innovation-group.com/sustainability.
Note 2 – We reported the purchase of 828 tCO 2e for FY13 in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts. However, we later doubled our offset 
commitment and purchased a further 828 tCO 2e to account for 12% of the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions for FY13.
Note 3 –Whilst we have a high degree of confidence in the data reported, and have completed several internal checks and audits of the figures and 
evidence for each region, we have decided to arrange an external audit by an independent third party in Q1 of 2015 to verify FY13 and FY14 figures. 
Further detail is available in our separate GHG Emissions Inventory report online.
We have now achieved3 the Group’s  
global carbon intensity reduction  
targets set last year to:
Reduce our full time equivalent Scope 1  
and Scope 2 emissions intensity (tCO 2e/FTE) 
by 6% by the end of FY15 against a FY13 base 
year. Extend this reduction to achieve 15%  
by the end of FY20. 32
The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Theme 4: Employee engagement
As a Group we employ over 3,000 people in 14 
countries, all of whom contribute to the success 
of our business. As required by legislation, we 
report the split of our employees as detailed in 
Appendix 4 on page 131.
Our employment policies meet the 
requirements of the local jurisdictions that we 
operate in. We do not discriminate on any basis 
and we encourage our people to speak out if 
they believe something is wrong. We operate  
a whistleblowing telephone hotline and a 
web-based reporting whistleblowing service.
We respect the rights of our employees and 
ensure that all are given a fair wage, that all have 
the right to organise and that none shall be 
subject to any form of discrimination whilst in 
employment with Innovation Group. Further 
information on all of these topics can be found 
within our Sustainability report.
We have sent questionnaires to all employees 
to record their feelings and opinions around 
sustainability issues and encourage suggestions 
to improve our performance in this area. 93% 
of those employees that responded agree that 
sustainability is important and 90% feel that 
Innovation Group has a responsibility to care  
for the environment and its local communities. 
Our other sustainability activities, therefore, 
whilst making business sense in their own right, 
are also aligned to the interests of our most 
valuable asset – our people.
Sustainability at our Core
Corporate responsibility and sustainability
Theme 3: Carbon emissions continued
In addition to reporting our Scope 1 & 2 
emissions as required by legislation, we think 
it is appropriate to also report our Scope 3 
emissions from business travel. In FY13 the  
total Scope 1, 2 and 3 intensity performance 
was 5.31 tCO 2e per FTE1. This has reduced to 
4.66 tCO2e per FTE in FY14 which represents a 
12.24% reduction. We have also achieved a 
reduction in our absolute emissions of Scope 1, 
2 and 3 emissions of 1.4% despite organic 
growth against our recalculated base year2. 
The Group has established a range of 
actions across the Greenhouse Gas 
Management Hierarchy
• We have developed and implemented a 
Carbon Abatement Plan with targets in each 
region. This has helped us to achieve our 
reduction targets ahead of schedule.
• We have, for the first year, submitted our 
complete carbon emissions data for 
assessment through the CDP (formerly 
Carbon Disclosure Project), an international, 
not-for-profit organisation providing the only 
global system for companies and cities to 
measure, disclose, manage and share vital 
environmental information. We received  
a disclosure score of 80 (out of a possible  
100 points).
• We have developed an innovative new service 
which focuses on preventing property claims 
arising, therefore reducing emissions 
associated with the claim process.
• Last year we doubled up on our previous 
target of offsetting 6% of our emissions  
and have now offset 12% of our FY13 
emissions3. This was achieved through a 
Carbon Fix Foundation endorsed and Ashden 
award winning, gold standard premium quality 
carbon credits clean cook stove scheme in 
Kampala, Uganda. In addition, we have 
committed to purchase 2,890 tCO 2e to 
compensate for 20% of the FY14 footprint.
• We are also working with our supply chain 
members in Subsidence Management 
Services Division (within UK Property) to 
support them to calculate and report their 
carbon emissions.
Note 1 – This base year figure has been recalculated from the figures in our FY13 Annual Report and Accounts. The recalculated figure now includes 
emissions for Crashworth Limited and LAS Claims Management Limited which were acquired on 31 January and 13 March 2014. The recalculation 
has been completed in line with the GHG Protocol guideline. We have recalculated under the fixed base year approach where emissions sources 
from an acquired company are included both with their emissions in the base year (when the acquiring company didn’t control these sources yet) 
and in the current years. Emissions have also been recalculated for the entire year (all-year option), rather than only for the remainder of the 
reporting period after the structural change occurred (the pro-rata option). Further detail is available in our GHG emissions inventory report at this 
link: http://www.innovation-group.com/sustainability.
Note 2 – Whilst we have a high degree of confidence in the data reported, and have completed several internal checks and audits of the figures and 
evidence for each region, we have decided to arrange an external audit by an independent third party in Q1 of 2015 to verify FY13 and FY14 figures. 
Further detail is available in our separate GHG Emissions Inventory report online.
Note 3 – We reported the purchase of 828 tCO 2e for FY13 in last year’s annual report. However, we later doubled our offset commitment and 
purchased a further 828 tCO 2e to account for 12% of the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions for FY13. 33

Theme 6: Supply chain management
Suppliers of our Subsidence Management 
Services Division (within UK Property) are 
required to report their annual carbon emissions 
via the web-based SmartCarbon™ tool as part 
of their contractual obligations. Through this 
system we can assist our supply chain partners 
to reduce their emissions. We plan to expand 
this programme across the rest of our UK 
business, European business and then globally, 
as detailed in our strategy.
Theme 7: Innovation
We have continued to act upon our strategy 
of embedding innovation for sustainability 
into our business through our Kairos team 
of high calibre employees. This team have 
created a new service which focuses on 
preventing property claims arising and the 
potential impacts that are associated with 
claims resolution.
Theme 5: All stakeholders
We have continued to engage with our 
stakeholders to ensure that we are recognising 
and acting upon the most important areas of 
sustainability according to the people who 
are most important to us. We have used the 
results of our stakeholder engagement 
programme to develop our first materiality 
matrix which has informed our ever evolving 
Sustainability Strategy.
Theme 8: Governance
• We have maintained our commitment to the 
United Nations Global Compact. This includes 
our commitment to Human Rights, Labour, 
Environment and Anti-Corruption.
• We have maintained our listing on the 
FTSE4Good index for FY14.
• We were scored as being grade B (scale of 
A-E) by the Ethical Investment Research 
Service (EIRIS) Ltd following their review of 
our ESG profile during FY14 in a sector 
specific ranking indicating that, at this time, 
we were within the top 20% of Software and 
Computer Services Companies globally for 
ESG performance.
• Innovation Group Subsidence Management 
Services Division (with UK Property) has been 
awarded Gold standard by Investors in People 
for FY 2014 ahead of target.
“ FTSE Group confirms 
that Innovation Group 
has been independently 
assessed according to 
the FTSE4Good criteria 
and at the September 
2014 review satisfied

the FTSE4Good Index 
Series. The Supersector 
relative score places 
Innovation Group in the 
86th percentile (where 
100 is the highest). The 
Supersector relative 
score provides an 
indication of how each 
company on the index 
scores relative to others 
in its Supersector.

Directors and their interests
A	list	of	the	present	directors	of	the	Company	is	given	on	pages	34 	and	35.
The	interests	in	the	Company	of	the	directors	in	office	at	the	year-end	are	set	out	in	the	Directors’	Remuneration	report	on	pages	53 	 
to	61. 	All	of	the	Non-executive	Directors	are	considered	to	be	independent.	James	Morley	is	currently	the	Senior	Independent	Director.
Andy	Roberts,	Chris	Harrison	and	David	Thorpe,	offer	themselves	for	re-election	at	the	forthcoming	Annual	General	Meeting	in	March	
2015. 	Lewis	Miller	has	been	put	forward	for	re-election	in	March	2015. 	The	Board	believes	that	these	Directors	should	be	re-elected	as	
their	participation	and	experience	within	the	industry	and	markets	in	which	the	Group	operates	adds	considerably	to	the	Group’s	overall	
ability to deliver its objectives.
Directors’ liabilities
The	Company	has	granted	an	indemnity	to	its	Directors	against	all	liability	in	respect	of	proceedings,	whether	civil	or	criminal,	in	respect	of	
alleged	negligence,	default,	breach	of	duty,	breach	of	trust	or	otherwise	in	which	judgement	is	given	in	a	Director’s	favour	or	in	which	such	
Director	is	acquitted	or	in	defending	or	settling	any	such	proceedings	which	are	otherwise	disposed	of	on	terms	previously	agreed	with	
the	Board	or	on	terms	otherwise	approved	by	the	Board	without	a	finding	or	admission	of	negligence,	default,	breach	of	duty	or	breach	of	
trust	on	the	Director’s	part	brought	by	third	parties,	subject	to	the	conditions	set	out	in	s234 	of	the	Companies	Act	2006. 	Such	qualifying	
third	party	indemnity	provision	was	in	force	throughout	the	period	and	remains	in	force	as	at	the	date	of	approving	the	Directors’	report.
Appointment of Directors
Directors	may	be	appointed	by	the	Company	by	ordinary	resolution	or	by	the	Board.	A	director	appointed	by	the	Board	holds	office	only	
until	the	next	Annual	General	Meeting	and	is	not	taken	into	account	in	determining	the	directors	who	are	to	retire	by	rotation	at	that	
meeting.	Unless	and	until	otherwise	determined	by	ordinary	resolution,	the	number	of	directors	shall	not	be	less	than	two	and	shall	not	be	
subject to any maximum.
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The	statements	of	compliance	with	the	principles	of	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code	on	Corporate	Governance	(the	‘Code’)	
published	by	the	Financial	Reporting	Council	(“FRC”)	in	September	2012, 	as	required	by	DTR	7.1, 	are	set	out	on	page	39. 	The	Board	
considers	that	it	has	complied	with	the	provisions	of	the	Code	during	the	financial	year	and	to	the	date	of	the	signing	of	the	 
Directors’	report.
Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7
The	compliance	statement	on	page	40	complies	with	sub-sections	2.1; 	2.2(1); 	2.3(1); 	2.5; 	2.7; 	and	2.10 	of	Rule	7	of	the	UK	Listing	Authority	
Disclosure	Rules.	The	information	required	to	be	disclosed	by	sub-section	2.6 	of	Rule	7	is	shown	in	the	Corporate	Governance	report	on	
pages	40	to	43 	and	is	incorporated	in	this	corporate	governance	statement	by	reference.
Disabled Employees
The	Group	is	committed	to	a	policy	of	recruitment	and	promotion	on	the	basis	of	aptitude	and	ability	without	discrimination.	The	Group	
gives	full	consideration	to	applications	for	employment	from	disabled	persons	where	the	requirements	of	the	job	can	be	adequately	
fulfilled	by	a	handicapped	or	disabled	person.	Where	existing	employees	become	disabled,	it	is	the	Group’s	policy	wherever	practicable	to	
provide continuing employment under normal terms and conditions and to provide training and career development and promotion to 
disabled	employees	wherever	appropriate.
Our Relationship with Shareholders
The	Board	recognises	the	significance	of	effective	communication	with	both	institutional	and	private	investors,	and	the	need	to	respond	
promptly to queries received.
During	the	year	the	Chief	Executive	Officer	and	Group	Finance	Director	held	presentations	for,	and	attended	meetings	with,	analysts	 
and	institutional	shareholders.	The	Senior	Independent	Director	attends	sufficient	meetings	to	develop	a	balanced	view	of	shareholders’	
needs.	In	addition	the	Chairman	and	Senior	Independent	Director	have	notified	themselves	to	all	major	shareholders	and	offered	
themselves	as	an	alternative	point	of	contact	for	any	matters	of	concern.
A	large	amount	of	investor	information	is	available	from	the	Group’s	website	(www.innovation-group.com).	This	includes:	
• The	Group’s	published	interim	and	annual	financial	statements;	
• Material	presented	at	institutional	investor	meetings;	
• A	library	of	stock	exchange	notices	issued	by	the	Group;	and	
• Other	information	on	the	Group	such	as	press	releases	and	contact	details.
The	annual	general	meeting	is	also	used	as	a	forum	to	introduce	the	directors	to	shareholders	and	to	take	questions	from	investors.	 
All	Executive	and	Non-executive	Directors	attended	the	annual	general	meeting	held	in	March	2014.
The	Directors	meet	the	Group’s	brokers	to	discuss	items	raised	by	shareholders	and	feedback	from	the	analysts	attending	the	interim	
and	annual	presentations	is	also	collated	by	the	Group’s	advisors	and	reviewed	by	the	Directors.	The	Directors	also	receive	copies	of	
analyst	coverage	as	and	when	it	is	released.

The	Directors	propose	a	final	dividend	for	the	year	of	0.2p 	per	share	(2013: 	nil).	An	interim	dividend	of	0.1p 	per	share	was	paid	in	June	2014 	
(2013: 	nil).
Dividend rights
Holders	of	the	Company’s	ordinary	shares	may,	by	ordinary	resolution,	declare	dividends	but	may	not	declare	dividends	in	excess	of	the	
amount	recommended	by	the	directors.	The	Board	of	directors	may	also	pay	interim	dividends.	No	dividend	may	be	paid	other	than	out	 
of	profits	available	for	distribution.
If	a	dividend	remains	unclaimed	for	12 	years,	from	the	date	when	it	became	due	for	payment,	it	shall,	if	the	Board	of	Directors	so	resolves,	
be	forfeited	and	cease	to	remain	a	liability	of	the	Company.
Voting rights
The	Company’s	articles	of	association	provide	that	a	resolution	put	to	the	vote	of	a	general	meeting	shall	be	decided	on	a	show	of	hands	
unless,	before	or	on	the	declaration	of	the	result	of	a	vote	on	the	show	of	hands	or	on	the	withdrawal	of	any	other	demand	for	a	poll,	a	 
poll	is	duly	demanded.	On	a	poll,	each	shareholder	who	is	entitled	to	vote	and	is	present	in	person	or	by	proxy	has	one	vote	for	every	share	
held.	In	addition,	the	articles	of	association	allow	persons	appointed	as	proxies	of	shareholders	entitled	to	vote	at	general	meetings	to	
vote	on	a	show	of	hands,	as	well	as	to	vote	on	a	poll	and	attend	and	speak	at	general	meetings.
Save	as	otherwise	provided	by	the	Company’s	articles	of	association,	two	persons	present	in	person	or	by	proxy	(not	being	corporate	
representatives	or	proxies	appointed	by	the	same	member)	are	entitled	to	vote	shall	be	a	quorum	for	any	general	meeting.
On	a	show	of	hands	at	a	general	meeting	of	the	Company,	every	holder	of	shares	present	in	person	and	entitled	to	vote	shall	have	one	
vote	and	on	a	poll,	every	member	present	in	person	or	by	proxy	and	entitled	to	vote	shall	have	one	vote	for	every	ordinary	share	held.	 
The	notice	of	the	general	meeting	specifies	deadlines	for	exercising	voting	rights	either	by	proxy	notice	or	present	in	person	or	by	proxy	 
in	relation	to	resolutions	to	be	passed	at	the	general	meeting.	All	proxy	votes	are	counted	and	the	numbers	for,	against	or	withheld	in	
relation	to	each	resolution	are	announced	at	the	annual	general	meeting	and	published	on	the	Company’s	website	after	the	meeting.
Ordinary Share capital 
There	are	no	restrictions	on	the	transfer	of	ordinary	shares	in	the	Company	other	than:	
• Certain	restrictions	may	from	time	to	time	be	imposed	by	laws	and	regulations	(for	example,	insider	trading	laws);	and	
• Pursuant	to	the	model	code	on	Directors’	Dealings	in	Securities	and	the	Listing	Rules	of	the	Financial	Conduct	Authority	whereby,	 
in	accordance	with	the	Company’s	share	dealing	code,	certain	employees	of	the	Company	require	the	approval	of	the	Company	to	 
deal	in	the	Company’s	securities.
There	have	been	no	changes	in	share	capital,	other	than	the	use	of	shares	to	perform	acquisitions	and	the	exercise	of	options	under	
employee	incentive	plans.	There	have	been	no	purchases	by	the	Company	of	its	own	shares	and	the	Company	holds	no	shares	in	treasury.
Articles of Association 
The	following	description	summarises	certain	provisions	of	the	Company’s	articles	of	association	and	applicable	English	law.	 
This	summary	is	qualified	in	its	entirety	by	reference	to	the	Companies	Act	2006 	of	England	and	Wales	and	the	Company’s	articles	 
of association.
The	articles	of	association	can	be	obtained	from	the	Company	Secretary.
The	Company	is	a	public	limited	company	under	the	laws	of	England	and	Wales.	The	Company	is	registered	in	England	and	Wales	under	
the	name	“The	Innovation	Group	plc”	with	the	registration	number	3256771.
All	of	the	Company’s	ordinary	shares	are	fully	paid.	Accordingly,	no	further	contribution	of	capital	may	be	required	by	the	Company	from	
the	holders	of	such	shares.	English	law	specifies	that	any	alteration	to	the	articles	of	association	must	be	approved	by	a	special	resolution	
of	the	shareholders. 38
The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
At	30 	September	2014, 	the	Company’s	issued	share	capital	comprised	a	single	class	of	shares	referred	to	as	ordinary	shares.	No	individual	
disclosed	carries	special	voting	rights	over	their	shareholding.
The	Company’s	articles	of	association	may	only	be	amended	by	a	special	resolution	at	a	general	meeting	of	shareholders.
Authority to purchase own shares
The	Company	purchased	none	of	its	own	shares	during	the	year.	At	the	end	of	the	year,	the	Directors	had	authority,	under	the	
shareholders’	resolutions	dated	20 	March	2013, 	to	make	market	purchases	of	the	Company’s	own	shares	up	to	a	maximum	of	97,385,504 	
(being	10% 	of	issued	share	capital	as	at	21 	February	2013).
A	resolution	will	be	proposed	as	a	special	resolution	at	the	2015 	Annual	General	Meeting	which	will	continue	to	give	the	Company	
authority	to	use	its	available	cash	resources	to	acquire	up	to	10% 	of	its	own	shares	in	the	market	for	either	cancellation	or	to	hold	them	as	
treasury	shares.	The	Directors	will	continue	to	use	this	authority	only	after	careful	consideration,	taking	into	account	market	conditions	
prevailing	at	the	time,	other	investment	opportunities,	appropriate	gearing	levels,	and	the	overall	position	of	the	Company.	The	Directors	
only	purchase	such	shares	after	taking	into	account	the	effects	on	earnings	per	share	and	the	benefits	for	shareholders.
On	20 	March	2013 	the	shareholders	granted	the	directors	authority	to	allot	equity	shares	up	to	a	maximum	nominal	amount	equal	to	
£6,492,367, 	save	in	respect	of	the	issue	of	equity	securities	for	cash,	either	by	way	of	rights	issue	or	in	any	other	way,	where	the	maximum	
nominal	amount	was	restricted	to	£973,855 	(representing	5%	of	the	Company’s	issued	share	capital	at	21 	February	2013. 	The	Company	
will	consult	with	major	shareholders	in	the	event	usage	of	the	authority	to	allot	equity	shares	for	cash	would	result	in	more	than	7.5%	of	the	
Company’s	issued	share	capital	being	allotted	with	a	rolling	three	year	period.
Authority to allot equity shares
Under	section	549	of	the	Companies	Act	2006 	directors	are,	with	certain	exceptions,	unable	to	allot	the	Company’s	ordinary	shares	or	
securities	convertible	into	the	Company’s	ordinary	shares	without	the	authority	of	the	shareholders	in	a	general	meeting.	In	addition,	
section	561 	of	the	Companies	Act	2006 	imposes	further	restrictions	on	the	issue	of	equity	securities	(as	defined	in	the	Companies	Act	
2006 	which	include	the	Company’s	ordinary	shares	and	securities	convertible	into	ordinary	shares)	which	are,	or	are	to	be,	paid	up	wholly	in	
cash	and	not	first	offered	to	existing	shareholders.	The	Company’s	articles	of	association	allow	shareholders	to	authorise	directors	for	a	
period	specified	in	the	relevant	resolution	to	allot	(i)	relevant	securities	generally	up	to	an	amount	fixed	by	the	shareholders	and	(ii)	equity	
securities	for	cash	other	than	in	connection	with	a	pre-emptive	offer	up	to	an	amount	specified	by	the	shareholders	and	free	of	the	
pre-emption	restriction	in	section	561.
The	authority	to	allot	relevant	securities	fixed	by	shareholders	at	the	AGM	in	2014 	as	set	out	otherwise	than	for	cash	and	for	cash	 
were	both	in	line	with	corporate	governance	guidelines.	The	directors	consider	it	desirable	to	have	the	maximum	flexibility	permitted	 
by	corporate	governance	guidelines	to	respond	to	market	developments	and	to	enable	allotments	to	take	place	to	finance	business	
opportunities	as	they	arise.	In	order	to	retain	such	maximum	flexibility,	the	directors	propose	to	renew	the	authorities	granted	by	
shareholders	in	2014 	at	this	year’s	AGM.	Further	details	of	such	proposals	are	provided	in	the	2015 	notice	of	AGM.
Change in Control
Within	the	Recruitment,	Retention	and	2011 	Plans	are	change	of	control	clauses	which	will	result	in	the	pro-rata	vesting	of	the	awards	
subject	to	certain	conditions	being	achieved	at	the	point	that	change	of	control	takes	place.	There	are	no	shares	options	or	awards	issued	
under	share	schemes	with	rights	not	directly	exercisable	by	employees	as	the	shares	are	only	issued	when	the	share	option	or	award	is	
exercised	by	the	employee.	The	Company	is	not	aware	of	any	agreements	between	shareholders	that	may	result	in	any	restriction	on	the	
transfer	of	securities	or	in	regards	to	any	voting	rights.
There	are	no	agreements	between	the	Company	and	its	Directors	or	employees	providing	for	compensation	for	loss	of	office	or	
employment	(whether	through	resignation,	purported	redundancy	or	otherwise)	that	occurs	because	of	a	takeover	bid.	The	agreements	
between	the	Company	and	its	Directors	for	compensation	for	loss	of	office	are	given	in	the	Directors’	Remuneration	Policy	report	see	
page 53.
The	Group	has	a	facility	with	Barclays	Bank	that	would	require	all	outstanding	amounts	to	be	repaid	upon	a	change	in	control,	being	a	
multi-currency	revolving	credit	facility	of	£50.0m,	entered	into	in	September	2014 	of	which	£23.3m 	was	utilised	as	at	30 	September	2014.
Going concern
After	making	appropriate	enquiries,	the	Directors	have	formed	a	judgement,	at	the	time	of	approving	the	financial	statements,	that	 
there	is	a	reasonable	expectation	that	the	Group	has	adequate	resources	to	continue	in	operational	existence	for	the	foreseeable	future.	
The	Group	held	£56.9m	of	net	cash	at	30 	September	2014 	(2013: 	£26.9m) 	and	has	access	to	borrowing	facilities	with	its	bankers	that	are	 
in	place	until	September	2019.
The	Group	tests	all	banking	covenants	on	a	quarterly	basis	and	reports	on	these	covenants	to	its	bankers.	Forward	looking	covenants	 
are	also	tested	based	on	the	Group’s	financial	forecasts	and	these	forecasts	indicated	continued	compliance	based	on	the	2015 	Budget.
For	these	reasons,	the	Directors	have	adopted	the	going	concern	basis	in	preparing	the	financial	statements.
Responsibilities of Directors
Financial statements and accounting records
Company	law	in	England	and	Wales	requires	the	Directors	to	prepare	financial	statements	for	each	financial	year	which	give	a	true	and	fair	
view	of	the	state	of	affairs	of	the	Group	at	the	end	of	the	financial	year	and	of	the	profit	or	loss	of	the	Group	for	that	period.

position	of	the	Group	and	to	enable	them	to	ensure	that	the	financial	statements	comply	with	the	Companies	Act	2006 	and	Article	4	of

report	and	accounts,	taken	as	a	whole,	as	fair,	balanced	and	understandable	and	that	it	provides	the	information	necessary	for	
shareholders	to	assess	the	Group’s	performance,	business	model	and	strategy.
Neither	the	Group	nor	the	directors	accept	any	liability	to	any	person	in	relation	to	the	annual	report	except	to	the	extent	that	such	liability	
could	arise	under	English	law.	Accordingly,	any	liability	to	a	person	who	has	demonstrated	reliance	on	any	untrue	or	misleading	statement	
or	omission	shall	be	determined	in	accordance	with	section	90A	and	schedule	10A 	of	the	Financial	Services	and	Markets	Act	2000.

The Board of Innovation Group plc
The role of the Board
The	Board	is	responsible	to	shareholders	for	the	proper	management	of	the	Group	and	for	its	system	of	corporate	governance.	 
The	Board	meets	regularly	and	prior	to	significant	decisions	being	taken.
The	Non-executive	Chairman	and	Non-executive	Directors	meet	regularly	as	a	group	without	the	executives	present	and	at	least	 
once	a	year	without	the	Chairman	present.	During	the	year	there	were	eleven	scheduled	meetings,	including	three	Board	calls.
In	advance	of	each	meeting,	each	Director	receives	documentation	concerning	the	Group’s	financial	performance,	an	update	on	 
legal	matters	and	other	information	to	enable	decisions	to	be	taken	on	the	resolutions	proposed.
These	resolutions	are	made	with	reference	to	a	formal	schedule	of	matters	reserved	for	Board	approval,	which	include:
• the	Group’s	long-term	objectives,	commercial	strategy	and	related	plans;
• approval	of	interim	and	final	financial	statements	and	reports;
• the	Group’s	acquisition	and	divestment	policy	and	any	transactions	arising;
• approval	of	major	capital	expenditure	projects	and	consideration	of	significant	financing	matters;
• approval	of	all	circulars,	listing	particulars	and	press	releases	concerning	matters	decided	by	the	Board;
• the	approval	of	the	annual	budgets;	and
• matters	concerning	the	membership	and	terms	of	reference	of	the	Board	and	its	Committees.
During	the	year,	operational	management	of	the	Group	was	delegated	to	the	Executive	Directors	and	the	Regional	Executive	Group	 
who	meet	monthly	to	discuss	and	approve	operational	matters,	on	a	region	by	region	basis,	under	a	schedule	of	matters	reserved	for	this	
forum.	From	1 	January	2015, 	operational	management	will	be	delegated	to	the	Executive	Directors	and	the	Chief	Executive	–	Business	
Services	and	Chief	Executive	–	Insurer	Business.
These	matters	include	review	of	segment	results,	project	delivery,	maintaining	customer	relationships	and	initial	due	diligence	on	 
mergers and acquisitions. 42

The composition of the Board
During	the	financial	year,	the	Board	comprised	two	executive	Directors	and	three	Non-executive	Directors,	including	a	Non-executive	
Chairman,	all	of	whom	served	throughout	the	year	and	to	the	date	of	the	signing	of	the	annual	report.
The	structure	of	the	Board	is	aligned	with	the	recommendations	of	the	Code	which	for	large	companies	requires	a	board	structure	 
where	at	least	half	the	members	of	the	Board	excluding	the	Chairman	are	independent	Non-executive	directors.	The	executive	and	
Non-executive	Directors	are	equal	members	of	the	Board	and	have	collective	responsibility	for	the	direction	of	the	Group.
The	Board	has	concluded	that	the	Non-executive	Directors	comprising	David	Thorpe	(Non-executive	Chairman),	James	Morley	 
(Senior	Independent	Director)	and	Chris	Harrison	are	independent	of	management	in	character,	judgement	and	opinion.	In	coming	to	 
this	assessment,	the	Board	has	taken	into	consideration	a	number	of	factors,	which	include	the	criteria	contained	in	the	Code	which	are	
whether,	the	Director:	
• has	been	an	employee	of	the	Group	within	the	last	five	years;
• has,	or	has	had	within	the	last	three	years,	a	material	business	relationship	with	the	Group;
• has	received	or	receives	additional	remuneration	from	the	Group	apart	from	a	director’s	fee;
• has	close	family	ties	with	any	of	the	Group’s	advisors,	Directors	or	senior	employees;
• holds	cross-directorships	or	has	significant	links	with	other	directors	through	involvement	in	other	companies	or	bodies;
• represents	a	significant	shareholder;	and
• has	served	on	the	Board	for	more	than	nine	years	from	the	date	of	their	first	election.
The	Chairman	is	responsible	for	the	effective	operation,	leadership	and	governance	of	the	Board.	He	is	also	responsible	for	setting	the	
agenda,	style	and	tone	of	Board	discussions.
Balance of the Board 
The	skills	and	experience	of	each	Director	is	included	in	their	biographies	on	pages	34 	and	35. 	The	Nomination	Committee	considers	this	
at	each	meeting	in	order	to	ensure	that	the	Board	contains	the	capabilities	required	to	meet	the	needs	of	the	business,	its	strategic	goals	
and	the	activities	it	performs	to	achieve	them.	At	the	balance	sheet	date,	this	is	considered	to	have	been	met.	Further	disclosure	of	the	
policies	of	the	Nomination	Committee	is	shown	on	page	44.
Re-election of Directors
All	Directors,	in	accordance	with	the	Code,	will	submit	themselves	for	re-election	at	least	once	every	three	years	and	at	the	first	annual	
general	meeting	following	their	appointment	as	a	director.
Performance evaluation of the Board
The	Code	requires	each	company	to	conduct	performance	evaluations	of	its	board,	committees	and	individual	directors	and	to	report	 
on	these	evaluations.	Evaluations	of	the	individual	directors,	the	Board,	the	Nomination,	Remuneration	and	Audit	Committees	were	
performed	during	the	year	through	the	use	of	tailored	questionnaires.	The	results	of	each	questionnaire	were	reviewed	and	reported	 
back	to	the	Board	and	relevant	committee	by	the	chairman	of	that	body.	In	each	case,	any	specific	strengths	and	perceived	weaknesses	
were	highlighted	and	discussed,	and	any	resultant	requirements	documented.
The	performance	evaluation	of	each	individual	Director,	including	the	Chairman,	was	also	performed	during	the	year	by	the	completion	 
by	each	Board	member	and	the	Company	secretary	of	a	series	of	questionnaires.	The	results	of	these	were	communicated	to	the	Board	
by	the	Chairman,	or	in	the	case	of	the	appraisal	of	the	Chairman,	by	the	Senior	Independent	Director,	noting	any	appropriate	actions	that	
were	required.

Letter from David Thorpe, Chairman of the Nomination Committee 
The	members	of	the	committee	are	James	Morley,	Chris	Harrison	and	I.	James	Liddiard	acts	as	secretary	to	the	Committee.	All	members	
of	the	Committee	are	considered	independent	of	management	in	the	opinion	of	the	Board.
The objective of the Nomination Committee	is	to	ensure	that	the	Board	continues	to	comprise	of	individuals	with	the	appropriate	skills	
and	knowledge	to	guarantee	the	future	success	of	the	Group	and	to	discharge	its	responsibilities	in	regards	to	Corporate	Governance.

the	Group’s	website	at:	http://www.innovation-group.com/corporate-governance.	The	Terms	of	Reference	also	include	policies	on	
gender and diversity.
Committee Meetings
The	Committee	held	one	meeting	in	the	current	year.	Only	members	of	the	Committee	are	entitled	to	be	present	at	its	meetings;	
however	the	Executive	Directors	and	external	advisors	may	be	invited	to	attend.	In	the	event	of	matters	concerning	my	membership	 
of	the	Board,	I	would	excuse	myself	from	the	meeting	at	that	time	and	the	Board’s	Senior	Independent	Director	would	take	the	chair.
Main activities of the Committee during the year
Topic Area of focus
Executive Succession We	focused	upon	the	process	for	appointment	to	the	Board	in	the	event	of	
departure	of	either	Executive	Director	or	Non-executive	Director.	On	the	
appointment	of	Jane	Hall	as	Chief	Executive	–	Business	Services	we	enacted	a	
succession	plan	to	appoint	Lewis	Miller	to	the	role	of	Group	Finance	Director.
Re-election of Directors During	the	year,	we	considered	the	re-election	of	Directors	both	for	the	AGM	in	
March	2014, 	but	also	for	the	future	AGM	in	2015.
In	considering	this,	we	took	account	of	the	fact	that	I	will	be	leaving	the	Board	in	
December	2014. 	External	advisors	have	been	engaged	to	assist	in	the	identification	
of	a	new	non-executive	director	and	Chairman	remains	in	progress	at	the	date	of	 
this	report.
Andy	Roberts,	Chris	Harrison	and	David	Thorpe	offer	themselves	for	 
re-election	in	March	2015. 	Lewis	Miller	has	been	put	forward	for	re-election	in	 
March	2015.
Diversity of the Board We	considered	the	diversity	of	the	Board	during	the	year,	in	line	with	best	practice	
developing	in	the	marketplace.
The	policy	of	the	Committee	is	to	ensure	that	the	relevant	skills	and	experience	
relevant	to	the	Group	and	its	operations	are	present	in	the	membership	of	the	Board.
We	will	continue	to	monitor	and	assess	developments	in	corporate	governance	to	ensure	that	the	structure	of	the	Board	remains	within	
the	guidelines	for	best	practice.
Effectiveness
The	committee	monitors	its	effectiveness	each	year	through	the	use	of	a	questionnaire	which	is	completed	by	each	member	and	
submitted	to	the	Company	Secretary	to	collate	and	summarise.	Any	suggestions	for	improvement	are	discussed	by	the	Committee	and	
implemented	if	it	is	agreed	that	this	will	lead	to	improvements	in	the	Committee’s	effectiveness.

Letter from Chris Harrison, Chairman of the Audit Committee 
The	members	of	the	committee	are	David	Thorpe,	James	Morley	and	myself.	James	Liddiard	acts	as	secretary	to	the	Committee.	 
All	members	of	the	Committee	are	considered	independent	of	management	in	the	opinion	of	the	Board.
The objective of the Audit Committee	is	to	provide	rigour	and	challenge	to	the	financial	reporting	process	of	the	Group,	including	
assessment	of	the	performance	of	both	the	internal	and	external	audit	functions	and	the	management	of	the	Group’s	internal	control	and	
risk	management	systems.	The	Committee	also	monitors	the	Group’s	sustainability	policies,	which,	as	reported	in	the	Group	Operational	
and	Financial	Review	are	increasingly	becoming	a	more	integral	part	of	the	Group’s	overall	strategy.	The	terms	of	reference	for	the	
committee,	which	can	be	found	at	http://www.innovation-group.com/corporate-governance,	are	formally	reappraised	on	an	annual	basis	
and	modified	as	considered	appropriate	by	the	Committee.

Conduct of Committee meetings
The	Committee	held	five	meetings	in	the	current	year.	Only	members	of	the	Committee	are	entitled	to	be	present	at	its	meetings;	
however	Ernst	&	Young	LLP ,	the	Chief	Executive	Officer,	the	Group	Finance	Director,	the	Group	Financial	Controller	and	the	Head	of	
Internal	Audit	attend	each	meeting	by	invitation	to	the	extent	that	it	is	deemed	to	be	appropriate.	On	occasion	other	members	of	
management	may	be	called	to	report	to	the	Committee.
The	Committee	also	meets	separately	with	Ernst	&	Young	LLP ,	as	further	discussed	later	in	this	letter,	and	may	meet	with	the	 
Head	of	Internal	Audit	or	the	Group	Financial	Controller	without	other	members	of	the	executive	management	team	being	present.	 
As	Chair	of	the	committee,	I	also	hold	private	meetings	with	each	of	these	parties	and	they	are	encouraged	to	consult	with	me	 
should	they	see	a need.	
Main activities of the Committee during the year
Topic Area of focus
Financial Reporting We	focused	upon	the	interim	and	annual	results	and	reports	(including	a	review	of	
matters	raised	by	the	external	auditor)	and	reported	to	the	Board	on	whether	the	
Annual	Report	and	Accounts	are	fair,	balanced	and	understandable.
We	have	also	had	significant	input	into	the	preparation	of	the	Annual	Report	and	
Accounts	in	order	to	ensure	that	this	principle	has	been	met.	
Significant accounting matters We	assessed	significant	accounting	matters	which	may	have	a	material	impact	on	
the	results	of	the	Group.
Risk Management and Internal Control We	reviewed	management’s	risk	register	and	internal	controls	reports.
Internal Audit We	approved	the	programme	of	work	for	Internal	Audit,	reviewed	Internal	Audit	
reports and proposed management actions to address any areas for improvement 
that	are	identified.
The	Committee	also	assessed	of	the	Internal	Audit	function	and	its	effectiveness.
External Audit We	assessed	the	effectiveness,	independence	and	objectivity	of	the	External	
Auditor,	Ernst	&Young	LLP ,	as	well	as	agreed	the	level	of	non-audit	fees.
Sustainability We	reviewed	the	Group’s	achievements	against	the	strategy	for	sustainability	
established	in	2013 	and	provided	input	into	the	sustainability	strategy	to	2020 	 
which	is	at	an	advanced	state	of	drafting.	We	also	reviewed	and	approved	the	 
Group	sustainability	report	at	www.innovation-group.com/sustainability,	which	is	 
a	crucial	document	for	communicating	both	our	intent	and	our	performance	to	 
our	internal	and	external	stakeholders.	
Corporate Governance We	reviewed	the	Group’s	compliance	with	the	Code.
Effectiveness We	made	assessment	of	the	effectiveness	of	the	Committee	and	its	communication	
with	management.
Outside	of	Committee	meetings,	I	and	other	members	of	the	Committee	hold	conversations	with	operational	and	financial	management	
on	matters	of	risk	and	control	during	our	periodic	Board	visits	to	key	operating	segments.	
During	the	year,	I	travelled	with	the	Board	to	the	USA	and	met	with	the	global	head	of	our	insurer	business,	executives	from	our	North	
American	business	and	since	the	year	end	travelled	to	South	Africa	to	meet	with	executives	from	that	business.	The	Board	has	also	
received	a	presentation	from	the	head	of	our	UK	property	business.
During	the	year,	the	Group	also	initiated	a	360 	degree	feedback	process,	initially	for	the	executive	directors	of	the	main	Board.	
I participated	in	this	process	which	gave	me	the	opportunity	to	meet	in	person	with	each	of	the	heads	of	our	business	units.

The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Financial Reporting
The	primary	role	of	the	Committee	in	regards	to	financial	reporting	is	to	meet	prior	to	the	release	of	financial	results	to	review	the	interim	
and	full	year	results	announcements,	in	conjunction	with	both	management	and	the	external	auditors.	
This	includes	an	assessment	of	the	appropriateness	of	the	going	concern	basis	in	the	preparation	of	the	accounts	so	as	to	be	able	to	
advise	the	Board	on	its	statement	on	page	38 	made	in	this	regard.
The	matters	that	we	consider	include:
• 	 Whether	the	annual	financial	statements	are	fair,	balanced	and	understandable	and	provide	a	depth	and	quality	of	information	
necessary	to	enable	shareholders	and	other	stakeholders	to	assess	the	Group’s	business	model	and	its	performance	against	its	stated	
strategy;	
• 	 Ensuring	the	consistent	application	of	accounting	policies	and	appropriate	disclosure	in	the	event	of	any	changes;
• 	 Material	items	where	judgements	and	estimates	have	been	applied;	and
• 	 Compliance	and	appropriate	disclosures	in	accordance	with	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards
In	the	current	year	the	committee	has	paid	particular	attention	to	the	programme	for	integration	and	reporting	for	businesses	acquired	
during	the	current	year	as	the	scale	of	the	businesses	we	have	acquired	has	increased	significantly.
The	Committee	receives	reports	from	both	the	Group	Financial	Controller	and	Ernst	&	Young	LLP	to	assist	its	deliberations	on	these	
matters.	In	addition,	as	Chairman	of	the	Committee,	I	held	a	meeting	with	the	Group	External	Audit	Partner	and	Group	Finance	Director	
immediately	prior	to	the	regional	Audit	close	meetings	and	reported	to	the	Committee	on	the	discussions	in	these	meetings.	
The	Committee	is	acutely	aware	that	despite	the	Group	having	an	increasingly	clear	and	consistent	strategy	across	the	geographies	in	
which	it	operates,	there	are	differences	in	how	the	Group	provides	its	services	to	the	property	and	motor	insurance	industries	across	
these	territories.	This,	together	with	the	Group’s	strategy	of	both	organic	and	acquisition	led	growth	gives	rise	to	a	considerable	degree	 
of complexity in certain areas. 
The	significant	matters	considered	by	the	Committee	in	relation	to	the	Annual	Report	and	Accounts	in	the	year	were:

gained	comfort	on	the	matter
Intangible	Assets	–	Capitalisation	
of	Insurer	and	Intangible	Assets	
identified	as	a	result	of	business	
acquisitions
For	a	number	of	years	the	Group	has	been	
developing	its	Insurer	software	suite	using	
internal	resources.	This	base	software	is	critical	
to	the	Group’s	software	sales	and	the	effective	
delivery	of	the	Group’s	BPS	offering	in	those	
regions	where	“Insurer	Enterprise”	has	been	
implemented. 
Judgement	is	required	to	determine	that	only	
appropriate	levels	of	cost	are	capitalised,	that	
the	rate	of	amortisation	of	this	software	is	also	
appropriate	and	that	the	carrying	value	of	the	
asset	at	each	reporting	period	is	supported	by	
the	net	present	value	of	future	cash	flows	to	
be derived from it (see Goodwill and Intangible 
Assets – Carrying value and the associated risk  
of impairment).
There	are	a	number	of	key	estimates	when	
assessing	the	valuation	of	intangible	assets	
recognised	upon	the	acquisition	of	business	
combinations,	which	include	continuation	of	
contracts,	intellectual	property	acquired	and	
the	cash	flows	generated	from	them.	
We	enquired	into	the	work	carried	out	during	
the	year	so	as	to	satisfy	ourselves	that	only	
costs	that	have	given	rise	to	enhancements	
in	the	product	offering	have	been	capitalised	
during	the	year.	This	required	closer	scrutiny	
than	in	prior	years	as	there	have	been	a	number	
of	enhancements	at	a	regional	level	which	have	
been	undertaken	concurrently	with	first	time	
implementations	of	modules	of	the	product	 
at a regional level.
 
We	also	satisfied	ourselves	that	actual	 
software	sales	and	the	pipeline	of	potential	
sales,	together	with	the	economic	benefits	 
of	deploying	the	software	in	the	Group’s	 
BPS	offering	are	sufficient	to	support	the	
carrying	value	of	the	unamortised	cost	in	 
the	Balance	Sheet.
Management	documented	the	types	of	assets	
capitalized	as	part	of	business	combinations,	
the	assumptions	made	as	part	of	the	process.	
Given	the	materiality	of	LAS,	PwC	were	
engaged	by	management	to	advise	on	the	
fair value of intangible assets acquired as part 
of	this	combination.	We	are	satisfied	that	the	
resultant	acquisition	is	accounted	for	in	line	with	
the	Group’s	accounting	policies.

Goodwill	and	Intangible	Assets	–	
Carrying	value	and	the	associated	
risk	of	impairment
Determining	whether	the	carrying	value	of	
goodwill	and	intangible	assets	is	at	risk	of	
impairment	involves	a	number	of	estimates,	
which	includes	the	value	of	cash	flows	
estimated	to	be	generated	from	the	asset	 
in	the	future	(initially	driven	by	the	budget	for	 
the	following	financial	year)	and	the	discount	
rate	to	be	applied	to	these	cash	flows	so	that	 
an	assessment	of	their	net	present	value	can	 
be made. 
We	assess	the	anticipated	performance	of	the	
Group	and	the	associated	cash	flows	based	on	
the	approved	budget.	
We	have	assessed	the	assumptions	on	 
growth	rates	and	the	discount	rates	applied	
within	management’s	report	on	this	matter,	
paying	particular	attention	to	those	assets	
where	the	headroom	between	the	carrying	
value	of	the	asset	and	the	calculated	net	
present	value	of	estimated	future	cash	flows	 
is	most	vulnerable	to	the	assumptions	used.	 
We	are	satisfied	that	the	carrying	value	of	
intangible assets is appropriate and in line  
with	stated	accounting	policies.
Revenue	recognition	–	Software	
contracts
Software	licensing	agreements	invariably	
include complex multiple element 
arrangements and a number of judgements  
are	required	to	determine	the	elements	that	 
can	be	treated	as	revenue	and	those	which	 
need to be deferred for recognition as revenue 
in future periods. 
The	primary	judgement	is	whether	the	Group	
is able to separate recognition of revenue 
generated	on	professional	services	from	that	
on	licence	sales	as	part	of	the	same	contract,	
dependent	upon	the	substance	of	the	solution	
provided	to	the	customer	on	each	specific	
contract.	An	additional	consideration	is	if	the	
customer,	or	a	separate	third	party	provider,	
could	perform	these	professional	services.	
We	enquired	into	each	new	licensing	agreement	
entered	into	by	the	Group	during	the	year,	so	
as	to	understand	the	judgements	made	by	
management	in	arriving	at	the	level	of	revenue	
recognized	in	the	current	year.	Management’s	
treatment	was	presented	in	a	paper	considered	
by	the	committee.	
Recognising	the	inherent	subjectivity	in	certain	
of	the	judgements	made	by	management,	we	
satisfied	ourselves	that	the	level	of	revenue	
recognition	was	fair	and	in	accordance	with	the	
Group’s	disclosed	accounting	policies.
Revenue	recognition	–	Revenue	
shares	on	on-risk	contracts
There	are	a	number	of	key	estimates	that	are	
required	to	be	made	in	regards	to	establishing	
the	revenue	recognition	profile	on	revenue	
share	arrangements.	
For	the	on-risk	contracts	handled	by	the	UK	
subsidence	business,	these	include:
• 	 The	levels	of	outstanding	recoveries	to	 
be	made	on	a	portfolio	of	claims;
• 	 The	level	of	potential	increase	in	the	
settlement	value	for	open	claims	within	 
a	portfolio;	
• 	 The	projection	of	the	ultimate	settlement	
value	for	a	portfolio	of	claims;	and
• 	 The	costs	to	complete	on	a	“work-in-
progress”	run	off	book.	
For	the	on-risk	service	plans	handled	by	the	
South	African	motor	business,	these	include:
• 	 The	cancellation	rate	of	policies	sold;
• 	 The	number	of	services	taken	under	a	 
policy;	and
• 	 The	number	of	policies	that	may	lapse.	
Management’s	treatment	was	presented	in	a	
paper	considered	by	the	committee.	
Recognising	the	inherent	subjectivity	in	certain	
of	the	judgements	made	by	management,	 
we	satisfied	ourselves	that	the	level	of	revenue	
recognition	was	fair	and	in	accordance	with	the	
Group’s	disclosed	accounting	policies. 48

Matter
Judgement	and	 
estimation required
How	the	Committee	 
gained	comfort	on	the	matter
First time accounting for acquired 
businesses
Including	profits	from	acquired	businesses	
for	the	first	time	in	the	consolidated	results	
requires	appropriate	determination	of	the	
effective	date	of	acquisition,	the	balance	 
sheet	at	that	date,	and	effective	reporting	
procedures	consistent	with	the	group’s	
standard	procedures	to	be	adopted	by	the	
acquired business.
The	due	diligence	conducted	by	PwC	on	behalf	
of	the	group	into	LAS,	highlighted	a	number	of	
shortcomings	in	the	accounting	procedures	
at	LAS,	and	as	a	consequence	of	these	it	
took	longer	than	had	been	hoped	to	finalise	
the	opening	balance	sheet	of	LAS	for	the	
purposes	of	purchase	price	determination	and	
the	attribution	of	post-acquisition	profits.	In	
addition,	the	changes	necessary	to	bring	LAS’s	
accounting	into	line	with	group	procedures	had	
not	been	completed	at	the	year-end.
We	enquired	into	the	work	that	was	undertaken	
to	confirm	the	opening	balance	sheet	of	LAS	
and	supported	EY	in	their	additional	procedures	
to	satisfy	themselves	that	the	closing	balance	
was	drawn	up	in	accordance	with	group	
standards.	This	additional	work	did	give	rise	to	
adjustments	and	we	ensured	that	all	identified	
specific	errors	have	been	reflected	in	the	
consolidated accounts.
Tax	matters The	Group	operates	in	12 	countries,	with	a	
variety	of	tax	regimes	which	have	different	levels	
of	complexities	and	challenges	dependent	upon	
the	tax	environment.	
The	Group	also	sells	software	licences	
internationally,	with	the	intellectual	property	
for	this	asset	residing	in	the	United	Kingdom.	
Because	of	this	the	Group	operates	a	transfer	
pricing	policy,	which	requires	some	judgements	
over	the	level	of	benefit	derived	locally	and	the	
amount	which	can	be	charged	as	this	royalty.	
Establishing	the	carrying	value	for	potential	
tax assets and liabilities involves a number of 
estimates.	These	include	the	assessment	of	
future	profits	budgeted	in	the	next	financial	
year	that	would	enable	the	available	losses	to	
be	utilised	and	the	size	of	intangible	assets	
recognised	as	part	of	the	accounting	for	
business combinations. 
We considered a report prepared by 
management	for	the	committee	which	analysed	
the	Group	tax	charge,	highlighting	areas	of	
subjectivity	particularly	with	regard	to	the	
recognition of deferred tax assets.
 
We also considered areas of uncertainty and 
satisfied	ourselves	that,	where	appropriate,	
provision	has	been	made	for	identified	potential	
liabilities	that	are	considered	likely	to	arise.
The	change	in	disclosure	
requirements	brought	by	 
‘The	Companies	Act	2006 	
(Strategic	report	and	Directors’	
report)	Regulations	2013’, 	the	
updated	Corporate	Governance	
Code	and	the	new	legislation	on	
Directors’	remuneration	reports.	
These	changes	have	had	a	significant	impact	on	
the	presentation	of	the	Annual	Report	and	the	
information	disclosed	within	it.	As	a	company	
with	a	3 0	September	accounting	reference	date,	
in	2013 	we	were	one	of	the	early	adopters	and	
as	a	consequence	we	had	little	opportunity	to	
learn	from	the	work	of	others	in	determining	
how	to	comply	with	the	regulations.
In	2013 	we	invested	considerable	time	with	
the	intent	of	significantly	improving	our	
communication	through	the	Annual	Report	 
with	our	shareholders	and	other	stakeholders.
This	year,	with	the	help	of	our	auditors	and	from	
studies	compiled	by	the	regulator	and	other	
professional	services	firms,	we	have	reviewed	
our	2013 	Annual	Report	in	comparison	to	
emerging best practice and made a number  
of	changes	in	response	to	that	practice.
We	have	satisfied	ourselves	that	the	Annual	
Report	meets	the	requirements	of	the	
regulations	and	are	pleased	to	note	that	we	
have	not	needed	to	make	any	fundamental	
changes	as	a	result	of	the	review	referred	to	
above.	Nevertheless	we	will	continue	to	review	
and learn from emergent best practice.
All	of	the	above	are	addressed	by	discussing	with	management	the	key	judgements	made	and	the	evidence	that	supports	them	(such	as	
third	party	actuarial	valuations,	historical	performance	and	accuracy	of	forecasts). 49

Risk Management and Internal Control
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	establishing	and	maintaining	the	Group’s	system	of	internal	control	and	reviewing	its	effectiveness.	 
By	its	nature,	however,	such	a	system	is	designed	to	manage	rather	than	eliminate	the	risk	of	failure	to	achieve	business	objectives	and	
can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
As	with	any	business,	a	number	of	risk	factors	may	affect	the	Group,	its	results	and	the	Board’s	ability	to	deliver	on	its	strategy.	 
The	Group	operates	a	risk	register	and	identifies	risk	under	the	following	categories;	strategic,	financial,	operational	and	environmental.	
The	key	risks	and	mitigation	factors,	not	all	of	which	are	within	the	Directors’	control,	are	shown	on	pages	12 	to	13 	as	part	of	the	Group	
Strategic report. 
The	Audit	Committee	reviews	this	register	on	an	annual	basis,	challenging	management	on	its	completeness,	the	balance	of	the	
identified	risks	and	the	steps	taken	by	management	to	mitigate	those	risks.
There	are	a	number	of	key	elements	to	the	Group’s	internal	control	system,	which	are	targeted	at	mitigating	the	identified	key	risks.	 
These	include:	
• A	clearly	defined	management	structure	and	delegation	of	authority	to	committees	of	the	Board,	executive	committee	and	 
business	units;
• A	detailed	budgeting	process	culminating	in	approval	by	the	Board;
• Timely	and	accurate	financial	and	management	reporting	of	historical	results	and	regular	re-forecasting	of	future	profit	and	cash	 
flow	performance;
• Board	information	and	meeting	agendas	linked	to	identified	risks	to	ensure	review	of	progress	in	key	risk	areas;
• Quality,	knowledge	and	integrity	of	personnel	maintained	through	recruitment,	training	and	communication	activities;
• Day	to	day	hands-on	involvement	in	selected	business	areas	by	the	Executive	Directors;	and
• Use	of	internal	audit	and	external	professional	advisors.
This	process	is	regularly	reviewed	by	the	Board.	It	has	been	in	place	for	the	year	under	review	and	up	to	the	date	of	the	approval	of	these	
financial	statements.	
Internal Audit
The	Committee	oversees	the	resourcing	and	effectiveness	of	Internal	Audit,	which	is	consistent	with	the	size	of	the	Group.	The	Group	
function	consists	of	two	people	with	a	further	dedicated	resource	in	South	Africa.
Each	year	I	agree	the	programme	of	work	with	the	Head	of	Internal	Audit	and	this	is	then	submitted	to	the	Committee	for	review	and	
approval.	Reports	are	submitted	to	the	Committee	as	they	are	completed	and,	as	Chairman,	I	discuss	these	in	detail	with	the	Head	of	
Internal	Audit	before	each	meeting.	She	also	has	instructions	to	share	any	issues	of	significant	concern	with	me	as	they	arise.	
Progress	against	plan	is	also	reviewed	at	each	meeting	together	with	follow	up	and	action	plans	in	the	light	of	findings.	Flexibility	in	the	 
plan	is	also	maintained,	so	that	the	plan	can	be	varied	if	circumstances	suggest	the	need	for	additional	reviews.	Where	appropriate	the	
Committee	will	make	recommendations	to	management	so	as	to	ensure	that	findings	are	actioned	in	a	timely	and	effective	manner.
The	key	items	reviewed	by	Internal	Audit	during	the	financial	year	were:
• Integration	of	our	Enterprise	software	solution	with	our	financial	reporting	package	in	the	business	units	where	Enterprise	has 
been	deployed;
• Post-acquisition	integration	processes;
• Information	security	review	(a	multi-year	project	to	include	all	business	units);	and
• Data Protection in various business units.
The	Committee	are	of	the	view	that	the	Internal	Audit	function	has	operated	effectively	and	independently	throughout	the	financial	year.	
External Audit
It	is	key	that	in	order	to	ensure	an	external	audit	is	as	effective	as	possible,	that	the	appropriate	risks	are	identified	by	the	external	 
auditors	as	part	of	their	planning	process.	For	this	financial	year,	Ernst	&	Young	LLP	submitted	a	detailed	audit	plan	at	the	planning	Audit	
Committee	meeting	which	outlined	the	following	as	key	risks,	including	areas	of	accounting	capable	of	manipulation	which	were	to	be	a	
key	area	of	focus	in	their	audit	the	focus	of	their	audit:
• Revenue	recognition;
 – Revenue	recognised	under	on-risk	contracts	using	actuarial	curves
 – Software	revenue	recognition
 – Revenue	recognition	on	property	subsidence	claims
• Goodwill	impairment;
• Capitalisation	of	expenditure	in	regards	to	Innovation	Insurer	and	Enterprise;
• Accounting	for	the	acquisitions	made	by	the	group	in	the	year;	and
• Recognition	of	deferred	tax	assets.
The	above	key	risks	were	also	identified	in	the	prior	year. 50
The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Management	are	satisfied	that	the	risks	identified	by	the	auditors	are	in	line	with	those	identified	internally.
At	the	Audit	Committee	meetings	convened	to	discuss	the	interim	and	full	year	results,	I	and	the	other	members	of	the	Committee	held 
	a	private	meeting	with	the	external	auditors	so	as	to	provide	a	forum	for	them	to	provide	feedback	without	executive	management	being	
present.	Matters	discussed	include	the	quality	and	transparency	of	information	provided	by	management	to	the	auditors	as	part	of	the	
audit	process,	confirmation	that	they	have	been	able	to	perform	the	scope	of	their	audit	without	restriction	and	how	they	have	used	their	
professional	scepticism	in	regards	to	any	specific	matters	of	note.	I	also	meet	with	the	Group	Audit	Partner	during	the	year	outside	of	the	
formal	Committee	process.	The	Committee	and	the	Board	consider	auditor	objectivity	and	independence,	ensuring,	in	particular,	that	
this	is	not	compromised	where	the	auditor	provides	non-audit	services.	It	is	the	Group’s	policy	to	use	the	services	of	advisors	other	than	
the	external	auditors	for	non-audit	work	where	conflicts	may	arise	for	significant	new	assignments,	but	it	is	also	recognised	that	in	certain	
cases	the	incumbent	auditor	is	often	best	placed	to	provide	a	cost	and	time	efficient	service.	In	order	to	safeguard	and	help	ensure	
independence,	I	am	consulted	prior	to	each	major	non-audit	engagement	where	the	use	of	the	auditor	is	proposed.	During	the	financial	
year,	Ernst	&	Young	LLP	and	its	associated	member	firms	were	engaged	in	non-audit	services,	giving	rise	to	fees	of	£386,000. 	This	
compares	to	overall	audit	fees	of	£819,000. 	The	non-audit	fees,	all	of	which	met	the	criteria	above,	arose	principally	in	relation	to	
transaction	services	in	connection	with	the	fund	raising	in	March	2014.
The	Committee	considers	the	reappointment	of	the	external	auditor	on	an	annual	basis.	This	includes,	where	appropriate,	the	rotation	 
of	the	Group	Audit	Partner,	the	rotation	of	any	Audit	Partner	from	any	of	the	material	subsidiary	entities	and	ongoing	independence	of	 
the	Group.	This	is	the	tenth	year	of	Ernst	&	Young	LLP’s	appointment	as	the	Group’s	external	auditor.	The	external	auditor	is	required	to	
rotate	the	Group	Audit	Partner	every	five	years.	The	Group	Audit	Partner	changed	during	2013 	and	this	is	his	second	year	of	appointment.
The	Group	has	not	performed	a	formal	tender	process	since	the	appointment	of	Ernst	&	Young	LLP	in	2005. 	In	my	last	report	I	signalled	
that	we	would	give	serious	consideration	to	tendering	the	audit	for	the	2015 	financial	year.	However	we	have	now	decided	to	defer	that	
decision	for	a	further	12 	months.	In	reaching	this	conclusion	we	have	had	regard	to	the	fact	that	there	remains	considerable	uncertainty	
as	to	how	the	EU	rules	on	auditor	rotation	will	be	implemented	in	the	UK.	and	what	the	consequences	of	a	retender	at	this	time	would	be	
for	our	future	retendering	obligations.	We	also	do	not	consider	it	sensible	to	change	our	auditors	in	the	same	year	that	we	have	appointed	
a	new	finance	director	to	the	group,	as	announced	elsewhere	in	this	report.
The	Committee	are	of	the	view	that	the	external	auditors	have	operated	effectively	and	independently	throughout	the	financial	year.	 
We	have	reached	this	conclusion	through	enquiry	of	the	auditors	and	feedback	on	the	conduct	of	the	audit	from	local	management	in	
each	of	our	major	geographies.	
Corporate governance – Financial and Business Reporting
The	Board	is	required	to	present	a	fair,	balanced	and	understandable	assessment	of	the	Group’s	position	and	prospects	in	the	Annual	
Report	and	Accounts	and	in	interim	and	other	public	reports.	The	Board	looks	to	the	Audit	Committee	to	provide	it	with	assurance	that	 
it	has	met	this	obligation.	The	Committee	has	been	able	to	provide	this	assurance.	A	summary	of	the	Directors’	responsibilities	for	the	
financial	statements	is	set	out	on	pages	38 	to	39.
Effectiveness
The	committee	monitors	its	effectiveness	each	year	through	the	use	of	a	questionnaire	which	is	completed	by	each	member	and	
submitted	to	the	Company	Secretary	to	collate	and	summarise.	Any	suggestions	for	improvement	are	discussed	by	the	Committee

Letter from James Morley, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
Dear	Shareholder
I	am	pleased	to	take	this	opportunity	to	provide	an	overview	of	way	the	Company’s	remuneration	policy	has	been	implemented	during	 
the	2014 	financial	year	under	review.
Reporting Format
As	required	under	the	directors’	remuneration	reporting	regulations,	the	Company	sought	and	received	shareholder	
approval for a	directors’	remuneration	policy	by	way	of	a	binding	shareholder	resolution	at	the	2014 	AGM.	The	remuneration	
policy was designed to support	the	Company	in	delivering	its	long-term	strategy	and	to	achieve	alignment	between	the	directors	
and the Company’s	shareholders.	The	complete	2014 	Remuneration	policy	report	is	available	from	the	Group’s	website	at:	
http://www.innovation-group.com/corporate-governance	and	it	is	expected	that	this	will	continue	to	apply	through	to	the	2017 	
AGM when	the	regulations	will	require	the	Company	to	seek	approval	for	a	new	Remuneration	policy	report.	In	relation	to	the	year	
under review,	as	the	regulations	require,	we	have	set	out	the	remuneration	report	in	two	parts,	(i)	this	Annual	Statement,	and	(ii)	
the Annual Report	on	Remuneration	which	will	be	put	to	an	advisory	shareholder	resolution	at	the	forthcoming	AGM	in	2015.
Performance outcome for the 2014 Financial Year
As	highlighted	in	the	Group	Strategic	report,	the	year	ended	30 	September	2014 	has	been	a	further	year	of	progress	which	has	seen	
continued	growth	of	adjusted	profit	and	adjusted	earnings	per	share,	despite	economic	conditions	that	remain	challenging.	Growth	has	
been	delivered	through	a	combination	of	organic	growth	at	constant	currency	at	the	same	time	as	successfully	completing	a	number	of	
targeted	acquisitions	(e.g.	Crashworth	Limited	and	LAS).	In	addition,	the	Group	has	continued	to	generate	good	levels	of	cash	from	its	
enlarged	operations,	and	the	conversion	rate	of	EBITDA	to	operating	cash	flow	has	remained	strong.
The	financial	results	delivered	reflect	the	talents	and	skills	of	our	management	team,	our	ability	to	successfully	target	and	integrate	
complementary	businesses	and	demonstrate	the	strength	of	the	Group’s	strategy	of	operating	a	focused	software	and	services	portfolio.
With	regards	to	the	specific	levels	of	performance	delivered	during	the	financial	year	under	review	and	how	these	feed	through	to	 
the	reward	of	the	executive	team,	the	Group	achieved	year	on	year	adjusted	profit	growth	of	26% 	(38% 	at	constant	currency),	 
growth	in	revenues	of	3% 	(10% 	at	constant	currency)	and	the	conversion	of	adjusted	EBITDA	into	adjusted	operating	cash	flow	of	88%.	
Notwithstanding	the	strength	of	performance	delivered,	based	on	the	targets	set	at	the	start	of	the	financial	year,	no	bonuses	were	
payable	to	the	Chief	Executive	and	Group	Finance	Director.
The	long-term	incentive	awards	granted	under	the	2011 	Plan	to	the	Chief	Executive	and	Finance	Director	in	May	2011 	became	eligible	to	
vest	from	30 	September	2014. 	The	performance	targets	applying	to	awards	granted	under	this	Plan	required	(i)	the	three	month	average	
share	price	to	be	between	20p 	and	40p	(ii)	the	Company’s	adjusted	EPS	as	at	30 	September	2014 	to	be	at	least	1.18 	pence	and	(iii)	the	
Committee	to	be	satisfied	that	the	vesting	result	was	reflective	of	the	underlying	financial	performance	of	the	Company	over	the	
three-year	performance	period.	In	terms	of	the	performance	achieved	against	these	targets,	the	three	month	average	share	price	to	 
30 	September	2014 	was	31.32p 	(adjusted	for	the	impact	of	the	March	2014 	Open	Offer)	and	adjusted	EPS	as	at	30 	September	was	1.87p. 	
In	light	of	recording	three-year	growth	in	adjusted	profit	and	revenue	growth	of	82% 	and	19%, 	the	Committee	approved	vesting	at	this	
level	and	considered	the	performance	achieved	over	the	period	in	the	broader	economic	context	to	be	an	exceptional	result	delivered	by	
the	executive	management	team	and	approved	vesting.	These	levels	of	performance	resulted	in	61% 	of	the	maximum	vesting.
Policy for the 2015 Financial Year
With	regards	to	the	wider	application	of	the	Company’s	shareholder	approved	remuneration	policy	for	the	current	year	under	review,	 
the	key	points	to	note	include:
1.	In 	light	of	their	new	roles	following	the	Board’s	restructuring	as	set	out	in	the	Corporate	Governance	report,	the	Chief	Executive’s	salary	
will	remain	unchanged	with	his	responsibilities	continuing,	broadly,	in	their	current	form	during	the	current	financial	year.	The	Group	
Finance	Director’s	salary,	however,	will	be	revised	such	that	it	will	be	reflective	of	her	new	role	in	the	restructured	Group.	Commensurate	
with	her	revised	role	of	Chief	Executive	–	Business	Services,	her	salary	will	increase	from	£255,000 	to	£310,000 	from	1 	December	2014. 	
An	additional	allowance	of	£45,000,	which	in	tandem	with	the	enhanced	long-term	incentive	award	to	be	granted	to	her	in	the	current	
financial	year,	is	to	be	paid	to	take	account	of	the	additional	time	commitment	and	responsibilities	that	will	be	required	of	her	during	 
a	period	of	transition	when	she	will	be	fulfilling	both	her	new	role	of	Chief	Executive	–	Business	Services	and	Group	Finance	Director.
2.	There 	is	to	be	no	change	to	the	maximum	annual	bonus	opportunity	(100% 	of	salary)	for	the	current	financial	year	and	the	performance	
measures	will	remain	adjusted	profit,	operating	cash	conversion	and	revenue	growth.	Clawback	provisions	will	also	continue	to	operate	
that	enable	any	value	overpaid	to	be	reclaimed	within	one	complete	audit	cycle	in	the	event	of	a	misstatement	of	the	Company’s	
financial	results. 52
The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
3.	Awards 	will	be	granted	under	the	Company’s	existing	Performance	Share	Plan	(‘PSP’).	The	award	to	the	Chief	Executive	will	be	at	the	
‘normal’	maximum	annual	award	multiple	of	100% 	of	salary	with	the	award	to	the	Chief	Executive	–	Business	Services	to	be	granted	 
at	the	‘exceptional’	level	of	150% 	of	salary.	The	exceptional	award	is	to	be	granted	(i)	in	recognition	of	Jane	Hall’s	revised	role	within	 
the	Group	and	its	central	importance	to	driving	future	profitability	and	(ii)	the	fact	that	she	will	be	undertaking	the	dual	roles	of	Chief	
Executive	–	Business	Services	and	Group	Finance	Director	through	a	period	of	transition	until	such	time	as	a	new	Group	Finance	
Director	is	fully	in	post.	Structuring	her	remuneration	for	the	period	she	undertakes	dual	roles	via	a	cash	allowance	and	an	enhanced	
PSP	award	was	considered	more	appropriate	than	providing	a	more	substantial	additional	cash	allowance	than	the	one	detailed	above	
since	the	benefit	of	the	enhanced	PSP	will	only	be	received	if	the	Board’s	restructuring	is	executed	successfully	and	drives	shareholder	
value	over	the	long-term	such	that	the	award’s	challenging	performance	targets	are	met.	The	performance	condition	applying	to	 
the	awards	will	remain	an	equal	blend	of	adjusted	EPS	growth	and	relative	TSR	performance,	with	the	vesting	criteria	to	be	broadly	
consistent	with	the	2014 	awards	but	reflecting	the	results	of	the	consultation	in	respect	of	those	proposed	for	the	initial	awards	under	
the	2015 	Plan,	if	approved.	In	addition,	a	two	year	holding	period	will	continue	to	apply	to	the	after	tax	number	of	vested	shares.
The	awards	to	be	granted	in	the	current	financial	year	under	the	current	PSP	(approved	by	shareholders	in	2005) 	will	be	the	final	set	of	
annual	awards	eligible	to	be	granted	before	the	PSP	expires	on	28 	June	2015. 	Given	the	current	PSP	is	the	sole	long-term	incentive	plan	
currently	operated,	shareholder	approval	is	being	sought	for	a	replacement	PSP	at	the	2015 	AGM.	The	replacement	PSP	has	been	
designed	to	broadly	mirror	the	terms	of	the	existing	plan	and	has	also	been	designed	to	be	consistent	with	the	overview	of	our	approach	
to	long-term	incentive	provision	incorporated	into	the	remuneration	policy	for	which	we	received	shareholder	approval	at	the	2014 	AGM.	
A	full	summary	of	the	principal	terms	of	the	new	PSP	will	be	included	in	the	2015 	Notice	of	AGM.	It	is	anticipated	that	the	first	awards	to	be	
granted	under	the	2015 	PSP	plan,	subject	to	shareholders	approving	the	Plan	at	the	2015 	AGM,	will	take	place	in	December	2015 	following	
the	Company’s	results	announcement	for	the	year	ending	30 	September	2015. 	The	performance	targets	to	apply	to	those	awards	will	 
be	set	out	in	the	2015 	Directors’	Remuneration	report	and	it	is	intended	that	the	targets	will	be	similarly	challenging	to	those	set	for	the	
awards	to	be	granted	in	the	current	financial	year	(detailed	on	page	58).
Subject	to	the	approval	of	the	2015 	PSP	at	the	AGM,	the	Committee	continues	to	believe	that	the	Company’s	remuneration	policy	 
and	its	application	(as	summarised	above),	alongside	the	operation	of	share	ownership	guidelines,	ensure	that	the	objectives	of	the	
Executive	Directors	are	clearly	aligned	with	the	long-term	objectives	of	the	Company	and	its	shareholders.	Furthermore,	given	that	 
the	remuneration	policy	includes	a	substantial	weighting	towards	long-term	performance	and	share	ownership,	the	Committee	is	
comfortable	that	the	policy	does	not	encourage	undue	risk	taking.
Shareholder feedback
The	Committee	and	I	will	continue	to	maintain	an	open	and	constructive	dialogue	with	our	shareholders.	We	continue	to	engage	in	
appropriate	dialogue	with	our	major	investors	on	any	significant	remuneration	matters	and	the	Company’s	major	shareholders	and	
leading	shareholder	protection	bodies	will	be	consulted	in	relation	to	the	proposed	replacement	PSP .	Furthermore,	we	welcome	any	
feedback	you	may	have.
As	a	result,	the	Committee	looks	forward	to	your	support	of	our	remuneration	policy	at	the	forthcoming	Annual	General	Meeting.

Remuneration policy report
The	Company’s	Remuneration	policy	report	was	prepared	in	accordance	with	The	Large	and	Medium-sized	Companies	and	Groups	
(Accounts	and	Reports)	(Amendment)	Regulations	2013 	(‘the	Act’).	As	required	by	the	regulations,	the	Remuneration	Policy	report	was	
put	to	a	binding	shareholder	vote	at	the	2014 	AGM	and,	having	received	majority	shareholder	support	(with	the	voting	results	included	on	
page	61 	of	the	Annual	Report	on	Remuneration)	operates	with	an	‘Effective	Date’	of	1 	October	2014 	for	the	purposes	of	complying	with	
the	Act.	The	remuneration	policy	can	be	found	at	http://www.innovation-group.com/corporate-governance.	
Annual report on remuneration
This	part	of	the	report	has	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	paragraph	3 	within	Part	3 	of	The	Large	and	Medium-sized	Companies	and	
Groups	(Accounts	and	Reports)	(Amendment)	Regulations	2013 	and	9.8.6R	of	the	Listing	Rules.	The	Annual	Remuneration	report	will	 
be	put	to	an	advisory	shareholder	vote	at	the	AGM	in	2015.
Unaudited information
The	Remuneration	Committee	(the	‘Committee’)	currently	comprises	James	Morley	(Chairman),	David	Thorpe	and	Chris	Harrison	who	
are,	in	the	opinion	of	the	Board,	independent	of	management.	James	Liddiard,	CLO	and	Group	Company	Secretary,	acts	as	secretary	to	
the	Committee.	
The	Committee	is	responsible	for	recommending	the	remuneration	of	the	Executive	Directors	and	the	Chairman	to	the	Board.	The	
remuneration	of	each	of	the	Non-executive	Directors	is	determined	by	the	executive	members	of	the	Board	within	the	limits	set	out	in	
the	Articles	of	Association.	No	Director	is	involved	in	discussion	relating	to	his	or	her	remuneration.	The	terms	of	reference	of	the	
Committee	are	available	on	the	Group’s	website	at:	www.innovation-group.com/corporate-governance.
The	Committee	has	appointed	independent	remuneration	consultants	New	Bridge	Street	(‘NBS’),	a	trading	name	of	Aon	plc,	to	advise	on	
all	aspects	of	senior	executive	remuneration.	NBS	is	a	signatory	of	the	Remuneration	Consultants’	code	of	conduct	and	has	no	connection	
with	the	Group	other	than	in	the	provision	of	advice	on	executive	and	employee	remuneration	matters.	For	the	2014 	financial	year	under	
review	NBS’	total	fees	charged	were	£55,000	(including	design,	operation	and	administration	of	remuneration	policy).	Aon	plc,	through	 
its	subsidiary	Aon	Insurance	Managers	(Guernsey)	Limited,	provides	management	services	for	one	of	the	Group’s	subsidiary	companies.	 
The	Committee	regularly	reviews	the	external	advisor	relationship	and	is	comfortable	that	NBS’	advice	remains	objective	and	independent.
The	Chief	Executive,	at	the	invitation	of	the	Committee,	also	provides	guidance	to	the	Committee	on	remuneration	of	the	senior	
executive	team.	The	Executive	Directors	attended,	by	invitation,	meetings	of	the	Committee.	
Page	43 	of	the	Corporate	Governance	report	sets	out	the	number	of	times	the	Committee	met	during	the	year	and	the	attendance	at	
each	meeting.	
The	key	issues	considered	by	the	Committee	during	the	year	under	review	included:
• the	continuing	appropriateness	of	the	Company’s	remuneration	policy	and	the	remuneration	arrangements;	
• salary	levels	for	the	Chief	Executive	and	Group	Finance	Director;
• the	terms	of	the	2013/14 	and	2014/15 	Annual	Performance	Related	Bonus	Plans,	and	the	individual	bonuses	payable	for	2012/13, 	 
in	light	of	performance	against	the	targets	set;	
• the	individual	long-term	share	incentive	awards	under	the	Company’s	2005 	Performance	Share	Plan	and	the	associated	performance	
measures	and	targets;	
• testing	of	the	performance	conditions	and	approval	of	the	vesting	levels	of	long-term	share	incentive	awards	granted	in	2010/2011;
• the	approval	of	the	Directors’	Remuneration	report	for	2012/13; 	and
• the	implications	of	revised	reporting	requirements	for	the	Directors’	Remuneration	report	for	2013/14.
Implementation of Remuneration policy for year ending 30 September 2015
Base Salaries
The	Executive	Directors’	base	salaries	were	reviewed	during	the	final	quarter	of	the	financial	year	ending	30 	September	2014 	in	light	of	 
(i)	their	revised	responsibilities	following	the	restructuring	of	the	Group’s	Board	(as	detailed	in	the	Chairman’s	Statement	on	page	5)	 
and	(ii)	the	levels	of	anticipated	salary	increases	to	be	awarded	across	the	Group	as	a	whole	and	in	the	UK.
As	a	result	of	this	exercise,	the	Committee	decided	to	increase	the	Executive	Directors	salaries	as	follows:
Salary as at 
1 December 2014
Salary as at 
1 	April	2014 Increase
Andy	Roberts £420,000 £420,000 0%
Jane	Hall £310,000 £255,000 21.6%
As	detailed	in	the	Committee	Chairman’s	Annual	Statement,	reflecting	the	revised	management	structure,	the	Chief	Executive’s	salary	 
is	unchanged	and	the	salary	for	the	role	of	Chief	Executive	–	Business	Services	has	been	set	at	a	revised	level	to	reflect	the	responsibilities	
required	of	the	role.	An	additional	allowance	of	£45,000,	which	in	tandem	with	the	enhanced	long-term	incentive	award	to	be	granted	 
to	her	in	the	current	financial	year,	is	to	be	paid	to	take	account	of	the	additional	time	commitment	and	responsibilities	that	will	be	 
required	of	her	during	a	period	of	transition	when	she	will	be	fulfilling	both	her	new	role	of	Chief	Executive	–	Business	Services	and	Group	
Finance Director.

The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Pension and Benefits
The	Executive	Directors	participate	in	defined	contribution	arrangements	into	which	the	Company	contributes	10% 	of	base	salary.	
In	addition	to	pension	benefits,	the	Executive	Directors	also	receive	private	medical	insurance,	permanent	health	insurance	and	a	fully	
expensed	company	car	or	car	allowance.	
Annual Performance Related Remuneration
The	bonus	opportunity	is	set	by	the	Committee	at	the	start	of	the	financial	year	against	targets	aligned	with	creating	shareholder	value,	
which	may	be	either	financial	or	strategic.	Any	bonus	payable	will	be	dependent	on	the	achievement	of	these	targets	which	will	include	
Group	adjusted	profit.	
For	the	year	ended	30 	September	2015, 	the	maximum	bonus	opportunity	for	the	Executive	Directors	will	remain	unchanged	at	100% 	 
of base salary. 
The	bonus	opportunity	is	funded	by	over-performance	against	the	adjusted	profit	target.	Failure	to	achieve	this	target	means	that	no	
bonus	is	payable	irrespective	of	whether	the	revenue	and	cash	targets	are	met.	A	bonus	is	earned	on	an	incremental	basis	once	the	
predetermined	threshold	target	is	satisfied	(0%	payable)	through	to	a	maximum	payment	for	substantial	out-performance	of	the	
threshold	performance	targets	(100% 	payable).
The	Committee	considers	that	the	revenue,	cash	and	adjusted	profit	targets	themselves	are	commercially	sensitive	and	therefore	 
plans	to	disclose	them	only	on	a	retrospective	basis.	Details	of	the	targets	and	actual	outturn	will	be	disclosed	in	next	year’s	Directors’	
Remuneration	report.	
Clawback	provisions	will	enable	the	Remuneration	Committee	to	correct	the	bonus	in	the	event	of	a	misstatement	of	the	Company’s	
results	(through	the	adjustment	of	future	incentive	pay	awards	in	the	first	instance)	so	that	it	reflects	the	value	that	should	have	been	 
paid	had	it	not	been	for	the	misstatement.	
Recognising	the	nature	of	the	Group’s	profits,	the	period	over	which	the	clawback	provisions	will	apply	is	until	approval	of	the	audited	
accounts	for	the	subsequent	year.
PSP
In	relation	to	the	awards	to	be	granted	in	the	current	financial	year	under	the	existing	PSP ,	the	Chief	Executive	will	be	granted	an	award	 
at	100% 	of	salary	with	an	award	to	the	Chief	Executive,	Global	Business	Services	at	150% 	of	salary.
The	award	to	the	Chief	Executive	is	in	line	with	‘normal’	policy.	The	award	to	the	Chief	Executive,	Global	Business	Services	is	within	the	
scope	of	the	Company’s	shareholder	approved	remuneration	policy	in	‘exceptional’	circumstances	and	her	award	at	this	level	relates	to	
the	central	importance	her	revised	role	has	within	the	restructured	Group	at	the	same	time	as	recognising	that	she	will	be	undertaking	her	
existing	and	new	roles	during	a	transitional	period	until	such	time	as	a	replacement	Group	Finance	Director	is	appointed	and	commences	
employment.	The	Committee	considers	providing	a	temporary	cash	allowance	in	tandem	with	a	higher	PSP	award	in	the	current	year	 
to	be	the	most	appropriate	method	of	remunerating	her	for	her	period	fulfilling	dual	roles.	This	is	on	the	basis	that	her	additional	
remuneration	will	be	linked	to	executing	a	successful	restructuring	of	the	Business	Services	Division	and,	ultimately,	the	long-term	
shareholder	value	created	from	this	strategic	change	at	the	Company.	In	taking	this	decision,	the	Committee	took	comfort	that	the	
potential	reward	to	Jane	Hall	under	the	proposed	award	would	only	arise	if	demanding	performance	targets	are	met	through	to	
September	2017 	with	a	requirement	then	in	place	to	hold	any	vested	shares	(net	of	tax)	through	to	2019 	(i.e.	long-term	sustainable	
shareholder	value	would	need	to	be	created	for	her	to	receive	value).

In	setting	the	above	awards	levels,	the	Committee	considered	(i)	the	scope	of	their	individual	roles	and	the	need	to	motivate	and	retain	the	
Executive	Directors	and	other	participants	(ii)	the	number	of	shares	comprising	individual	awards	when	they	are	expressed	as	a	multiple	of	
salary	given	the	prevailing	share	price	and	(iii)	the	demanding	nature	of	the	performance	targets	set.	
The	performance	measures	and	overall	structure	of	the	performance	targets	that	are	intended	to	be	applied	to	the	awards	granted	in	the	
2015 	financial	year	are	broadly	consistent	with	the	targets	operated	in	2014 	and	are	summarised	below.
Relative TSR Performance (50% of the award)

Adjusted EPS Growth (50% of the award)

Three	Year	Growth	in	Adjusted	EPS Vesting	%
Below	RPI	+	30% 0%	
RPI	+30% 30% 	
RPI	+	60% 100%
Straight-line	vesting	occurs	between	these	points.
With	regards	to	the	choice	of	performance	metrics	for	the	intended	2015 	PSP	awards,	since	adjusted	EPS	continues	to	be	considered	by	
the	Board	to	be	the	broadest	measure	of	the	Company’s	long-term	financial	performance	and	is	well	understood,	it	remains	appropriate	
to	continue	to	use	it	as	a	key	metric	in	our	long-term	incentive	plan.	Relative	TSR	versus	the	most	comparable	UK	listed	companies	(those	
companies	comprising	the	FTSE	Software	and	Computer	Services	and	FTSE	Support	Services	Indices)	is	considered	to	align	executives	
with	our	shareholders	in	that	our	executives	only	receive	reward	for	this	part	of	awards	for	out-performing	similar	types	of	companies.	 
As	a	result,	the	Committee	will	be	comfortable	granting	2015 	PSP	awards	subject	to	an	equal	blend	of	adjusted	EPS	growth	targets	and	
relative	TSR.	
With	regards	to	the	range	of	adjusted	EPS	performance	targets	set	for	the	awards	to	be	granted	in	the	current	financial	year,	these	were	
determined	by	the	Committee	having	had	due	regard	to	the	Company’s	business	plans	and	the	current	market	expectations	for	the	
future	performance	of	the	Company.	The	range	was	structured	so	that	only	a	modest	proportion	of	the	relevant	part	of	an	award	would	
vest	for	delivering	both	the	Company’s	expectations	and	the	growth	currently	expected	in	the	market,	and	reflecting	the	company’s	
strategic	development	from	a	“recovery	phase”	to	a	“growth	phase”.	This	is	aligned	with	current	institutional	investors’	guidelines	and	the	
Committee	was	also	mindful	in	setting	the	targets	that	the	year	under	review	was	a	record	year	for	the	Company	and	so	future	growth	will	
need	to	be	achieved	from	a	record	high	base	point.	As	a	result,	the	range	of	targets	set	are	considered	to	provide	an	appropriate	balance	
between	incentivising	out-performance	of	the	Company’s	planning	expectations	at	the	same	time	as	setting	realistic	incentive	targets.	
Sharesave
Executive	Directors	will	be	entitled	to	participate	in	any	Sharesave	plan	on	the	same	terms	as	any	other	eligible	employee.	
Non-executive Directors Remuneration
Non-executive	Directors	are	not	eligible	to	participate	in	short	or	long-term	incentive	plans	or	to	receive	any	pension	from	the	Group.	The

payment	at	the	discretion	of	the	Committee	of	£2,000 	in	settlement	of	a	historic	market	value	share	option	award	(granted	in	March	2004) 	that	she	was	unable	to	exercise	due	to	the	Company	being	in	
a	close	period	at	the	time	the	option	came	to	the	end	of	its	10 	year	life.	This	payment	replicated	the	gain	that	would	have	been	received	had	she	been	in	a	position	to	exercise	her	option	at	the	end	of	its	
ten year life. 
2	 The 	2014 	Long-Term	Incentives	figure	relates	to	the	vesting	of	the	2011 	Plan	award	granted	on	16 	May	2011. 	The	number	of	awards	was	determined	by	a	share	price	performance	condition	and	an	EPS	
underpin,	which	concluded	for	the	year	ending	30 	September	2014. 	The	value	of	the	shares	has	been	calculated	using	the	average	share	price	from	1 	July	2014 	to	30 	September	2014. 	Further	details	
are	set	out	below.	
	 The	2013 	Long-Term	Incentives	comparative	relates	to	the	vesting	on	9	December	2013 	of	the	Key	Executive	Recruitment	and	Key	Executive	Retention	Plan	awards	which	were	granted	on	
9	December	2010. 	The	number	of	awards	vesting	was	determined	by	an	EPS	condition	which	concluded	for	the	year	ending	30 	September	2013. 	The	value	of	the	shares	was	previously	estimated	
using	the	average	share	price	from	1 	July	2013 	to	30 	September	2013 	(29.2p). 	This	has	now	been	restated	for	the	actual	share	price	on	vesting	(35.3p).

In	addition	to	the	above,	Jane	Hall	received	fees	of	£30,000 	during	the	financial	year	for	her	role	as	Non-executive	Director	at	Outsourcery.
Annual incentive (performance period 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014) (audited)
The	annual	bonus	for	the	2014 	financial	year	under	review	was	based	on	the	achievement	of	targets	set	in	respect	of	Group	adjusted	 
profit	(60%)	and	Group	Revenue	(20%) 	and	achieving	Group	Cash	conversion	of	85%	(20%). 	These	terms	are	defined	within	the	Group	
Operational	and	Financial	Review	and	Appendix	2 	–	Non-GAAP	measures.	
The	entire	bonus	is	funded	from	over-performance	against	the	adjusted	profit	target.	No	bonus	is	payable	under	the	other	two	measures	
if	the	threshold	profit	target	is	not	met.
Group	Adjusted	profit	for	the	year	ending	30 	September	2014 	was	£27.5m 	(target	£27.4m), 	Group	revenue	was	£209.8m 	(target	£230.4m) 	
and	Group	cash	conversion	was	88%	(target	85%).	The	adjusted	profit	for	the	year	met	but	did	not	sufficiently	exceed	the	threshold	target	
and	consequently	no	bonuses	were	awarded.
Long-Term Incentives (performance period 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2014) (audited)
The	Executive	Directors	each	received	one-off	awards	under	the	2011 	Plan	in	the	financial	year	ended	30 	September	2011.
Vesting	of	the	awards	was	determined	by	the	Company’s	share	price	which	was	assessed	by	reference	to	the	average	share	price	
(adjusted	for	the	impact	of	the	March	2014 	Open	Offer)	achieved	during	the	period	of	three	months	expiring	on	30 	September	2014, 	 
being	the	last	day	of	the	performance	period.	The	range	of	share	price	targets	applying	to	the	awards	was	as	follows:
Company’s	three	month	average	share	price	to	30 	September	2014 %	of	an	award	vesting
20p 10%
40p	(or	above) 100%
Between	20p 	and	40p Pro	rata	on	a	straight-line	basis	between	10% 	and	100%
In	addition,	regardless	of	the	average	share	price	achieved,	awards	would	only	vest:	
• if	the	Company’s	adjusted	earnings	per	share	as	at	30 	September	2014 	was	no	less	than	1.18 	pence;	and

performance.	If	the	Company’s	adjusted	EPS	for	the	financial	year	ending	30 	September	2014 	was	at	least	1.18 	pence	but	the	level

The	Committee	determined	that	(i)	the	three	month	average	share	to	30 	September	2014 	was	31.32p 	(adjusted	for	the	impact	of	the	
March	2014 	Open	Offer)	(ii)	the	adjusted	earnings	per	share	for	the	year	ended	30 	September	2014 	was	1.87p 	and	(iii)	the	vesting	result	
was	a	fair	reflection	of	the	Company’s	underlying	financial	performance	based	on	three-year	growth	in	adjusted	profit,	and	revenue	
growth	of	82%, 	and	19%. 	The	level	of	performance	achieved,	therefore,	resulted	in	vesting	at	61% 	of	the	maximum.	
The	adjustment	to	the	actual	three	month	average	share	price	to	30 	September	2014 	took	place	to	recognise	the	impact	of	the	March	
2014 	Open	Offer.	The	adjustment,	following	the	standard	approach	commonly	applied	to	HMRC	approved	options	where	a	discounted	
open	offer	takes	place,	resulted	in	the	actual	average	share	price	being	increased	by	a	factor	of	1.005 	(i.e.	half	of	one	percent)	to	ensure	
that	the	share	price	was	able	to	be	tested	on	a	consistent	basis	with	the	share	price	targets	which	were	not	adjusted	for	the	impact	of	the	
March	Open	Offer.	In	effect,	the	Open	Offer	resulted	in	the	weighted	average	share	price	following	the	issue	of	the	Open	Offer	shares	
falling	by	half	of	one	percent	(with	the	benefit	of	this	realised	by	shareholders	partaking	in	the	Open	Offer	through	buying	shares	at	a	
modest	discount	to	the	prevailing	market	price).	Therefore,	from	a	theoretical	perspective,	increasing	the	share	price	for	the	three	
months	to	30 	September	2014 	sought	to	neutralise	the	impact	of	the	Open	Offer	for	the	purposes	of	testing	the	performance	condition	
(i.e.	testing	the	condition	with	an	adjusted	share	price	resulted	in	the	condition	being	no	more	or	less	challenging	to	achieve	based	on	the	
targets	originally	set	after	allowing	for	the	impact	of	the	Open	Offer).	
In	addition	to	adjusting	the	share	price,	the	number	of	shares	comprising	the	awards	was	also	increased	by	the	same	factor	(1.005) 	to	
ensure	that	the	impact	of	the	Open	Offer	did	not	reduce	the	value	of	the	award	originally	granted	(i.e.	since	shareholders	had	the	potential	
to	purchase	shares	in	the	Open	Offer	at	a	marginal	discount,	theoretically,	this	reduces	the	value	of	existing	shares	and	increasing	the	
number	of	shares	by	the	adjustment	factor	seeks	to	ensure	that	the	value	of	the	original	award	at	grant	is	maintained).	All	other	
outstanding	share	awards	were	similarly	adjusted	(including	the	Company’s	All	Employee	Share	Awards).

Key Executive Recruitment and Key Executive Retention Plans
The	award	granted	on	9	December	2010 	vested	in	full	on	9	December	2013 	with	a	summary	of	the	performance	targets,	and	the	extent	 
to	which	they	have	been	met,	detailed	in	last	year’s	Annual	Report	on	Remuneration.
PSP award granted in 2013
The	performance	shares	granted	on	28 	May	2013 	are	half	subject	to	a	relative	TSR	performance	condition	and	half	subject	to	an	EPS	
performance condition. 
The	TSR	performance	condition	requires	the	Company	to	deliver	a	median	ranking	(30% 	vests)	rising	on	a	straight-line	basis	to	an	upper	
quartile	TSR	ranking	(100% 	vests)	relative	to	the	constituents	of	the	FTSE	Software	and	Computer	Services	and	FTSE	Support	Services	
over	a	three-year	performance	period.	TSR	is	measured	using	the	net	return	index	averaged	over	the	6	months	before	the	performance	
period	and	the	last	6	months	of	the	performance	period,	ending	1 	April	2017.
The	EPS	performance	condition	measures	the	adjusted	EPS	in	the	final	year	of	the	performance	period.	Threshold	vesting	of	50%	of	the	
shares	occurs	for	adjusted	EPS	of	1.90p 	rising	on	a	straight-line	basis	to	full	vesting	for	adjusted	EPS	of	2.25p.
PSP award granted in the 2013/14 year (audited)
Following	consultation	with	the	Company’s	major	shareholders	during	2012, 	the	Committee	determined	that	awards	under	the	PSP	
would	be	granted	for	the	2013 	financial	year	and	on	an	ongoing	basis	at	up	to	100% 	of	salary.	On	31 	March	2014, 	a	PSP	award	was	made	to	
each	of	the	Executive	Directors	at	100% 	of	salary.	The	award	was	made	on	the	following	basis:
Type	of	 
Award
Basis of  
award	granted
Share	price	 
at date of grant
Number of  
shares	awarded
Face value

%	of	face	value

Andrew	Roberts Nil–cost	option 100% 	of	salary £0.355 1,185,000 £420,675 30% 	
Jane	Hall Nil–cost	option 100% 	of	salary £0.355 720,000 £255,600 30%
The	awards	were	half	subject	to	a	relative	TSR	performance	condition	and	half	subject	to	an	EPS	performance	condition.	
The	TSR	performance	condition	requires	the	Company	to	deliver	a	median	ranking	(30% 	vests)	rising	on	a	straight-line	basis	to	an	upper	
quartile	TSR	ranking	(100% 	vests)	relative	to	the	constituents	of	the	FTSE	Software	and	Computer	Services	and	FTSE	Support	Services	
over	a	three-year	performance	period.	TSR	is	measured	using	the	net	return	index	averaged	over	the	6	months	before	the	performance	
period	and	the	last	6	months	of	the	performance	period.	
The	EPS	performance	condition	requires	the	adjusted	EPS	over	the	performance	period,	to	be	measured	against	the	Retail	Prices	Index	
(“RPI”).	Threshold	vesting	of	30% 	of	the	shares	occurs	for	growth	of	RPI	+45%	rising	on	a	straight-line	basis	to	full	vesting	for	growth	of	 
RPI	+	100%. 	
Dilution limits (not audited)
Shareholders	approved	a	reworking	of	the	Company’s	dilution	limits	at	the	AGM	in	March	2007 	that	allows	it	to	issue	up	to	12.5% 	of	its	
issued	share	capital	in	a	rolling	10-year 	period	to	employees	under	all	share	plans.	Previously	the	Company	had	operated	within	a	10% 	in	
10 	years	discretionary	limit	and	a	15% 	in	10 	years	all	schemes	limit.	This	re-working	of	the	existing	dilution	limits	was	considered	to	provide	
a	better	balance	between	the	need	to	operate	competitive	incentive	schemes	in	a	global	environment	and	limiting	shareholder	dilution.	
The	current	level	of	dilution	is	approximately	6.2% 	and	the	Company	remains	committed	to	managing	dilution	as	efficiently	as	possible.

Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 
2014 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of The Innovation Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2014 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and Company Balance Sheet, and the related notes 1 to 34 for the 
group financial statements and 1 to 14 for the parent company financial statements. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statements set out on pages 39 and 117, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement and our response to those risks
The table below shows the risks we identified, and our response to those risks, that have had the greatest effect on the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team together with our audit response  
to the risk:
Risk Response
Revenue recognition, specifically that related to the UK property 
subsidence business, the South African warranty business and  
on software license sales and implementations in the UK, the US 
and Australia. We considered these revenue recognition areas  
to be subject to a number of judgements and key estimates  
(all as described on page 47 in the Letter from the Chair of the  
Audit Committee).
We understood the specific terms of the key UK property 
subsidence contracts insofar as they impacted the revenue to  
be recorded by the Group. We also challenged management’s 
assumptions inherent in the calculation of the revenue to be 
recognised on these contracts, in particular the percentage of 
completion of the claims, the anticipated recoveries to be made  
on the portfolio of claims and the deterioration rate (potential 
increase) in relation to the net cost of closing the claims. We tested 
the percentage of completion of the claim book by assessing  
and corroborating management’s method for calculating this.  
We tested the anticipated recoveries and the deterioration rate  
by assessing the historical accuracy of management’s forecasting 
in this area.
We utilised our actuarial experts to evaluate the critical actuarial 
assumptions employed by management’s experts in the South 
African warranty business to calculate the revenue recorded  
by management.
We challenged the accounting for the material software license 
sales and implementation agreements entered into in the US,  
the UK and Australia, specifically focusing on the substance of the 
agreements and whether any licence sales can be separated from 
professional services when these are contracted together, as well 
as assessing whether the revenue recognition policies adopted 
complied with IFRS. We also challenged the appropriateness of 
disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts regarding the 
conversion of the annual licence rental into a perpetual licence in 
the UK and Asia Pacific regions, as described on pages 20 and 25  
of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recording of  
any potential tax liabilities arising from the group’s international 
operating structure, where the group operates in a number of 
countries with a variety of tax regimes which have different  
levels of complexities and risk (as described on page 48 in the 
Letter from the Chair of the Audit Committee).
We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s assumptions 
and estimates in relation to the likelihood of generating future 
taxable profits to support the recognition of deferred tax assets by 
ensuring that the taxable profit forecasts are consistent with those 
used in the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and other 
long life assets, challenging those assumptions (as noted in the 
goodwill section below) and evaluating supporting forecasts and 
estimates by considering the historical accuracy of forecasting. We 
also evaluated open tax matters and any potential liabilities largely 
in relation to the overall structure of the group, involving separate 
tax specialists as required. 
The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill (as described  
on page 47 in the Letter from the Chair of the Audit Committee). 
We challenged management’s assumptions used in the 
impairment model for goodwill, described in note 14 to the  
group financial statements, including specifically assessing the 
determination of cash generating units and forecast growth rates, 
discount rates used and the historic accuracy of forecasting. We 
especially focused on the forecast results for the North American 
and Asia Pacific BPS operating segments, given the significant 
improvement in year 1 (ie FY15) forecasts compared with actual 
cashflows achieved in the current year. We evaluated the plans for 
executing on these forecasts and assessed their reasonableness in 
light of expected future revenues and management’s historical 
accuracy of forecasting. 64

Risk Response
The capitalisation and assessment of the recoverability of  
Insurer/Enterprise Intangible Assets (as described on page 46  
in the Letter from the Chair of the Audit Committee).
The majority of these costs capitalised are internal payroll costs.  
A number of the additions to the intangible assets during the  
year were carried out at the same time as some customer 
implementations of the Insurer product in the Group’s regional 
operations. We therefore tested that these additions added to  
the base product in these regions. We also tested that these  
costs meet the other requirements of IAS 38, especially the 
requirements around reliable measurement of the costs and that 
they enhance the asset rather than being maintenance of it.
We challenged management’s assessment of the future forecasts 
of income that is required to support the carrying value of the 
assets in the CGU’s to which they specifically relate. 
Recognition of the appropriate level of revenue and profits from 
the post-acquisition period relating to LAS (as described on  
page 48 in the Letter from the Chair of the Audit Committee).
We tested the opening balance sheet, post-acquisition income 
statement and closing balance sheet of LAS to evaluate the 
appropriateness of the amounts recorded by management in 
respect of these matters.
Acquisition accounting for LAS, Driven and Crashworth, including 
the identification and valuation of the assets and liabilities under 
the Purchase Price Allocation exercise (as described on page 46  
in the Letter from the Chair of the Audit Committee and in  
Note 17 to the Annual Report and Accounts).
Management used the services of an external expert for the 
valuation of the LAS acquisition, and conducted the valuation of 
Crashworth and Driven internally. We understood the terms of 
each acquisition and used our internal valuation experts to evaluate 
the work of management or management’s external experts as 
applicable. We considered the valuation methodology applied and 
critically assessed the key assumptions utilised in the Purchase 
Price Allocation exercise using the requirements of IFRS 3R.
Our application of materiality 
Our final materiality was calculated to be £941,000 (2013: £760,000) which was based on 5% of Profit Before Tax adjusted for non-
recurring exceptional items added back of £5,675,000. We used Profit Before Tax adjusted for non-recurring exceptional items as we 
consider it to be a key focus of users of the financial statements.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
the overall performance materiality (i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) should be 50% (2013 50%) of 
planning materiality, namely £470,500 (2013 £380,000). Our objective in adopting this approach was to ensure that total uncorrected and 
undetected audit differences in all accounts did not exceed our materiality level.
Audit work at individual components is undertaken based on a percentage of our total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based on the relative size of the component and our view of the risk of misstatement at that 
component. In the current year the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £94,100 to £329,350.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £47,050 (2013 £38,000),  
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in the light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, we selected 19 components which 
represent the principal business units within the Group’s six reportable segments. Due to certain insignificant subsidiaries that were not  
in scope for our Group audit, the coverage of profit before tax achieved from the entities within our Group scope was slightly greater than 
100%. The 19 components principal business units selected for Group audit also accounted for 87% (81%) of the group’s total assets and 
98% of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for non-recurring exceptional items. Six of these were subject to a full audit, whilst at the 
remaining thirteen specific audit procedures were performed including full audit of the accounts that were impacted by our assessed risks  
of material misstatement and the materiality of the Group’s business operations at these locations. They were also selected to provide an 
appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. For the remaining components, 
we performed other procedures to confirm there were no significant risks of material misstatement in the Group financial statements.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory 
Auditor visits each of the locations where the risk of material misstatement is considered to be most significant at least once every three 
years, with those where the risk of material misstatement is particularly heightened being visited at least once every year. For all full scope 
entities in addition to the location visit the group audit team reviewed key working papers associated with revenue recognition as deemed 
appropriate and participated in the component team’s planning including the component team’s discussion of fraud and error. 65

The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS
The financial statements of The Innovation Group plc (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 30 September 2014 were authorised for issue  
by the Board of Directors on 2 December 2014 and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by Jane Hall. The Innovation 
Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on  
the London Stock Exchange.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted 
by the European Union. The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2. 
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with  
the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000s), except 
where otherwise indicated. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of The Innovation Group plc and the entities it controls drawn up to 
30 September 2014.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the 
investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights; currently 
exercisable or convertible potential voting rights; or by way of contractual agreement. Typically, financial statements of subsidiaries are 
prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. 
Due to the proximity of the acquisition of Driven Solutions Inc to the year end, this business remains on a December year end. The 
business performed financial close processes that were in line with the rest of the Group’s entities as part of the current year end process. 
It will also perform a formal closure process as part of the preparation of its financial statements at 31 December 2014. It is considered 
that this meets the requirements of IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. 
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising from them, are eliminated.
The results and cash flows relating to a business are included in the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of

Restatement of comparatives
Adjustment to presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities
At 30 September 2013, the Group incorrectly presented deferred tax assets and liabilities between both current and non-current assets 
and liabilities. This has been corrected as part of the presentation of the 30 September 2013 balance sheet within these statements.  
This has had the effect of increasing the non-current deferred tax asset by £1,583,000 and the non-current deferred tax liability 
by £1,755,000 and reducing the current deferred tax asset by £1,583,000 and the current deferred tax liability by £1,755,000 as at 
30 September 2013. There has been no impact of this change to total assets or the income statement. In accordance with IAS 1, 
a restated third balance sheet has also been presented as at 1 October 2012. This has had the effect of increasing the non-current 
deferred tax asset by £2,014,000 and the non-current deferred tax liability by £1,019,000 and reducing the current deferred tax asset 
by £2,014,000 and the current deferred tax liability by £1,019,000 as at 1 October 2012.

Interests in associates
The Group’s interests in associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are not subsidiaries, are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is 
carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate, less distributions 
received and less any impairment in the value of individual investments. The Group income statement reflects the share of the 
associate’s results after tax.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group’s 
share of the net fair value of the associate’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount  
of the associate and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the associate’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Group’s share of the associate’s profit or loss in 
the period in which the investment is acquired. 
Revenue
The Group derives its revenues primarily from the provision of BPS services to the insurance, fleet, automotive and property industries 
and software and related services to the insurance sector. In the BPS division the Group has core competencies in motor, property  
and workers’ compensation (US) particularly in the provision of administration services for first notice of loss, incident management,  
full claims handling, loss adjusting and service, maintenance policy and warranty administration. In addition the BPS division supplies 
motor parts into its managed network of repairers. The software division provides software to insurance companies through the sale  
of licences and the building and maintaining of the underlying business systems that are required to manage claims administration and 
policy processes. 
Revenue earned by the BPS division
Overview
The Group receives payments either as principal or agent. This is differentiated by the extent to which the Group is at risk for the gross 
payment. Where the Group acts as agent for the insurer, the insurer retains complete liability for the cost of settlement of the claim.  
As a result, even when the Group processes claims settlement costs gross through its own balance sheet, revenue is accounted for on  
a net basis and comprises fees for administrative and other services. Where the Group retains the liability for the settlement of claims 
costs, revenue is accounted for gross. Revenues are recognised in line with the delivery of the related services or referred work including, 
where appropriate, an assessment of accrued income. 
The majority of the Group’s BPS revenue is derived from the administration of different parts of the claims management or policy 
management process. This is predominantly performed for a fixed administration fee or a fixed contractual percentage of the value of  
any repair. All administration fees are recognised, in accordance with IAS 18, as the service is considered to be delivered. Certain services, 
such as the provision of first notice of loss services are paid by transaction and the transactions can be delivered over a very short period 
of time. Revenue on these services is recognised as the transactions occur. Other services, such as the administration of motor service 
plans, or the administration of a subsidence claim will be delivered over a longer period of time. The key revenue streams are detailed 
below, and unless otherwise indicated may apply to the motor or property sector:
Key BPS revenue streams
First notice of loss (‘FNOL ’). The Group operates call centres which take calls on behalf of the insurer. Using scripting, the call centre will 
validate client details, ascertaining the policy number of the claimant and determining whether the reported loss falls within the scope of 
the policy and then captures claim details directly into the insurer’s own system. A contracted fee per claim is received and recognised 
when the service is complete. Notifications are taken for motor, property and workers’ compensation claims.
Incident management. Once the Group has been advised of a claim, either by taking the FNOL or after being notified by the insurer, the 
Group assesses the claim, whether motor or property, and deploys the repair into its network of managed body shops or property 
contractors. Revenue is a fixed contracted percentage of the repair and is borne by the repairer not the insurer. Revenue is recorded net 
as the Group acts as agent and takes no liability for the settlement of the claim and is recognised on a claim by claim basis at the point of 
deployment into the network as this is where the administration effort is substantially complete. The Group also handles the payment 
process on behalf of the client however, effort is minimal and deemed perfunctory. The Group also has an identical methodology for the 
servicing of vehicles except, in this instance, the customer is generally a fleet company. 
Loss adjusting. Loss adjusting services may be performed as a stand-alone service for those insurers who do not take the end-to-end 
claims service. For both motor and property claims the Group performs the determination and approval of the repair on behalf of the 
insurer. An administration fee is recognised as revenue at the point of delivery of the loss adjuster’s report when the service is complete.
Car hire and leasing. The Group earns revenue in two ways from this revenue stream. In the first instance the Group sources a vehicle from 
the rental provider on a fixed rate and charges to the insurer on a daily rate. The Group acts as principal and revenues are recognised on a 
gross basis when the lease is undertaken as hires are typically two or three days, on a pro-rata basis as the hire is provided. The second is 
where the Group promotes special offers to clients acting as an agent to the manufacturer and receives a commission for the service 
which is recognised as revenue as an agent when the lease is signed. 74

2. Accounting policies continued
Sale of Motor Parts. In certain geographies the Group supplies motor parts to its network of repairer garages. The Group’s business model 
is for these goods to be delivered directly from the supplier to the customer and as a result it does not take inventory risk. However, the 
Group is exposed to the credit and supply of its counterparties and consequently recognises the transaction gross, in the income 
statement. Revenue is recognised at the point of despatch from the supplier to the customer. 
Service and Maintenance Plans. In South Africa the Group has contracts with a number of motor manufacturers to administer their  
service and maintenance policies for a fixed fee. Contracts can be either off-risk or on-risk where the Group has assumed the liability of 
the service cost (see below). The Group currently administers approximately 565,000 off-risk plans and 82,000 on-risk plans. 
The proportion of the administration fee that relates to the initial sale of the policy, the commission revenue, is recognised up front.  
An allowance is held against commission revenue receivable to allow for the risk of cancellation. The Group is reliably able to estimate the 
risk of cancellation based on prior experience of a significant number of similar claims. The remainder of the administration fee is 
recognised over the life of the policy.
In the case of off-risk plans the Group receives a fee per vehicle per month for the administration of the policy. In addition, in certain cases, 
to the extent the Group is able to manage a specified book of policies to settlement below a contracted benchmark it is entitled to a share 
of the savings on a percentage basis as determined by the contract. Based on prior experience of a significant number of similar claims 
the Group is reliably able to estimate these savings and revenue is recognised as this service is delivered.
On-risk plans may be either term (paid in advance for the life of the plan) or monthly and as the Group has assumed liability for the service 
revenue is recognised gross. In both cases, the fee received will comprise an administration fee and a fund portion to cover future vehicle 
servicing costs. In the case of term policies cash is received upfront to cover the policy term and the amounts received are deferred  
(in either ‘deferred income’ for the administration fee or ‘other creditors’ for the fund portion) to the extent that they are considered 
required to meet the Group’s obligations under the policy based on actuarial advice. On monthly policies, cash is received each month  
and is recognised in income when received and costs are recognised as incurred. The Group only has a liability for costs incurred in a 
month if payment has been made for that month and the policy is not in arrears. The Group only commenced selling monthly policies post 
the implementation of IFRS, but sold term policies for a number of years prior to the implementation of IFRS. These policies meet the 
IFRS 4 definition of an insurance contract and as such the Group has continued its pre-existing accounting policy on revenue recognition 
for term policies – as detailed in note 24.
Property subsidence claims. The handling of subsidence claims, only performed in the UK, is by its nature a more lengthy process than 
motor and property repair claims, with the settlement of some claims spanning more than one accounting period. Therefore, the Group 
recognises administration fees received at certain milestones throughout the claims process, being:
• Receipt of engineer’s report and determination of liability;
• Completion of site investigations;
• Completion of mitigation;
• Completion of monitoring/commencement of repairs;
• Receipt of all recoveries; and
• Closure and final settlement.
Revenue is recognised on a per claim basis and the amount recognised at each milestone reflects the service delivered at each stage of 
the process.
On-risk models
In general where the Group is involved in the administration of the settlement of a claim a fixed contractual fee is received. For some 
contracts, the Group has entered into a ‘risk and reward’ model. On-risk models result when the Group shares, in part or fully, in the 
savings or losses generated from the settlement of a claim, or portfolio of claims, against a contracted benchmark. Revenue is 
recognised on these contracts to the extent that the saving attributable to the Group can be measured reliably, the extent to which  
the Group has delivered its service can be determined, and the profit arising can be attributed to the stage of completion. Service  
delivery may be attributed by reference to closed claims, or by reference to the underlying costs associated with delivering the service. 
Profit attribution may be based on the average expected profit per claim against a portfolio of claims, or directly by reference to the 
percentage complete. Each contract has unique terms and conditions and is individually assessed.
These on risk contracts may be funded either through the customer’s own bank account, through an Innovation Group bank account 
funded by the customer or in limited situations through the Group’s own bank account with the Group taking prime responsibility for the 
settlement. For these on risk contracts, to the extent funds flow through the Group’s balance sheet, they will be accounted for on a  
gross basis in both the balance sheet and the income statement.
For on-risk contracts, the administration fee is either fixed in the contract or separately allocated from the fees received using evidence 
of fair value determined from the administration only contracts.

2. Accounting policies continued
On-risk contracts are predominantly in two areas of the business, property subsidence claims handling in the UK and the administration 
of motor service and maintenance plans in South Africa. These are detailed below:
Property subsidence claims. The Group has a number of contracts which generate revenue based on the Group’s ability to settle a 
portfolio of notified claims within a specific period below a contractually agreed benchmark. Revenue is recognised on these contracts to 
the extent that the saving attributable to the Group has been delivered and can be reliably measured. An average settlement per claim is 
calculated, being the actual cost on all closed claims in the population plus an estimate to settle all remaining open claims, adjusted by a 
deterioration factor to allow for the worsening of claims, divided by the number of claims in the population. Provided this average cost per 
claim is lower than the contractual benchmark, revenue is recognised by multiplying the number of closed claims in the population by the 
saving per claim or by reference to the percentage complete.
Where the average settlement per claim is calculated to be higher than the benchmark, the Group becomes liable for the excess and will 
provide in full for any exposure. This exposure is limited by reinsurance on each of these contracts. 
Service and maintenance plans. On-risk service and maintenance plans may be term or monthly policies. These are deemed on-risk as the 
Group bears all liability for the service costs and receives all the benefit should a portfolio of policies be settled below the premium price. 
The plans are priced based on the estimated cost of the specified services plus an administration fee and third party commission. In the 
case of term policies, the administration fee is carved out with an upfront element recognised to cover the initial capturing of the policy 
data and the remainder is deferred, as deferred income, over the life of the policy. The remaining portion of the premium, relating to the 
repair fund (the cost of the services) is then deferred, as other creditors, and released according to an actuarial assessment of the 
required reserve, driven by cost and independently reviewed by actuaries each year. The costs of the services are recognised as incurred. 
Where the Group performs the sale of the product, the commission for selling the product is recognised at the point of sale. 
In the case of monthly policies the total premium is recognised monthly as received with no distinction between administration fee and 
fund. The costs of the services are recognised as incurred, which may cause distortion on a single policy but has a smoothing effect over a 
large book.
Revenue earned by the software division
Overview
New solution sales often involve software licences being sold together with Post Customer Support (‘PCS’) services and/or 
implementation services. Where the commercial substance of such a combination is that the individual components operate 
independently of each other and fair values can be attributed to each of the components, each are then recognised in accordance  
with their respective policies described below.
Where it is not possible to attribute reliable fair values to two or more components these are viewed as a combination and revenue is 
recognised on the combined revenue streams as the combined service is delivered. For example, when software licences are sold 
together with implementation services and the fair value of either element is not determinable, both software licence and the 
implementation services are recognised using the percentage of completion method with provisions for estimated losses on 
uncompleted contracts being recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the current contract cost 
estimates. When software licences are sold together with PCS services and the fair value of either revenue stream is not determinable, 
the licence income is recognised over the period of the PCS services.
The revenue recognition policies for separately identifiable revenue streams are as follows:
Initial licence fees
Revenues are recognised when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the licence fee is fixed or 
determinable, the collection of the fee is reasonably assured, no significant obligations with regard to installation or implementation  
of the software remain, and customer acceptance, when applicable, has been obtained.
Maintenance and other PCS services 
Maintenance and PCS services are typically billed on an annual basis in advance. The Group recognises this revenue on a monthly basis 
over the period of the contract.
Solution delivery implementation services 
The majority of implementation services are recognised as the services are performed and billed on a time and materials basis.  
Revenues for all fixed fee contracts are recognised on a percentage complete basis. Where the percentage complete does not coincide 
with payment milestones the revenue is accrued or the payment shown on account. The Group calculates the percentage to complete  
by comparing the number of man days utilised at each period end with the total number of man days required to complete the project. 
Where the contract includes explicit acceptance criteria associated to the milestones the revenue is recognised in stages of the 
achievement of those milestones and customer acceptance. Project plans are reviewed on a regular basis with losses recognised 
immediately in the period in which such losses become probable based on the current contract cost estimates. 
Hosting services 
Where hosting is provided as part of a new solution sale, the hosting revenue stream will either be negotiated as a distinct separable 
element within the overall contract or will have a fair value attributed to it from the overall revenue stream generated. This is recognised 
rateably as the service is provided over the term of the contract.  76

2. Accounting policies continued
Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure incurred in the development of software and hardware products for use or sale by the business, and their related intellectual 
property rights, is capitalised as an intangible asset only when:
• technical feasibility has been demonstrated;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources exist to complete the development, which the Group intends to complete and use;
• future economic benefits expected to arise are deemed probable; and
• the costs can be reliably measured.
Development costs not meeting these criteria are expensed in the income statement as incurred. Capitalised development costs are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives once the related software and hardware products are available to use.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the 
Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as 
goodwill. Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment review. 
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place before 1 October 2004. As a result 
goodwill recognised on any business combinations that took place prior to 1 October 2004 is recorded at its carrying amount under UK 
GAAP in the functional currency of the acquiring entity. The Group follows guidance in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised) for business 
combinations. On acquisition date, businesses are recorded at acquisition cost, being the fair value at the date of exchange of the cash 
paid, or other consideration given. Direct transaction costs are directly expensed through the Consolidated Income Statement. 
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of acquired businesses are identified as required by IFRS 3 (revised), and are recorded in  
the Consolidated Financial Statements at their acquisition date fair values, with certain exceptions as set out in IFRS 3 (revised). 
If the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, the excess is recognised as goodwill. In the event 
that the value of the net assets acquired exceeds the cost of acquisition, the excess is immediately recognised as a gain in the 
Consolidated Income Statement at the acquisition date. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for 
impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. 
Impairment losses are never reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) monitored by management, 
usually at operating segment level or statutory company level as the case may be. A CGU is defined as being the smallest identifiable 
group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.  
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a CGU is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit,  
or of an operation within it. 
Deferred consideration is capitalised as part of the cost of acquisition and is discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Where the 
consideration is contingent, any revision to the amount payable is adjusted through the consolidated income statement. Where any 
payments are dependent upon continued employment, these payments are treated as compensation rather than consideration and  
are expensed to operating expenses in future periods.
Exceptional items
The Group classifies items of income and expense as exceptional items, where the nature of the item is non-recurring and its size is 
material so as to assist the user of the consolidated financial statements to better understand the results of the operations of the Group. 
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the primary statements. Exceptional items primarily relate to restructuring costs and the 
costs of acquisitions and are added back to the Group’s profit/(loss) before tax when calculating the Group’s adjusted profit. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible 
assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are 
carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Internally generated intangible assets, excluding internally generated software and capitalised development costs, are not capitalised  
and expenditure is charged against income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. 
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development activity, including software for internal use, is recognised 
only if the asset can be separately identified, it is probable the asset will generate future economic benefits, the development cost can be 
measured reliably, the project is technically feasible and the project will be completed with a view to the sale or use of the asset. 
Additionally, guidance in Standing Interpretations Committee (‘SIC’) 32 has been applied in accounting for internally developed website 
development costs. Internally generated intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, when the asset is available  
for use, and are reported net of any impairment losses.

The Group capitalises costs that relate to the development of a website only if the primary purpose of the website is the generation of 
revenue. These costs include application development, design and content which enables revenues to be generated from the website, 
excluding advertising or promotional material. Where a website has been developed primarily for promoting or advertising the services of 
the Group, these costs are expensed as incurred. Website development costs are amortised over the expected useful life of the asset. 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the 
useful life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. 
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial 
year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset 
are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates and 
adjustments are reflected prospectively. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income 
statement in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset. The useful lives of the intangible assets are 
as follows:
Software licences   5 to 7 years
Customer relationships  5 to 12 years
Customer lists   2 y ears
Internally generated software 5 years
Trade names   5 to 10 years
Intellectual property  5 years
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Such cost includes 
costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. 
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. On other assets it is calculated to write off their cost less estimated residual value, based on 
prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets. These are as follows:
Freehold property   50 years
Property improvements  1 0 to 15 years
Fixtures and fittings  4 to 15 years
Motor vehicles   4 years 
Computer systems  5 years
Computer equipment  2 t o 3 years
The useful lives and residual values assigned to property, plant and equipment are assessed on an annual basis. The carrying values of 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. 
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists,  
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount.  
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s (or CGU’s) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of 
assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to 
its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses 
of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the 
impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may  
no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since  
the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.  
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement, except in the case of Goodwill, 
where no reversal of impairment can be made. 78

2. Accounting policies continued
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at the lower of the original invoiced value and recoverable amount. A provision is made against the receivable 
when there is evidence that the Group may not be able to collect the full amount due.
All trade receivables which are more than six months overdue are reviewed and provided for based upon estimated irrecoverable amounts 
determined by reference to past default experience. Amounts which are less than six months overdue are provided where the 
recoverability of the balance due is considered to be doubtful. Any amounts provided for are recorded in the income statement within 
administrative expenses. Amounts are written-off when it is considered there is no further prospect of recovery. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited against administrative expenses within the income statement.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter carried at amortised cost.
Share based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted 
and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award. Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model, taking into account performance and service conditions as 
appropriate. Where only non-market performance conditions are in place, a Black-Scholes model has been used. In all other cases, an 
external valuer has been used, using stochastic modelling to derive a fair value. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or  
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described 
above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a 
corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost 
based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over 
the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value 
of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is 
recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled (including when non-vesting conditions within the control of the entity or employee are not 
met), it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is 
expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from 
equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Employer taxes that crystallise on the vesting of share based payments are recognised on the basis of likelihood of settlement, at each 
balance sheet date, based on management’s best estimate of the likely exercise of the award or option. The charge relating to the 
expected settlement is recognised in the income statement in line with the vesting period, in order to match the cost with the service 
provided. If an award or option does not vest, then the cumulative expense recognised in relation to that award or option will be reversed 
through the income statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less. For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and cash equivalents,  
as previously defined, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the 
balance sheet.
Investments
Investments in unquoted equity investments which do not have a reliable market value are stated at cost less provision for any 
impairment in value. For investments where there is an actively traded market the investment is stated at fair value, determined by 
reference to a quoted market bid price at the close of business on the balance sheet date. 
Leases and hire purchase contracts 
Assets acquired under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and disclosed under property, plant and equipment at 
their estimated fair value, or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments on the inception of each lease or contract and 
depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The capital element of the future payments is treated as a liability and the total finance 
charge is allocated over the period of the lease or contract in such a way as to give a constant charge on the outstanding liability.
Leases in which a significant proportion of the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease rentals payable or receivable are charged or credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or 
losses on translation are included in the income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency loans to foreign currency 
subsidiaries which form part of the net investment. These are taken directly to equity until the date of disposal of the net investment,  
at which time they are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
 Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year, where this represents a reasonable approximation of actual 
exchange rates at the date of transactions. The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity.  
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in the income statement.
The Group previously applied the exemption in IFRS 1 ‘First Time Adoption’ to reset cumulative exchange differences on net investment 
in foreign operations to zero at the date of transition.
During the year the most significant currencies, other than Sterling, were the US Dollar, South African Rand and the Euro. The average 
annual exchange rates used to convert results into Sterling are shown in the table below: 
Currency 2014 2013
US Dollar 1.66 1.56
South African Rand 17.63 14.58
Euro 1.23 1.19
Current and deferred income tax
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed,  
based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences 
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation  
of taxable profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognised on all temporary differences except in respect of investments in subsidiaries and 
associates where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that it will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction, 
other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax 
assets on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries or associates are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future.
In all cases, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary difference or unused deferred tax asset can be utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on 
the same basis. The carrying amount of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
In the United Kingdom, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as remuneration on exercise of certain employee 
share options. As explained under ‘Share based payments’ above, a remuneration expense is recorded in the Group’s income statement 
over the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the relevant options. As there is a temporary difference between the 
accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset may be recorded. The deferred tax asset arising on share option awards is calculated as the 
estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future (based on the Group’s share price at the balance sheet date) pro-rated to 
the extent that the services of the employee have been rendered over the vesting period. If this amount exceeds the cumulative amount 
of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings. Similarly, current 
tax relief in excess of the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate is also recorded in retained earnings.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability  
is settled. This is based upon tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables and held-to-maturity 
investments, as appropriate. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial 
assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group determines the classification of its 
financial instruments at initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Such assets are carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are 
derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.  80

2. Accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts which give rise to them and are classified as 
financial liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss or loans and payables as appropriate. When financial liabilities are recognised 
initially, they are measured at fair value, plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable 
transaction costs. The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
A financial liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are 
recognised in profit or loss. 
Loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction  
costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in net profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
amortisation process. 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial 
period of time to get ready for use or sale) are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an 
expense when incurred.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are fully authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity concerned.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions, including those for legal claims, are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event and management believe it to be probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of the 
amount can be made. Where a reimbursement is expected, this is recognised only when it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will 
take place, and of the amount to be reimbursed. Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to 
settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to net present value where this is deemed to be material. 
Contingent liabilities are liabilities that represent a possible obligation arising from a past event whose existence is dependent on one or 
more uncertain future events not within the control of the Group, or a present obligation where it is not probable that an outflow will be 
required for settlement of the obligation. Contingent liabilities are not disclosed where the likelihood of the uncertain future event is 
remote.
Contingent assets, which relate to possible assets and depend on the outcome of uncertain future events, are not recognised. Such an 
asset is disclosed only where the inflow of economic benefit is probable.
Segment reporting
For reporting purposes the results of the Group are organised into regional business units and a central cost centre. The central cost 
centre includes unallocated corporate costs and expensed development costs, as well as income from transfer pricing royalties and 
management recharges. Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purposes of making 
decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment revenue and segment profit exclude transactions between 
business segments.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has had to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
that have been made in preparing the consolidated financial statements are detailed below and in specific accounting policy notes.  
These judgements involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events which can vary from what is anticipated.

Deferred administration fees
A significant proportion of the Group’s BPS revenue 
comes from fees for the outsourced administration of 
different elements of both the motor and property claims 
management process. 
Administration fees are recognised in revenue to  
the extent that the service is considered delivered.  
Where the effort is incurred over a significant period  
of time, estimation is required to determine the extent  
to which the service has been delivered. 
The application of incorrect 
assumptions as to the extent 
to which the service has been 
delivered could potentially 
mean that the level of revenue 
recognised is wrong.
The Group recognises significant 
levels of administration fees, 
however the majority of services are 
performed prior to invoicing.
Service and maintenance plans
In addition to administering motor service and maintenance 
plans for third parties, the Group’s South African business 
writes service and maintenance plans on behalf of the  
Group and bears the risk of the settlement of the obligations 
under the plan. 
Assessing the deferral of monies received that are required 
to cover the future cost of the claims under these policies 
requires significant estimation. 
Incorrect estimation of the 
future cost of settlement could 
lead to the under estimation 
of future costs and hence the 
potential value of the obligation. 
The Group takes advice from 
an external firm of actuaries to 
determine the expected future 
liability and to support the 
position taken.
The Group has deferred income 
of £5.6m (2013: £5.2m) in relation 
to these service and maintenance 
plans. Please refer to note 24 for 
further details.
Intangible assets recognised as part of business combinations
Intangible assets are identified and capitalised on 
acquisition of subsidiaries where appropriate. Although 
the techniques used to value these assets are in line with 
internationally used models, they do require the use of 
estimates which may differ from actual outcomes. 
Incorrect valuation of intangible 
assets upon acquisition will 
increase the risk of impairment 
having to be recorded if the 
assumptions used are incorrect. 
Intangible assets capitalised in 
the year in relation to business 
combinations totalled £14.8m 
(2013: £3.9m). 
 
Please refer to note 15. 
Share based payments
The Group has to estimate, on an annual basis, whether  
the Group will achieve the non-market performance 
conditions within all plans as described in note 29. 
The assessment is based upon market conditions and 
management’s expectation of future profits, achievement 
of the long-term business plan and individuals remaining  
in employment. 
Incorrect estimation of the likely 
share-based payment (based on 
non-market conditions) will have 
an effect on profit before tax and 
basic earnings per share.
Costs relating to share based 
payments for the year totalled 
£2,135,000 of which £1,938,000 
related to the IFRS 2 charge (2013: 
£2,234,000). 
Please refer to note 29. 
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets are recognised where management 
believe that the availability of future profits is reasonably 
assured and hence available losses are likely to be utilised. 
Incorrect estimation of deferred 
tax assets due to incorrect 
budget assumptions will have 
an effect on the tax charge, the 
effective tax rate and both basic 
and adjusted earnings per share.
At 30 September 2014, the Group 
has recognised £3.8m of deferred 
tax assets, of which £1.9m relates to 
short term timing differences. 82

Revenue recognition on on-risk revenue share arrangements
There are a number of key estimates that are required to 
be made in regards to establishing the revenue recognition 
profile on revenue share arrangements. 
For the on-risk contracts handled by the UK subsidence 
business, these include:
•  the levels of outstanding recoveries to be made on a 
portfolio of claims;
•  the level of potential increase in the settlement value 
for open claims within a portfolio; 
•  the projection of the ultimate settlement value for 
a portfolio of claims; and
•  the costs to complete on a ‘work-in-progress’  
run off book. 
For the on-risk service plans handled by the South African 
motor business, these include:
• the cancellation rate of policies sold;
•  the number of services taken under a policy; and
• the number of policies that may lapse. 
For the warranty plans administered by the South African 
motor business and written through the associate cell 
captive, these include:
• development of actuarial claims curves;
•  levels of costs incurred on inception of a plan; and
• the number of policies that may lapse.
Incorrect use of estimates 
on on-risk revenue share 
arrangements will impact the 
revenue recognised in a period. 
This would then affect profit 
before and after tax, adjusted 
profit and both basic and 
adjusted earnings per share.
The Group uses third party actuarial 
advice to perform calculations to 
ensure that revenue is accrued 
appropriately. 
Useful economic life of internally generated software
The useful economic life of the Group’s internally 
generated software is estimated based on the historic 
length of relationship following the implementation of  
the product.
The carrying value is subject to an annual review to  
ensure that there has been no impairment.
If the expected useful economic 
life of the software is considered 
to be too long, then this 
could result in profitability 
being overstated. 
The amortisation charge in relation 
to internally generated software in 
the year was £6.5m (2013: £4.8m). 
See note 15.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment
Determining whether the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets is at risk of impairment involves a number 
of estimates, which includes the value of cash flows 
estimated to be generated from the asset in the future 
(initially driven by the budget for the following financial year) 
and the discount rate to be applied to these cash flows so 
that an assessment of their net present value can be made. 
This is tested annually. The recoverable amounts of 
CGUs have been determined based upon value in use 
calculations. The key estimates within the calculations are:
• EBITA;
• discount rates; and
• growth rates and terminal growth rates.
If the estimates supporting the 
calculated value of goodwill are 
over optimistic, then the Group  
is at risk of overstating the 
value of the asset and hence 
overstating profits. 
Details of the specific rates used 
and the value of any amounts 
which have been written off within 
administrative expenses in the 
income statement are detailed  
in notes 14 and 15.

Critical accounting judgement Issue
Value within the Annual 
Report and Accounts
Revenue recognition on significant software licensing 
arrangements
Software licensing agreements invariably include 
complex multiple element arrangements and a number 
of judgements are required to determine the elements 
that can be treated as revenue and those which need to be 
deferred for recognition as revenue in future periods. 
The primary judgement is whether the Group is able to 
separate recognition of revenue generated on professional 
services from that on licence sales as part of the same 
contract, dependent upon the substance of the solution 
provided to the customer on each specific contract. 
This is because the customer, or a separate third party 
provider, could perform these delivery services, if required. 
If the Group is unable to 
demonstrate that there is 
separation between the sale of 
the licence and the professional 
services, then revenue for 
the licence is then recognised 
rateably as the professional 
services are delivered. 
This would then impact the level 
of upfront licence that would be 
recognisable. 
Total software revenue sales for the 
year were £5.8m (2013: £3.7m).
Capitalisation of software development costs
For a number of years there has been ongoing 
development and regionalisation of the Group’s core 
Innovation Insurer product and Innovation Enterprise 
This base software is critical to the Group’s software sales 
and the effective delivery of the Group’s BPS offering in 
those regions where Enterprise has been implemented. 
Judgement is required to determine that only applicable 
costs are capitalised and that the carrying value of the 
asset at each reporting period is supported by the net 
present value of future cash flows to be derived from it. 
Inappropriate capitalisation  
of costs would improve 
profitability as costs would be 
put on the balance sheet rather 
than expensed through the 
income statement.
The carrying value of internally 
generated software is £20.9m  
(2013: £19.7m). £8.0m was 
capitalised in the year (2013: £5.5m).
Additions of £5.0m (2013: £3.7m) 
were made in the year relating to 
the ongoing development and 
regionalisation of the Group’s  
core Insurer/Enterprise asset.  
The closing net book value of the 
Insurer/Enterprise asset was £16.5m 
(2013: £16.9m).
Exercise of warrants over Nobilas France by AXA 
As part of the disposal of 30% of Nobilas France to 
Vendomes Participations 3, a subsidiary of AXA, two 
separate warrants were issued which entitle Vendomes 
Participations 3 to acquire up to a further 19% stake in 
Nobilas France if certain volume targets are met over a 
consecutive 12-month period. A volume rebate will be 
payable if either or both of these warrants are exercised. 
This is disclosed in more detail on page 115. 
Judgement is required in assessing the likelihood of these 
warrants being exercised and hence whether a provision 
should be recognised. 
Incorrect judgement arising from 
optimism that the warrants are 
likely to be recognised would 
have the impact of reducing 
revenue and profits through 
recognition of a provision. 
Likewise, if this judgement is too 
pessimistic, this will have the 
reverse effect.
The potential rebate payable to 
Vendomes Participations 3 if both 
warrants are exercised totals 
€2.9m (£2.3m). 
The Group considers it probable that 
the first warrant will be exercised and 
remote that the second rebate will 
be exercised. 
As such, accrual is being made in 
connection with the first warrant, 
see note 32.

Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in the current year 
The accounting policies adopted in these Consolidated Financial Statements are consistent with those of the financial statements for the 
year ended 30 September 2013 except for the adoption of new standards, amendments to the standards and interpretations which are 
mandatory for the financial year ending 30 September 2014. All effective dates shown below are those given within the IFRS as adopted by 
the European Union. The Group will apply these new standards, amendments and interpretations in the first accounting period following 
the effective date.
Standard Effective date
IFRS 7 Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IFRS 7 1 January 2013
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised) 1 January 2013
There has been no material impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements from the adoption of these IFRS.
Amendments to existing standards and interpretations that are deemed to be applicable to the Group, that are not yet effective 
and have not been early adopted by the Group
Standard Effective date
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement 1 January 2018
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, 1 January 2014
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2016

IAS 27 Equity method in Separate Financial Statements – Amendments to IAS 27 1 January 2016
IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32 1 January 2014
Management have assessed the potential impact of the above amendments and interpretations on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group. The majority of these are not expected to have any impact. The Group does have certain cell captive structures 
which are 100% owned and equity accounted for under IAS 27 in note 16. We have completed our assessment of the elements of control 
as defined by IFRS 10. We have concluded that there will be no impact to the adjusted profit or the net assets of the Group of 
implementing the new standard.

1 Included in rendering of services is a revenue rebate of £166,000 (2013: £nil) which is related to the warrants discussed in note 32, and which is added back to adjusted profit.
No revenue was derived from exchanges of goods or services (2013: nil).
4. Segment information
The Group is organised into regional business units and a central cost centre. The Group has six reportable operating segments which are 
separately disclosed together with a central cost centre which includes unallocated corporate costs, expensed development costs and 
transfer pricing royalties. Operating segments have been aggregated where the aggregation criteria have been met. More specifically, 
Asia Pacific includes Australia, India, Pakistan and Japan, the Rest of Europe includes France, Spain and Benelux and North America 
includes the US and Canada. 
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on adjusted profit which is the Group’s internal 
principal measure of profit. Segment revenue excludes transactions between business segments. Segment adjusted profit as reflected in 
the tables within this note, includes both royalty charges and transfer pricing adjustments for reallocating corporate costs to the regional 
business units. Management does not monitor the balance sheets of its business units separately for the purposes of making decisions 
and therefore segmental assets, additions to non-current assets and segmental liabilities have not been disclosed. Non-current assets in 
the segmental disclosure comprise investments, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The Group’s revenues are derived from the following products and services:
• Motor Business Process Services (BPS) and networks;
• Property Business Process Services (BPS) and networks;
• Other Business Process Services (BPS) and networks; and
• Software.

Total exceptional items included within administrative expenses 5,677 346
 
Year ended 30 September 2014
Exceptional costs on acquisition relate to the deal costs incurred on the three acquisitions completed during the year (see note 17) and 
costs incurred in respect of aborted deals. Further costs have been incurred in the current year relating to the settlement of contingent 
consideration in relation to the GVS and Teledesk prior year acquisitions (see note 17). These expenses have resulted from the difference 
between the fair value probability weighted estimation of the expected contingent consideration liability and the final cash settlement of 
this liability. 
The majority of other exceptional costs related to restructuring activity in the year. In Europe the Motor and Property BPS divisions were 
significantly restructured following the acquisitions of Crashworth and LAS made during the first half of the year. The restructuring in 
Australia is in connection with the costs of closure of one of the entities in the motor business. The BPS restructuring in North America  
is in relation to the relocation of one office. Following the appointment of Paul Nichols in the year as the new head of our global software 
business, there has been restructuring activity in both the UK and North America Technology divisions. The restructuring in South Africa 
is to separate the regulated and non-regulated parts of the business. 
Year ended 30 September 2013
Exceptional costs incurred on acquisition relate to the deal costs incurred on the three acquisitions completed in the year and disclosed 
as part of note 17. These costs have been included in operating expenses in the income statement. 
Other exceptional costs relate to redundancy and compromise costs incurred due to a restructuring of the BPS motor divisions within 
North America and Australia. 
The release of contingent consideration no longer due on acquisition of subsidiary of £0.4m relates to amounts no longer owed to the 
previous owner of Wintec AG, acquired in 2011, due to performance targets for the year ended 30 September 2013 not being met in line 
with the sale and purchase agreement. This is not considered, however, to have any impact on the carrying value of any goodwill or 
intangible assets held in relation to this acquisition (see notes 14 and 15). 
The exceptional income recognised relates to management’s best estimates of the future cash flows of the partial sublet of property 
previously accounted for as an onerous lease.

The movement from a deferred tax asset of £1.1m at 30 September 2013 to a deferred tax liability of £1.9m at 30 September 2014 is 
largely driven by deferred tax liabilities recognised in relation to the three acquisitions detailed in note 17, of £6.8m, including a liability  
of £3.4m in relation to deferred taxable income within Driven Solutions Inc. This was partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax liability 
through the income statement of £3.8m.
The Group’s usual policy is to look forward one accounting period when assessing future utilisation of deferred tax assets. However, 
where territories have proven to be profitable, a deferred tax asset has been recognised on the basis that a longer forecast period of 
utilisation is probable and can be justified by a consistent underlying business. The deferred tax asset recognised at 30 September 2014  
is £3,803,000 (2013: £5,435,000). 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. The Finance Act 2013, 
which included a reduction in the UK corporate income tax rate to 20% from 1 April 2015 was enacted on 17 July 2013 and so the 
Company will consider these rates when scheduling the reversal of the temporary differences to determine the appropriate closing rate 
to apply to the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
It is likely that the majority of the unremitted overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemption introduced by Finance Act 
2009 and therefore no tax liability is expected to arise on the repatriation of the earnings from overseas subsidiaries and associates.

Unutilised deferred tax assets largely relate to carried forward tax losses which are available for offset against future profits of the 
companies in which the losses have arisen. These assets have not been recognised on the basis that there is insufficient evidence that  
the asset will be recoverable at the balance sheet date. The assets will only be recognised with improved predictability of taxable profits.

14. Goodwill continued
Goodwill is allocated to a regional CGU as either BPS or software unless the acquisition is not immediately integrated into the existing 
businesses of that CGU. In which case, goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to its own separate CGU until such a time that the 
business is integrated.
Impairment test for goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to CGUs. The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of 
goodwill using value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, EBITA and the 
future growth rate of net operating cash flows. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts for these CGUs based on the most recent annual budgets approved by the Board. These are 
based upon detailed budgets for the coming year and internal forecasts of future growth over a five year period and cash flows beyond 
the five year period are extrapolated using expected growth rates. Further information on the assumptions used within the major CGUs is 
detailed below.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The calculation of value in use for all of the business units is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
• EBITA;
• discount rates; and
• growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period. 
EBITA is derived from management budgets which are based upon both past performance and experience together with changes 
anticipated following expected developments within each location and operating segment. EBITA is defined as operating profit after 
adding back amortisation, share based payments and exceptional items. 
Discount rates reflect management’s estimation of the rate of return that would be expected from a rational investor over the period of 
the forecast, should the CGU be independent of the Group’s capital structure. In determining these rates management has reflected 
specific risks relating to the relevant operating segments. Specific details of the discount rates for each CGU are provided below.
Growth rate estimates for a five year period, are based on sensitised management forecasts. The standard growth estimates for years 
two to five are mainly in the range of 3% to 10%. For specific CGUs, where management have historical data which supports a different 
growth rate, the historical growth rate previously achieved in similar CGUs has been used to inform the future growth rate assumptions 
used, giving consideration to current market conditions. The terminal growth rate used is 1%. Further information is provided below for 
specific rates used for each of the CGUs.

Further details on the main CGUs with material goodwill balances are detailed below:
UK, Software – This CGU represents all cash flows for software sales of the Group on the basis that the intellectual property in regards 
to Innovation Insurer is held in the UK and the related sales of the product within region are wholly dependent on the asset within the UK. 
The growth rate used is 10%, which reflects the minimum future growth expected by management for the business. The cash flows for 
the software business for 2015 reflect increased sales of Insurer in the UK, North America and Australia. Cash flows in regards to North 
America and Australia are based on royalty income due to international sales of the Insurer suite of products. 
UK, BPS – This CGU represents pre 1 October 2004 acquisitions and all fully integrated acquisitions since that date. The growth rate used 
is 3% which reflects the minimum growth expected by management for the business. Management is of the view that the underlying cash 
flows of the Motor and Property operations are significantly linked therefore operate as a single CGU.
Germany, BPS – This CGU represents pre 1 October 2004 acquisitions and all fully integrated acquisitions since that date. The growth 
rate used is 3% which is based on historical data and the expected minimum future growth expected by management for the business. 
Management is of the view that the underlying cash flows of the Motor and Property operations are significantly linked and therefore 
operate as a single CGU.
RoE, BPS – This CGU predominantly represents the European operations acquired under the Nobilas banner in December 2007 and all 
fully integrated acquisitions since that date. The growth rate used is 5% which is underpinned by the expected continued growth from our 
partnership with AXA.
North America, BPS – This CGU represents the acquisitions made in prior years together with the Driven business acquired in 2014. 
Management is of the view that the underlying cash flows of the Motor and Property operations are significantly linked and therefore 
operate as a single CGU. The growth rate used is 5% which is underpinned by the strong pipeline available and the enhanced growth of  
the Motor business as a whole from the integration of the Driven business.
Asia Pacific, BPS – This CGU represents the acquisitions made in prior years. The growth rates used for 2016 to 2018 are reflective of  
the future growth expected by management for the business, based upon the impact of two transformational contract wins which are 
included in the board approved 2015 budget, and which will continue to ramp up through to 2018.
Discount rates
For all gross and individual CGUs, the discount rates used have been derived using each specific CGU’s WACC which reflects 
management’s assessment of the risks relating to each specific CGU and have excluded the risks relating to the Group as a whole.  
The discount rates used are all pre-tax rates. The discount rate used for the Software CGU has increased and the discount rate for the  
UK BPS CGU has decreased in the year to reflect changes in the underlying businesses. However, in neither case has this led to any 
impairment of goodwill and there remains significant headroom in place for both of these CGUs. 94

14. Goodwill continued
Sensitivities
As outlined in the Accountability part of the Corporate Governance section of the Directors’ report, the risk of benign weather conditions, 
as well as economic decline in a region could impact a regions performance and hence the cash flows attributed to it.
In regards to all CGUs, management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions used to calculate the cash 
flows that would cause any impairment to goodwill.
Impairment
There was no impairment to goodwill during the current or prior year.

Investments in associates accounted for under the equity method
The Group has a 100% shareholding in a cell captive structure which is part of Guardrisk Insurance Company Limited (registered in  
South Africa). As the Group has no control over the financial and operating policies of the cell it has not been consolidated. The Group 
does have a significant influence over the cell and it is therefore accounted for as an associate using the equity method of accounting.  
The Group’s share of net profit has been brought into the income statement with the investment carried at the equity value in the balance 
sheet. The cell is a Special Purpose Entity (‘SPE’) as defined by SIC 12. The SPE writes motor warranty policies which are a regulated 
contract under South African law.

17. Business combinations
Year ended 30 September 2014
In addition to the business combinations mentioned below, a small acquisition was completed in our South African business in the year for 
total cash consideration of ZAR8m (£0.4m), with no material impact on the Group’s income statement and balance sheet. This acquisition 
has not been commented upon any further in this report.
17a. Crashworth Limited
On 31 January 2014, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Crashworth Limited (‘CW’) for a maximum cash consideration of 
£11.75m plus a provisional working capital adjustment of £0.2m. 
£5.0m was paid on completion with the remaining balance payable over the course of the period to 31 December 2015. £1.75m of 
deferred consideration was paid on 1 April 2014, with a further £1.75m of deferred consideration due to be paid on 31 December 2014. 
£0.2m was paid in the period in relation to the provisional working capital adjustment.
A further £1.25m is payable contingent on profit performance of Crashworth for the 12 months ending 30 September 2014, with a final 
contingent payment due of £2.0m depending on the profit performance of UK Motor in the twelve months ending 30 September 2015.  
As these payments are dependent upon the continued employment of the vendor in the UK Motor business, these payments are to be 
treated as compensation, rather than consideration, and will be expensed to operating expenses in future periods. The first tranche of 
contingent compensation of £1.25m has been accrued in full at 30 September 2014 as the performance condition has been met.
Transaction costs were £0.1m and have been expensed and included in operating expenses. See note 5 for further detail.
The goodwill arising from this acquisition is £4.2m and consists of the enhanced offering to the Group’s current and future customers.  
CW manages an established and efficient motor repair network. The acquisition will enable the Group to move closer to realising its 
objective to transform its Motor business into the number one motor claims management business in the UK in terms of client 
experience, customer experience, operational efficiency and profitability. The acquisition also introduces into the Group’s offering a 
consultancy proposition for those clients seeking to gain competitive advantage in a fast changing environment. 
Intangible assets recognised of £5.4m represent customer relationships and have been allocated a maximum useful economic life of  
five years, in line with the contractual terms present. 
From the date of acquisition to 30 September 2014, CW contributed £1.7m revenue and £1.4m profit after tax to the results of the Group. 
If the combination had happened at the beginning of the year, assuming results are linear, the consolidated profit of the Group would have 
increased by £0.5m and revenues from continuing operations would have increased by £0.6m.

17b. LAS Claims Management Limited
On 13 March 2014, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Broomco 4421 Limited, the immediate parent company of LAS Claims 
Management Limited (‘LAS’) for a maximum cash consideration of £35.0m. 
£33.8m was paid on completion, including £13.0m paid in regards to the settlement of shareholders loan and interest which is included  
in the net liabilities acquired below, with a further £1.2m which has been deferred for certain members of the shareholder base who 
remain as management in the business. This is due for payment in March 2016. The goodwill arising from this acquisition consists of  
the enhanced offering to the Group’s current and future customers, introducing the capability to handle claims in relation to wet perils.  
LAS’s operations and service offerings are highly complementary to the existing UK Property business. It is therefore expected that the 
combination of the two businesses will generate both significant revenue synergies and operational leverage.
LAS provides its customers with a full suite of outsourced services that handle claims across a range of property-related perils including 
storm, burst pipes, flood, fire, theft and accidental damage. The vast majority of LAS’s revenue comes from water-related claims: also 
known in the insurance industry as wet perils. The addition of wet perils skills and capabilities to the Group’s service portfolio completes a 
key strategic goal for the Group, and will increase the UK Property division’s addressable property market from a claims spend of £100m 
– currently available for its traditional subsidence (or dry perils) market – to £1.3bn. Over time, the Group will also be able to replicate this 
business model in other geographies it currently serves. 
LAS’s approach allows insurers to incorporate their own third party supply chain and their own software systems into the claim process, 
providing them with full transparency and enabling them to offer an enhanced service to their own customers. LAS also has the capability 
to manage the complete process of a given claim or a particular aspect of the claim, dependent upon its client’s requirements. 
Transaction costs were £0.6m and have been expensed and included in operating expenses. See note 5 for further detail.
From the date of acquisition to 30 September 2014, LAS contributed £5.1m revenue and £0.1m profit after tax to the results of the group. 
If the combination had happened at the beginning of the year, assuming results are linear, the consolidated profit of the Group would have 
increased by £0.1m and revenues from continuing operations would have increased by £4.3m. 98

The intangible assets acquired represent customer relationships of £3.6m and a Building Repair Network of £1.7m, both allocated a 
maximum useful life of up to eight years, and Intellectual Property of £1.5m, allocated a maximum useful life of up to five years.
The fair values prescribed are considered to be provisional given the length of time that the business has been part of the Group and  
are expected to be presented as final as part of the Group’s 2015 interim financial statements.

17c. Driven Solutions Inc
On 22 September 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Driven Solutions Inc (“Driven”) and its 
associated companies for total cash consideration of $7.2m (£4.3m), the acquisition had an effective date of 31 August 2014. Of the total 
consideration, $0.9m (£0.7m) has been paid on completion, with the remainder withheld by the Group to settle a pre-closing deferred tax 
liability which has been assumed on acquisition and will be settled over the next two to four years.
Driven works with approximately 30,000 towing and roadside assistance providers to deliver services to government entities, fleet 
providers, insurers and credit card membership programs across North America. 
 
The acquisition provides the Group’s US BPS business with access to a high quality, effective tow and roadside national network and 
enhances its offering to both Insurance and Fleet clients in North America. It also has the benefit of broadening Innovation Group’s 
product set and increasing margins from the supply chain in line with our stated strategic aims. Key management are to remain with the 
business.
Transaction costs were $0.3m (£0.2m) and have been expensed and included in operating expenses. See note 5 for further detail.
From the effective date of acquisition to 30 September 2014, Driven contributed $1.3m/£0.8m revenue and $0.3m/£0.2m profit after tax 
to the results of the Group. If the combination happened at the beginning of the year, assuming results are linear, the consolidated profit 
of the Group would have increased by £1.8m and revenues from continuing operations would have increased by £8.8m.
The goodwill of $7.2m (£4.4m) arising from the acquisition consists of the enhanced offering to the Group’s current and future customers, 
adding to the Group’s existing BPS capability in North America.
The intangible assets acquired represent customer contracts of $0.8m (£0.5m), allocated a maximum useful life of up to ten years, and 
customer relationships of $0.6m (£0.4m) and intellectual property of $2.8m (£1.7m), both allocated a maximum useful life of up to five 
years. The fair values prescribed are considered to be provisional given the length of time that the business has been part of the Group 
and are expected to be presented as final as part of the Group’s 2015 interim financial statements. The trade and other receivables value 
presented below is shown net of an allowance for doubtful debts of $0.4m (£0.3m).

17d. Sachcontrol
On 1 November 2012, the Group acquired the trade and assets of a division of Sachcontrol for total cash consideration of €1.5m (£1.2m). 
The division of Sachcontrol acquired provides loss adjusting services for large value claims to insurers, predominantly in the eastern 
German market. As a result of the acquisition, when added to our existing business handling low value claims in the western part of 
Germany, the Group expects to increase its potential for growth within the property claims handling sector across the whole geography 
of the German market. 
The consideration of €1.5m (£1.2m) comprises an initial payment of €1.0m (£0.8m) on completion of the acquisition, €0.2m (£0.2m) to  
be paid upon delivery of specific financial information and €0.3m (£0.2m) contingent consideration based on the results of the business 
for the 12 months ended 31 December 2012. This has been paid in full by 30 September 2013. 
Transaction costs were £0.02m and have been expensed and included in operating expenses. See note 5 for further detail. 
From the date of the acquisition to 30 September 2013, Sachcontrol contributed €0.9m (£0.8m) revenue and €0.2m (£0.2m) profit after 
tax to the results of the Group. If the combination had happened at the beginning of the year, assuming profits are linear, the consolidated 
profit of the Group would have been increased by £0.02m and revenue from continuing operations by £0.1m. 
The goodwill of €1.0m (£0.8m) arising from the acquisition consists of the enhanced offering to the Group’s current and future 
customers, adding to the Group’s existing capability in Germany and synergistic benefits of having coverage across the whole of 
Germany, rather than predominantly in the western part of the country. 
The intangible assets acquired represent customer relationships and have been allocated a maximum useful life of up to three years.

17e. Innovation Connect Enterprise
On 4 January 2013, the Group acquired the activities, inputs and processes, including the intellectual property rights to, and the 
associated revenue streams connected to body shop subscription contracts of, Innovation Connect Enterprise (‘ICE’) for cash 
consideration of €2.5m (£2.1m). 
ICE is a body shop and supply chain performance management tool, which enables repairers to provide excellent quality, customer 
service and deliver cost savings in the motor insurance claim cycle. Repairers are charged a monthly subscription fee for access to  
this tool. 
The consideration of €2.5m (£2.1m) comprises a single fixed cash payment paid on the date of acquisition. No further amounts are  
due to the vendors in deferred or contingent consideration. 
From the date of the acquisition to 30 September 2013, ICE contributed €0.6m (£0.5m) revenue and €0.4m (£0.3m) profit after tax to  
the results of the Group. If the combination had happened at the beginning of the year, assuming profits are linear, the consolidated  
profit of the Group would have been increased by £0.1m and revenue from continuing operations by £0.2m. 
The goodwill of €1.5m (£1.2m) arising from the acquisition consists of the enhanced offering to the Group’s current and future customers, 
expanding upon the existing services in France and the rest of Europe and the future earnings to be generated from this. 
The intangible assets acquired represent the intellectual property rights to the ICE software.

17f. Gemini Vehicle Solutions
On 9 April 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Gemini Vehicle Solutions (‘GVS’) for total maximum cash consideration 
of £4.5m. 
GVS is a leading provider of motor claims management solutions in the UK, including third party intervention services and vehicle repair 
solutions. As a result of the acquisition, the Group has a broader service set to offer within the motor claims handling sector of the UK 
market, as well as the potential for growth within Australia. 
The maximum consideration of £4.5m comprises £3.0m paid on completion and a further £1.5m contingent on certain volume targets 
being met in the 12 months following acquisition. As required by IFRS 3, the contingent consideration has been probability weighted by 
£0.2m to reflect management’s best estimate to the likelihood of settlement, meaning that the contingent consideration disclosed in the 
table below is £1.3m. £0.8m of this contingent amount has been paid since the balance sheet date. The remainder is likely to be settled 
during the second half of the next financial year. 
Transaction costs of £0.05m have been expensed and are included within operating expenses. See note 5 for further detail. 
From the date of the acquisition to 30 September 2013, GVS contributed £1.2m of revenue and £0.4m of profit after tax to the results  
of the Group. If the combination had happened at the beginning of the year, assuming profits are linear, the consolidated profit of the 
Group would have been increased by £0.4m and revenue from continuing operations by £1.2m. 
The goodwill of £3.0m arising from the acquisition consists of the enhanced offering to the Group’s current and future customers, 
expanding upon the existing services in the UK and the future earnings to be generated from this wider skill set.

Solutions Limited for £2.3m in consideration which was paid in 10,519,172 freely available shares (note 28). 
This has resulted in the de-recognition of the carrying value of the non-controlling interest at the date of disposal of £2.0m and a loss 
recognised through retained earnings of £0.3m, as no additions can be made to goodwill on the increase of this investment. 
17h. Value Partners N.V.
On 12 June 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Value Partners N.V. (“VP”), the holding company of Teledesk and 
Teledesk Claims Management (“Teledesk”). Teledesk is a provider of “round the clock” helpdesk services on a subscription basis to  
the insurance industry in Belgium, including brokers, insurers and related financial services companies. 
In the year ended 30 September 2014 £675,000 of cash was paid and £480,000 of shares were issued in respect of contingent 
consideration. There is £114,000 of contingent consideration remaining in other payables at the year end. 102

Year ended 30 September 2014
No shareholdings were disposed of in the year ended 30 September 2014.
Year ended 30 September 2013
18a. Nobilas France SAS
On 29 April 2013, the Group disposed of 30% of its shareholding in Nobilas France SAS to Vendomes Participations 3 (‘VP3’), a subsidiary 
of AXA France, for €3.45m (£2.9m) cash consideration received in full on the date of disposal. 
At the date of disposal, the net assets of Nobilas France SAS totalled approximately €6.0m (£5.0m). The disposal of 30% of Nobilas France 
SAS resulted in the immediate recognition of a non-controlling interest of approximately €2.1m (£1.8m), representing a €1.8m (£1.5m) 
allocation of net assets and an allocation of goodwill to the non-controlling interest of €0.3m (£0.3m). £0.1m of cumulative foreign 
exchange losses was also allocated to the non-controlling interest at that time. This leaves a gain on disposal of €1.2m/£1.1m. 
Transaction costs incurred as part of the disposal totalled €0.1m (£0.1m). This gain is reflected in retained earnings and is disclosed 
separately within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. 
As part of the sale agreement with VP3, there are warrants in place which entitle VP3 to increase its shareholding in Nobilas France SAS if 
certain volume targets are met over a rolling 12-month period by April 2023. Further detail on this is included in note 32 on page 115. 
18b. Travest Investments Pty
Effective 1 June 2013, the Group disposed of its entire shareholding of its subsidiary Travest Investments Pty (‘Travest’) for approximately 
R59m (£4.0m). Travest is the holding company of Travel Insurance Consultants (‘TIC’), which operated the region’s travel insurance 
business. 
Prior to disposal, the Group increased its effective shareholding in TIC from 53% to 62%, which was settled through the payment of cash 
of R14m (£0.9m). This resulted in a loss on increase in shareholding of R10m (£0.7m) and derecognition of non-controlling interests of 
R2m (£0.2m).
At the date of disposal, the net assets of Travest, inclusive of cash of R15m (£1.0m), goodwill of R13m (£1.0m) and intangible assets of 
R6m (£0.4m), totalled approximately R21m (£1.4m). The net cash inflow for the Group was approximately R43m (£3.0m), due to the  
cash disposed of as part of the transaction. The disposal of Travest resulted in the immediate de-recognition of non-controlling interests 
of R22m (£1.5m), total goodwill of R49m (£3.2m) and total intangible assets of R17m (£1.2m). This resulted in a profit on disposal of 
approximately R12m (£0.8m), after deduction of deal costs of R1m (£0.1m), which has been removed as part of the Group’s presentation 
of Adjusted Profit. Net assets of Travest were materially the same at the point of disposal as they were at the point of acquisition; hence 
no material foreign exchange was identified for recycling from the foreign exchange reserve.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and on average have 30 to 60 day settlement terms. The credit quality of the trade receivables 
is considered by management to be very good as a high proportion of customers are large global companies with whom the Group trades 
on a long-term basis. Management do not consider that there is a significant concentration of credit risk due to the spread of trade 
receivables across the global business.
Other debtors includes £853,000 (2013: £466,000) owed to the Group by ETSIA Digital Inc, a company in which the Group has a  
3.5% investment.

On-risk contracts currently fall into two categories: subsidence contracts and service and maintenance plan contracts.
a Subsidence contracts
In order to manage the risks around these contracts, each individual subsidence claim is assessed for possible repudiation and total 
potential exposure to costs if it is not possible to repudiate the claim. Analysis is performed on a regular basis to ensure that there are 
adequate funds available to cover the assessed potential exposure to costs. This includes an assessment of costs to complete on a 
contract by contract basis. If this percentage remains below 100%, then there are sufficient funds to cover the potential future costs.  
In both the current and previous financial years, the percentage is below 100%. The insurance company is invoiced in advance for claims 
so cash is always available to meet the repair costs. All claims handled since 2006 are backed with reinsurance as part of the contract  
with the customer to limit the exposure of the Group to an acceptable level.
b Service and maintenance plans
In order to manage the risks around these contracts all vehicles are assessed in terms of make, model, age and distance driven to date. 
Service plan contracts are only sold for vehicles if the above criteria fall within set parameters. 
Fund burn analyses are performed periodically to ensure that there are adequate funds available to pay future expected claims. If this 
percentage remains below 100%, then the fund is sufficient to cover future claims. In both the current and previous financial years,  
the percentage is below 100%.

The Group has on-risk contracts for both service and maintenance plans. The ratio at the end of the year is 81% (2013: 84%) service  
and 19% (2013: 16%) maintenance. As these plans can be priced accurately due to parts having to be replaced at specific intervals,  
risk due to uncertainty is mitigated to satisfactory levels.
Both service and maintenance plans expire on the earlier of either the fixed length of the plan or the distance limit being reached. 
These contracts are not reinsured as management believe it is possible to price the contracts very accurately.

Borrowings comprise bank loans and finance leases: 
Bank loans
The Group has a revolving credit facility of £50.0m available, of which £26.7m was undrawn as at 30 September 2014 (2013: £30.0m 
revolving credit facility with £8.0m undrawn) and is secured against the assets and liabilities of material subsidiaries of the Group apart 
from the South African business. The loan bears interest at 1.85% above LIBOR, which is paid at the end of each draw down period.  
This is disclosed in full as borrowings not falling due until after one year in line with the expiry date of the facility of September 2019.  
£0.9m of fees in relation to the facility has been allocated against this balance, therefore reducing the overall loan balance. 
As part of the terms and conditions of the bank loans, the Group has to satisfy a number of covenants on a quarterly basis. The Group  
is not in breach of the covenants at the date of the approval of the financial statements or at any point during the financial year, and is  
not forecast to breach the covenants going forward.
Finance leases
Finance leases held by the Group primarily relate to the rental of fixtures and fittings and computer equipment for Group companies to 
utilise in the course of their business. The leases cover periods of between two to five years and are payable under terms with equal 
monthly or quarterly instalments. There are no other significant restrictions in place in regards to these assets.

and small cases in relation to employment disputes. 
NI on share options 
The share option provision reflects the Directors’ estimate of the employer’s national insurance and other similar tax liabilities arising  
on outstanding share options. This is expected to be utilised over the upcoming 36 month period. 
Property leases
The property lease provision relates to the differential between the onerous element of the lease contract and the rental income  
received from sub-letting part of the empty property. The provision is expected to be utilised over the period to the end of the lease  
in August 2018. 
27. Financial instruments
Objectives, policies and strategies
The Group’s objective has been to finance acquisitions through new capital, cash reserves and borrowings. Investments in intangible  
fixed assets and property, plant and equipment have been made through cash and finance lease borrowings.
The Group’s policy towards using financial instruments is to manage credit, interest rate, liquidity and currency exposure risk without 
exposing the Group to undue risk or speculation. The policy is kept under review by the directors according to the Group’s foreign 
exchange and treasury policy.

Risk management
The risks arising from the Group’s operations are explained below.
Credit risk
The Group monitors its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Cash investments are only allowed in liquid securities with major 
financial institutions that satisfy specific criteria. The maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date is represented by the 
carrying value of financial assets and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk. 
Interest rate risk 
Interest bearing financial assets comprises cash. Interest bearing financial liabilities comprise net obligations under finance leases and 
bank loans used to fund previous acquisitions. The Group currently relies on the natural hedge of financial assets versus financial liabilities 
to manage the risk arising from changes to floating interest rates in the majority of cases and it is generally the policy of the Group to hold 
assets under floating interest rates. 
The interest rate risk is for cash and cash equivalents and bank loans only. All other financial assets are non-interest bearing. Interest on 
floating rate assets is based on the relevant national inter-bank rates, with short-term deposits being made for varying periods of 
between one and three months depending upon the immediate cash requirements of the Group. During the year interest rates on these 
assets ranged from 0.5% to 5.9% depending on the type of account and the location of the Group entity. Finance leases are held at fixed 
rates and as such bear no interest rate risk.
Capital risk 
The Group defines its capital as the Group’s total equity, including non-controlling interests. Its objectives when managing capital are to 
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, to provide an adequate return to 
investors based upon the level of risk undertaken, to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas 
that may deliver future benefit to investors and maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate risks and unforeseen events. The total 
equity of the Group increased significantly in the year, which improves the Group’s capital position.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debts.
Gearing
The Group’s gearing ratio is calculated on the basis of the level of total debt against total equity. This is calculated as follows:
2014 
£’000
2013
 £’000
Total debt 23,705 23,322
Capital reserves attributable to shareholders 193,801 126,738
Non-controlling interests 4,018 3,894
Total equity 197,819 130,632
Gearing ratio 12.0% 17.9%
The Group manages capital on the basis of the level of net cash held and on the equity ratio, which is calculated as equity (including 
non-controlling interest) as a percentage of total assets. The Group’s capital and equity ratio are detailed below:
2014 
£’000
2013 
£’000
Capital reserves attributable to shareholders 193,801 126,738
Non-controlling interests 4,018 3,894
Total equity 197,819 130,632
Total assets 333,971 250,052
Equity ratio 59.2% 52.2%
Liquidity risk
The Group’s funds are principally held either as cash or short-term money market investments with a number of different major banking 
institutions. Throughout the year the Group policy has been to maintain a mix of short and medium term borrowings with their lenders.  
This flexibility is achieved by the use of the Group’s revolving credit facility. At the year end, this facility was due to expire in September 2019. 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserves (comprising any undrawn borrowing facility (note 25) and cash 
and cash equivalents (note 21)) on the basis of expected cash flow. The Group’s liquidity management policy includes reviewing cash flows 
in major currencies and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against 
internal key performance indicators and external covenant requirements and maintaining debt financing plans.
The Group may choose to settle contingent consideration earlier than contractually due, if there is persuasive evidence that the 
conditions pertaining to the contingent consideration will be met. This is unlikely to significantly alter the amount to be paid, other than  
a discount for early settlement, but would lead to earlier maturity than disclosed within the table on the next page.  108

Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
Fair value is considered to be materially equivalent to book value for the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, where items are short-term 
in nature, including cash, trade payables and other contractual liabilities. The borrowings relate to fixed and floating rate instruments. 
There have been no events that would impact the credit risk encountered by the Group since the revolving credit facility was taken out, 
therefore book value is deemed to equate to fair value. 
A summary of the fair values and book values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is noted below.

Currency risk
Currency exposure arises through intra-group loans and trading balances throughout all Group locations. Natural hedging is employed,  
to the extent possible, to minimise net exposures. 
Currency exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional 
currency of the operating unit involved. In general all overseas operating units trade and hold asset and liabilities in their functional 
currency. The parent company has long-term intercompany loans designated in foreign currency. As these are of a long-term nature, 
these are treated as quasi-equity and as such any foreign exchange arising is taken straight to reserves. Any foreign exchange incurred  
on trading loans is taken through the income statement. 
Sensitivities
The following table details the Group’s sensitivities to a change in Sterling against the respective foreign currencies. The sensitivities 
represent management’s assessment of the effect on monetary assets and liabilities of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the year end has been determined based on the assumption 
that the change is effective throughout the financial year and all other variables remain constant.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and other components of equity where Sterling weakens against  
the respective currencies. A strengthening of Sterling would have the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables  
remain constant.

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to changes of 1% in interest rates throughout the year, with all other variables  
remaining constant.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and equity (net assets) where interest rates rise. A fall in interest rates 
would have the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables remain constant. The assets and liabilities included in  
this analysis are those which attract a floating interest rate.

29. Employee share schemes
The Group operates five equity settled share based payment arrangements: the Global Share Option and Incentive Plan, the 
Performance Share Plan, the Key Executive Recruitment and Key Executive Retention Plan, the 2011 Retention Plan and the UK, US and 
International Sharesave Scheme. 
The main terms of the five employee share schemes are as follows:
Global share option and incentive plan
Options granted under this scheme have historically been to senior executives and management across the Group, as well as to staff  
with high potential or to recognise significant achievements. Under this scheme options will usually vest after between two and five years 
and be exercisable between two and ten years following grant, provided that the employee remains in employment at the date of exercise. 
Options issued up to 16 March 2004 have no performance conditions attached. Awards issued after this date will vest and become 
exercisable between the given dates if EPS growth, adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles, share based payment charges  
and any adjustments required in respect of exceptional gains or charges that may arise as made at the discretion of the remuneration 
committee, exceeds 3% per annum. The base EPS is that for the year ended 30 September 2004. Future options under this scheme will 
vest based on EPS growth plus 10%. No awards have been granted under this scheme in the current or prior year.

Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
Options under this scheme are made to senior executives and managers across the Group. The options will vest subject to meeting the 
two performance conditions. 
In regards to awards made from 2010 to 2012, vesting of up to 50% of the award is based upon the Group’s Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) relative to the TSR of a comparator group of other companies comprising the software and computer services and the support 
services sector of the FTSE, over a three year performance period. If the Group’s TSR growth ranks below the 50th percentile over the 
three year period 0% of the award will vest. At the 50th percentile 15% will vest and at 75% or above, 50% will vest. Between the 50th and 
75th percentile vesting will occur on a straight-line basis. Vesting of the remaining 50% of the award will be subject to the growth of the 
Group’s adjusted EPS. 15% of an award will vest for total adjusted EPS growth of 12% above RPI over the performance period, with 50%  
of an award vesting for total adjusted EPS growth of 45% or more above RPI over the performance period. Between these points,  
vesting will occur on a straight-line basis. 
In regards to the awards made in March 2013, May 2013 and July 2013, the vesting of the TSR element of the award is as described above. 
Vesting of the remaining 50% of the award remains subject to the growth of the Group’s adjusted EPS. The EPS performance conditions 
requires the adjusted EPS for the financial year ending 30 September 2015 to be 1.89p, where 50% of the award will vest, with 100% of the 
award vesting at 2.24p. Between these points, vesting will occur on a straight-line basis. These targets have been reduced from 1.90p and 
2.25p respectively following the firm placing and open offer that occurred on 13 March 2014. 
In regards to the awards made in March 2014, May 2014 and July 2014, the vesting of the TSR element of the award is as described above. 
Vesting of the remaining 50% of the award remains subject to the growth of the Group’s adjusted EPS. 15% of an award will vest for total 
adjusted EPS growth of 45% above RPI over the performance period, with 50% of an award vesting for total adjusted EPS growth of 100% 
or more above RPI over the performance period. Between these points, vesting will occur on a straight-line basis. 
 
Key Executive Recruitment Plan and Key Executive Retention Plan (‘RRP’)
Executive Directors only are eligible for awards under the RRP to facilitate recruitment and retention. Two-thirds of the initial award (the 
‘first tranche’) vest to the extent to which adjusted EPS growth exceeded RPI growth over the three year period ending with the financial 
year of the Company ending 30 September 2013. No awards will vest until adjusted EPS growth is RPI+ 12%. At RPI+ 12%, 30% will vest 
and at RPI+ 45% 100% of the awards will vest. Vesting will occur pro-rata on a straight-line basis between 30% and 100% between these 
amounts. One third of each such initial award (the ‘second tranche’) will ordinarily vest to the extent to which adjusted EPS growth 
exceeds RPI growth over the same timeframe. No awards will vest until adjusted EPS growth is RPI+ 45%. At RPI+ 45%, 0% will vest and  
at RPI+ 100%, 100% of the awards will vest. Vesting will occur pro rata on a straight-line basis between these amounts. All awards under 
this plan have vested as at the date of this report. No awards have been made during the financial year or to the date of this report.
2011 Retention Plan (‘2011 Plan’)
Options under this scheme were made to the Executive Directors to facilitate retention. Vesting of the awards will be determined by the 
Company’s share price growth which will normally be assessed by reference to the average share price achieved during the period of three 
months expiring on 30 September 2014, being the last day of the performance period. No awards will vest if the Company’s average share 
price in the three month period ending 30 September 2014 is less than 20p. If the Company’s average share price for this period is 20p, 
then 10% of the award will vest. If the Company’s average share price for this period is 40p or greater, then 100% of the award will vest. 
Vesting takes place on a straight-line basis between these two values. 
In addition, regardless of the average share price achieved, awards will only vest if i) the Company’s adjusted earnings per share as at  
30 September 2014 are no less than 1.18p and ii) to the extent that the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the vesting result is  
a fair reflection of the Company’s underlying financial performance. If the Company’s adjusted EPS for the financial year ending  
30 September 2014 is at least 1.18p but the level of vesting does not, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, reflect the 
underlying financial performance of the Company, the Remuneration Committee will be required to reduce the level of vesting to a  
level that it considers fair and reasonable in light of the underlying financial performance of the Company during the period to  
30 September 2014.
The number of shares subject to both options and awards (including those granted to Executive Directors), the date on which they  
were granted and the periods in which they may be exercised are given below. 
UK, International and US Sharesave Schemes (‘Sharesave’)
All eligible employees have been given the opportunity to enter into a sharesave scheme to share in the benefits of future growth in the 
Company and to align their interests to those of our shareholders. 
Participants under each of the schemes have signed up to savings contracts of up to £150 per month, which upon maturity in three years 
time (two years in the case of the US scheme) will enable each participant to either use their savings to exercise a linked discounted share 
option or to ask for the return of their savings (and any interest). 
The option price for this scheme is 29.6p (2013: 24.5p), which represented a 10% discount to the previous three day average share price 
prior to the granting of the option. The option price is used on day one to determine the total number of shares which each participant  
will be eligible to exercise upon maturity. Any fluctuation in exchange rates are at the risk of the employee.  112

29. Employee share schemes continued
Options will normally be exercisable from the third anniversary of the commencement of the related savings contract. In the case of the 
US scheme, options will normally be exercisable from the second anniversary of the commencement of the related savings contract. 
Earlier exercise is permitted, however, in the following circumstances:
• Following cessation of employment by reason of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement on reaching age 60 (or any other age at 
which the employee is bound to retire under the terms of their employment) or the business or company that the employee works for 
ceasing to be part of the Company’s group;
• When an employee reaches 60;
• Where employment ceases more than three years from grant for any reason other than dismissal for misconduct; and
• In the event of a takeover, amalgamation, reconstruction or winding up of the Company, except in the case of an internal  
corporate re-organisation when the Board may decide to exchange existing options for equivalent new options over shares in a  
new holding company. 
Except where stated above, options will lapse on cessation of employment or directorship with the Group. Shares will be allotted or 
transferred to participants within thirty days of exercise.
During the prior year the Performance Share Plan, the Key Executive Recruitment and Key Executive Retention Plan and the 2011 
Retention Plan were converted from share awards to nil-cost options. This change in classification is detailed below. 
The summary of the outstanding options and awards made under these arrangements are as follows:

Assumptions used in the valuation of share based payments
The Group engaged a third party to determine the fair value of the share based payment arrangements under the PSP scheme granted 
during the year to 30 September 2014. For all other plans, the valuation methodology remains unchanged from previous periods.  
The assumptions used in the valuation are outlined as follows:

The only awards granted during the current and previous financial years were under the PSP and the UK, US and International Sharesave 
Scheme. All awards are expected to be exercised on the date of vesting. 
Expected volatility was determined using the historic volatility of the Company’s share price over the expected life of the option.  
The risk-free rate of return is calculated based on the yield of a UK Government strip with a term commensurate with the expected term. 
A share based payment charge of £1,938,000 (2013: £2,234,000) has been recorded in the income statement in the year.  
The total charge for the year includes £197,000 (2013: £926,000) of employer social security contributions expensed in the year.

Operating leases operated by the Group primarily relate to the rental of office space for the use of Group companies. The leases cover 
periods of between two to ten years and the majority of these leases have options to renew at the expiry of these periods. An extension  
of the lease would typically be associated by an escalation in the level of the rent payable on the lease in line with market changes.  
There are no other significant restrictions in place in regards to the assets being leased. 
31. Capital and financial commitments 
At 30 September 2014 there was no capital expenditure (2013: £nil) contracted for and not provided in the financial statements. 
32. Contingent liabilities
Warrants – Nobilas France
As part of the transaction where 30% of the Group’s shareholding in Nobilas France was sold to Vendomes Participations 3 (‘VP3’),  
a subsidiary of AXA, two warrants exist which enable VP3 to increase its shareholding in Nobilas France if certain volume targets are met. 
These outcomes are summarised as follows: 
• VP3 can exercise the first warrant to increase its shareholding in Nobilas France from 30% to 40% (an increase of 10%) if more than 
200,000 AXA claims are handled by Nobilas France in a consecutive 12 month period by April 2023.
• VP3 can exercise the second warrant to increase its shareholding in Nobilas France from 40% to 49% (an increase of 9%) if more than 
240,000 AXA claims are handled by Nobilas France in a consecutive 12 month period by April 2023.
The cost to VP3 to exercise these warrants has been calculated as part of the original transaction and has been set at €1.3m/£1.1m  
and €1.6m/£1.3m respectively. At the date of the exercise of each warrant, AXA will be entitled to charge Nobilas France a volume  
rebate equivalent to the price of the warrant. The Group will account for the cost of this volume rebate in line with its existing revenue 
recognition accounting policy, once the likelihood of the exercise of the warrants become probable and the timing of the exercise 
becomes more certain. 
Management considers it probable that the first warrant will be exercised within the contractual timeframe and hence the related  
volume rebate is being accrued as a reduction against revenue in the income statement (see note 3).
At the balance sheet date and at the date of the signing of the Annual Report, management considers it remote that the second warrant 
will be exercised by April 2023 and as such no disclosure of the contingent liability is made and no charge has been made to the Group’s 
income statement in the current financial year relating to the second warrant. 
The Group has no other material contingent liabilities to disclose at 30 September 2014.  116

34. Post balance sheet events 
On 3 December 2014, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Ingleby (1879) Limited, the holding company of EMaC Limited,  
one of the UK’s leading motor service plan specialists, for total maximum cash consideration of £46.0m. £36.0m was paid in cash  
on completion with a further payment of up to £10.0m payable in cash in early 2017 based on a profit target for the calendar year to  
31 December 2016.
 
Due to the proximity of this acquisition to the announcement date of this Annual Report and Accounts, it has not been possible to prepare 
the purchase price accounting under IFRS 3, this will be prepared and disclosed in the interim report for the period ending 31 March 2015.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable  
United Kingdom law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the  
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements,  
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue  
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are  
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities.

Company notes to the financial statements
Year ended 30 September 2014
1. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’) on a going concern basis. The principal accounting policies adopted in the 
preparation of these financial statements are set out below and have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding 
year. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its 
individual profit and loss account and related notes.
Financial assets 
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value. Investments in unquoted equity 
investments which do not have a reliable market value are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. For investments where 
there is an actively traded market the investment is stated at fair value, determined by reference to a quoted market bid price at the close 
of business on the balance sheet date. 
Cash
Cash at bank and in hand represents cash in hand and deposits repayable with any qualifying institution. 
Debtors
Amounts due from subsidiary undertakings are stated at the lower of the original invoiced value and recoverable amount. A provision is 
made against the debtor when there is evidence that the Company may not be able to collect the full amount due. Any amounts provided 
for are recorded in the profit and loss account within administrative expenses. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are credited against administrative expenses within the profit and loss account.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts which give rise to them and are classified as 
financial liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss or loans and payables as appropriate. When financial liabilities are recognised 
initially, they are measured at fair value, plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable 
transaction costs. The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. A financial liability is generally 
derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an  
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are 
recognised in profit or loss. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management believe it to be 
probable that the Company will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to net present value where this is deemed  
to be material. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or 
losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account. 
Dividends
Dividends are recognised once paid and once formally approved and recorded as a liability and no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Share based payments
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share based payment transactions, whereby employees 
render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted 
using an appropriate model. 
A cost is recorded in the subsidiary company that benefits from the employee’s services. Since there are no employees within  
The Innovation Group plc no charge has been recorded in the current or previous year within the Profit and Loss account. 
The fair value of the equity-settled share based payment is recognised in the relevant subsidiary operating company as an expense, with 
the equity reserve being recognised in the Company and a capital contribution within Investments – shares in subsidiary undertakings. 120

Appendix 1 – Shareholder information 128
The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Adjusted profit and adjusted earnings per share
Group adjusted profit is defined as being Group profit before tax adjusted for:
• Amortisation of intangible assets created through business combinations accounted for under IFRS 3(R);
• Advisor and other related costs incurred on business combinations;
• Share based payments charges as calculated under IFRS 2;
• Exceptional and other one-off items which do not reflect the underlying trade of the business;
• Impairment of non-current assets; and
• Profit or loss created on disposal of non-current assets.
Adjusted earnings per share is profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders adjusted for the items outlined above in  
‘Group Adjusted Profit’ divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the financial year.
We believe it is important to report these measures to shareholders and analysts for the following reasons:
• these form part of the internal performance measurement of the Group by those charged with governance and reflects the  
ongoing underlying trade of the business;
• these measures inform remuneration policies for Executive Directors and senior management for both bonus and long-term  
incentive plans; and
• these measures are commonly used within the investment analyst community.
Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation)
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as being operating profit excluding share in the results of associates, depreciation and amortisation,  
share based payment charges, exceptional items, impairment losses and other operating income and expense.
We use adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction with adjusted profit (defined below) to assess our operating performance.
We believe that EBITDA is an operating performance measure, not a liquidity measure, as it includes non-cash changes in working  
capital and is reviewed by the Executive Directors to assess internal performance in conjunction with adjusted profit margin, which is  
an alternative net margin figure.
Adjusted EBITDA is also used by our bankers to monitor compliance against the covenants to which the Group is signed up to as part  
of its revolving credit facility.
Cash flow measures
One of the key performance indicators used by the Group is cash conversion of adjusted EBITDA.
Cash conversion of adjusted EBITDA is defined as being the net cash flow from operating activities, adjusted for payments made in  
the year on corporation tax, exceptional items and executive team bonuses divided by adjusted EBITDA.
We believe it is important to report this measure to shareholders and analysts as:
• this demonstrates our capabilities in being able to convert profits into cash available for reinvestment into the business so as to 
increase shareholder value;
• this forms part of the internal performance measurement of the Group;
• this measure informs the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and senior management for bonus payments; and
• this measure is commonly used within the investment analyst community.
Organic growth
Organic growth is used by the Group to present the growth of the business allowing for any acquisition activity undertaken by the Group  
in the current and previous financial years.
We believe it is relevant to report this measure to shareholders and analysts as:
• it provides additional information on the underlying performance of the business without the impact of any mergers and acquisition 
activity; and
• it enables comparison of performance with other companies, however as the term ‘organic growth’ is not defined under IFRS, it may  
not reflect a consistent application of the terminology.
Constant currency
Constant currency is used by the Group to present performance metrics for the previous year using the current year’s average and closing 
exchange rate. As the Group generated over 74% of its revenues (2013: 77%) and over 79% of its profits (2013: 90%) through operations 
outside of the UK in the current financial year we believe this provides a more accurate representation of the performance of the global 
management team on a year to year basis.

Adjusted effective tax rate
The adjusted effective tax rate is defined as being the Group’s adjusted tax charge divided by Adjusted EBITDA.
The Group’s adjusted tax charge is the Group’s tax charge for the year adjusted for the tax effect from:
• Amortisation of intangible assets created through business combinations accounted for under IFRS 3(R);
• Advisor and other related costs incurred on business combinations;
• Share based payments charges as calculated under IFRS 2;
• Exceptional one-off items which do not reflect the underlying trade of the business; and
• Impairment of non-current assets. 130

1  This base year figure has been recalculated from the figures in our FY13 Annual Report and Accounts. The recalculated figure now includes emissions for Crashworth Limited and LAS Claims 
Management Limited which were acquired on 31 January and 13 March 2014. The recalculation has been completed in line with the GHG Protocol guideline. We have recalculated under the fixed base 
year approach where emissions sources from an acquired company are included both with their emissions in the base year (when the acquiring company didn’t control these sources yet) and in the 
current years. Emissions have also been recalculated for the entire year (all-year option), rather than only for the remainder of the reporting period after the structural change occurred (the pro-rata 
option). Further detail is available in our GHG Emissions Inventory report at this link: http://www.innovation-group.com/sustainability.
2  We reported the purchase of 828 tC O2e for FY13 in last year’s annual report. However, we later doubled our offset commitment and purchased a further 828 tC O2e to account for 12% of the Scope 1, 
2 and 3 emissions for FY13.

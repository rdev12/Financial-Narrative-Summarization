WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY
“There’s always a tasty new pizza 
or side order to try at Domino’s –
we never get bored.”
Gabriela Besevil
“I can get a Domino’s delivered
straight to my house and don’t 
have any washing up to deal 
with afterwards.”
Dean Llewellyn
“I really like the Domino’s dips, and
the lolly pop the manager gives my
small son each time we visit is a
really nice touch.”
Miske Jimale By all measures, 2005 was another outstanding year for Domino’s
Pizza. We opened 50 stores and are now more than 400 units strong.
Our system wide sales topped £200 million, breaking 2004’s record-
setting totals by more than £25 million. Though we have continued to
add new stores in record numbers, our long standing units have not
faltered, continuing their unbroken record of year on year sales growth.
Our e-commerce sales also saw dynamic growth in 2005 totalling
nearly £14 million – an increase of 69.5% over 2004. In other words -
nearly one million Domino’s Pizza orders went from “mouse to house”
in less than 30 minutes. The beauty of these e-commerce sales 
is that they do not require special facilities, dedicated delivery
systems or increased management costs. These web and interactive
TV orders come directly into the store in the same way as a phone
call does – only far less time-consuming and with 100% accuracy. 
What has fuelled this customer demand, which seems to grow 
so steadily year after year? At least some of the credit must go 
to our highly talented marketing team which has carefully gauged
consumer tastes and trends. Our marketing is paid for by our
stores, which contribute a portion of their sales directly to the
National Advertising Fund. As new stores are opened and our units
grow, so does the size of the fund. The cost of managing this fund
however remains fairly constant allowing more and more to be
spent on advertising which, in turn, drives sales. 
It is not enough, however, to look a year or two ahead when planning
the roadmap for long-term growth. Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley
and I look not only at today’s and tomorrow’s needs but also at the
company’s long-term requirements. This goes not only for planning
growth strategies, but also for strengthening and enhancing the
management team. Stephen, by example and guidance, has fashioned
and elevated Domino’s Pizza into a market leader. In addition, 
Chris Moore, formally our Sales and Marketing Director, has been 
promoted to the newly created position of Chief Operating Officer.
Chris has been with the company for more than 15 years and his
vision of the brand, his passion and his ability to achieve excellence
will be key in getting us to the 1,000 store mark. Chris has already
been instrumental in enticing a very skilled veteran from Domino’s in
the USA, Patricia Thomas, to head up our expanded Operations Team.
In addition to our strong executive team, we have also been
fortunate enough to attract an impressive team of non-executive
Directors whose guidance and assistance we value highly. As 
we begin 2006, we are pleased to welcome two non-executives,
Michael Shallow and Dianne Thompson. Michael joined our Board
on 5 January 2006 and brings with him years of experience in the
food and leisure industry and a wealth of large public-company
expertise. Dianne, who joined our Board on 22 February 2006 also
has wide plc experience together with the energy and drive to help
position Domino’s for the years ahead. Gerald Halpern, who retired
from the Board last year, will continue to serve as a Director of our
Republic of Ireland subsidiary. We thank him for his contribution
over many years.
Although I could continue to commend to you our talented, wise
and experienced Board of Directors and management team, our
energetic and entrepreneurial franchisees and our terrific product at
Domino’s Pizza - we know that our success would not be possible
without the continued support of our shareholders. It is because 
of you we have the means to build this company for many years 
to come. It is you who deserve the recognition for your loyalty 
and for the confidence you have placed in us. For that I thank you
most sincerely.

TELEPHONE ORDERING
Inside a busy Domino’s Pizza store
every second counts. 
Take the phones, for example. 
It’s our goal to answer the phone
within just two rings. The speed
and accuracy of our order-taking
makes a big impact on whether or
not we get to the customer on time.
Telephone orders still generate the
majority of our sales but customers
are also switching on to the benefits
of ordering online via
www.dominos.co.uk. Domino’s employs 8,200 team members across more than
400 stores in the UK and Ireland. It’s up to these diverse
and dedicated people to take care of our customers and
maintain the high standards that make us the No. 1 pizza
delivery company in the UK and Ireland.
10.4%
of all delivered pizzas sales in the UK 
came through e-commerce channels
Annual Report & Accounts 2005
IMPROVED DELIVERY TIMES
A major part of the success of
Domino’s is the focus on getting the
basics right time and time again.
We have a fanatical dedication to
delivering piping hot fresh food on
time every time. Of over 11 million
deliveries made last year 90% were
delivered on-time to our hungry
customers across UK and Ireland.
Our teams are continually looking
to improve the service to set new
standards in ‘out the door’ and
‘delivery’ times.
PEOPLE FIRST
When your business is about taking
care of customers, it’s vital to have
a team of motivated professionals
who understand why high standards
of pizza, service and image matter.
Without great people, we can’t
deliver.
Our training centre in Milton Keynes
runs over 50 courses every year to
help our franchisees and their
team members strengthen their
edge. We also value experience
and loyalty, and we work hard to
foster long-term service.
5 Introduction 
In 2005, Domino’s Pizza celebrated the 20th anniversary of our 
first UK store opening and another year of excellent progress. 
We believe that this success results from a total focus on the
development of the Domino’s brand in the UK and Republic of
Ireland. This focus has extended our market leadership with the
opening of 50 new stores and strong like-for-like sales growth. 
This has resulted in another year of robust system sales growth,
increased profits and excellent cash generation. 
We are confident that your Company’s growth is sustainable into
the long-term given the robust growth prospects of the market in
which we operate. The combined effect of a growing number of
households in the UK and Republic of Ireland, increased acceptance
of home delivery and favourable demographic changes provides the
opportunity for 800-1,000 Domino’s Pizza stores in these territories.
It has taken us 20 years to open the first 400 stores, we hope to
reach our next target in a further ten years.
System sales 
In 2005, system sales, which are the sales of all stores in the
Domino’s system in the UK and Republic of Ireland, rose by 
15.1% to £200.7m in 2005 (2004: 22.5%). Like-for-like sales in 
the 317 stores open for more than twelve months in both periods
grew by 7.1% (2004: 6.6%). 
In addition to the continued store roll-out, several other factors
underpinned system sales growth in 2005. We launched a number
of new pizzas in the year, which were very well-received and gave us
the opportunity to communicate something new to our customers.
The combination of these new products, national TV and direct
marketing proved a strong driver of system sales.
In the area of e-commerce, our first-mover advantage continues 
to pay dividends with sales increasing by 69.5% over the last 
year. E-commerce sales represented 10.4% of all delivered pizza 
sales by Domino’s Pizza in the UK. Orders made via our website
(www.dominos.co.uk) account for 94% of e-commerce sales. 
The remaining 6% of orders are generated by our presence on 
two national interactive TV platforms.
Expansion 
In 2005 we opened 50 new stores (2004: 40 stores) to take the
year-end store count to 407 stores (2004: 357). No stores were
closed during the year (2004: one).
Mindful of the speed at which we are growing, and the fact that 
we must focus on the quality as well as the volume of new stores,
we are increasingly selective about the franchisees whom we allow
to expand. We must also build a system that can be effectively and
cost-efficiently managed as we grow to 1,000 stores. Finally, we must
provide the opportunity for our franchisee partners to build substantial
and successful businesses. To this end we will focus more on
assisting our existing franchisees to open as many of the new
stores as possible, providing they meet our very rigorous standards.
In 2005, 70% of new stores were opened by existing franchisees.
New franchisees will be increasingly encouraged to acquire existing
stores from franchisees wishing to leave the system.
Trading results
Group turnover, which includes the sales generated by the Group
from royalties, fees on new store openings, food sales, finance lease
and rental income, as well as the turnover of corporately owned
and operated stores, grew by 10.0% to £81.7m (2004: £74.2m).
This rate of growth is slower than the system sales rate due to 
6 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT the disposal of the corporate stores during the year. Excluding the
impact of lost revenue from these disposed stores, Group turnover
would have increased by 19.3%.
Group operating profit, including our share of operating profit in joint
ventures, but before the accelerated LTIP and exceptional items,
was up 20.4% to £11.0m from £9.1m. As a result of the early
vesting of the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) outlined below,
we have taken an accelerated £0.6m charge that would otherwise
have been made in 2006 and 2007. This treatment follows the
requirements of FRS20 which we have now adopted. After taking
into account this charge, Group operating profits were up 13.6% 
to £10.4m.
As our Chairman stated we have significantly strengthened the
resources we commit to our operations function. The key to our
eventual growth to 1,000 stores will lie in our focus on the
execution of the Domino’s system at store level. This additional
investment in our operations team cost £0.5m in 2005. 
During 2005, we also introduced a commissary rebate scheme
which was designed to help our franchisees overcome a number of
external cost pressures they were facing. This performance-related
rebate enabled our franchisees to receive a reduction in the cost of
food purchased from our commissaries, provided they achieve
certain percentage sales increases. Franchisees benefited from a
total rebate of £0.5m which was an increase of £0.4m over a more
limited scheme that operated in 2004. 
Profit on ordinary activities before interest and taxation grew 
by 23.8% to £11.3m (2004: £9.1m). This includes the profit of
£0.9m on the sale of corporate stores as well as the accelerated
LTIP charges as referred to above. 
Net interest paid fell to £0.1m (2004: £0.3m) primarily due 
to stronger cash generation from operations during the year. 
Net interest costs are covered 122 times by operating profits 
(2004: 34 times). 
The tax charge for the year was 26.2% (2004: 23.3%) and is lower
than the statutory tax rate of 30% as a result of the relief available on
the profit from the sale of the corporate stores under the substantial
shareholding exemption and the exercise of employee share options.
The increase in the tax rate from 2004 is due to substantially higher
relief in the earlier year on the number of employee share options
exercised.
Profit after tax and minority interests was up 22.6% to £8.3m
(2004: £6.7m).
Earnings per share and dividend 
Basic earnings per share were up 22.8% to 16.25 pence from
13.23 pence. Diluted earnings per share increased by 22.1% 
to 15.47 pence from 12.67 pence.
As a result of the ability of the business to generate strong cash
flows, the Board is pleased to recommend a further significant
increase in the dividend payment which, if approved by shareholders,
will give a final dividend of 4.15 pence per share (2004: 3.05 pence
per share). This would give a total dividend for the year of 7.25 pence
per share, a 38.1% increase over the 5.25 pence per share declared
for 2004. The proposed dividend is 2.2 times covered by profits after
tax (2004: 2.5 times). 
Subject to shareholders’ approval the final dividend will be payable
on 28 April 2006 to shareholders on the register on 7 April 2006.

FRESH INGREDIENTS IN 
EVERY STORE
Every day, teams from our 
three commissaries travel 6,000
miles to supply fresh ingredients
to Domino’s Pizza stores. By 
centrally controlling the sourcing
and distribution of ingredients,
customers can be assured of 
the highest standards and team
members can concentrate on 
getting a tasty pizza delivered 
to customers on time, every time.
great 
product Annual Report & Accounts 2005
Delivering great tasting, piping hot pizza time after time
relies on a team of highly skilled people. From our purchasing
team who scour the earth sourcing for great tasting, high
quality ingredients right the way through to our in-store
teams who are trained in the art of hand crafting every
order to the customers’ individual requirements, and 
delivering a freshly made piping hot pizza directly to the
customer’s door.
33.5m
We made 33.5m dough balls during 2005
FRESH DOUGH
Our stores now offer a range of
four pizza crusts, The Chicago Thin
Crust, the Dominator, the Double
Decadence and the perennial
favourite, our classic Fresh Dough
which remains the Number One
choice. Why? Our customers tell us
that it’s the unbeatable combination
of that freshly baked taste and
lightness of texture which makes 
it so irresistible. There is a lot of
effort in using fresh dough but
we’ve seen the results for over 20
years in the UK and it’s worth it.
FINEST INGREDIENTS
We are fanatical about ingredients. 
Take our tomatoes, for instance. 
During just one fortnight of every
year, enough tomatoes are harvested
to make an entire year’s supply of
our secret recipe sauce. Specific
weeks are chosen for the harvest so
that our tomatoes are at their most
ripe. We then go into round-the-
clock production to get fresh sauce
made within hours of the tomatoes
coming off the vine.
9 Cash flow and balance sheet 
Net cash inflow from operating activities reached £12.7m, up from
£9.9m in 2004. This increase was attributable mainly to the higher
operating profit, before the accelerated LTIP charge, which was
£1.8m up on 2004.
Cash flows were also stronger as cash interest was £0.2m lower,
taxation paid was £0.5m lower, and capital expenditure £1.5m
lower. Proceeds of £3.7m from the sale of subsidiary undertakings
and £0.5m from the sales of fixed assets of corporate stores were
partially offset by an increase in dividend payments of £0.9m.
Overall, net cash inflow before financing was £7.2m higher than
last year, up from £1.8m to £9.0m. This strong cash generation has
allowed us to return a further £8.2m to shareholders through share
buybacks during the year. We have now returned £15.2m of cash to
shareholders over the past two years via share buybacks of £9.8m
and dividends of £5.4m.
In the year, options over 0.7m shares were exercised generating an
inflow of £0.5m (2004: £1.1m). The Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”)
borrowed an additional £1.1m taking its total borrowings to £7.5m
(2004: £6.4m). This additional loan was used to purchase further
shares in the Company, over which an LTIP award was granted.
During the year DP Capital continued to provide leasing support to
franchisees for the fit-out of new stores and the refit of existing stores,
with new advances of £1.2m (2004: £0.9m). After repayments, the
balance outstanding at the year end on these leases was £2.9m
(2004: £2.9m). These facilities are financed by a limited recourse
loan facility and the amount drawn down at the end of the year
stood at £2.5m (2004: £2.6m).
At the year end, the Group had cash at hand of £5.9m (2004: £4.8m)
and consolidated debt of £10.0m (2004: £9.0m) all of which related
to the EBT and DP Capital loans. Net borrowings at the year end
therefore stood at £4.1m (2004: £4.2m) representing 34.5% 
(2004: 28.4%) of shareholders’ funds.
Although adoption of IFRS will only be mandatory for AIM listed
companies from 2007, a preliminary assessment has highlighted
that the adoption of IFRS is not expected to have any significant 
impact on the Group’s reported results.
Corporate stores
During 2005, we disposed of 14 corporate stores, acquired one 
and opened two new stores, leaving just five. It is our intention to
dispose of these remaining stores as the opportunities arise. Since
the year-end, one of these stores has been sold and terms have
been agreed on three others. These disposals effectively complete
our exit from own-store operation. This has been achieved at a
significant capital profit and the stores are now being operated
successfully by franchisees.
During the year, two stores were transferred into subsidiary
companies in which our partners have a 20% equity stake. We
hope that the combination of our partners’ entrepreneurial skill 
in operating the stores, combined with our strategic direction 
and capital, will provide an attractive return for our shareholders.
In total, we now have an equity interest in five ventures which 
are not 100% owned and operate in a total of 26 stores. Our 
total equity investment in these enterprises is £565,000 
(2004: £205,000) and they contributed £166,000 to operating 
profits in 2005 (2004: £105,000). 
The market
According to Mintel’s 2004 Home Delivery Report, the home-delivered
food market was estimated to be worth around £1.36bn in 2005
with pizza takeaway/delivery being the largest component at 48%.
10 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT (continued) Annual Report & Accounts 2005 11
Current purchasing habits indicate that there is an enormous growth
opportunity in the pizza delivery sector. Mintel also states that just
23% of adults have ever ordered a delivered pizza, and only 6% of
the population had ordered from Domino’s. When compared to the
more mature US market, where 75% of adults have ordered a
delivered pizza, and 50% of those have had a pizza delivered from
Domino’s, these figures suggest that the scope for growth lies not
only in the expansion of the system into virgin territory but also in
attracting more new customers to our existing stores.
Furthermore, a report by The Future Foundation forecasts growth
of 91% in the pizza segment of the home delivery market by 2015.
This report also underlines how your Company is well-placed to
maximise future opportunities in the market arising from changing
eating habits, the increasing spend on in-home leisure as well as
the continuance of the cash-rich, time-poor society.
People
At Domino’s Pizza, we believe that encouraging longevity of service
is a key part of our success. To this end, we seek to foster long-term
loyalty from our people and offer them market-leading rewards.
During the year we introduced a Save As You Earn scheme giving
team members an option to acquire shares in your Company. This
offer was extremely well-subscribed. We have also reinforced
previous schemes with the granting of a further round of share
options to all team members, excluding the executive directors,
further demonstrating the commitment and strong partnership
between our people and the Company.
Long Term Incentive Plan and Employee Benefit Trust
As a result of the rapid growth in profitability and earnings per share
over the last three years, the performance targets included in the
2003 LTIP award have been achieved. The early vesting of these
awards necessitates the acceleration of the 2006 and 2007 charge
as referred to above. 
Based on the closing share price on 24 February 2006 of 416.5 pence,
the beneficiaries of the LTIP are now entitled to the growth in value
of the LTIP which will be satisfied by the transfer of 1,909,334 shares
to them. During the year, the EBT purchased a further 375,000
shares, over which an LTIP interest was granted. Following these
movements, the EBT owns 2,065,587 shares, of which 975,000 are
subject to an outstanding LTIP interest.
Current trading and outlook 
Trading in the first six weeks of 2006 has got off to an excellent
start with like-for-like sales up 10.3% (2005: 6.6%). E-commerce
has continued to show robust growth with an increase of 59.5% in
the same period (2005: 49.2%). E-commerce in the first six weeks
accounted for 11.8% of all UK delivered pizza sales. Our store
opening programme is also progressing in line with expectations
and we are on track to achieve our target of 50 new store openings
this year. 
Cash flow remains strong and it is the Directors’ intention to return
cash not needed to expand our business to shareholders by further
share buybacks and a progressive dividend policy. The Company is
once again well-positioned for another year of strong growth.
Conclusion 
On behalf of the team in the UK and Ireland, I should like to thank
our customers for their loyalty and continued support of Domino’s
Pizza. Finally, to all of our franchisees and team members, I thank
you sincerely for your tireless dedication at every level of the
business and for contributing to another successful year.

ADVISORS The Remuneration Committee consists of John Hodson (Chairman), Nigel Wray and Colin Halpern. It has the primary responsibility to review
the performance of executive directors and similar employees and set the scale and structure of their remuneration. The underpinning
objective is to recruit, retain and motivate a top quality team of executive directors and senior executives through a competitive remuneration
structure, which provides incentives to deliver exceptional performance. This is achieved through offering remuneration packages, which
include salaries and bonuses benchmarked against similar companies and a long-term incentive plan, which provides significant reward for
achieving stretching targets. These arrangements are described more fully below.
Service agreement
Stephen Hemsley, Lee Ginsberg and Christopher Moore have entered into service agreements with the Company, which are subject to twelve
month’s notice by the Company. The remuneration packages consist of basic salary, pension contributions, health and life insurance benefits
and the use of a company car or cash equivalent allowance.
Colin Halpern is seconded to the Company from International Franchise System Inc. (“IFS”) as executive chairman under the terms of a 
management agreement. The agreement is reviewed annually and the level of compensation paid to IFS agreed by the Remuneration 
Committee.
The non-executive directors are appointed on three-year agreements with the Company terminable at one weeks notice. Fees for non-executive
directors are set by the Board.

The value of benefits relates primarily to the provision of a company car or equivalent allowance. Colin Halpern is not remunerated by the
Company. A management fee of £204,000 (2004: £196,000) was paid to IFS in respect of his services. Mr Halpern has indicated his intention to
retire on his 70th birthday, which falls in 2007. In view of this the Remuneration Committee has determined to make pension contributions not
previously paid during his previous twelve years of chairmanship of the Company. Accordingly, the first of these contributions, amounting to
£200,000, was made in 2003 and further contributions of £200,000 paid in 2004 and £100,000 in 2005, have been made.
Gerald Halpern was not directly remunerated by the Company. A management fee of £10,000 (2004: £48,000) was paid to Chinese Pompano Inc,
a company of which Gerald Halpern is a director, in respect of his services.
Nigel Wray is not directly remunerated by the Company. A management fee of £28,000 (2004: £24,000) was paid to Brendon Street
Investments Limited, a company of which Nigel Wray is a director, in respect of his services. 
The Company makes contributions of 10% of annual basic salary to personal pension plans of Stephen Hemsley, Lee Ginsberg and
Christopher Moore.
Remuneration in 2004 included £20,000 for Stephen Hemsley and £13,000 for Christopher Moore in respect of pension contributions. In 2004 
a bonus of £139,000 was paid to Stephen Hemsley, £83,000 to Christopher Moore and £14,000 to Lee Ginsberg.

Principal activity and review of the business

Directors and their interests

interests held over ordinary shares (which are detailed in the analysis of reversionary interests included in the Report on Directors’
Remuneration) were as follows:

owned by Nigel Wray.
During the period from the end of the financial year to 24 February 2006, there have been no changes in directors’ shareholdings or their 
interests in share options.
Other significant shareholders
Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company have been disclosed above. The other significant shareholders holding more than 3% of 
the shares in the Company, which have been disclosed to the Company are Morgan Stanley Securities Limited which holds a 4.18% interest,
Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee Limited acting as trustee of the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc Employee Benefit Trust which holds a 7.51%
interest and Moonpal Singh Grewal who is the beneficial holder of a 3.75% interest. 
Share option schemes
In order to provide employee share incentives in the future the Group had previously adopted two share option schemes, one of which, the
Domino’s Pizza Group Limited (Unapproved) Share Option Scheme, has been in place since 30 March 1999. The Domino’s Pizza Share Option
(Unapproved) Scheme was introduced on 24 November 1999. 
All participants in the Domino’s Pizza Group Limited (Unapproved) Share Option Scheme were, on admission of the Company to the
Alternative Investment Market, offered the chance to release their options over shares in Domino’s Pizza Group Limited in return for 
equivalent options over ordinary shares in the Company under the Domino’s Pizza Share Option (Unapproved) Scheme. Further details 
of options outstanding at the year-end are contained in note 22.
18 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
DIRECTORS’ REPORT The Remuneration Committee has resolved that the exercise of these options which have been granted under the Share Option Schemes 
will be subject to the condition that the growth in basic earnings per share in any financial year between grant and vesting exceeds 
the growth in the Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) in the previous financial year by at least 5%.
On 23 March 2004 the Company established the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 2003 Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme. Under the
scheme the Company can grant options to eligible full time employees. The options are only exercisable if the growth in the Company’s 
EPS during a performance year exceeds the growth in RPI during that performance year by at least 5%. The EMI options lapse after 10 years 
or in certain other circumstances connected with leaving the Company. For details of the options granted and outstanding see note 22.
The Employee Benefit Trust also operates a long-term incentive plan under which senior executives may be incentivised by the grant to them
of reversionary interests over a portion of the assets of the trust. These interests are capable of vesting after certain stipulated performance
criteria have been reached (detailed in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration). 
During the year the Group introduced a Sharesave Scheme giving employees the option to acquire shares in the Company. Employees have
the option to save an amount per month up to a maximum of £250 and at the end of three years they have the option to purchase shares in
the Company or to take their savings in cash.
Company share buyback programme
During the year the Company continued its programme of buying back its own shares. A total of 2,614,936 (2004: 800,000) shares of 5p 
each were purchased during the year at a total cost of £8,084,000 (2004: £1,600,000) before expenses of £138,000. This represented 4.9% 
(2004: 1.5%) of the issued shares of the Company at 1 January 2006. The reason for the purchase of these shares is that the Company has 
generated surplus cash and this is being returned to shareholders in the form of a progressive dividend policy and share buybacks. These
shares have been cancelled and no longer form part of the Company’s issued share capital.
Creditor payment policy 
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between the Group and its
suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions have been complied with. At 1 January 2006, the Group had an average of 20 days
(2004: 25 days) purchases outstanding in trade creditors. 
Corporate governance
The Company is supportive of the principles embodied in the Combined Code prepared and published by the Committee on Corporate
Governance in June 1998, although the rules of the Stock Exchange do not require companies that have securities trading on the Alternative
Investment Market to formally comply with the Combined Code. The directors have taken note of its provisions insofar as they consider 
them appropriate to the Company, and as a result does not fully comply with the revised code. At present the main facets are:
• The Board – at the year-end the Company had four executives and two non-executive directors. The directors hold regular board meetings
at which operating and financial reports are considered. The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s
strategy, budgets, and major items of capital expenditure and senior personnel appointments.
• Audit Committee – which consists of Colin Halpern (Chairman), Nigel Wray and John Hodson. It meets at least twice each year and is
responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly reported on and monitored, for meeting the auditors and
reviewing the reports from the auditors relating to the financial statements and internal control systems. 
• Remuneration Committee – which consists of John Hodson (Chairman), Nigel Wray and Colin Halpern. It meets at least twice each year
and has a primary responsibility to review the performance of executive directors and senior employees and set the scale and structure of
their remuneration having due regard to the interests of shareholders.
• Going Concern – the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future and
for this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparing the financial statements.
• Internal Control – the directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains internal controls to provide reasonable
assurance on the reliability of the financial information used within the business and for safeguarding the assets. There are limitations in
any system of internal controls and accordingly, even the most effective system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
with respect to preparation of the financial information and the safeguarding of the assets.
The key elements of internal and financial control are as follows:
• Control Environment – the presence of a clear organisational structure and well-defined lines of responsibility and delegation of appropriate
levels of authority.
• Risk Management – business strategy and plans are reviewed by the Board.
• Financial Reporting – a comprehensive system of budgets and forecasts with monthly reporting of actual results against targets.
• Control and Monitoring Procedures – ensuring authorisation levels and procedures and other systems of internal financial controls are
documented, applied and regularly reviewed.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare the financial statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements, and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Employees
Employees of Group companies are encouraged to participate in the success of the business through incentive and share option schemes.
Progress is regularly communicated to the management of subsidiary companies and all management and staff are expected to communicate
fully within their own area of responsibility. 
Disabled employees
The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the requirements of the job can be adequately
fulfilled by a handicapped or disabled person.
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy wherever practicable, to provide continuing employment under normal
terms and conditions and to provide training, career development and promotion to disabled employees wherever appropriate.
Corporate social responsibility & charitable donations
Domino’s Pizza is committed to delivering the highest standards of product, service, image and safety for our franchisees, team members, 
customers, the communities we serve and all other stakeholders affected by our operations. 
Furthermore, we are an equal opportunities employer and are committed to investing in our team members through market-leading
remuneration, training and development. Our franchisees are contracted to adhere to high standards of employment practice.
The Company also ensures that its rapid expansion plans are underpinned by a culture of ‘Responsible Growth’. This means that we aim to
earn the respect, admiration and trust of local people and authorities by taking a responsible attitude towards the environment, construction,
planning and local regeneration. 
In 2005, the Company’s charity of choice was the Make-A-Wish Foundation
®
UK, an inspiring charity that grants the wishes of children 
who are living with life-threatening illnesses. As well as donating a £20,000 lump sum to Make-A-Wish®, the Company’s franchisees and 
stores undertook a wide range of fund-raising activities throughout the year.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s auditor will be put to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (continued) We have audited the Group and parent Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc for the 
52 weeks ended 1 January 2006, which comprise the Group profit and loss account, the Group statement of total recognised gains and 
losses, the Group and Company balance sheets, the Group statement of cash flows and the related notes 1 to 29. These financial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) as set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or
if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. 
This other information comprises the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement, Report on Director’s
Remuneration and Five Year Financial Summary. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,
of the state of the Group’s and the parent Company’s affairs as at 1 January 2006 and of the Group’s profit for the 52 weeks then ended and
the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

GROUP STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS Annual Report & Accounts 2005 27
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation 
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice. 
Changes in Accounting Policy
The accounting policies adopted are the same as the previous financial year except that the Group has adopted the following standards 
which are applicable to the Group:
FRS 20 – Share based payment
FRS 21 – Events after the balance sheet date
FRS 22 – Earnings per share
FRS 25* – Financial Instruments disclosure and presentation
FRS 28 – Corresponding Amounts
FRS 20 – Share based payment
The revised accounting policy for share based payment transactions is described below. The effect of the revised accounting policy has an
insignificant impact on the charge in the current year (except for the accelerated LTIP charge in note 3), and it also has an insignificant impact
on retained earnings. This standard has been adopted in advance of the effective date.
FRS 21 – Events after the balance sheet date 
This requires dividends, which are proposed after the balance sheet date to be disclosed and not recognised as a liability. As a result of 
adopting this accounting standard, retained earnings have been increased by £1,083,000 as at 28 December 2003, and increased by £1,531,000
as at 2 January 2005. Liabilities have been decreased by £1,531,000 as at 2 January 2005. There has been no effect on current or previous year
results from adopting this standard.
FRS 22, FRS 25 and FRS 28 have not resulted in a restatement of retained earnings and have had no impact on the results or net assets for 
the current or prior year.
* The Group has only adopted the presentation requirements of this standard, as it does not have to comply with the disclosure requirements
in this year.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the nearest
Sunday to 31 December each year. No profit and loss account is presented for Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc as permitted by Section 230 of 
the Companies Act 1985.
Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and are jointly controlled by one or more ventures under a contractual
agreement are treated as joint ventures in the Group accounts. Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method. The Group
accounts include the appropriate share of assets and liabilities and earnings, based on management accounts for the period to 1 January 2006.
Goodwill
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions of a subsidiary or business is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised on
a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years. It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year
following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If a subsidiary or business is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill arising on acquisition that has not been amortised through the profit
and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture is capitalised as part of the investment in the joint venture and is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are capitalised at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business
are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to the constraint that, unless
the asset has a readily ascertainable market value, the fair value is limited to an amount that does not create or increase any negative goodwill
arising on the acquisition. Intangible assets created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged against profits in the
year in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Franchise fees – over 20 years
Interest in leases – over the life of the lease
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full year following acquisition and in other periods if
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Significant property developments
Interest incurred on finance provided for significant property development is capitalised up to the date of completion of the project. These
costs are then depreciated in accordance with the Group’s policy for the relevant class of tangible fixed assets.
Depreciation 
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the cost less residual value of each asset evenly over its
expected useful life as follows: 
Freehold buildings – over 50 years
Equipment – over 2 to 10 years
Leasehold building improvements – over the life of the lease 
Motor vehicles – over 18 months to 3 years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Stocks
Stocks comprise raw materials, consumables and goods for resale (being equipment for resale to franchisees) and are stated at the lower of
cost and net realisable value. Cost of stock is determined on the average cost basis or, for computer and food stock, the first-in, first-out basis.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions
or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following
exceptions:
• Provision is made for tax on gains from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, or gains on disposal of fixed
assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement
to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date,
it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement
assets are sold.
• Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable
taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction 
is covered by a forward foreign currency contract. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate. All differences are taken to the profit 
and loss account. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of the historical cost are translated using the historical exchange rates.
Income and expenses relating to foreign operations are converted at the monthly average rates throughout the year. The assets and liabilities
of foreign operations are translated using the year end rate. Exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign operations are recognised
in reserves.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
As lessee
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to 
the Group, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their useful lives. The capital elements 
of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. The interest elements of the
rental obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a 
constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As lessor
Amounts receivable under finance leases are included under debtors and represent the total amount outstanding under lease agreements 
less unearned income. Finance lease income, having been allocated to accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of return on the 
net cash investment is included in turnover. Income and expenditure from the rental of leasehold properties and equipment have been included
in the gross income in turnover and the related expenditure within cost of sales.  Annual Report & Accounts 2005 29
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Employee Benefit Trusts
The Company has adopted UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts. Shares in the Company held by the trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust are
stated at cost and included as a deduction to shareholders’ funds. The trust has waived its entitlement to dividends. The Group will meet the
expenses of the trust as and when they fall due. 
Pensions
The Company makes contributions to certain individuals’ personal pension plans. Contributions are charged in the profit and loss account as
they accrue. 
Share based payment transactions
Employees (including directors) of the Group receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based payment transactions, whereby
employees render services as consideration for equity instruments.
The awards vest when certain performance and/or service conditions are met, see note 23 for the individual vesting conditions for the various
schemes.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and 
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the
award. Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account
is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition,
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions 
are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has
expired, management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that
will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in 
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost
based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over the
remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the
original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this
difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the
income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or 
settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions in respect of equity settled awards and has applied FRS 20 only to awards 
granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 3 January 2005.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised as follows:
Pizza delivery – on delivery of pizzas to franchisee customers
Commissary and equipment sales – on delivery
Royalties (based on system sales) – on delivery
Franchise sales – on commencement of franchisee trading
Finance lease interest income – as per leasing and hire purchase commitments (lessor) above
Rental income on leasehold properties – on a straight line basis in accordance with the lease terms
Trade and other debtors
Trade debtors, which generally have 7 – 28 days terms are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any 
uncollectible amounts when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the debts. Bad debts are written off 
when identified.
Bank and other loans
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
Interest expenses are recognised in the profit and loss account at a constant rate based on the carrying amount. 30 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
at 1 January 2006 
2. TURNOVER AND SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
The principal components of turnover are royalties received, commissary and equipment sales, sale of franchises, pizza delivery sales, rental
income on leasehold and freehold properties and finance lease interest income, stated net of value added tax. All of the turnover is in one
continuing business segment being the development of the Domino’s Pizza Franchise System and originates in the United Kingdom and the
Republic of Ireland. The directors believe that full compliance with the requirements of SSAP 25 ‘Segmental Reporting’ would be seriously
prejudicial to the interests of the Group as it would require disclosure of commercially sensitive information. The requirements of SSAP 25
with which the Group do not comply are the disclosure of profit before interest and tax and net operating assets by segment. All the turnover 
of the Joint Ventures relates to the United Kingdom.

Accelerated LTIP charge
During the year the Company has accelerated the charge relating to reversionary interests in ordinary shares granted in 2003, as the 
performance targets set will be achieved earlier than expected (further details included in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration). This 
resulted in an additional charge of £626,000 during 2005. This charge is not deductible for corporation taxation purposes (see note 8). 
This charge had no impact on the cash flow of the Group during the year.  Annual Report & Accounts 2005 31
3. OPERATING PROFIT (continued)
Exceptional items
Recognised below operating profit 
During 2005 the Group sold two subsidiary undertakings, DPGS Limited and Triple A Pizza Limited (which included 12 corporate stores at the
date of the transaction). The main elements of the transaction were as follows:
£000
Cash consideration received 3,650
Net assets disposed of (1,495)
Disposal costs (296)
Provisions (1,189)
Profit on disposal of subsidiary undertakings 670
These subsidiary undertakings were sold to Dough Trading Limited, a company controlled by Marc Halpern (see related party transactions –
note 29). In addition to the sale of DPGS Limited and Triple A Pizza Limited, the Group sold one corporate store to Dough Trading Limited for a
cash consideration of £350,000 resulting in a profit on sale of £144,000 (see related party transaction – note 29). The principal component of
the net assets disposed of in the subsidiary undertakings was fixed assets of £1,828,000.
Due to the relief available under the substantial shareholding exemption, the profit arising in the Company on the sale of the subsidiary 
undertakings is not taxable. The Group accounting profit in respect of the disposal is £670,000. At the statutory corporation tax rate of 30%,
this would lead to an expected reduction in the tax charge of £210,000 (1.9%). However, the provisions included within the accounting profit
are expected to be largely allowable for corporation tax purposes. Therefore the profit to be excluded from the corporation tax calculation in
respect of the disposal is increased to £1,770,000 (a reduction in the tax charge of £531,000 at 30%). This has reduced the effective tax rate for
2005 by 4.7% (see note 8) (2004: nil).
In addition the Group sold one corporate store resulting in a profit of £62,000 (2004: loss £56,000). This profit has been included in the
corporation tax calculation for the period at the statutory rate. In 2004 the Group’s share of profit realised on the disposal of a joint venture store
was £9,000.

8. TAX ON PROFIT ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES (continued)
d) Factors that may affect future tax charges
No provision has been made for deferred tax where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets. Such gains 
would become taxable only if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief. The amount not provided is £191,000
(2004: £191,000) in respect of this. At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
The company is able to receive a tax deduction when new shares are issued to satisfy the exercise of share options. The timing of the 
exercise and hence resultant tax deduction is at the discretion of the option holder.

The diluted earnings per share is based on earnings of £8,255,000 (2004: £6,731,000) and on 53,368,778 (2004: 53,108,892) ordinary shares. The

21. DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group’s financial risk management objectives consist of identifying and monitoring those risks which have an adverse impact on the value
of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities or on reported profitability and on the cash flows of the Group. The Group’s principal financial
instruments are bank loans, other loans, finance leases and cash. 
The financial instruments are principally in place to finance the head office facility and associated equipment, provide finance to franchisees
and to provide finance for the EBT loan. The Group has other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly
from its operations. As permitted by FRS 13 short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosure of financial liabilities
and assets. 
The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps or financial foreign currency contracts. The main risks
arising from the Group’s financial instruments are set out below. In view of the low level of foreign currency transactions the Board does not
consider there to be any significant foreign currency risks.  40 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
at 1 January 2006 
21. DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
Credit risk
Due to the nature of customers who trade on credit terms, being predominantly franchisees, the franchisee selection process is sufficiently
robust to ensure an appropriate credit verification procedure. In addition, trade debtors balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with 
the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. Since the Group trades only with franchisees that have been subject to 
the franchisee selection process and have provided personal guarantees as required under the franchise agreements, there is no requirement
for collateral. 
Price risk
The Board considers that the Group’s exposure to changing market prices on the values of financial instruments does not have a significant
impact on the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities. As such no specific policies are applied currently, although the Board will
continue to monitor the level of price risk and manage its exposure should the need occur.
Liquidity risk
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations with cash collection targets set throughout the Group.
All major investment decisions are considered by the Board as part of the project appraisal process. In this way the Group aims to maintain a
good credit rating to facilitate fund raising.
Interest rate risk
The Board has a policy of ensuring a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Whilst fixed rate interest bearing debt is not exposed to cash
flow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to enjoy a reduction in borrowing costs when market rates are falling. Conversely,
whilst floating rate borrowings are not exposed to changes in fair value, the Group is exposed to cash flow risk as costs increase if market
rates rise.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets
The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the Group was as follows:
Financial
Floating asset
Fixed rate rate on which
financial financial no interest Average
Total asset asset is paid period
At 1 January 2006 £000 £000 £000 £000 to maturity

Cash 5,885 – 5,885 –
9,486 2,936 6,477 73
The floating rate financial assets are based on the Group’s bank base rate plus a fixed percentage of 2% (2004: 2%).
The average interest on the fixed rate financial asset is 11% (2004: 11%).

The fair value of the financial assets is not considered materially different from book value except for the fixed rate financial asset where the
fair value is £2,500,000 (2004: £2,640,000). The fair value has been determined by discounting the cash flows of the fixed rate financial assets
at prevailing market rates. 21. DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)

9,899 2,682 6,360 857
The average interest on the fixed rate financial liability is 7.0% (2004: 7.1%). This is fixed over a weighted average period of 26 months
(2004: 29 months). The bank loan relates to a revolving facility granted to the EBT for the purpose of acquiring shares in the Company for 
the benefit of the Company’s employees. The loan attracts interest at a rate of 0.625% (2004: 0.625%) above National Westminster Bank plc
base rate and expires on 11 September 2013.
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities is set out in notes 17 and 19. The fair value of the financial liabilities is not considered
materially different from book value.
Other loan facilities at 1 January amounted to £5,000,000 (2004: £4,500,000) in respect of other loans relating to a limited recourse loan facility.
Of the other loan facilities, £5,000,000 expires on 31 December 2006 (2004: £3,000,000 expired on 05 March 2005 and £1,500,000 expired on
30 November 2005).

On 24 November 1999 participants in the Domino’s Pizza Group Limited (Unapproved) Share Option Scheme (which had been in place since
31 March 1999) had the option of exchanging options over shares in Domino’s Pizza Group Limited in return for equivalent options over 
ordinary shares in the Company under the Domino’s Pizza Share Option (Unapproved) Scheme.
On 23 March 2004, the Company established the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (EMI Scheme). Under
the scheme 481,000 options were granted at 206.5p, the market price on the date of the grant. The options are only exercisable if the growth in
the Company’s EPS during a performance year exceeds the growth in RPI during that performance year by at least 5%. The EMI options lapse
after 10 years or in certain other circumstances connected with leaving the Company.
In respect of all outstanding options under these schemes, options may be exercised as follows:
One year after date of grant – maximum 1/3 of options held
Two years after date of grant – maximum 2/3 of options held
Three years after date of grant – in full
The options expire 10 years after the date granted. 
In 2003 the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc Employee Benefit Trust was established for the benefit of employees. The trust was established to
hold and deal in the Company’s shares under two new share incentive schemes. These are the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 2003 Enterprise
Management Incentive Scheme, under which the Company may grant options over ordinary shares to eligible full time employees. 
During the year the Group introduced a Sharesave Scheme giving employees the option to acquire shares in the Company. Employees have
the option to save an amount per month up to a maximum of £250 and at the end of three years they have the option to purchase shares in
the Company or to take their savings in cash.
The Employee Benefit Trust also operates a long-term incentive plan under which senior executives may be incentivised by the grant to 
them of reversionary interests over a portion of the assets of the trust. During the year further reversionary interests were granted over
375,000 shares. At 1 January 2006, the Trust held 3,974,921 shares, which had a historic cost of £7,499,864. These shares had a market 
value at 1 January 2006 of £13,792,976.
At 1 January 2006 reversionary interests over 3,800,000 shares in Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc have been granted. Further details are 
contained in the Report on Director’s Remuneration on page 16. 44 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
23. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS
Long Term Senior Executive Plan
Reversionary interests over assets held in Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc Employee Benefit Trust are approved and granted, at the discretion of
the Board, to senior executives. The interests vest within a five year period when certain performance targets have been achieved by the Group.
For the interests granted in 2003 to vest, the diluted earnings per share must have reached 14p per share, the profit before tax must be greater
than £11,000,000 and the 2005 financial statements must have been approved by the Board. The interests granted in 2004 vest when the diluted
earnings per share reaches 24p and the profit before tax exceeds £17,000,000. The interests granted in 2005 vest when the diluted earnings per
share reach 27p and the profit before tax is more than £20,000,000.
The contractual life of each interest is 5 years and all awards are equity settled.
The fair value of reversionary interests, which will be equity-settled, is estimated as at the date of granting using a Black Scholes model, taking
into account the terms and conditions upon which they were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the valuations
in 2004 and 2005:
2005 2004
Dividend yield (%) 3.3 3.3
Expected volatility (%) 17.0 20.0
Historical volatility – 250 day (%) 28.7 28.8
Risk-free interest rate (%) 4.3 4.5
Expected life of reversionary interests (years) 4.4 5.3
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 295.0 200.0
Weighted average share price (pence) 295.0 200.0
The expected life of the reversionary interests are based on historical data and are not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may
occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the
actual outcome. No other features of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value and non-market conditions have not been
included in calculating the fair value. 
Employee Share-option
All other employees are eligible for grants of options, which are approved by the Board.
The options vest over a 3 year period and are exercisable subject to the condition that the growth in basic earnings per share in any financial
year between grant and vesting exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index in the previous financial year by at least 5% (see note 22 for
further details).
The contractual life of each option granted is 10 years. There are no cash settlement alternatives and all awards are equity settled. 
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted, for the EMI and Domino’s Pizza (unapproved) schemes, is estimated as at the date of
granting using a Binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The following table lists
the inputs to the model used for the valuations for the EMI and Domino’s Pizza (unapproved) schemes in 2004 and 2005:
2005 2004
Dividend yield (%) 3.3 2.9
Expected volatility (%) 19.0 23.0
Historical volatility - 250 day (%) 28.1 27.7
Risk-free interest rate (%) 4.3 4.6
Expected life of options (years) 3.5 7.0
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 340.8 206.5
Weighted average share price (pence) 340.8 206.5
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the
actual outcome. No other features of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value and non-market conditions have not been
included in calculating the fair value.

Weighted average share price (pence) 242.8
The expected life of the options is based on an average of exercise period which is between 3 – 3.5 years.

Amounts contracted for but not provided in the accounts amounted to £ nil for the Group and £ nil for the Company (2004: £nil and £nil
respectively).
28. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Additional consideration up to a maximum of £500,000 in cash, may become payable for the acquisition of American Pizza Company Limited,
dependent upon certain conditions being met. Due to the remote probability of these conditions being met, the directors consider a provision
of these amounts to be inappropriate.
Pursuant to the relevant regulation of the European Communities (Companies: Group Accounts) Regulations, 1992 the Company has guaranteed
the liabilities of the Irish subsidiary, DP Pizza Ltd and as a result the Irish company has been exempted from the filing provisions section 7,
Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 of the Republic of Ireland.
29. RELATED PARTIES
During the period, the Group traded with International Franchise Systems Inc., in the normal course of business and at normal market prices.
Colin Halpern is a director of International Franchise Systems Inc.
Transactions between the Group and International Franchise Systems Inc, are set out below:

Closing debt due to International Franchise Systems Inc. – –
In June 2005 the Company sold its subsidiaries, DPGS Limited and Triple A Pizza Limited for a cash consideration of £3,650,000 to Dough
Trading Limited. Dough Trading Limited is controlled by Marc Halpern, the son of Colin Halpern. HS Real Company is guaranteeing part 
of the debt funding that Dough Trading Limited has used for the acquisition. HS Real Company is owned by a discretionary trust, the 
beneficiaries of which are the adult children of Colin and Gail Halpern. By virtue of Colin Halpern’s position in the Company and his 
relationship with HS Real Company, he took no part in the voting at the Company’s board meeting on the approval of the transaction.
The consideration for the sale of the companies was calculated taking into account market rates and the full consideration was received 
prior to the year end. A further corporate store was sold for a cash consideration of £350,000 to Dough Trading Limited during the year. 
The transactions resulted in a profit on sale of £814,000 in total (see note 3).
At the year end there is a balance owing from DPGS Ltd of £65,000, which has arisen during the course of normal trading. Since June 2005
sales of £1,686,000 have been made to DPGS Ltd at normal market prices. 
Transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are set out in note 13.

Notes:
1. Any member entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting may appoint one or more other persons as a proxy or proxies to attend and, in the
event of a poll, to vote instead of him or her. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. Shareholders will receive a Proxy Form with
this document.
2. Proxy Forms, if used, must reach Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours
before the time fixed for the Meeting and in default will not be treated as valid. Completion of a Proxy Form will not preclude shareholders

3. The Register of directors’ interests in shares in, or debentures of, the Company and copies of the directors’ service contracts of more than
one year’s duration will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during business hours only on any weekday
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) from the date of this Notice until the date of the Annual General Meeting and at the
place of the Meeting from 9.00am until the conclusion of the Meeting.
Further explanatory notes:
1. Resolution 1 – Report and Accounts
The Directors are required to present for the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2006 to the Meeting.
2. Resolution 2 – Declaration of a dividend
A dividend can only be paid if it is recommended by the Directors and approved by the shareholders at a General Meeting. The Directors
propose that a final dividend of 4.15 pence per ordinary share of five pence each in the Company (“Ordinary Shares”) be paid on 
28 April 2006 to ordinary shareholders who are on the register at the close of business on 7 April 2006. An interim dividend of 3.10 
pence per Ordinary Share was paid on 31 August 2005.
3. Resolutions 3, 4 and 5 – Retirement by rotation
The Articles of Association of the Company requires one third of the Directors to retire at each Annual General Meeting (generally those
who have been longest in office since their last appointment). Colin Halpern, Christopher Moore and Lee Ginsberg will retire by rotation
and seek re-election.
4. Resolutions 6 and 7 – Re-appointment of new directors
The Articles of Association of the Company requires that any Director appointed to the Board by ordinary resolution shall hold office only
until the next following annual general meeting and shall then be eligible for reappointment. Michael Shallow and Dianne Thompson were
appointed since the last Annual General Meeting and thus retire and seek reappointment.
5. Resolution 8 – Re-appointment of auditors
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each Annual General Meeting to hold office until the next such meeting at which accounts
are presented. This resolution proposes the re-appointment of the Company’s existing auditors, Ernst & Young LLP , and authorises the
Directors to agree their remuneration.
6. Resolution 9 – Asks the shareholders to renew the directors’ general authority to allot unissued shares, should it be desirable to do so. 
In accordance with corporate governance best practice recommendations, if approved, this authority is limited to an aggregate nominal
amount of £882,929.05.
7. Resolution 10 – Renews an existing authority given to the directors each year to allot shares for cash to person other than existing
shareholders up to a maximum of 5% of the Company’s issued share capital. This authority, which will expire at the next annual general
meeting or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of the resolution, gives the directors flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities
as they arise and the 5% limit ensures that existing shareholders’ interests are protected.
8. Resolution 11 – seeks to grant (until the next Annual General Meeting or the expiration of 15 months if sooner) the Directors authority to
purchase the Company’s own shares up to a maximum of 10% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company. In proposing this
Resolution, the Directors consider that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders that Directors should retain the ability
to make market purchases of the Company’s own shares without the cost and delay of an Extraordinary General Meeting to seek specific
authority for a share purchase.

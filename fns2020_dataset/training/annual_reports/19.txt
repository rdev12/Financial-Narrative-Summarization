“revolutionary”
“It’s no exaggeration to say 
ONSPEED Mobile could 
revolutionise mobile web 
browsing” 
PC Advisor
Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 Launched in March 2006, 
ONSPEED Mobile uses compres-
sion technology and licensed page 
reformatting software to enhance 
mobile phone surfing, making it 
faster, easier and more affordable. 
By compressing web pages by up 
to 80% and resizing pages to fit 
specific mobile screens, users enjoy 
speed increases of up to ten times, 
web pages that are easy to view 
and use and data savings of up to 
75%. As most operators charge per 
Megabyte of data, by compressing 
the data, bills are reduced.
ONSPEED Mobile addresses the 
growing market for mobile Internet 
access and is aimed at the 700 
million java-enabled mobile 
phone users across the world. 
It has been reviewed success-
fully in over 15 publications, 
securing several five star awards 
in magazines such as Stuff, 
WebUser and Computer Active.
ONSPEED is the leading Internet 
acceleration software in the market. 
An award-winning product, it 
relies upon patented compression 
technology that delivers Internet 
speed increases of up to ten times 
for Dial-up and up to five times 
for Broadband connections. It is 
available online and in retail outlets 
in the UK and abroad. 
Dial-up users still make up the 
majority of Internet users in 
emerging markets like Brazil, India, 
Mexico and Russia. For such 
connections, ONSPEED delivers 
the only viable means to increase 
web browsing speeds and signifi-
cantly enhance the sending and 
receiving of emails. For users who 
are on a Broadband connection of 
up to two Megabytes (2Mb) and 
who frequently do not receive the 
promised speeds, as a result of line 
quality, distance from the exchange 
and contention ratios, ONSPEED 
delivers speed increases of up to 
five times. BT now offers ONSPEED 
as an enhancement to their 1Mb 
and 2Mb connections. 
Z gr OUp delivers consumer-
focused software services using 
cutting-edge technologies that are 
acquired through exclusive licenses 
or developed from the group’s own 
intellectual property (ip). 
Bridging the gap between new 
technology and marketing, the 
group combines a highly effective 
direct-to-consumer marketing 
approach, accelerated time-to-
market and a growing portfolio of 
innovative products. The group’s
strength lies in identifying new 
technological opportunities with 
well-defined commercial potential 
and developing these by licensing, 
acquiring and creating ip. it has 
produced a number of strong 
consumer brands, establishing 
key partnerships and delivering 
effective, analytical marketing 
strategies.

Net2Roam addresses the global 
need for low-cost easy Internet

Relaunched in February 2007 with 
iPass (NASDAQ: IPAS) infrastruc-
ture, Net2Roam added 76,000  
Wi-Fi hotspots in 68 countries to its 
offering. 
NetAway, a cut-down version of 
Net2Roam previously sold in retail

Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 OnShare is the most recent addition 
to the Group’s portfolio. A software 
service, it uses proprietary next 
generation file sharing technology 
to deliver the most secure and 
easiest way to share files with a 
closed network of friends known as 
Friend-to-Friend (F2F). The Group 
has made a significant investment 
in research and development over 
the last 2.5 years and purchased 
the outstanding minority interest in 
OnShare in December 2006. 
Securing 100% ownership of the 
OnShare subsidiary allows the 
Group to benefit fully from the 
growing market for file sharing, 
which currently accounts for at least 
60% of all Internet traffic. OnShare 
is set to satisfy the increasing 
demand while addressing the 
inherent problems associated with 
other kinds of file sharing. 
Offering secure, private, one-to-
one file sharing, OnShare has 
been developed to integrate into 
the very heart of the Windows 
application. It enables secure 
file sharing without the bundled 
spyware and malware associated 
with most other programs. By inte-
grating directly into the Windows 
operating system, users can create 
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

“...a growing portfolio of 
innovative products”
on-the-fly without the requirement 
for hardware and set-up. Known 
as Instant Private Networks (IPNs) 
OnShare enables friends, family 
and small to medium enterprises to 
establish the kind of networks that 
have commonly been the preserve 
of big business. 
The group focuses on low-risk, 
pre-paid cash generation and its 
product portfolio emphasises low-
cost products, low-cost customer 
acquisition and high levels of 
customer retention, achieved 
through the provision of excellent 
customer service and product 
upgrades. 
Z grOUp plc was admitted to the 
alternative investment market 
(aim) in June 2005 to enhance 
its profile among customers and 
prospective partners. This is the 
group’s second annual report as a 
listed company.

The key elements of our results for 
the year to 28 February 2007 are 
that turnover was down to £2.6 
million (2006: £5.0 million) and 
losses before tax and the share 
option based charge were £0.8 
million (2006: profit of £1.0 million). 
Cash balances reduced to £2.2 
million (2006: £4.1 million).
These results demonstrate the 
resilience of ONSPEED as we 
continued with the development 
of OnShare. There is no doubt 
that the challenges associated 
with the development of OnShare 
have been greater than originally 
anticipated but this product is 
now out and we are confident it 
will be considerably better for the 
delays encountered. As a result 
of this emphasis on development 
expenditure last year, the cash 
burn rate was considerable but 
it has been reduced substantially 
since the beginning of this year.
COrpOra TE STra TEgy
Our strategy for growing the 
business remains as stated in 
our AIM admission document – 
to identify, acquire or licence and 
develop technology opportuni-
ties and to commercialise them 
through proven brand develop-
ment and analytical and cost 
efficient marketing. We continue 
to monetise the current products 
within the Group as well as seeking 
new, innovative, web-enabled tech-
nologies to add to our portfolio that 
are pre-paid, high margin and offer 
high visibility. We have acquired the 
technology rights to market some 
new products which will grow our 
product portfolio, thereby enabling 
us to utilise our customer base to 
maximum effect.
In December 2006, we completed 
the acquisition of the outstanding 
minority interest in Onshare 
Limited which holds the OnShare 
technology and this will allow us 
to gain the full advantage of this 
new product when commerciali-
sation commences.

We strengthened our Board by 
appointing three new members 
in the year. In July 2006, Polly 
Williams was appointed as a 
non-executive Director and as 
Chair of our Audit Committee and 
Jonty Slater, the Group’s Chief 
Technical Officer, was appointed 
as an executive Director. Duncan 
Neale was appointed as Finance 
Director and Company Secretary 
in September 2006.
Ian Smith, who joined as a non-
executive Director at the time of 
our AIM listing in June 2005, has 
decided to stand down from the 
Board at our forthcoming AGM due 
to his other increasing business 
commitments. We have benefited 
greatly from Ian’s wisdom and 
experience and wish him well with 
his other endeavours.

Success in the technology 
sector is fundamentally reliant 
upon making the best use of the 
people it employs to create intel-
lectual capital. We are committed 
to motivating, developing and 
rewarding our employees and 
are pleased that employees 
have been with Z GROUP for an 
average of nearly two and a half 
years. We promote knowledge 
sharing across the Group, 
ensuring that management are 
responsive to issues and trends 
within the business and the wider 
marketplace. Our employees are 
encouraged to keep abreast of 
new technology in the market-
place in order to remain competi-

atmosphere based on teamwork 
so as to foster creativity while 
focusing on business development.

Part of Z GROUP’s philosophy 
is to work to the highest ethical

this includes its relationships with 
employees and customers and 
all those who may have dealings 
with the Group. We actively 
support a small start-up charity 
and provide encouragement 
to those employees involved. 
Also, we adhere to all environ-
mental regulations and have, 
where possible, utilised environ-
ment-sustaining policies such as 
recycling and waste reduction. We 
also encourage our employees 
to use environmentally-friendly 
supplies wherever possible, and 
to conserve electricity and water. 
prOSpECTS
OnShare is now at the stage 
where we can see its potential and 
believe it can deliver significant 
shareholder value. Our priority 
this year is to commercialise the 
OnShare product and to become 
cash positive. Our existing 
and other new products, and a 
much reduced cash burn rate, 
will assist us in that endeavour. 
The current year’s trading is 
currently ahead of budget and 
we are cautiously optimistic that 
the coming months will continue  
that trend.

The past financial year has seen 
focus on the following areas:
The core consumer product 
ONSPEED, improving the cost 
of acquisition and focusing on 
customer retention, mitigating a 
reduction in sales as a result of the 
increasing use of Broadband;
ONSPEED Mobile which 
provides a fast, full Internet expe-
rience on a mobile phone, was 
launched last March 2006 and 
the business continues to focus 
on sales both to consumers and 
also to operators; 
The development of the innova-
tive file sharing service OnShare, 
and its underlying technology. 
Beta testing of OnShare was 
concluded in February 2007 and 
is demonstrating encouraging 
signs of success;
Laying the groundwork for the 
release of new products; and
Towards the end of the year, 
the commencement of a cost-

fiNaNCiaL OvErviEw
The Group’s results for the 12 months 
ending 28 February 2007 show a 
loss before tax of £1.1 million on 
turnover of £2.6 million, compared 
to a restated profit in 2006 of £0.4 
million on turnover of £5.0 million.
Turnover from ONSPEED re-
presents 88% of total turnover 
for the year. The fall in ONSPEED 
turnover from £4.4 million for 2006 
to £2.4 million in 2007 was princi-
pally as a result of the growth of 
competitive, fast Broadband in the 
UK, Europe and the US. 
Net2Roam contributed £0.1 million 
to turnover (2006: £0.4 million) 
and ONSPEED Mobile which was 
launched in 2006 added £0.1 million 
to turnover. 
The loss in the year adjusted for all  
non-cash items was £0.6 million. 
Together with the investment 
in OnShare of £1.3 million, 
this has resulted in a net cash 
outflow of £1.9 million, leaving 
cash resources of £2.2 million at  
28 February 2007.
A cost saving plan was implemented 
in January 2007 and we are already 
seeing the benefits in the current 
financial year.
SHar E iSSUES
333,172 shares were issued in the 
year on the exercise of share options 
by three option holders.
A further 3,942,134 shares were 
issued to the minority shareholders 
of Onshare Limited to acquire the 
49% minority interest in the business, 
ensuring that the benefits of the future 
success of this service will flow 100% 
to Z GROUP shareholders.
rE viEw Of Op Era TiONS
The primary aims in the past year were 
to maintain good customer retention 
in ONSPEED, while gaining market 
traction for two new products, 
ONSPEED Mobile and OnShare. 
ONSpEEd
In spite of the predicted decline in 
Dial-up Internet access, ONSPEED 
has performed well throughout the 
year in retaining its direct customer 
base whilst gaining additional rest of 
the world revenue through partner-
ships in new territories. Online sales 
continue to account for the majority 
of sales both in the UK and abroad. 
ONSPEED has been a mainstay since the business was 
founded and has provided a valuable Internet service 
for those consumers who have not converted to Internet 
Broadband usage.
“safe”
“(OnShare is) a safe and convenient  
way of sharing files among friends”
Web User
Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 We recognise the need for  
local support within international 
markets and have established  
relationships with key local 
partners, which we have found to 
be highly beneficial in supporting 
sales growth. Following the 
success of ONSPEED sales via 
the web and the release of the 
retail version in Europe, we have 
signed a number of additional 
distribution deals for ONSPEED 
in Poland and Russia. In Russia, 
we deployed a retail promotion 
in March 2006 through monthly 
scratch cards, thereby addressing 
low credit card penetration  
and successfully attracting  
direct consumer revenue. In August 
2006, we closed an agreement with 
Voxnet, one of Poland’s leading 
ISPs, to promote ONSPEED and 
ONSPEED Mobile. 
The Group’s retail presence in 
Europe and the US has also been 
strengthened. In April 2006, the 
Group signed a retail agreement 
with Avanquest, a leading global 
publisher of best-selling personal 
and professional software 
marketed in over 100 countries, 
for France and Spain gaining a 
retail presence in key multiples 
including FNAC, Boulanger and 
through select online portals 
such as Bluesquad and Blitzbox. 
In February 2007, we appointed 
Navarre (NASDAQ: NAVR), a 
leading distributor of home enter-
tainment PC software in the US. 
In June 2006, we announced an 
extension to the agreement with 
BT to distribute ONSPEED to BT’s 
512kb Broadband base, giving 
these customers up to 5 times 
faster connectivity with ONSPEED 
Version 5. The Group continues to 
use these high profile relationships 
to further improve its awareness 
and credibility to a wider interna-
tional audience. 
Marketing spend on ONSPEED 
represented 29% of total Group 
indirect costs, representing a 
continuation of the historically 
efficient use of marketing. With 
targeted media buying and 
innovative in-house analysis, cost 
per sale equated to an efficient 
£6.76 compared to £8.04 in 2006. 
To further increase ARPU across 
the ONSPEED base, we launched 
an ONSPEED toolbar in February 
2007, providing more value to the 
ONSPEED product as well as a 
search box powered by YAHOO! to 
capitalise on search revenue from 
the ONSPEED base. The benefit 
of this added capability will be 
reflected in next year’s results. 
ONSPEED Mobile
The ONSPEED Mobile product 
became commercially available  
in March 2006 via Internet 
subscription and through existing 
UK distribution channels, including 
Amazon, PC World, Play and 
Staples. ONSPEED Mobile has 
received wide acclaim in the trade 
press, many of whom believe that 
demand will be triggered by the 
current expense of accessing the 
Internet via mobile devices – the 
same driver behind the original  
success of ONSPEED.

Fifteen publications have 
presented upbeat reviews, 
some granting 5 star awards, 
notably Computer Active, Stuff 
and WebUser. Although direct 
consumer sales have been slow 
to materialise, the Directors 
believe in the size and strength 
of the mobile Internet market 
and feel ONSPEED Mobile is 
well-positioned to benefit from 
longer term consumer take-up. In 
addition, deeper market penetra-
tion will take place via partnership 
with mobile network operators 
as demonstrated by a diverse 
pipeline of potential partners and 
jurisdictions.
OnShare
The Group has continued to 
invest significantly in OnShare, 
the proprietary file sharing 
software. The development of 
OnShare over the last 12 months 
has seen a series of continuous 
improvements to the design 
and functionality of the OnShare 
product, with focus on building 
stability and ease of use. In 
addition, significant R&D has been 
invested in OnShare’s underlying 
protocol, “ActiveStream”. This 
proprietary IP will be re-used and 
is set to become the basis for 
future consumer and corporate 
product development. 
OnShare was launched to a test 
group of users in March 2006, with 
subsequent upgrades through the 
year. This test identified a number 
of required improvements prior 
to launch and in February 2007 
a soft launch was implemented 
providing users with free access 
to the product which included a 
mechanism to encourage viral 
marketing. The growth in users 
has exceeded budget and based 
on this trend, we plan to commer-
cialise the product with marketing 
support around the middle of 
the current financial year. Share-
holders will be informed at the 
commencement of this initiative 
and will be regularly updated as  
to progress.
Net2Roam
Net2Roam continues to provide 
a consistent revenue stream, 
with very little requirement for 
additional resources or marketing 
budget. Relaunched in February 
2007 using iPass (NASDAQ: IPAS) 
infrastructure, Net2Roam added 
76,000 Wi-Fi hotspots in 68 
countries to its offering.

A cost saving plan was imple-

based on a staff redundancy 
programme, continuing focus 
on efficient marketing spend, 
streamlining server use across 
our portfolio of products and 
negotiating better terms with  
our suppliers. 
As a result of these costs  
savings, our unaudited manage-
ment accounts for the first two 
months of the current financial  
year show a 30% reduction in 
administrative costs year-on-year. 
In addition, consolidated sales 
for quarter one of the current year 
are ahead of budget.
OUTLOOk
The extended test launch of 
OnShare, although putting us 
behind our original plan at the 
time of admission to AIM, has 
resulted in a stronger offering to 
consumers. OnShare offers several 
unique features to consumers and 
to SMEs which the Group intends

the R&D invested in OnShare’s

future revenue streams. 
Mobile Internet usage is the 
key driver to ONSPEED Mobile,

uses proprietary compression 
technology to enable more 
efficient access to the Internet,  
and we are confident of the 
conclusion of operator agreements 
and healthy consumer demand in  
the coming year.

to develop products that satisfy 
consumer needs. We have a

that adhere to our high margin,

Z GROUP plc recognises the importance of, and 
is committed to, high standards of corporate 
governance. Z GROUP plc, as an AiM company, is 
not required to comply with the July 2003 Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance (the “Combined 
Code”), although it has adopted those Combined 
Code principles relevant to the size of the Group as 
set out below.
ThE BOARD AND iTS COMMiTTEES
The Board
There are currently eight board members, comprised 
of four executive Directors and four non-executive 
Directors. The role of the non-executive Directors is to 
bring independent judgement to Board deliberations 
and decisions. The chairman of the Board is a non-
executive Director who oversees the Board meetings 
and fields all concerns regarding the executive 
management of the Group and the performance of 
the executive Directors. A biography of each Director 
appears on pages 10 to 11. As the biographies 
demonstrate, the Directors have diverse backgrounds 
and the Board benefits from a wide range of 
experience. The Board’s collective knowledge and 
skill in business matters helps to ensure that the Board 
effectively governs the activities of the Group in the 
best interests of the shareholders. The Board meets 
regularly to review the Group’s trading performance, to 
discuss product developments and launches, to review 
the Group’s ongoing operations and to determine 
strategies for future growth. The Board discusses the 
schedule of matters prepared for each meeting but 
otherwise delegates specific responsibilities to its 
committees as set out on the right.
Each of the executive Directors is subject to an 
executive services agreement, with notice periods of 
between three and twelve months. Each of the non-
executive Directors is subject to a three month notice 
period with re-appointment or re-election required 
annually. Z GROUP plc’s Articles require Directors 
to retire from office and submit themselves for re-
election on one third rota at each AGM. Jack Bekhor 
will be retiring at the AGM and submitting himself for 
re-election.

The Nomination Committee is comprised entirely 
of non-executive Directors, being John Standen 
as Chairman, ian Smith and Polly williams. The 
committee oversees the structure and balance of the 
Board generally and is responsible for screening and 
proposing candidates for appointment to the Board. 
Remuneration Committee
The Group’s Remuneration Committee is also 
comprised of non-executive Directors, being ian Smith 
as Chairman, John Standen and Polly w illiams. The 
committee is responsible for reviewing the salary and 
benefits offered to executive Directors as well as the

the committee is responsible for determining contract 
terms, compensatory share options and pension rights.

all non-executive Directors. Further details regarding the 
Directors’ individual remuneration are set forth in the 
Report of the Directors on Remuneration on page 18.

Relations with Shareholders
The Board recognises and understands that it has a 
fiduciary responsibility to the Group’s shareholders. 
The Chairman’s Statement and Joint Chief Executives’ 
Statement include detailed analysis of the Group’s 
performance and future expectations. The Board and 
Z GROUP plc maintain consistent dialogue with its 
shareholders through presentations, such as those 
made immediately after the Group announced its 
interim results. The Group also routinely presents 
newly launched products to institutional investors 
and the Group’s website (www.zgroupplc.com) allows 
shareholders access to company information, such as 
contact details and the current share price. 
The AGM will also be a platform for the Board to 
communicate with shareholders, and the Board 
welcome the attendance and participation of all 
shareholders. Details of resolutions to be proposed at 
the AGM on 30 July 2007 can be found in the notice of 
the meeting on pages 45 to 46. 
internal Control and Risk Management
The Board requires strict internal control procedures 
for the Group. Upon the advice of the Board, the 
executive Directors each assumed responsibility 
for specific aspects of the Group’s operations. The 
executive Directors also regularly liaise with non-
executive Directors regarding accounting practices and 
legal compliance. The Board and senior accounting 
staff are all aware of the importance of adhering to 
the financial and accounting policies of the Group. The 
Board discusses any relevant changes to accounting 
policies and, if necessary, discusses the impact of 
such changes with external financial advisers to 
facilitate compliance. 
internal Audit
The Board agrees that there should be no internal audit 
function for the Group at this time considering the 
size of the Group and the close involvement of senior 
management over the Group’s accounting system. 
however, the Board will keep this matter under review 
in the event that circumstances warrant an internal 
audit function for the Group in the future.
Personnel Quality
The Board also oversees recruitment in order to 
maintain the highest level of competence and integrity. 
The policy of the Board is to promote competitive 
compensation and a professional working environment 
in order to attract the most qualified candidates. 
Budgetary Process
The Board approves the annual budget each year. This 
process allows the Board to identify key performance 
targets and risks expected during the upcoming 
year. The Board also considers the agreed budget 
when reviewing trading updates and considering 
expenditures throughout the year.
Going Concern
having made appropriate enquiries, the Directors are 
satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operation for the foreseeable future. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
Z GROUP is committed to operating to the very highest 
ethical standards, whether dealing with customers, 
employees, shareholders or partners. The Group also 
actively supports women to women international, a 
charity dedicated to working with women to promote 
access to basic economic, health and educational rights 
to benefit themselves, their families, and the whole 
community. Z GROUP has been supporting women to 
women international since its inception.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year.  Under that 
law the Directors have elected to prepare the financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).  
The financial statements are required by law to give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company 
and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for that period.
in preparing those financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on a going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and to enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for 
taking steps to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. They 
are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report 
includes information required by the AiM Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority (or Listing Rules).
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Z GROUP plc website.
The work carried out by the auditors does not involve 
consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the 
auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that 
may have occurred to the information contained in the 
financial statements since they were initially presented 
on the website.

comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, 
the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised 
Gains and Losses, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
the Company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement and the related notes.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the company and the company’s members as a body,

The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and international Standards on Auditing 
(UK and ireland).
we report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether 
the financial statements are properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.  we also 
report to you whether, in our opinion, the information 
given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the 
financial statements.
in addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, the 
company has not kept proper accounting records, if we 
have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information specified 
by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
we read other information contained in the Annual 
Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the 
audited financial statements.  This other information 
comprises only the Business Profile, the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Joint Chief Executives’ Statement, 
the Corporate Governance Report and the Report 
of the Directors on Remuneration.  we consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the financial statements.  Our responsibilities do 
not extend to any other information.
BASiS OF AUDiT OPiNiON
we conducted our audit in accordance with international 
Standards on Auditing (UK and ireland) issued by 
the Auditing Practices Board.  An audit includes 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  
it also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
and company’s circumstances, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed.
we planned and performed our audit so as to obtain 
all the information and explanations which we 
considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. in forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the financial statements.
OPiNiON
in our opinion 
the financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of 
the company and of the group’s affairs at 28 
February 2007 and of the group’s loss for the year 
then ended and have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
the information given in the Directors’ Report is 
consistent with the financial statements.

ACCOUNtiNG POliCieS 
Basis of Accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, in accordance with 
applicable accounting standards in the United 
Kingdom.
Basis of Consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the 
financial statements of Z GROUP plc and all its 
subsidiaries made up to 28 February 2007. No separate 
profit and loss account is presented for Z GROUP plc 
as permitted by section 230 Companies Act 1985.
The Company was incorporated on 20 April 2006 as 
Z GROUP investments plc and passed a resolution to 
change its name to Z GROUP plc on 15 June 2006. 
On 15 June 2006, Z GROUP entered into a share for 
share exchange agreement with the shareholders of 
Net2Roam Limited, whereby Z GROUP plc acquired 
the entire issued share capital of Net2Roam Limited 
and its subsidiaries, the consideration being satisfied 
by the allotment of ordinary shares in Z GROUP to the 
shareholders of Net2Roam Limited.
This acquisition was accounted for as a merger as 
permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 6.
Subsequent acquisitions, including the acquisition of 
Onshare Limited have been acquisition accounted.  
The difference between the cost of acquisition 
of shares in subsidiaries and the fair value of the 
separable net assets acquired, goodwill, is capitalised 
and written off on a straight line basis over its 
estimated economic life.
Significant Accounting Policy – Research and 
Development
Z GROUP invests a significant proportion of its 
resources in the development of its own intellectual 
property to bring new products and services to the 
market.  Development expenditure (principally in the 
form of the salary costs of its developers) is capitalised 
when its future recoverability can be foreseen with 
reasonable assurance.  it is amortised in line with 
sales from the related product over a period, typically 
between four and five years, which represents 
the Directors’ estimate of its useful economic life.  
ONSPEED Mobile development costs are being 
amortised over 4 years on a straight-line basis.  All 
research and other development costs are written off 
as incurred.
Significant Accounting Policy – Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is 
included in the balance sheet at cost, less accumulated 
amortisation and any provisions for impairment.  
Goodwill, which represents the difference between the 
purchase consideration and the fair values of those net 
assets (or book value of those net assets if the difference 
between book value and fair value is immaterial), is 
capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis from 
the year following acquisition and over a period which 
represents the Directors’ estimate of its useful economic 
life. Goodwill in the case of the acquisition of Onshare 
Limited will be amortised over 10 years. 
Adoption of new accounting policy – Share Based 
Payments, and resulting prior year adjustment
The cost of providing share based payments to 
employees is charged to the consolidated profit and 
loss account over the vesting period of the related 
share options or share allocations. The cost is based 
on the fair value of the options and shares allocated 
determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing 
model, which is appropriate given the vesting and other 
conditions attached to the options. The value of the 
charge is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect 
expected and actual levels of vesting.
in accordance with FRS20 “Share-based payment” the 
Group has elected to apply FRS20 to all grants, options 
and other equity instruments as they have all been granted 
since November 2002, the effective date of the standard.
The adoption of FRS20 this year has necessitated a 
prior year adjustment to be made, creating a share 
based payments reserve at 28 February 2006 of 
£739,978. This adjustment relates to options issued 
under the share option schemes described in Note 18. 
OThER ACCOUNTiNG POLiCiES
Deferred Taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing 
differences that have originated but not reversed at 
the balance sheet date where transactions or events 
that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future 
or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred 
at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are 
differences between the Group’s taxable profits and 
its results as stated in the financial statements that 
arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax 
assessments in periods different from those in which 
they are recognised in the financial statements. 
for the year ended 28 February 2007 27
Ë
Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
ACCOUNtiNG POliCieS
for the year ended 28 February 2007
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign Currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into sterling and recorded at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Balances 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Any exchange differences are written off 
against profits in the period in which they are incurred.
intellectual Property Rights and Domain Names
Expenditure incurred in the acquisition of intellectual 
property rights and domain names is capitalised within 
intangible fixed assets and amortised over a period not 
exceeding ten years, being the Directors’ assessment 
of the useful economic lives. 
An annual impairment review is undertaken to ensure 
that the recoverable amount has not fallen below the 
carrying value.
Leased Assets and Obligations
where assets are financed by leasing agreements 
that give rights approximating to ownership (“finance 
leases”), the assets are treated as if they had been 
purchased outright. The amount capitalised is the 
present value of the minimum lease payments payable 
during the lease term. The corresponding leasing 
commitments are shown as obligations to the lessor.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital 
and interest elements, and the interest is charged 
to the profit and loss account in proportion to the 
remaining balance outstanding.
All other leases are “operating leases” and the annual 
rentals are charged to profit and loss on a straight line 
basis over the lease term.
Pensions
The Group operates a stakeholder pension plan for 
which all employees are eligible. No employee has as 
yet entered into the scheme.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Net realisable value is based upon estimated 
selling price less further costs expected to be incurred 
to completion and disposal. Provision is made for any 
obsolete or slow-moving items.
Tangible Fixed Assets
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets 
at rates calculated to write each asset down to its 
estimated residual value over its expected useful life, 
as follows:-
website development 
costs 4 years, straight line basis Ë
Computer equipment 4 years, straight line basis Ë
Fixtures, fittings and 
equipment 4 years, straight line basis Ë
Motor vehicles 4 years, straight line basis Ë
Turnover
Revenue from the sale of licences is recognised in full 
when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, when 
delivery and acceptance of the software by the customer 
has occurred, when the fee is fixed and determinable 
and when collection is considered probable.
Revenue relating to the provision of services is  
recognised as the services are delivered with that 
portion relating to subsequent years included in 
deferred income.
Revenue is stated exclusive of value Added Tax.
website Development Costs
The Group capitalises website development costs to 
comply with UiTF Abstract 29 “w ebsite Development 
Costs” and these capitalised development costs are 
amortised over their estimated useful economic life.
The website development costs to launch new 
versions of an existing product are charged to the 
profit and loss account as incurred, unless the new 
version opens up a new customer-base in which case 
the costs are capitalised as “website Development 
Costs” and these capitalised development costs are 
amortised over their estimated useful economic life. Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007

The Group has tax losses of approximately £800,000 (2006: £170,000) which, subject to agreement with 
hM Revenue & Customs, are available to carry forward against future profits of the same trade.
A deferred tax asset of £64,084 (2006: £26,456) has been recognised in respect of these losses leaving 
a potential deferred tax asset of approximately £178,000 (2006: £24,000) which has not been recognised 
because there is insufficient certainty that adequate suitable profits will arise in the foreseeable future to 
utilise such losses.
in addition, a deferred tax asset of approximately £325,000 (2006: £220,000) in respect of share based 
payments has not been recognised because there is insufficient certainty that a tax deduction of this 
amount will result from the exercise of the options in the foreseeable future.

it is the Group’s policy to limit foreign currency exposure by using financial instruments whenever they are 
appropriate. No derivative contracts were entered into during the current year. it is the Group’s policy that 
no trading in financial instruments should be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign 
currency risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are 
summarised as follows:
interest rate risk
The Group’s policy on managing its exposure to interest rate change is agreed at Board level and reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. At the year end there was a small overdraft with a variable rate of interest at LiBOR 
plus 2%. 
NOteS tO tHe FiNANCiAl St AteMeNtS 
for the year ended 28 February 2007 Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.  The Group’s 
policy is to manage working capital so as to ensure that liquidity is maintained so as to meet peak  
funding requirements.
Foreign currency risk
The Group does not enter into hedging transaction to limit the exposure of foreign currency fluctuations. 
The Group does operate bank accounts in US Dollar and Euro to receive income and make payments from, 
and therefore employs a natural hedge against the US Dollar and Euro.
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures, i.e. those transactional (or non-structural) 
exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account. Such 
exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in 
the operating (or functional) currency of the operating unit involved.
As at 28 February 2007, these currency exposures were as follows:

Share Option Plans
The Z GROUP plc EMi Share Option Plan and the Z GROUP plc Executive Unapproved Share Option Plan 
were both introduced in June 2005. Under the schemes the board of Directors of Z GROUP plc can grant 
options over shares in the Company to Directors and employees of the Group. Options are typically granted 
at a fixed price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The contractual 
life of the option is 10 years. Awards under the scheme are reserved for employees who are deemed to be 
critical to the future success of the Group. The vesting period of the options typically is for 1 year or 3 years. 
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment. The differences between the two schemes are 
relatively minor: the main difference is in the definition of an eligible employee – in the EMi scheme you 
have to be a full-time employee, whereas part-time employees can become members of the unapproved 
scheme. Options issued under both schemes were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. 
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:

The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility from 21 June 2005, the date Z GROUP plc was 
admitted onto AiM, to the date of the grant concerned.  The expected volatility of options granted at the 
date of the float was derived by taking an average of historic share price volatility of a listed technology 
company of equivalent size to Z GROUP plc and Z GROUP plc’s subsequent share price volatility.

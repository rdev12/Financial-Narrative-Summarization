62235 Cobra Report 2006  25/1/07  17:53  Page 1 The financial results for the year ended 30 September 2006
demonstrate a continued strengthening of Cobra’s
competitive position. Turnover grew by 31% to a record
£10.1m (2005: £7.7m) and the Group made a profit before tax
of £0.2m (2005: £0.4m loss), generating £1.2m operating cash
(2005: £0.6m).  Cash at bank (including short term deposits) at
the year end stood at £3.2m (30 September 2005: £3.0m). The
contracted forward order book for the financial year 2007
currently stands at £6.0m (10 January 2006: £5.0m). 
North America continues to dominate with £8.7m or 85% of
turnover (2005: £6.1m) and this increase reflects both the
buoyancy of investment into the biotechnology sector in the
region, and the ability of our business development team to
successfully promote Cobra’s range of protein, virus and DNA
manufacturing services.  
Process development skills in protein particularly resulted in a
doubling of turnover relating to that product segment over
the previous year to £6.7m (2005: £3.2m), including the
completion of our first Phase III clinical programme. This
offset somewhat a lower demand for DNA, which fell by 27%
to £1.0m (2005: £1.4m).
Despite the phasing of demand for virus based manufacturing
services in 2006 to £1.9m (2005: £2.8m), the forward order
book for this product segment shows good growth potential,
with Cobra recognised as an expert in this scientifically
challenging field.  Accordingly, further investment in people
and facilities is planned at our Oxford Facility to enable all
three suites to be operating during 2007.  In order to broaden
our virus service offering we have also entered into an
agreement with an internationally recognised provider of ‘fill
and finish’ services to the biopharmaceutical industry. A
dedicated virus ‘fill and finish’ suite will be constructed and
made available to Cobra so that we can provide a seamless
service from pre-clinical through to final clinical trial dosage
form. This facility will be operational during 2007 with
customer contracts already under discussion. We will continue
to examine other ways of providing specialised services for
our customers and also stand ready to acquire additional
manufacturing capacity, subject always to confirmed demand
from our customers.
During the year we have continued to support internal
research and development initiatives to add value to our
service offering and we have filed a number of patents and
acquired certain patents to compliment existing intellectual
property.  This is a knowledge-based business and we seek to
be at the forefront of process development science to
enhance our competitive position.
In September 2006 David Bloxham retired as a Non-Executive
Director. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank him for
his four year service; his commitment and enthusiasm for
what we are seeking to achieve has been invaluable during
these early years in the Group’s development. David Oxlade
joined as a Non-Executive Director in July 2006.  David has
worked in the biotechnology, diagnostic and therapeutic
healthcare industry for over 30 years, with CEO appointments
in the UK, Asia and North America. David’s experience will be
applied to the challenges that we face in the global market
place and I am delighted to welcome him to the Board.
Cobra’s return to profitability is a significant milestone.  We
are a Group with a broad service offering across all
biopharmaceuticals, a strong North American business
development capability and active research and development
programmes into new processes and techniques to support
our customers in developing effective products. Further
expansion will be predicated on customer demand, and given
the forward order book, continued growth in sales and
profitability should support our ambition to be a leading
provider of biomanufacturing services to the global market
place.

Chief Executive’s Review
Financial year 2006 was a period of impressive progress for
Cobra.  Whilst increasing revenue to a record £10.1m (2005:
£7.7m) and moving back into profit, Cobra completed the
largest reorganisation we have ever undertaken. This
initiative has included the creation of separate research,
process science and manufacturing departments and a major
upgrade to our quality systems; thus positioning Cobra to
provide a higher level of excellence for our customers and
further our evolution towards becoming a major supplier to
the pharmaceutical industry. 
Much of this change has been fuelled by increasingly
stringent manufacturing quality standards which have been
spearheaded by the MHRA’s (the UK’s pharmaceutical
regulator) attitude to the implementation of the EU Clinical
Trials Directive which only recognises a single manufacturing
standard for all phases of clinical development and
commercial manufacture.  Our success in managing these
changes was shown this year by the completion of Cobra’s
first Phase III contract, a milestone in our history and a
remarkable achievement for the process science,
manufacturing and quality departments. The process
development and scale up programme was carried out in
record time and enabled our customer to initiate pivotal trials
in November 2006, nine months after scale up work began.
The process science department developed an efficient and
robust production process for this protein product from
scratch, enabling the customer to announce their plans for
product launch and commercial supply.
As well as consolidating our position as a protein
manufacturer, 2006 saw the potential for real growth in our
virus manufacturing business and in particular, the initiation
of a large contract with International Aids Vaccine Initiative
and GSK Biologicals (Belgium) (IAVI/GSK). This project involves
the manufacture of an HIV vaccine based on genetically
engineered chimpanzee adenovirus; a groundbreaking
technology. The selection of Cobra as lead manufacturer
recognises our track record in tackling the most challenging
projects in the industry. 
During 2006 we initiated further capital investment in our
Oxford Facility in order to enable multiple commercial scale
manufactures of virus product in three bioreactor suites.
Additionally, we constructed a further building adjacent to
the Oxford Facility to house a central storage area, additional
meeting rooms and offices for the quality department. This
investment now positions our Oxford Facility as an
international centre of excellence for large scale GMP
manufacture of virus products and for significant revenue
growth in 2007. In April 2006 we also expanded and
strengthened the US sales team with the appointment of a
sales executive in Washington DC; Cobra now has
representation close to all the major North American biotech
hubs.
Cobra continues to develop its technology base through
investment in research and development. We are
collaborating with the US Navy on a vaccine for malaria using
our proprietary oral vaccine technology ORT-VAC. The US
Navy is a major player in malaria vaccine research and is able
to bring with it significant development resources to validate
this technology. During the year Cobra was awarded a broad
patent on the ORT-VAC vaccine technology which along with
our granted patents in the USA and other major territories
gives us excellent coverage and an exciting opportunity to
gain value through out-licensing. In addition, the Group has
had a number of patents granted related to DNA
manufacture and we also acquired certain patents from
Valentis Inc., consolidating our leading position in ORT, the
antibiotic free manufacture of biopharmaceuticals in
genetically engineered micro-organisms.
We have entered the new year with the contracted forward
order book at a historic high of £6.0m and a real opportunity
to maximise the return on investment. Financial year 2006
was a record year in several respects and it is a credit to the
energy and commitment of our staff that made this year a
success against the background of rapid change within Cobra.

Financial Review
Turnover
Cobra generated £11.0m worth of invoiced sales in financial
year 2006 (2005: £7.9m), £10.1m of which has been
recognised as revenue in the period, a 31% increase on the
previous financial year (2005: £7.7m).  The remainder was
held in the closing deferred income balance of £1.2m, a
threefold increase on the closing balance last year (30
September 2005: £0.4m). The deferred income balance
provides an indication of the value of contracts in progress as
at 30 September 2006. Turnover by the customer’s product
type and destination is as follows:
Cobra made excellent progress in the financial year 2006: 
• Turnover increased by 31% to £10.1m (2005: £7.7m).
• The Group retained a profit before tax of £0.2m (2005:
£0.4m loss).
• Operating cash inflow doubled to £1.2m (2005: £0.6m).
• Deferred income at 30 September 2006 stood at £1.2m
(2005: £0.4m).  
• Cobra invested £1.5m (2005: £0.8m) in new equipment
and buildings during the year, £1.1m (2005: £0.4m) of
which was funded via either mortgage or leasing finance.  
• Cash at bank (including short term deposits) at the year
end increased to £3.2m (30 September 2005: £3.0m).
Turnover derived from protein manufacturing services
supported the Group’s overall increase in turnover this year,
with a 112% increase on the previous year to £6.7m (2005:
£3.2m). Virus manufacturing services fell by 29% this year to
provide £1.9m (2005: £2.8m). Turnover from DNA
manufacturing services also fell by 27% compared with last
year to contribute £1.0m (2005: £1.4). Cell line manufacturing
services provided £0.4m of turnover, which is a 12% increase
on last year (2005: £0.4m).  
Cobra has maintained its success in North America. £8.7m of
turnover was derived from our North American customer base
a 41% increase on the previous year (2005: £6.1m). There was
also an indication of recovery in Continental Europe, with a
235% increase to £0.7m (2005: £0.2m). Turnover from the Rest
of the World increased by 124% to £0.2m (2005: £0.1m) and
turnover generated by our UK customers fell by 54% to £0.6m
(2005: £1.3m).

FY 2006
Gross margins: The majority of costs included in the cost of
goods are fixed labour and facility costs and despite a 41%
increase in these costs in the year to provide the infrastructure
necessary to support the growing contracted forward order
book, gross margins were largely maintained at 53% (2005:
56%) as capacity filled in the second half of the year.
Sales and marketing: The 31% increase in turnover was
accompanied by an 8% increase in sales, marketing and
distribution expenditure to £1.1m (2005: £1.0m) 
Research and development: Cobra continues to recognise
that it has achieved its competitive advantage in the complex
market of biopharmaceutical manufacturing, through
investment in research and development. Research and
development expenditure increased by 51% to £0.4m (2005:
£0.3m).   
Administrative expenses: Increased by 5% to £3.6m (2005:
£3.4m). The factors attributed to the increase include the cost
of sourcing and recruiting scientists and quality assurance
personnel, along with an increase in site service costs as Cobra
expands into its Oxford Facility.  
Profit before tax: The Group retained a profit before tax of
£0.2m (2005: £0.4m loss) and a profit after tax of £0.3m (2005:
£0.3m loss). This is Cobra’s first full year profit since financial
year 2003, and provides earnings per share of 1.4 pence (2005
1.7 pence loss).

Financial Review
Cash Flow
Operating cash flow: The Group doubled its operating cash
inflow in 2006 to generate £1.2m from operations in the year
(2005: £0.6m). This was primarily derived from an EBITDA of
£1.0m (2005: £0.4m) along with an improvement in working
capital of £0.2m (2005: £0.2m). 
Capital expenditure: During the year Cobra nearly doubled its
capital investment to £1.5m (2005: £0.8m). This was for new
equipment at both the Keele and the Oxford facilities and a
new freehold unit adjacent to the existing Oxford Facility to
further enhance our manufacturing capabilities. 
Intangible assets: In the year Cobra acquired certain patents
from Valentis Inc. for $0.3m to consolidate our leading edge
in ORT technology.
Financing: In the year Cobra increased its mortgages and loans
by £0.6m (2005: £0.2m) to fund the purchase of an industrial
unit adjacent to the Oxford Facility. In addition, the Group
financed £0.5m of its plant and equipment expenditure during
the year through sale and leaseback financing offset by
repayments in the year of £0.4m (2005: £0.3m) to provide a
total net financing of £0.7m (2005: £0.1m).
Cash at bank (including short term deposits): The Group’s
improved trading position provided an operating cash flow of
£1.2m, this combined with the £0.7m net financing and a
£1.5m capital investment programme contributed towards an
increase in Cobra’s cash at bank (including short term
deposits) by £0.2m to £3.2m (30 September 2005: £3.0m). 
Taxation
At 30 September 2006, the Group had trading tax losses
carried forward of £14.2m ensuring that the Group should
not be obliged to pay UK corporation tax for the foreseeable
future on any trading profits.  
The Group is entitled to claim research and development tax
relief, available under Schedule 20 of the Finance Act 2000, in
respect of financial year 2006, which resulted in a credit of
£55k to the profit and loss account (2005: £54k). 
Treasury policies and financial risk
Surplus funds are intended to support the Group’s short term
working capital requirements. These funds are invested
through the use of short term deposits and the policy is to
maximise returns as well as provide the flexibility required to
fund ongoing operations. It is not the Group’s policy to enter
into financial derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Interest rate, liquidity and foreign currency risk
Interest rate risk: At 30 September 2006 the Group had a
sterling mortgage with the National Westminster Bank Plc of
£1.5m. The Group utilises the availability of an ‘off-set’
arrangement with the bank on the mortgage, which effectively
means the Group currently pays a fixed rate of 1.5% over the
National Westminster Bank Plc’s sterling base rate on the
outstanding mortgage balance. In addition the Group has a
$0.5m loan, again with the National Westminster Bank Plc,
where the Group pays interest at a rate of 1.45% over the
bank’s US dollar base rate on the outstanding balance.  
Liquidity risk: Surplus funds are invested on a short term basis
at money market rates and therefore such funds are available
at very short notice.

62235 Cobra Report 2006  26/1/07  15:42  Page 6 Foreign currency risk: The Group generated significant
overseas turnover during the year, primarily from North
America. The position regarding currency risk is regularly
reviewed and currency hedging activity is initiated where
appropriate. In the year the Group achieved an exchange rate
gain of £127k (2005: £48k loss), through the provision of
forward currency contracts against the Group’s contracted US
dollar order book, and the transfer of £0.3m of its existing
mortgage facility to a $0.5m US dollar loan in April 2006 at an
exchange rate of $1.74 to provide a currency hedge against its
US dollar trade debtors. Currency risk is also partially offset by
overseas expenditure.

Report of the Directors
The Directors of Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc present their
report to the shareholders, together with the audited
financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2006.
Principal Activities 
Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc is a holding company, with
wholly owned subsidiaries of Cobra Biologics Limited, Cobra
Biomanufacturing EBT Limited and Cobra Biomanufacturing
LLC.  The principal activity of the Group is the provision of
manufacturing services for protein, virus and DNA based
pharmaceuticals. 
Results and Dividend
The Group profit for the period after providing for taxation
tax was £0.3m (2005: £0.3m loss) and an equivalent amount
has been added to reserves. The Directors do not propose the
payment of an ordinary dividend (2005: nil).
The accumulated deficit carried forward for the Group
amounted to £33.2m (2005: £33.5m) 
Enhanced Business Review
Operations: Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc is an international
provider of manufacturing services for the global bio-
manufacturing industry. The Group operates two UK based
manufacturing facilities, one located  in Keele, Staffordshire
and the other in Cowley, Oxfordshire, both of which trade
through the Company’s wholly owned trading subsidiary
Cobra Biologics Limited. The Company’s other subsidiaries are
Cobra Biomanufacturing EBT Limited whose principal activity
is to act as trustee to the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan
(LTIP) and Cobra Biomanufacturing LLC which is currently
dormant. The financial position and performance of the
Group is set out on pages 4 to 7.
Markets: Cobra’s primary market for its services is in
North America, a region that currently attracts 78% or
$16bn of the $20bn* global research and development
expenditure on biopharmaceuticals. The global outsourced
biopharmaceutical market is currently worth $2.6bn**, the
vast majority of which, approximately 70%, is for phase III and
commercial supply. Although Cobra has completed its first
phase III contract, the Group does not have the scale to
compete effectively in this area and is therefore focused
primarily on the remaining 30% estimated to be worth in the
region of $0.8bn which comprises activities such as process
development, pre clinical, phase I and II clinical trials supply. 
The vast majority of the biopharmaceutical market is for
protein based manufacturing services, but there is also an
available growing specialised niche market for both DNA and
virus based manufacturing services. Cobra can uniquely
provide manufacturing services for all of these segments in
addition to cell based therapies. However the growth in
turnover over the last two financial years, has been built upon
providing protein based manufacturing services for the North
American market. 
Sales and marketing: The success we have achieved in North
America, with 85% of the turnover in 2006 (2005: 79%) has
been achieved through the recruitment of a highly effective
US based sales force of 3 sales executives, covering the major
biotechnology hubs of the West Coast and East Coast,
focusing on mid size biotechnology product companies with a
requirement for process development expertise and
specialised manufacturing services. 
Research and development: To maintain the Group’s scientific
competitive edge Cobra invested £0.4m (2005: £0.3m) in
research and development in the year and purchased patents
for $0.3m (2005: nil). The Group has a distinct research
department which employs 5 members of staff (2005: 3),
through which the Group develops its own intellectual
property, not only in the filing of its own process patents,  but
also, for example in the development of its own oral vaccine
platform technology ORT VAC, which we are developing in
conjunction with DSTL (UK Defence Science and Technology
Laboratory) who are using it to carry out clinical trials for an
anthrax vaccine and also the US Navy, who are promoting a
malaria vaccine.
Contract values: These are variable and range from £0.1m to
£3.0m, dependent upon the size and complexity of the
programme. It usually follows that the further down the
regulatory process our customer is, the higher the value of the
potential contract. The Group has been more successful over
the last 2 years in winning bigger contracts that are longer
term in nature, which has provided greater revenue stability.

Report of the Directors
Commercial risks  
The key commercial risks facing the Group are as follows: 
Recruitment, retention and training of employees: Cobra
operates in a knowledge based industry and recognises the
importance of the recruitment and retention of its highly
skilled workforce (for further information see key
performance indicator section). 
Regulatory compliance: Cobra is under intense pressure from
the UK pharmaceutical regulator, the Medical and Healthcare
Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), through the EU Clinical
Trials Directive to ensure that both our manufacturing
facilities provide services that are consistent and achieve the
appropriate quality standards, termed as current Good
Manufacturing Practice (cGMP).  Non regulatory compliance
with the MHRA may result in production delays or the even
closure of our facilities until corrective action is in place. This
risk is managed by employing and maintaining an
experienced quality assurance/control team of 27 employees
at both facilities (2005: 21) two of which are Qualified
Person’s (QP’s).   
Customer funding: The global biopharmaceutical industry
raised $19.7bn* worth of funding in 2005, $15.7bn* or 80%
of which was in North America. The majority of Cobra’s
customers are mid sized loss making biopharmaceutical
companies, who are reliant upon funding from the capital
markets for their product development. Cobra has a market
intelligence capability which constantly monitors global
pipeline funding and which companies are receiving that
funding. The Group always carries out financial due diligence
on all its customers prior to contract signature. 
Customer product failure: The biopharmaceutical product
failure rate is similar to the failure rate of conventional
pharmaceuticals, in that 90% of phase I drugs fail to reach the
commercial market. Cobra attempts to mitigate this risk, by
ensuring it has a wide customer base, working with 35
customers in 2006 (2005: 48), operating in all the
biopharmaceutical market segments and being thorough in
its customer due diligence. 
Capital investment requirements: Both the Keele and Oxford
facilities are maintained to both full cGMP and MHRA
compliance, and it is essential we maintain our facilities to
these standards. Capital investment is key to on going
activities. The Group spent £1.5m this year on capital
expenditure (2005: £0.8m).
Exchange rates fluctuations: Turnover from North America is
primarily in US dollars and any significant movement in the
USD/£ exchange rate may hinder our competitive position.
This risk is alleviated somewhat by currency hedging activities
such as forward contracts and the utilisation of a $0.5m US
dollar loan, which resulted in a £127k exchange rate gain in
2006 (2005: £48k loss). Our specialist skills are also relatively
price insensitive and the currency risk is partially offset by
overseas expenditure.
Key performance indicators (KPI’s)
Cobra operates in a complex and specialist field, but with a
business model of a conventional contract manufacturing
business, whose primary objective each financial year is to fill
capacity slots and thereby cover the fixed overhead cost of
the two facilities. The vast majority of these overheads are
fixed labour costs. The business has high operational gearing
driven by the generation and completion of contractual
revenue in the year and therefore the KPI’s of the Group have
been identified as follows:
The contracted forward order book: This is at an historical
high of £6.0m for the financial year 2007, 20% higher than
the same time last year (Jan 2006: £5.0m).  
Turnover and deferred income: Cobra invoiced sales of
£11.0m in the year (2005: £7.9m), £10.1m of which was
recognised as revenue (2005: £7.7m), the remainder was held
in the balance sheet as deferred income. The deferred income
balance at 30 September 2006 reached an historical high of
£1.2m, three time higher than the closing figure in the
previous financial year (30 September 2005: £0.4m), this
provides an indication of the value of work that has been
invoiced and paid, but not yet completed.  
Gross margins and profit before tax: These are another key
financial indicator the outcome of which is dependent upon
three key variables, firstly the price of the contract, secondly
slot occupancy which allows the Group to recover its fixed
overhead costs and thirdly the efficiency and speed at which
Cobra completes its programmes i.e. productivity. Gross
margins for 2006 stood at 53% (2005: 56%). The profit before
tax for 2006 was £0.2m (2005: £0.4m loss).

62235 Cobra Report 2006  25/1/07  17:53  Page 12 Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc 13
Report of the Directors
Operating cash flow: Cobra usually charges a non refundable
capacity reservation fee. This is payable by upon contract
signature and assists the Group with its working capital
requirements given that the majority of our costs are fixed
employee salaries. Trade debtors stood at the end of the
financial year at £1.4m (30 September 2005: £1.4m) despite
the 31% increase in turnover and debtor days for the Group
represented 48 days of invoiced sales (2005: 60 days).
Operating cash inflow for the year was £1.2m (2005: £0.6m).
Cash at bank: The Board pays particular attention to the cash
at bank to ensure the financial commitments of the Group are
met. Cobra closed the financial year with cash at bank
including short term deposits of £3.2m (30 September 2005:
£3.0m).
Employee recruitment and retention: The Group increased its
average headcount in the year by 25% to 118 employees
(2005: 94), 66% of which are regarded as productive
employees (2005: 65%). Voluntary staff turnover (excluding
temporary staff and retirements) increased in the year to 15%
(2005: 11%), but remains relatively stable compared with our
industry peers.

The notice of the Annual General Meeting, together with
notes on the resolutions, is on pages 43 and 44. In addition to
the ordinary business there are two items of special business
for consideration at the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting. These are: 
1. An ordinary resolution to renew the Directors’ authority
for the purpose of Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985
(“the Act”) to exercise all powers of the Company to allot,
or agree to allot, authorised but unissued (and unreserved
share capital of the Company). The authority will relate to
7,408,830 ordinary shares of 10p each, representing
37.8% of the current issued ordinary share capital of the
Company, and will expire at the conclusion of the next
Annual General Meeting of the Company or if sooner, 10
July 2008. The Directors have no present intention of
exercising the authority, which will be conferred by this
resolution. 
2. A special resolution to renew until the end of the next
Annual General Meeting or, if sooner, 10 July 2008 the
Directors’ power to allot equity securities (within the
meaning of Section 94 of the Act) for cash other than pro
rata to existing shareholders. This power will relate to
allotments in respect of rights issues (where difficulties
arise in offering shares to certain overseas shareholders
and in relation to fractional entitlements) and to
allotments (other than in respect of rights issues) of equity
securities having an aggregate nominal value not
exceeding £97,955 (being 5% of the issued equity share
capital of the Company). The Directors consider that it is
in the best interests of the shareholders that the Board
should have this limited power in order to retain
flexibility.
In the opinion of the Directors the passing of these
resolutions is in the best interests of the shareholders.

Report of the Directors
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in
Respect of the Financial Statements  
United Kingdom Company Law requires the Directors to
prepare financial statements for each financial year which
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.  In
preparing those financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
1. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
2. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
3. state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed; and 
4. prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and the Group and to
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985.  They are also responsible for
establishing and maintaining the system of internal control,
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Going Concern
The Directors have reviewed the budget, cash flow and other
relevant information and have a reasonable expectation that
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for the
preparation of the accounts.
Auditors
In the case of each of the persons who are Directors of the
Company at the date when this report is approved:
1. as far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no
relevant audit information (as defined in the Companies
Act 1985) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware;
and
2. each of the Directors has taken all the steps that they
ought to have taken as a Director to make themselves
aware of any audit information (as defined) and to
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that
information.
This statement is given and should be interpreted in
accordance with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies
Act 1985.
Deloitte & Touche LLP were appointed as auditors during the
year and have expressed their willingness to continue in office
as auditors and a resolution to re-appoint them will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Corporate Governance Statement
The Combined Code
The Directors are committed to high standards of corporate
governance. The Board is accountable to its shareholders for
good corporate governance and adopts the necessary
structures and procedures. Although Cobra Biomanufacturing
Plc is listed on the Alternative Investment Market and
therefore does not need to comply with the Combined Code,
the Board has reviewed the corporate governance of the
Group and has implemented the changes it has felt
appropriate, given the Group’s size. The Board will continue
to review the corporate governance of the Company during
the next financial year. This statement describes the approach
of the Company and the application of the principles
identified in the current code, which are being applied.
Application of the Principles
of the Combined Code
The Board
The Board of Directors comprises three Executive Directors,
including the Chairman, and three Independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Executive Directors have a clear
division of duties and meet to direct and control strategy and
the operating performance of the Group. This includes the
approval and monitoring of budgets, reviewing trade
performance and determining risk management policies. The
Group also has a schedule of matters reserved for the decision
of the Board. There is an agreed procedure for Directors in
the furtherance of their duties to take independent
professional advice if necessary, at the Company’s expense.

Corporate Governance Statement
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the
Group’s system of internal control, which is designed to meet
the particular needs of the Group and the risks to which it is
exposed. Such a system is designed to manage these risks, to
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss and to maintain proper
accounting records to ensure the integrity of financial
information used within the business and for external
publication.
The Group’s established internal control procedures include
the following:
1. A schedule of matters reserved for the Board. The Board
of Directors has overall responsibility for the effective
running of the Group and it has a formal schedule of
matters, which are specifically reserved for decisions by
the Board. 
2. The Board meet to manage the affairs of the Group. The
Group’s financial and operating performance is closely
monitored at each Board meeting with formal Board
reports from the Chief Executive and the Finance Director
covering their areas of the business.
3. The Group’s Board meet twice a year for a strategic
review. The purpose of which is to formulate a long term
strategy for the Group and develop a strategic framework
for the achievement of the Group’s financial targets.   
4. The Group’s Senior Management Team (the SMT) meets
weekly to review and discuss the current issues facing the
Group and financial performance. The SMT is comprised
of the operational senior management, including the
Chief Executive and the Finance Director who each
provide an update. Each member of the SMT operates
within a clearly defined Group structure and each
member is given the appropriate operational authority.
5. The Group prepares an annual budget, developed
through a comprehensive operational budgeting process
prior to the commencement of the financial year. A
revised forecast is prepared at the half year. The budget
and the revised forecast are reviewed and approved by
the Board and the SMT.   
6. The Board and the SMT then monitor the actual monthly
financial performance of the Group against the budget
and the half year revised forecast, with any significant
variances highlighted and explained. 
The Board also recognises the need for an effective risk
management process. Last year, the Group reviewed and
prioritised the major strategic risks facing the Group, with the
current controls for each risk identified and a recommended
strategy put in place for improvement. This year the Group
has developed and embedded a risk review process into the
established internal control procedures of the Group.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of continual
communications with shareholders and will maintain a
programme of regular dialogue with its investors, including
presentations following the Company’s announcements of its
preliminary full year figures and of the half year results.
There is also an opportunity at the Company’s Annual General
Meeting for individual shareholders to raise general business
matters with the full Board and the notice of the Company’s
Annual General Meeting is circulated to all shareholders at
least 20 working days before such meeting. The Chairmen of
the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees will be
available at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions. 
The Annual Report will be published on the Company’s
website www.cobrabio.com, which also includes previous
financial reports, press releases, presentations and other
announcements made during the year.

Report on Directors’ Remuneration
This report describes the role and composition of the
Remuneration Committee (the Committee), the Group’s
remuneration policy and the arrangements currently in place
in respect of both Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
Reward Philosophy
To ensure corporate success and enhance shareholder value,
the Group needs people of high calibre able to meet the
challenges it faces. The Group’s overall remuneration policy
aims are to:
1. Attract, develop, motivate and keep talented people at
director and senior executive level;
2. Pay competitive total compensation packages to Directors
and Senior Executives, with a significant component
linked to the attainment of performance targets. When
pay levels are set, account is taken of the work a Director
does, what is paid by other companies for that work and
how well the Group’s businesses are performing; and
3. Encourage its Directors to hold shares in the Company,
which the Committee believes is an effective way of
bringing together their interests with those of external
shareholders.
The Company promotes greater ownership of its shares, by
offering Directors the opportunity to participate in the
Company’s share options scheme. 
Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period of
twelve months and then on a rolling contract subject to three
months’ notice either by themselves or the Company at a
salary determined by the Executive Directors. All Directors are
subject to re-election at an Annual General Meeting at least
every three years. The Board set the remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors with reference to third party consultants.
The Non-Executive Directors receive a basic salary and do not
participate in the bonus arrangements, healthcare
arrangements, company share option schemes or the pension
scheme. The Company repays the reasonable expenses they
incur in carrying out their duties as directors. Non-Executive
Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 30 September
2006 is set out in the following table:

Executive Directors’ Remuneration
The Committee determines and agrees with the Board on the
Group’s framework of executive remuneration. It decides the
specific remuneration benefits, employment conditions,
pension rights, compensation payments and severance terms
for the Executive Directors and the remuneration framework
for the other Senior Executives. 
The Committee investigates and takes into account the
remuneration paid to the directors of other companies of a
similar size and comparable industry sector in the UK, to
ensure that the levels of remuneration paid by the Group are
appropriate.
The primary source of this information was provided through
subscription and access to the annual New Bridge Street
Consultants’ “Biotechnology Industry Remuneration Survey”.
The Committee met twice in the year to 30 September 2006
and the Board accepted the Committee’s recommendations
without amendment.
The current members of the Committee are Michael Gatenby,
David Oxlade and Nigel Slater as Chairman, with David
Bloxham retiring on 30 September 2006. The members of the
Committee have no personal financial interest in the
Company other than as shareholders and the fees paid to
them as Non-Executive Directors. They are not involved in the
day-to-day running of the Group’s businesses. 
Although not members of the Committee, the Chairman,
Chief Executive and Finance Director may be invited to attend
meetings and the Committee consults them on proposals
relating to the remuneration of Executive Directors and
Senior Executives. They do not attend when the Committee
discusses matters relating to their own remuneration.

Report on Directors’ Remuneration
Reward Policy
The Committee’s policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration
is to:
1. Pay a basic salary, which competes with other companies
of similar size and complexity in the biotechnology sector. 
2. Give executives the opportunity to increase their earnings
by meeting and outperforming short term objectives
through the executive bonus scheme and longer term
objectives through the LTIP scheme. 
3. Evolve compensation schemes that encourage executives
to hold shares in the Company such as the LTIP scheme.
4. Overall, reward executives fairly and responsibly for their
contribution to the Group’s short and long term
performance; and 
5. Aligns, where appropriate the interests of the executives
with those of the members.
Elements of Remuneration
In deciding the Executive Directors’ total remuneration
package and individual elements of it, the Committee refers
to the reward policy and assesses where the Company should
be positioned relative to other companies. It has obtained
independent advice on appropriate comparisons and treats
them cautiously. The main elements of Executive Directors’
remuneration are as follows:
Basic salary: The Committee reviews basic salaries each year
taking account of the various factors, elements and policies
set out earlier, including Group performance. Any changes are
made with effect from 1 January. The basic salaries of the
Executive Directors are set out in the table overleaf.
Performance related bonus: The annual bonus further
motivates the Executive Directors and other senior executives
to achieve the Group’s financial objectives for the financial
year. The Committee reviews regularly the basis of the bonus
and the targets to be achieved.
The Directors’ bonus for the financial year 2006 was
determined by both quantitative and qualitative
considerations and directly linked to the financial year. The
quantitative objectives were based on Group turnover, PBIT
shareholder value and cash management. The qualitative
objectives were based on personal and team achievements.
The Chief Executive was entitled to receive up to a maximum
of 50%, the Finance Director 40% and the Chairman 30% of
their basic salaries under this scheme. In addition, the
Committee may award an additional discretionary bonus
where merited. Taking these factors into account the
Committee recommended the payment of bonuses as shown
in the table overleaf. 
Long term incentive arrangements: The Company operates
the Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc 2005 Long Term Incentive
Plan (LTIP) for the Executive Directors, in addition to the
Company’s unapproved share option scheme, which is open
to all employees of the Company. Both schemes are able to
grant options within the Enterprise Management Scheme.
The LTIP is designed to link a substantial part of the long term
reward of the Executive Directors to the investment of their
own funds in the Company’s shares, to align Executive
Director’s remuneration to improvements in the Company’s
performance and help retain them over the long term. The
LTIP allows for two types of award:
Matching award: this takes the form of an option to acquire
a number of shares in the Company at nil cost up to a
maximum of three times the number of shares acquired by
the participant through the scheme’s trust or a SSIP/SSAS
pension scheme up to a maximum of £40,000 in any financial
year. The ability to exercise the option will be subject to the
prior satisfaction of a performance target. 
Option award: this award does not require the participant to
invest their own funds to be granted nil cost share options.
However the value of shares options granted will be limited
to one times salary in each financial year.
The first awards under the LTIP were made in August 2006
and were matching awards (details of which are included in
the Directors’ Options and Performance Related Share Awards
table on page 21). The performance targets in achieving the
options were over a three year period and were split 50% on
achievement of a cumulative EPS target of 12 pence and 50%
on total shareholder return in comparison to other companies
within the FTSE Small Cap Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology
Sector.
Other benefits: The Chief Executive, David Thatcher and the
Finance Director, Peter Coleman receive a motor car, private
healthcare and death and disability in service cover. The
Chairman, Peter Fothergill receives a provision for private
healthcare and death and disability in service cover.
Pension arrangements: The Chief Executive, David Thatcher
and the Finance Director, Peter Coleman, are members of the
Group’s defined contribution personal pension scheme, which
is open to all employees. The Group makes a contribution of
10% of salary for David Thatcher and 7% for Peter Coleman
and both are required to make a minimum contribution of
3% of their basic salary. The scheme also provides a lump sum
death in service benefit. The Chairman, Peter Fothergill,
receives from the Group a contribution of 15% of his basic
salary to his defined contribution personal pension plan.

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with s235 of the Companies Act 1985.  Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s Members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.

statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of
the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order

Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the Year Ended 30 September 2006
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation: The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation and presentation of financial statements: The Group accounts comprise the accounts of Cobra
Biomanufacturing Plc and its subsidiary undertaking’s Cobra Biologics Limited, Cobra Biomanufacturing EBT Limited and Cobra
Biomanufacturing LLC up to 30 September 2006. No profit and loss account is presented for Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc as
permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Turnover and revenue recognition: Turnover, which excludes value added tax, represents amounts receivable in respect of the sale
of goods and services during the year. Turnover on contracts is invoiced in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the
customer. Non refundable capacity reservation fees, which are usually invoiced and paid upon contractual signature, are
recognised as turnover as the contract progresses. The remainder of the contractual turnover is recognised upon the stage of
completion when the outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty and after allowing for costs of
completion. 
Intangible assets: Are stated at cost less provisions for amortisation and impairments. Patents and know-how are amortised over
their estimated useful economic lives from the time they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for determining the
amortisation charge are reviewed annually.
Tangible assets and depreciation: Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land, at rates
calculated to write off the cost less residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings between 15 and 50 years
Plant and laboratory equipment between 6.67 and 10 years
Short leasehold building improvements 6.67 years
Office equipment 4 years
Motor vehicles 3 years
The cost of tangible fixed assets includes directly attributable finance costs, calculated on a day to day basis, on expenditure
incurred during construction and modification. The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets under construction include the costs
directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use.
Government grants: In respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income account and are released to profit over
the expected useful lives of the relevant assets by equal instalments. Grants of a revenue nature are credited to income so as to
match them with the expenditure to which they relate.  
Stocks: Are valued in the balance sheet at the lower of cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and
condition, and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a first in first out basis. 
Raw materials: purchase cost on a first in first out basis.
Work in progress: cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred on completion and disposal.
Research and development expenditure: Is written off in the period in which it is incurred, and includes inter alia all internal and
external costs incurred in patenting, external studies and consultancy.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments: Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts, which are those where
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet
and are depreciated over their useful lives. The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account
over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding. 
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

for the Year Ended 30 September 2006
Deferred tax: Is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date
where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to
receive more tax.  Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not
that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Foreign currencies: Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Pension costs: The Group operates a defined contribution scheme, covering all eligible employees. Contributions are charged to
the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Derivatives and other financial instruments: The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign
exchange risk and interest rate movements. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes.  The criteria for forward foreign currency contracts are:
–  The instrument must be related to a firm foreign currency commitment;
–  It must involve the same currency as the hedged item; and
–  It must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the Group’s operation.
Share based payments: Are accounted for in accordance with UITF 17, “Employee Share Schemes”, whereby the difference
between the market price and the exercise price of the options are charged to the profit and loss account over the period the
shares are vested, with a corresponding credit to reserves.

The deferred tax asset has not been provided for as it is uncertain whether sufficient profit will arise in the foreseeable future to
enable the asset to reverse.
7 PROFIT/(LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO MEMBERS OF THE PARENT COMPANY
The profit dealt with in the accounts of the parent company for the year ended 30 September 2006 was £67,930 (2005 £6,136
loss).
8 EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER ORDINARY SHARE
The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on profit of £265,057 (2005: £340,871 loss) and on 19,512,560 ordinary
shares (2005: 19,504,264) being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The earnings for the year for calculating the diluted earnings per share for the year ended 30 September 2006 are identical to
those used for the basic earnings per share. The weighted average number of ordinary shares for calculating the diluted earnings
per share for the year ended 30 September 2006 includes 389,304 share options and warrants that would potentially be issued
and would have the effect of reducing the earnings per ordinary share and would therefore be dilutive under the terms of
Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) No 22.  
The loss for the year and the weighted average number of ordinary shares for calculating the diluted loss per share for the year
ended 30 September 2005 are identical to that used for the basic loss per share. This is because the outstanding share options and
warrants would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and would therefore not be dilutive under the terms of
Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) No 22.

The long term loans are mortgage facilities of £1,542,891 and a $500,000 USD loan. Both are secured against freehold land and
buildings. They are repayable in monthly instalments, over a 13 year period commencing May 2007. For the mortgage facilities,
the Group utilises the availability of an ‘off-set’ arrangement with the bank, which effectively means the Group currently pays a
fixed rate of 1.5% over the National Westminster Bank Plc’s base rate on the outstanding mortgage balance.  For the USD loan
the Group pays interest at a rate of 1.45% over the bank’s US dollar base rate on the outstanding balance.

22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
An explanation of the Group’s objectives, policies and strategies for the role of derivatives and other financial instruments can
be found on page 7. It is not the Group’s policy to enter into financial derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The
financial instruments employed by the Group other than short-term debtors and creditors are used to fund its operations and
comprise cash, short-term deposits, long term loans and finance leases. 
The Group’s policy during the year ended 30 September 2006 was to place the majority of its cash on short-term deposit with its
bankers, to finance the purchase of freehold land and buildings through mortgage finance and to finance the purchase of fixed
assets through sale and leaseback, where possible, for cash flow purposes.
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to finance leases which are typically fixed rate, and its mortgage facility and
cash deposits which are typically floating rate. As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) No.13 the disclosures below
with the exception of currency exposure, exclude short-term debtors and creditors.

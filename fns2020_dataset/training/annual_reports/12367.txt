What sets us apart
Strong capital discipline 
As demonstrated in 2013, we are able to react dynamically  
to the changing market environment. This has allowed  
us to maintain free cash flow generation and sustain  
a significant dividend stream to our shareholders.
High-quality assets
Our high reserve grade supports relatively low cost profile  
and lower capital spending per ounce, which taken together 
drive better returns on invested capital and resilience  
to price shocks.

  The Company defines adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) as profit for the period 
adjusted for depreciation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, write-downs of inventory  
to net realisable value, share-based compensation, listing expenses, additional mining  
tax, penalties and accrued interest, income on disposal of subsidiaries, bargain purchase  
gains, foreign exchange gains/(losses), changes in fair value of derivatives, changes  
in fair value of contingent considerations, finance income, finance costs, and income  
tax expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.  
See Note 5 to the financial statements.

  Total cash costs comprise cost of sales of the operating assets (adjusted for depreciation 
expenses, rehabilitation expenses and write-downs of inventory to net realisable value)  
and general, administrative and selling expenses of the operating assets. Gold equivalent 
sales volume is calculated based on average realised metal prices in the relevant period. 
Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated as total cash costs divided  
by total gold equivalent unit ounces sold.

Record production volume
Polymetal achieved an all-time record 
production volume with 
810 Koz
of gold equivalent. This strong performance 
was bolstered by: 
•	de-bottlenecking of the Omsukchan 
concentrator (Dukat hub);
•	the expansion of the Kubaka plant; and 
•	mining and processing commencing  
at Albazino.
Premium listing on the LSE
Polymetal was admitted to the London  
Stock Exchange in November and included 
in FTSE 100 listing.
Strong operational performance
Metal sales for the full year exceeded 
production for both gold and silver.  
Polymetal produced
 1, 063 Koz
of total gold equivalent, up 31% compared to 
2011 and exceeding original guidance by 6%. 
Resource base increased
There was a dramatic increase in the resource 
base at Albazino. Successful exploration  
has also identified potential new growth 
assets at Kutyn and Svetloye. As a result,  
total gold equivalent resources grew by 35%.
Increased dividend pay-out 
Polymetal’s inaugural dividend payment,  
in respect of 2011, was made in June 2012.  
A new dividend policy was adopted,  
raising the payout ratio to 30% and 
introducing an annual consideration  
of special dividends in order to ensure  
value is delivered to shareholders.
Mayskoye mine started  
and ramped up
The Mayskoye plant was started up in April 
and achieved design capacity by Q4. This 
marked the completion of a major investment 
cycle to bring the second generation of assets 
into production, and the first 48 Koz of gold 
were sold to off-takers.
New dividend policy in action
A total of US$0.82 per share was paid  
in dividends in 2013, resulting in an industry-
leading dividend yield. The increased dividend 
payments were underpinned by commitment 
to capital discipline and strong free cash  
flow generation.
De-stockpiling on track
Progress made with scheduled stockpile 
reductions and with total gold equivalent  
sales exceeding production. De-stockpiling 
was driven mainly by the Dukat hub  
and Albazino. 
Net debt decreased
Positive cash flows resulted in a stable net 
debt at US$1,045 million, driven by continued 
strong operating cash flow and decreased 
capital spending. 
Production guidance exceeded
Polymetal exceeded its original annual 
production guidance for the second 
consecutive year and produced  
1 ,282 Koz
of gold equivalent, up 21% year-on-year. 
Amursk POX ramp-up  
successfully completed 
The Amursk POX plant delivered a full 
quarter at design throughput and recovery 
(averaging 93% in Q4). This is an important 
strategic milestone for Polymetal, which 
now possesses a unique competitive 
advantage in the FSU. Listing on the London Stock Exchange

Development focus
A core element in our strategy 
for driving long-term growth
Greenfield and brownfield exploration 
has proved to be one of the most 
efficient growth sources for Polymetal 
historically and remains an important 
pillar of our development strategy.  
Our decision to sustain our exploration 
programme and to keep working  
on the next generation of growth 
assets is a conscious strategic 
preference in the current market 
environment, although we have had  
to slow down some projects and defer 
development decisions for the key 
assets by approximately one year. 
In 2013, we invested in both  
brownfield and greenfield exploration, 
with total metres drilled increasing  
72% year-on-year to 194.9 km.  
We continued exploration activities  
at Albazino (including underground 
drift, geotechnical studies and in-fill 
drilling) with a view to converting the 
newly discovered resources to reserves  
and preparing the Albazino expansion 
project for the development decision. 
We have also advanced exploration 
activities and preparation for resource/
reserve estimates and development 
decisions at key greenfield projects 
(Svetloye, Kutyn and Maminskoye) 
which may form the next generation  
of our growth assets.
 
We expect that reductions in ore 
reserves and mineral resources  
in 2013 will be significantly reversed  
in 2014, as we step up our exploration 
efforts and complete feasibility studies 
on several key projects.

experience and technical 
expertise built up during  
the year
The Amursk pressure oxidation plant 
(POX), our state-of-the-art and the first 
operating POX plant in Russia’s gold 
industry, is now set to give Polymetal  
a unique competitive advantage, both 
nationally and in the Former Soviet 
Union, after successfully ramping  
up to design throughput and recovery 
by Q4 2013. 
However, reaching this milestone has 
taken longer than expected. During  
the ramp-up at the end of 2012, we 
encountered a number of mechanical 
and metallurgical problems, and  
a programme of remedial measures 
was developed to deal with these 
issues promptly.
The POX facility was restarted in  
Q1 2013, with limited daily throughput 
of concentrate to ensure operational 
stability. Works carried out during  
a planned six-week shutdown in Q2 
then allowed the plant to quickly 
ramp-up to the design concentrate 
throughput in Q3, along with 
improvement in recoveries. 
In Q4 the Amursk POX plant delivered 
a full quarter of stable performance  
at the design parameters for both 
throughput and recovery. Gold 
production was 59 Koz in Q4 while 
average recovery reached 93%.  
The plant is now running at 500 tonnes 
per day, exceeding its nameplate 
capacity for Albazino concentrate,  
with the aim of fast-tracking the 
processing of accumulated stockpiles.
In 2013, the successful ramp-up 
process at the Amursk POX plant  
(and related concentrate de-
stockpiling) contributed significantly  
to the increased gold production  
at Albazino/Amursk, which totalled  
238 Koz and exceeded original 
production guidance.

commitment to generating 
sustainable value
Commitment to capital discipline  
is the key characteristic of our 
investment and funding policy.
Capital discipline drives the use  
of the return on invested capital  
as the key metric for project 
development decisions. It also 
underpins our commitment to  
generate significant dividend streams 
for our shareholders while maintaining 
comfortable leverage levels and  
a conservative debt structure.
Despite challenging market conditions, 
in 2013 we were able to stick to all  
of these core principles. Free cash  
flow for the year was US$138 million, 
remaining flat year-on-year despite  
a substantial decline in revenues.  
This was largely achieved due  
to lower operating and capital 
expenditure levels, increased 
production and major de-stockpiling.
As a result, the Group’s liquidity  
profile remained comfortable, with net 
debt almost flat at US$1,045 million  
(2012: US$1,037 million) and 93%  
of debt being long-term. This has 
allowed us to retain dividend levels, 
with US$316 million being paid  
in during 2013 and a final dividend  
of US$31 million proposed in respect 
of this financial year.

Polymetal International plc
Chairman’s statement
During 2013, Polymetal achieved full compliance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code during the year,  
building on our established governance track record.  
We made advances in our executive remuneration and 
significant progress in sustainability governance and reporting, 
gaining ISO certification and upgrading our sustainability 
disclosure to the exacting standards of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI).
However, we regard strong governance as a dynamic  
process, in which continuous improvement is key. In 2013,  
we instigated the first formal evaluation of the Board’s 
performance, undertaken by an independent external advisor. 
This enabled us to review the Board’s effectiveness and 
identify areas for improvement. The majority of areas were 
rated very highly and we have pinpointed key priorities  
for the coming year along with strategic issues on which  
we need to focus.
We continue to strengthen and improve our business, both 
operationally and financially, but never lose sight of the Board’s 
responsibility for ensuring that the Company is run in the  
best interests of all its stakeholders through our commitment  
to the highest levels of ethical and responsible behaviour.
Our people
A strong leadership team can only achieve its goals with  
the collaboration and commitment of a strong and capable 
workforce. At Polymetal, we have talented, dedicated and 
hardworking employees and it is their efforts that are the 
bedrock of our success – now and in the future. On behalf  
of the Board and the leadership team, I would like to thank 
everyone for their support and I look forward to working 
together with them for the long-term prosperity  
of the business.
Confident outlook for 2014
The Board is pleased to be able to report a robust operating 
performance and resilient financial results for 2013, particularly 
given the vagaries of the commodity market trading throughout 
Market conditions during the year proved challenging, with 
gold and silver prices experiencing their sharpest drop in the 
last decade. However, thanks to a strong culture of delivering  
on our commitments, I am pleased to report on Polymetal’s 
resilient performance against this background. The high  
quality of our assets and a responsive team was instrumental  
in helping us achieve both our production targets and the 
planned asset ramp-up. We were also quick to respond  
to market challenges, taking timely and appropriate decisions 
on production, capital expenditure and funding and thus 
ensuring sustainable cash flow generation and profitability  
at the new commodity price levels.
For the second year in a row, we exceeded our original annual 
production guidance and produced 1.28 Moz (2012: 1.06 Moz) 
of gold equivalent in 2013, up 21% year-on-year and 7% above 
original expectations. This achievement was driven by the 
successful ramp-up of our key growth projects, Amursk POX 
and Mayskoye, and exceptional operational delivery at the 
Dukat hub. 
Dividends and value creation
Delivering meaningful dividend yield to the Company’s 
shareholders is central to our strategy focused on capital 
discipline. Polymetal has consistently implemented its dividend 
policy, with a payout totalling US$316 million in dividends  
in 2013 representing a 7.2% dividend yield to shareholders.  
This was underpinned by strong free cash flow generation  
in both 2012 and 2013, and by our commitment to deliver  
this value to shareholders.
Although the Company itself performed in line with the  
Board’s expectations, sustaining the same level of cash flow 
and profitability was clearly difficult in the significantly lower 
commodity price environment. Given current trends in the gold 
and silver market, with prices set to remain under pressure,  
the Board has rightly taken a conservative approach in order  
to preserve the Company’s current balance sheet strength, 
and has decided not to pay a special dividend for 2013. 
However, in line with our dividend policy and on the back  
of strong cash flow generation in 2013, the Board proposes  
a final dividend of US$0.08 per share for 2013 and this will  
be paid, subject to approval at the AGM, in May 2014.
Building on strong corporate governance
The Board is committed to open and constructive dialogue. 
Effective corporate stewardship and strong corporate 
governance are particularly important for the wellbeing  
of the business in the current challenging market environment, 
and we believe that we have the right balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company 
amongst the Board’s Directors to tackle these challenges.
the year. Our outlook for 2014 remains unchanged with  
a 1.3 Moz annual gold equivalent production target, which  
is set to reach a further 1.4 Moz level by 2016 with the current 
asset portfolio. Meanwhile, we will continue to prepare our third 
generation of assets for development decisions in 2014-2015  
in order to ensure growth beyond 2016. We will also look for 
strategic acquisition opportunities, and continue to streamline 
our current asset portfolio performance – all driven by the core 
objective of creating long-term value for our stakeholders.

Chief Executive’s review
safety rules by the employee. We have already implemented  
a number of additional safety measures and enforcements  
to existing safety rules across our operating mines. 
We are conscious of our long-term commitments  
to the economic, social and environmental wellbeing  
of the people and places associated with our operations.  
We have an ongoing programme of initiatives that support job 
creation, the development of local and regional infrastructure, 
health, education, culture, welfare and sports. Our investment  
priorities are determined through regular feedback from,  
and our experience of working with, local communities and 
indigenous peoples over many years. Our day-to-day conduct 
is guided by and complies with the UN Global Compact and 
the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
Looking to the future
Our plans for 2014 and beyond already take into account  
the current reduced level of commodity prices. Due to the  
high reserve grade and conservative price assumptions used  
in our life-of-mine models, the vast majority of our long-term 
mine plans remain intact after the recent price decline. All our 
operating mines continue to generate positive cash flows and 
can withstand further fluctuations in the gold and silver price. 
As a result, the Company reconfirms its production guidance  
of 1.3 Moz of gold equivalent for 2014 and 1.35 Moz for 2015, 
as well as our medium-term production guidance  
of 1.4 Moz in 2016. 
Our strategic focus is on new growth assets – through both 
the internal pipeline and M&A activities. We hope to deliver 
significant progress on both of these in 2014, but any decisions 
about either route will be subject to our usual commitment  
to capital discipline.

Robust operating performance
As reported in more detail in the Chairman’s statement, 
Polymetal exceeded its original production guidance for  
the second consecutive year, delivering an increase of 21% 
year-on-year, which was 7% above our production guidance. 
This robust achievement was driven by the successful  
ramp-up at Amursk and Mayskoye and strong operational 
delivery at the Dukat hub. 
Annual gold production was 805 Koz (2012: 589 Koz),  
up 37% year-on-year with significant increases coming  
from Albazino and Mayskoye. Annual silver production was  
27.2 Moz (2012: 26.5 Moz), up 3% year-on-year and helped  
by the increased throughput at the Dukat hub which more  
than offset the expected grade-driven decline at Khakanja.
The newly commissioned flagship Amursk POX plant, after  
all initial issues had been addressed, successfully achieved 
design throughput and recovery in the second half of the year 
(averaging 93% in Q4). This is an important strategic milestone 
for the Company which now possesses a unique competitive 
advantage in the FSU. 
Mayskoye, our newest underground mine and processing 
plant, ramped up to full capacity, marking the full completion  
of a major investment cycle between 2009 and 2012.
Strategy
Our strong production results were underpinned by a strategic 
commitment to capital discipline and to sustaining value in the 
long-term. We were quick to respond to the changing market 
environment by trimming capital expenditure, suspending 
higher cost assets and stabilising cost performance.  
All of these decisions will help preserve both the long-term 
value and the optionality of the Company’s portfolio.
Financial performance
While our financial results were unavoidably impacted by  
lower prices, this was partially offset by strong operating 
performance and decreased capital expenditure. We 
continued to generate a strong free cash flow despite the 
challenging market conditions. This allowed the Company  
both to sustain dividend flow to shareholders and to maintain  
a strong balance sheet position, which in turn will provide  
us with flexibility for further organic and acquisition growth 
opportunities in the current market environment.
Sustainability
Polymetal is one of the employers of choice in the  
mining sector in Russia and Kazakhstan, employing  
nearly 9,000 people at 31 December 2013. Alongside the 
responsible development of our business, the wellbeing  
of our dedicated staff is paramount to the success of the 
Company. We have made solid progress across all business 
operations to put in place an employee protection and 
workplace safety management system. Our health and  
safety focus for 2013-15 is to enhance our capabilities  
in three key areas – training, visualisation and monitoring –  
as well as rolling out the system to our supplier and  
contractor network. 
Our lost time injury frequency for the year reduced by 3%  
over 2012. However, it is with great sadness that we report  
one fatality in 2013 at the Ozerny open-pit mine in the  
Khakanja hub. A formal investigation into the incident has 
revealed a serious breach of both internal and statutory

2013 was a year when the world’s  
gold miners were tested for their  
ability to withstand market challenges  
as prices experienced their lowest  
dip for nearly two decades. While the  
drop in commodity prices impacted  
on performance, Polymetal demonstrated 
resilience by delivering on its promises  
and responding to the challenge swiftly  
and effectively.

Assets
Despite significant turbulence  
in commodity markets in 2013,  
Polymetal demonstrated a resilient 
performance and delivered  
on all of its operating targets
Polymetal exceeded its original annual production guidance  
by 7% and produced 1.28 Moz of gold equivalent during 2013, 
up 21% year-on-year. This achievement was driven by the 
successful ramp-ups at Amursk POX and Mayskoye, and 
strong operational delivery at the Dukat hub, supported  
by a robust performance at other mature operating mines. 
The full ramp-up of Amursk and Mayskoye in 2013 marked  
the completion of a major investment cycle and brought  
a whole new generation of Polymetal’s assets (Albazino/
Amursk, Omolon and Mayskoye) online. These new mines 
contributed 35% of total gold equivalent production in the year, 
as well as the bulk of production growth during 2011-2013.
In the light of a insignificant decline gold and silver prices  
in the second quarter of 2013, the management and the  
Board undertook a strategic review of our operations and 
projects, quickly identifying and implementing action plans  
to optimise operating performance and capital expenditures. 
The operational decisions taken were aimed at maintaining  
free cash flow generation and the capacity to pay dividends  
in the current market environment, whilst securing the long-
term health of our assets and retaining flexibility should  
prices recover in future. 
In light of this, high-grading (raising the cut-off grade  
of a mine significantly and continuing to mine whilst leaving  
the rest of the ore body uneconomic) was discarded as an 
approach for higher-cost assets. Instead, we have selectively 
suspended certain mines completely (Birkachan (Omolon hub)) 
and revised mine plans for certain processing hubs (Omolon  
and Khakanja hubs) in order to accelerate access to lower  
cost and/or higher grade material. All decisions, including  
the reallocation of mining volumes, optimisation of stripping  
and underground development, were driven by the  
life-of-mine NPV of an operation rather than short-term 
cost-cutting considerations.
Additionally, as a result of the Board’s strategic review, capital 
expenditure was optimised with savings of approximately 
US$60 million in 2013. Key decisions included:
•	the Sopka heap leaching project was postponed.
•	the greenfield/brownfield exploration budget was reviewed 
and re-prioritised. We have continued to invest in key 
development projects such as Svetloye, Maminskoye,  
Kutyn and the expansion of Albazino, although the pace  
of development has been slowed down and key project 
development decisions have been pushed back by 
approximately 12 months. At a number of early-stage 
exploration assets, exploration volumes have been  
reduced or cancelled completely.
•	certain non-core maintenance projects/mining  
equipment purchases at operating mines have been 
cancelled or delayed.
The actions outlined above made no impact on our 2013 
production plans and only a minor impact on the medium-term 
production up to 2016, when our original 1.4 Moz of gold 
equivalent production target will be achieved. Furthermore,  
we were also able to bring cash costs down by 8%  
in the second half of the year compared to the first half.

Exceeding expectations for production and sales 
Annual gold production was 805 Koz, up 37% year-on-year 
with significant increases coming from Albazino and Mayskoye. 
Annual silver production was 27 .2 Moz, up 3% year-on-year 
due to increased throughput at the Dukat hub, which more 
than offset the grade-driven decline at Khakanja. Copper 
production was 4.8 Kt, lower than in 2012 because  
of a scheduled decrease in copper grades at Varvara.
Silver sales lagged behind production in the first half of the 
year, mainly due to increased concentrate in transit inventories 
at Dukat. However, the gap was closed in the second half  
and metal sales for the full year slightly exceeded production 
for both gold and silver.
Successful completion of key capital projects
Amursk POX
Despite the unexpected setback in the ramp-up schedule  
at the Amursk POX plant, by the end of the third quarter  
of 2013 the plant was ramped up to full capacity and achieved 
design throughput and recovery. This required a six-week 
maintenance shutdown in the second quarter and an upgrade 
of the water treatment unit in the third quarter of the year.  
With these measures successfully completed on schedule,  
the plant quickly reached design parameters.
Launch of Mayskoye
Another highlight of the year was the successful launch  
and ramp-up of the Mayskoye processing plant. Between  
its launch in April and December, the plant produced  
87 Koz of gold in concentrate and achieved design  
throughput and recovery levels.
Analysis of production results
Mining
Stripping volumes in 2013 were flat at approximately 85 Mt  
of rock moved. Volumes of stripping were significantly reduced 
at the Omolon hub after Q2 (due to completion of a massive 
stripping campaign and suspension of mining at Birkachan  
in response to lower commodity prices), while at Varvara 
stripping volumes increased in the second half of the year  
as a result of pushback in the North-West and North-East pits. 
Underground development increased by 18% to more than  
55 km, mainly due to increased volumes at the Dukat hub 
where ore is increasingly sourced from underground, with  
the Dukat and Arylakh mines switching fully to underground.  
In 2013, we commenced open-pit mining at Dalneye (Omolon 
hub) and underground mining at Avlayakan (Khakanja hub).
Ore mined was 10.4 Mt and decreased by 18% compared  
to 2012; this is mainly attributable to the drawdown  
of additional ore for processing from prior years’ stockpiles  
at Varvara, Omolon and Khakanja. The bulk of ore mined (77%) 
was sourced from open pit, however the share of ore mined 
from underground has increased since the Mayskoye mine 
started active stoping with the launch of the processing plant 
and the Dukat hub shifted almost completely to underground 
mining during the year. 
The average gold equivalent grade in ore mined was  
4.7 g/t, a 22% increase year-on-year. The high-grade profile  
of Polymetal’s operations was further supported by the newly 
launched Mayskoye mine (average grade mined was 7.4 g/t 
gold) and the strong grade profile at Dukat, where the average 
silver grade in ore mined increased by 8% year-on-year  
to 429 g/t.
The full rollout of the short-, medium- and long-term 
computerised mine planning system across all the Group’s 
operations was also an important technical achievement  
during 2013.
Processing
Ore processed increased by 10% in 2013 and totalled 10.7 Mt. 
The increase was driven by further capacity expansion at the 
Dukat hub (including both Lunnoye and Omsukchan plants) 
and the launch of the Mayskoye processing plant in April 2013, 
which milled 488 Kt by the end of the year. Our mature mines 
demonstrated stable performance in terms of throughput  
and Albazino mine, as a result of de-bottlenecking, increased 
its capacity to 1.6 Mtpa of ore by the end of the year. 
In line with increased grades in ore mined, the average gold 
equivalent grade in ore processed grew by 4% to 4.6 g/t.  
This result was achieved through: the launch of the high-grade 
Mayskoye mine; the high grade profile at the Dukat hub and 
Albazino; and robust grade performance elsewhere across  
the Group, with the exception of Khakanja (scheduled grade 
decline driven by depletion of Yurievskoye and Khakanja’s  
pit 3) and Omolon (scheduled grade decline at Sopka).

In 2013, despite a significant decline in gold and silver prices, 
we continued to invest in exploration with total metres drilled 
increasing 72% year-on-year to 194.9 km. Total capital 
expenditure on exploration declined by 13% to US$59 million, 
mostly due to a decrease in the unit costs of drilling and  
a reduction in early-stage activities such as trenching.
We have made solid progress on all key advanced  
greenfield and brownfield exploration projects. As a result, 
material additions to ore reserves are expected in 2014  
at Svetloye (Q2), Albazino (Q4) and Kutyn (Q4), with further 
likely additions at near-mine properties at Omolon and Voro.

are due to rounding.
Production
For the second consecutive year, and despite commodity  
price fluctuations, we have exceeded the original guidance, 
achieving 1.28 Moz of gold equivalent production in 2013. 
Dukat, Mayskoye and Albazino/Amursk were the key 
contributors to this growth. Voro and Varvara demonstrated 
resilient performance. Production decline at Khakanja was  
a result of scheduled grade decline and the decrease at 
Omolon was a result of expected average grade decline  
in ore from Sopka.
In 2013, Polymetal continued to reflect seasonality in its 
production profile. Production dynamics on a quarterly  
basis are shown in the graph below. The strength of the 
second and the third quarters of the year was driven by:
•	 shipment of concentrates from Mayskoye and Albazino 
during the navigation period;
•	ore transportation at Omolon (trucking of ore from  
Sopka by winter road in the first quarter, processing  
in the second and third quarter); and
•	seasonal heap leaching operation at Voro.
In 2014, with the full volume of Albazino concentrate  
to be processed at the Amursk POX, the level of seasonality  
is expected to reduce. However seasonal navigation  
at Mayskoye and seasonal high-grade ore processing  
at Omolon will continue to influence the production profile,  
with peak production expected in the third quarter.

Ore reserves
at 01.01.14
In 2013, Polymetal decreased its ore reserves by 12%  
to 13.3 Moz of gold equivalent while mineral resources 
(additional to ore reserves) declined by 11%. These reductions 
were driven mostly by more stringent economic evaluation,  
using the same prices of US$1,300/oz gold and US$22.5/oz 
silver for both reserves and resources.
The key material additions to ore reserves were due to 
resource-to-reserve conversion at Oroch (241 Koz of gold 
equivalent) and acquisition and subsequent revaluation  
of Maminskoye (913 Koz of gold equivalent). Decreases  
in ore reserves, in addition to regular depletion (1,517 Koz), 
resulted mostly from the response to changes in mine plans 
and were mainly comprised of the following:
•	 re-optimisation of open pits at Birkachan and Sopka;
•	 exclusion of remote ore zones and ore bodies requiring 
significant additional investment in access at Dukat; and
•	 indefinite postponement of underground mining at Khakanja 
due to adverse assessment of geotechnical conditions.
Mineral resources decreased, mostly as a function  
of the lower gold price used in the year-end estimates 
(US$1,300/oz in 2013 vs US$1,500/oz in 2012).
Average ore reserve grade remains high at 3.7 g/t GE,  
a decline of 7% compared with 2012, while average mineral 
resource grade increased by 14% to 3.7 g/t as a result  
of lower-quality resources being excluded from the estimate.
Acquisitions remain an important pillar of our strategy
We believe that the current weakness in precious metal  
prices represents both a challenge and an opportunity.  
Growth through synergistic, value-driven M&A has always 
been an integral part of our strategy. In 2013, apart from  
the acquisition of Maminskoye, we undertook no major 
transactions. However, we are still keen to investigate potential 
acquisition opportunities, and have both the financial and 
operational flexibility to respond should such opportunities 
arise. In our acquisition strategy, we remain focused on 
high-quality development stage assets, with high-quality 
resources/reserves and long mine life to justify the construction 
of a standalone mine at current commodity price levels.
Metal sales in 2013 were 1,295 Koz of gold equivalent,
1
  
and grew by 19% compared to 2012. Sales volumes  
slightly exceeded production for the full year.
While most of the sales are comprised of refined metals,  
we continue to sell concentrates from Dukat (gold-silver), 
Varvara (gold-copper) to off-takers in Kazakhstan, Japan, 
South Korea and China. For Dukat and Varvara, the off-take 
allows us to maximise margins compared to in-house 
processing of these materials. During 2013, we diversified  
the off-taker base considerably in order to achieve an optimal 
combination of transportation costs and treatment charges/
recoveries. Off-take diversification is also an important element 
of Polymetal’s strategy aimed at strengthening our commercial 
independence from key customers. 
Due to the temporary setback in the ramp-up schedule for the 
Amursk POX plant and in order to avoid build-up of excessive 
concentrate stockpiles, we resumed concentrate sales from 
Albazino in the second and third quarters of 2013. Sales to 
off-takers in China during 2013 increased by 25% year-on-year 
and comprised 79 Koz. This has now been fully completed, 
with no further off-take required from 2014. 
Shortly after the start-up of the Mayskoye concentrator  
in April 2013, Polymetal signed two export sales contracts  
with Chinese off-takers for refractory gold concentrate 
produced at Mayskoye. A total of 30 Kt of concentrate  
with 48 Koz of payable gold was shipped to off-takers  
during the navigation period in 2013.
Exploration
Polymetal’s exploration activities are focused in five regions  
of Russia – Khabarovsk, Magadan, Chukotka, Karelia and 
Ekaterinburg – as well as in Kazakhstan. Polymetal currently 
has 54 licences for geological studies and gold, silver and 
copper exploration and mining, and one coal mining licence. 
Our current exploration portfolio includes 40 licences  
with a total area of approximately 10,240 km
2
. Of these,  
our exploration activities in 2013 covered 28 licence areas, 
including 20 areas in the scoping stage and eight areas  
in the advanced exploration stage.
Our exploration targets for 2013 included:
•	ongoing brownfield exploration activities aimed  
at extending mine lives at our existing operations:  
Khakanja (with the shortest current mine life), Dukat,  
Omolon, Varvara, and Voro;
•	continued exploration activities at Albazino (including 
underground drift, geotechnical studies and in-fill drilling)  
with a view to converting the newly discovered resources  
to reserves and preparing the Albazino expansion project  
for the development decision; 
•	 advanced exploration activities and preparation for  
resource/reserve estimates and development decisions  
at key greenfield projects (Svetloye, Kutyn and Maminskoye)  
which may form the next generation of our growth assets;

Outlook for 2014
The key operational focus in 2014 will be to deliver a full  
year of robust performance at two of our newest plants – 
Mayskoye and Amursk POX – and sustain robust operating 
performances at the Dukat hub and other mature mines.  
In doing so, we expect to achieve a production level  
of 1.3 Moz of gold equivalent, which will be further improved  
to 1.35 Moz in 2015 and 1.4 Moz in 2016, based on the  
current asset base.
Operations
Achieving our targets at Mayskoye will be key to delivering  
on this guidance. This will include trial processing of concentrate 
from Mayskoye at the Amursk POX plant in the first quarter  
and negotiation of the potential terms of long-term off-take.  
The split between own-processing at the POX plant and 
off-take sales will be driven partially by the relative economics 
of each of these routes and partially by the prospects  
of an Albazino expansion, which, if undertaken, will require 
additional POX capacity.
At the Amursk POX plant, the key objective is to deliver a full 
year of sustainable performance and further optimise it in terms  
of costs. Another important goal is to deliver a robust recovery 
and cost profile on the processing of Mayskoye concentrate. 
While the past year was challenging in terms of the POX plant 
performance, we believe that the internal expertise gained  
as a result of the ramp-up process will enable us to deliver 
both of these targets successfully.
Our operational objectives for other existing mines are:
•	 further de-bottlenecking at the Dukat hub underground  
mines and achieving total throughput of 2 Mtpa;
•	commencement of stoping at the Avlayakan underground 
mine and achieving an increase in the amounts of ore  
mined and shipped to Khakanja;
•	 increasing volumes of ore mined at Varvara after completion 
of the pushback and pit optimisation;
•	 a further increase in the amounts of ore trucking by winter 
road at the Omolon hub from Sopka and Dalneye; 
•	commencement of ore leaching at Birkachan heap leach 
facility (Omolon hub); and
•	an increased focus on enforcement of health and safety rules 
and risk management, with particular attention to key risk 
areas and rollout of our systems to suppliers and contractors.
Barring any further deterioration of commodity prices, we are 
also set to advance the development decisions for the third 
generation of growth assets, including potential expansion  
at Albazino and development of Svetloye in the second half  
of the year. In 2015 we will also consider development 
decisions for our Kutyn and Maminskoye projects.
Exploration
In 2014, our exploration activities will be focused on:
•	continued resource-to-reserve conversions and resource 
category updates at our advanced standalone exploration 
targets and brownfield targets through in-fill drilling;
•	 additional drilling at the flanks of Ozerny and Avlayakan  
with a view to extend life-of-mine at Khakanja;
•	further increase of resource potential at Albazino through 
additional underground development and drilling in the  
Olga zone, in-fill drilling in the Ekaterina-1 and Ekaterina-2 
zones, and additional step-out drilling at the flanks of the 
Albazino field;
•	completion of a resource estimate at Burgali and continued 
exploration at the other brownfield targets in the Omolon  
hub area;
•	 in-fill drilling and finalisation of resource estimates  
at Olcha with preparation for open-pit mining and  
exploration for new ore bodies in the area;
•	 continued exploration at the two key greenfield targets  
of Kutyn and Svetloye, followed by resource estimates  
and preparation of oxidised ores for open-pit mining;
•	 continued scoping and exploration at the Elmus and Semcha 
areas in Karelia, with a view to developing a new standalone 
gold/PGM asset in the region; and
•	 preparation of Maminskoye resources for open-pit mining 
and step-out drilling at the flanks of the deposit.
Our focus on exploration is a conscious strategic preference  
in the current market environment. With a high-quality portfolio 
of operating assets, we continue to generate robust operating 
results and healthy cash flows at lower commodity prices.  
We would, therefore, like to be fully prepared for the next  
stage of the commodity cycle by developing a new generation 
of Polymetal’s assets, both from reserve additions from 
exploration and from potential acquisition opportunities.  
The year ahead will be important for progressing both routes.
For the second year in a row, Dukat takes the lead among our 
mature mines in terms of both production growth and robust 
cost performance. Silver production in 2013 was 22.1 Moz,  
up 15% year-on-year, and was further supported by 
improvements in average grades at the Dukat and Goltsovoye 
mines and increased recovery rates. Despite the full switch  
to underground mining, the Dukat hub achieved a further 
reduction in total cash costs of 5% to US$11.6/silver  
equivalent oz. 
2013 highlights
Mining
In 2013, underground development at Dukat increased by 26% 
year-on-year to 30.7 km, with more than 1.25 Mt of ore mined 
from underground, and average silver grade in ore mined 
increasing by 9% to 423 g/t. This compensated for the 6% 
decrease in the total amount of ore mined after the completion 
of open-pit mining. Within the mine, we commenced 
development of the Eastern zone and further improved  
dilution levels by fine-tuning the parameters of blasting  
and drilling works. 
At Goltsovoye, following a significant amount of development  
in 2012, ore mined nearly doubled year-on-year to 168 Kt,  
and the average grades increased by 14% to 624 g/t silver, 
contributing to the increased grades in the Omsukchan 
concentrator feedstock. Underground development continued 
to accelerate and comprised 7.1 km in 2013, a 35% increase. 
The successful implementation of the drift-and-fill mining 
method has contributed to a significant reduction in dilution 
and improved average grades in ore mined.
At Arylakh, volumes of stripping and ore mined from open pit 
continued to decline due to depletion while being substituted 
by higher grade ore from underground. At Lunnoye works 
progressed steadily across ore zones 7 and 9 in accordance 
with the mine plan. Total ore mined increased by 7% year-on-
year to 394 Kt, although there was a slight decrease in average 
silver grade to 367 g/t due to the depletion of the open pit  
at Arylakh.
Processing
The amount of ore processed at the main Omsukchan 
concentrator grew by 9% year-on-year and comprised 1.57 Mt, 
with a further increase to 1.6 Mt expected in 2014 as a result  
of de-bottlenecking and increased capacity of the underground 
Dukat mine. Average grades processed followed the positive 
dynamics at Dukat and Goltsovoye mine, with the silver grade 
processed increasing to 425 g/t (+6% year-on-year). The 
average recoveries also trended up by 3% for gold and 2%  
for silver to 83.7% and 86.3% respectively. As a result, silver 
production grew by 18% year-on-year to 18.3 Moz, of which 
the majority was sold to third-party off-takers.
The new SAG mill was successfully commissioned at Lunnoye 
plant, which now has the capacity to process 400 Kt of ore  
per annum. Additional feed will come from existing stockpiles 
and potentially from the new satellite mine at Olcha in 2015.  
In 2013, the amount of ore processed was up 1% at 338 Kt 
and, despite some grade decline in the ore feed (see above), 
silver production was up 2% at 3.8 Moz due to increased 
recoveries which comprised 89.3% for silver.

Resources and exploration
We have continued our efforts in near-mine exploration in the 
Dukat licence area. In 2014, Dukat flanks and deep levels will 
see additional drilling concentrating on extensions of known 
veins beyond the down-dip limitations of historic exploration. 
We will also attempt to discover a new vein down plunge  
of the host rock formation, under the cover of sedimentary 
rocks. At Olcha, drilling will focus on the underground  
potential of currently known veins with an ore reserve  
estimate expected by the 2014 year-end.

 2014 pRioRities
In 2014, we plan to produce about 400 Koz of gold 
equivalent at Dukat since we expect the strong grade  
and recovery profile to continue. This will be enhanced  
by increased capacity at both Lunnoye and Omsukchan 
plants where throughput of 400 Ktpa and 1,600 Ktpa  
of ore, respectively, is anticipated.
At Arylakh, the transition to underground mining will be 
completed and the open pit is likely to close in Q2 2014.  
At Lunnoye, from Q3 2014 onwards, underground mining 
is expected to shift more towards the Zone 7 mine with 
lower gold and higher silver grades.
We will continue to work with our diversified off-taker base 
in Japan, South Korea and Kazakhstan in order to achieve 
optimum cost performance and recovery for the flotation 
and gravity concentrates produced at Dukat.
In 2014, if the market conditions are favourable, we will 
start development activities at the Olcha satellite deposit, 
where mining is expected to commence in 2015.

Despite a significant revision in annual and medium-term  
mine plans triggered by adverse movement of commodity 
prices in the first half of 2013, Omolon demonstrated  
a robust operating performance during the year. It was 
underpinned by flexibility and resilience offered by the concept 
of a processing hub with multiple feed sources. We were 
therefore able to reallocate the mining volumes promptly  
and deliver on our original targets in terms of gold equivalent 
production, producing 158 Koz of gold equivalent during  
the year.
2013 highlights
Mining
With the launch of mining at Dalneye in the third quarter, 
Omolon currently has four sources of ore: higher grade ore 
from Birkachan and ore from Tsokol are processed at the  
CIP circuit of the Kubaka plant; high-grade ore from Sopka  
and Dalneye is trucked to Kubaka and processed at the 
Merrill-Crowe circuit.
2013 saw a significant reallocation of mining volumes at the 
Omolon hub in response to the adverse changes in the gold  
and silver price. Open-pit mining was suspended at the 
Birkachan mine, which had the highest cash cost level, with 
mining volumes reallocated to Tsokol, Sopka and Dalneye, 
where a higher grade profile ensures lower cost levels.  
As a result, ore mined at Birkachan decreased by 55% 
compared to 2012.
At Sopka, the amount of ore mined was 672 Kt, a 47% 
decrease compared to 2012, while average grades for both 
gold and silver increased by 73% and 47% respectively.  
The decrease was largely driven by the availability of existing 
stockpiles and revision of the mine plan as a result of the 
Group’s strategic review. At Sopka, trucking of ore by winter 
road was successfully completed by the end of the first  
quarter of 2013 with 320 Kt of high-grade ore trucked. 
The heap leach project for low-grade Sopka and Dalneye ore 
has been further postponed from 2015 to 2016. Consequently, 
the last pushback in the Sopka pit has also been excluded 
from the mine plan with some loss of reserves below the 
current pushback boundary. The potential for underground 
mining at Sopka will be assessed by Q4 2014.
Mining at Dalneye commenced in the middle of the year  
and is now continuing at full scale. A total of 584 Kt of ore  
was mined in 2013, and the first 42 Kt of high-grade ore  
was trucked by winter road to the Kubaka mill during Q4,  
ahead of schedule. 
At Tsokol, volumes of waste and ore mined have increased 
considerably compared to 2012 as mining volumes  
were reallocated to the deposit following suspension  
of the Birkachan mine. Ore mined grew more than twofold  
to 223 Kt with an average gold grade of 4.8 g/t.

Processing
At the Kubaka plant, total throughput increased by 6%  
to 767 Kt and recoveries for both gold and silver increased  
by 1% to 95.3% and 88.4% respectively. This helped  
to partially offset the decline in average grades processed  
(-13% for both gold and silver) driven mainly by the expected 
average grade decline in ore from Sopka. As a result, gold 
equivalent production for 2013 was 158 Koz, down 9%. 
As part of the strategic review, management decided  
to defer the start of heap leaching at Birkachan (originally 
scheduled for Q2 2013) but to continue ore stacking during 
2013. We are planning to start leaching in 2014 with more  
ore stacked to achieve a better cost profile due to economies 
of scale. The heap leaching will then operate through to 2016.
Reserves, resources and exploration
Our brownfield exploration activities for Omolon in 2013  
were focused on several targets within a range of 150 km  
of the Kubaka plant in order to extend the life-of-mine.  
The reserve attrition at Birkachan and Sopka was partially 
compensated by resource-to-reserve conversion  
at Oroch at 1 January 2014 (+218 Koz of gold equivalent 
reserves). Mining at Oroch is expected to commence  
in 2015. New resource additions from Burgali and  
Nevenrekan (both saw additional in-fill and step-out  
drilling in 2013) are expected in 2014.

 2014 pRioRities
In 2014, at current market prices, we will continue  
to operate under the revised mine plans at Omolon.  
The Birkachan open pit is expected to be put on 
permanent care and maintenance in Q3 2014 after  
a brief mining campaign during the summer in the eastern 
part of the pit, which has already been reflected in revised 
reserve and resource estimates. The decision on the timing 
and other parameters of underground mining at Birkachan 
is expected to be made in Q4 2014 following the 
completion of in-fill drilling.
The total amount of ore trucked by winter road from  
Sopka and Dalneye to the Kubaka mill is expected  
to increase to 400 Kt in 2014 and support the overall  
grade level in ore processed.
The Kubaka plant at our Omolon hub
Despite initial mechanical and metallurgical problems in the 
ramp-up, the Amursk POX plant successfully achieved design 
throughput and recovery by October 2013. This was a definitive 
strategic milestone for us: Polymetal now possesses a unique 
competitive advantage in the Former Soviet Union, enabling  
us to target untapped refractory gold deposits across the 
region – through both exploration and acquisitions.
2013 highlights
During the ramp-up in the final quarter of 2012, we 
encountered a number of mechanical and metallurgical 
problems. Firstly, the presence of chlorine in the process  
water caused accelerated corrosion of valves and pipes  
made of an Inconel alloy in the circuit. It also depressed the 
recoveries in the autoclave due to the preg-grobbing effect.  
A programme of remedial measures was developed promptly 
to address both issues.
The POX facility was successfully restarted in Q1 2013, 
although daily concentrate throughput was intentionally limited 
before May-June 2013 in order to ensure stability of the plant’s 
operation. Then, during a six-week shutdown the Inconel parts 
susceptible to corrosion were replaced with more resistant 
parts made from titanium. The replacement allowed the plant 
to quickly ramp-up to the design concentrate throughput, 
along with improvement in recoveries to 87% in Q3 compared 
to 75% in Q1. In Q3, the POX plant produced 59 Koz of gold  
at an average throughput of 444 tonnes per day. 
After the completion of remedial work to the water treatment 
unit in Q3, full design recoveries were achieved in October.  
In Q4 the Amursk POX plant delivered a full quarter of stable 
performance at the design parameters in terms of both 
throughput and recovery. Gold production was 59 Koz  
in Q4 while average recovery reached 93%. A further 
optimisation programme is now in place to ensure continuous 
improvements in the recovery and cost profile of the operation. 
Currently, the plant is running at 500 tonnes per day, exceeding 
its nameplate capacity for Albazino concentrate, with the goal 
to fast-track processing of accumulated stockpiles.
In 2013, the successful ramp-up process at the Amursk POX 
plant (and related concentrate de-stockpiling) contributed 
significantly to the increased gold production at Albazino/
Amursk, which totalled 238 Koz and exceeded original 
production guidance.

Gold production at Albazino/Amursk in 2013 amounted  
to 238 Koz and exceeded the original production guidance, 
marking the successful completion of the ramp-up process  
at the Amursk POX plant and related concentrate de-
stockpiling. This was also a result of a robust operating 
performance at the open-pit mine and processing plant  
at Albazino where a considerable increase in throughput  
to annual run-rate of 1.6 Mtpa was achieved.
Mining
The open-pit mine at Albazino continues to run in accordance 
with the mine plan and with a stable grade profile. The amounts 
of ore mined increased 10% year-on-year to 1,338 Kt, and  
a further increase in mine capacity is expected in 2014  
to match the increased concentrator throughput. Average 
grades were 5.5 g/t gold, a 2% increase compared with 2012.
Processing
Ore processed grew by 23% year-on-year and comprised 
1,513 Kt while average gold grade processed increased  
by 6% to 5.6 g/t. As a result, gold in concentrate produced  
at Albazino in 2013 increased by 32% year-on-year. This was 
driven mainly by the considerable increase in plant throughput, 
where an annual run-rate of 1.6 Mtpa has been achieved since 
the implementation of a number of optimisation and de-
bottlenecking measures. 
Sales to off-takers in China, aimed at sustaining cash flow 
during the period of ramp-up of the Amursk POX plant, 
increased by 25% year-on-year in 2013 and comprised  
79 Koz. No further off-take will be required from 2014.
In 2013, the construction of an all-year-round road was 
completed, enabling uninterrupted trucking of concentrate 
produced to the Amursk POX plant. Previously, concentrate 
was trucked by winter road in the cold period and barged in 
the summer period. We have also commenced a scheduled 
upgrade of the tailings dam which will be completed in 2014.
Exploration and growth potential
The new resources established at Albazino in 2012 represent 
significant growth potential for the operation. This may require 
the expansion of the Albazino mine and the concentrator, with 
concentrate to be further processed at the Amursk POX plant. 
In 2013, we focused on the key areas required to prepare the 
feasibility study for this project. These included geotechnical 
studies to determine pit slope angle and underground mining 
method, additional in-fill drilling, and trade-off studies for coal/ 
heavy fuel oil power station. In addition, the outcome of the 
Mayskoye concentrate long-term off-take negotiations in 2014 
will be an important input to the expansion decision.
While the pace of the project has been slowed down and  
the development decision postponed to the end of 2014  
in response to lower commodities prices, we made significant 
progress in our geological studies during the year. The 
underground development continued, increasing almost 
twofold to 1,137 m in 2013, while the drilling volumes grew  
23% to 40.7 km. This included in-fill drilling from both 
underground and surface at Olga, Nadezhda, and Ekaterina-2 
ore bodies as well as underground ore drifting at Olga. 
We are planning to complete the full feasibility study on the 
Albazino-2 expansion project and consider the development 
decision in the fourth quarter of 2014.

 2014 pRioRities
In 2014 we expect to deliver a full year’s stable 
performance in terms both of mining and processing,  
as well as a healthy cost performance, which will be 
underpinned by operation of the POX plant at design 
parameters. No third-party off-take will be required  
for Albazino concentrate from 2014.
Our focus within Albazino will be increasingly on the 
geotechnical and feasibility study for new resources and 
their conversion to reserves, with the major reserve update 
expected by the end of 2014. By that time, we expect  
to evaluate all available development options for the newly 
discovered ore zones, and make key decisions for the 
needed plant and POX capacity expansion, as well  
as the mining method (large open-pit versus underground).

Mayskoye, a high-grade refractory gold deposit, is one  
of the top five deposits in Russia in terms of gold resources.  
The Mayskoye project consists of an underground mine  
and an 850 Ktpa on-site flotation concentrator. The ore  
is processed by conventional flotation on site and the 
concentrate produced is then shipped to third-party  
off-takers or the Amursk POX plant.
The launch and timely ramp-up of Mayskoye, located in the 
distant region of Chukotka, was one of the key achievements  
of the year. The mine delivered the first concentrate to off-
takers in China four months after the start-up of the plant  
in April 2013, and full ramp-up was completed in six months.
2013 highlights
Mining
The underground mine at Mayskoye has been operational 
since the beginning of 2010, with 29,976 m of underground 
development completed from 2009 through to Q1 2013, and 
280 Kt of ore grading 9.2 g/t gold mined before the start-up  
of the processing plant. Active stoping commenced in early 
2013 ahead of the launch of the plant. 667 Kt of ore were 
mined during the year at an average grade of 7.4 g/t.  
Grade is expected to improve in 2014 as ore from stopes  
fully replaces ore from historic development openings.
Plant ramp-up and processing
The construction was largely completed in 2012 and,  
in April 2013, the full flowsheet was launched in accordance  
with the schedule to produce the first batch of refractory gold 
concentrate. During 2013, a number of minor auxiliary facilities 
were commissioned, including fuel storage, an automated 
security and communication system, and a big-bag  
packaging unit. 
The ramp-up of the plant progressed in line with our  
original plans and, by October, the plant achieved its design 
parameters in terms of recovery and throughput. The daily  
ore throughput amounted to 90-95% of design capacity,  
while recoveries in Q3 were 86%.
Towards the end of the year, the Mayskoye concentrator  
continued to refine the metallurgical parameters of ore 
processing for different ore zones. Throughput stabilised  
at design parameters. In the meantime, we continued  
to manage concentrate yield versus recovery curve  
in order to achieve optimal cost performance through  
potential reduction of shipping costs. 
In 2013, a total of 488 Kt of ore with an average gold  
grade of 7.1 g/t were processed, while average recoveries  
comprised 78%. Total gold contained in the 49 Kt of 
concentrate produced at Mayskoye during 2013 was 87 Koz. 
Sales and downstream processing
Shortly after the launch of the processing plant, we signed  
two annual export sales contracts with Chinese off-takers  
for refractory gold concentrate, produced at the Mayskoye 
mine. The off-take allowed us to quickly receive cash flows 
from the project while the Amursk POX plant was focused  
on achieving design parameters and the de-stockpiling  
of Albazino concentrate. First shipments to the off-takers began 
in July and continued until mid-November. 30 Kt of concentrate 
with 48 Koz of payable gold contained were sold to the 
off-takers during the year and included in total gold production.

and trial processing of these commenced at the beginning  
of 2014. The results of the trial processing will inform the 
decision on the split of concentrate between off-take and  
own processing in 2014.

 2014 pRioRities
Our focus in 2014 will be on continuous improvement  
of production parameters and cost performance across  
all areas of the operation: in the underground mine,  
we will focus on reducing dilution through continuous 
improvement in the drilling/blasting technologies;  
at the processing plant, we will continue to refine the 
metallurgical parameters of ore processing for different  
ore zones, managing concentrate yield versus recovery. 
By the end of Q2 and the start of the navigation period,  
we will have completed the test processing of concentrate 
from Mayskoye at the Amursk POX plant and renewed  
the off-take contracts for sales of Mayskoye concentrate  
to China. The split between own-processing and third-
party off-take will be determined based on the relative 
cost/recovery attractiveness of each route.

Khakanja was one of our assets where the mine plans were 
amended mid-year in response to the significant decline in gold 
and silver prices. The change was made against the backdrop 
of a scheduled decline in grades at the main Khakanja deposit. 
Nevertheless, our total production target for the hub remained 
intact and the cost performance was better than expected due 
to increased recoveries and an increased share of high-grade 
ore from Ozerny and Avlayakan compared to the previous year.
2013 highlights
Mining
Mining at Yurievskoye was completed in the beginning  
of 2013. At the Khakanja open-pit mine, the pushback  
at pit 1 continued, which limited the amounts of ore mined 
(down 78% on 2012). Average gold and silver grades in ore 
mined decreased by 42% and 28%, compared to 2012  
when ore was mainly sourced from pit 3 and Yurievskoye.  
Ore mining is expected to be resumed in Q2 2014. As a result 
of additional studies, the commencement of underground 
mining at Khakanja has been postponed indefinitely due  
to geotechnical concerns, with the corresponding reserve 
being reclassified as resource. The resulting reduction in 
life-of-mine is expected to be compensated for by reserve 
additions at Ozerny, which are based on the results  
of ongoing step-out drilling.
At Avlayakan, open-pit mining ceased in November,  
one year earlier than originally planned, and underground 
development (919 m in 2013) commenced ahead of the original 
schedule as a result of decisions made following the strategic 
review. 78 Kt of Avlayakan ore were safely shipped by sea 
during the 2013 navigation season, compared to 41 Kt in 2012. 
The average grades in ore mined (8.7 g/t gold and 116 g/t 
silver in 2013) are expected to increase following the ramp-up 
of the Avlayakan underground mine and the beginning  
of stoping in 2014.
At Ozerny, mining works achieved full scale in 2013: stripping 
volumes increased to 4.7 Mt, more than 10 times over; ore 
mined increased more than five times over to 319 Kt, with 
average grades of 3.6 g/t gold and 40 g/t silver. 139 Kt  
were trucked to the Khakanja plant by winter road and were 
processed in 2013. A further increase in volumes of ore mined 
and trucked in 2014 is expected and will support the grade 
profile and production levels of the hub as a whole.
Processing
Gold production for the full year increased by 14% while  
silver production decreased by 44% as a result of a structural 
change in the plant’s feedstock year-on-year. Processing  
of high silver grade ore from Khakanja’s pit 3 was substituted 
by ore from Ozerny and Avlayakan.

Sustaining the grade profile and extending the life-of-mine 
remain our top priorities for Khakanja in 2014. In the year 
ahead, the development of the underground mine at 
Avlayakan and increasing the volume of ore shipping  
by sea, as well as further growth of mining volumes  
at Ozerny, will be the key contributors to support the 
volume and grade of ore processed at the Khakanja plant.

Voro continues to be one of the most profitable and effective 
mines in our portfolio. This is achieved by a combination  
of an attractive location in the Urals region, with full access  
to cheap power and infrastructure, and solid operating 
performance. Despite a significant decline in the gold price 
during the year, Voro delivered a resounding 61% adjusted 
EBITDA margin for 2013.
2013 highlights
Mining
The open-pit mine at Voro demonstrated a strong performance 
throughout the year. Mining in Q1 traditionally focused on primary 
ore, with a solid improvement in average grade mined allowing 
us to increase the average grade processed to 6.0 g/t. With  
the reduction of the stripping ratio in Q2, ore mined increased 
by 76% quarter-on-quarter, mainly represented by oxidised ore 
from the Southern pit to be used in heap leaching. In Q3 works 
continued at a stable pace across the Central and Southern 
pits. The amount of oxidised ore mined nearly doubled 
quarter-on-quarter, in order to supply material for the seasonal 
heap leaching. The amount of ore mined (both primary and 
oxidised) in Q4 was up 6% year-on-year. 
Total ore mined was 1.79 Mt, 6% up on 2012, with the increase 
split proportionally between primary and oxidised ore. Average 
gold grades in primary ore were stable at 5.7 g/t while average 
grades in oxidised ore decreased by 11%, fully in accordance 
with the mine plan. Mining works were concentrated on the 
Central (primary ore) and Southern (oxidised ore) pits.
Processing
In the first half of the year, Voro used third-party sources  
of ore from nearby deposits in order to leverage its processing 
capacity. This caused a temporary increase in the cash costs 
of the operation. Following the decline in the gold price in the 
second quarter, purchases of third-party ore were discontinued 
resulting in total cash cost improvement in the second half  
of the year.
Gold production at Voro in 2013 decreased marginally by  
1% year-on-year and comprised 154 Koz, of which 15% is 
produced at the heap leaching circuit and the remaining 85%  
at the CIP circuit. The modest grade and throughput decline  
at the heap leaching circuit was fully offset by a 7% increase  
in average grade and continued improvements in throughput 
(+1%) at the CIP circuit.
Ongoing improvement process
In 2013, the Carbon-in-Column (CIC) process was  
introduced for the extraction of gold from heap leach  
solutions as changing ore chemistry slowed down  
recoveries at the historical Merrill-Crowe circuit.

 2014 pRioRities
The Voro mine was one of Polymetal’s original acquisitions 
in 1998 and although it remains one of our lowest cost and 
highest margin assets, we remain committed to searching 
for new methods of enhancing both its efficiency  
and profitability.
Efforts are under way to identify additional sources  
of primary and oxidised ore, including third-party supplies.
At the Voro mine, the start of mining at the Gorevaya zone 
of South Voro is expected in 2014.

Since it was acquired in 2009, Varvara has become one  
of our core assets and a stable cash contributor. In 2013, 
Varvara demonstrated steady operating and financial 
performance despite challenging market conditions.  
This is well illustrated by stable total production (despite  
lower input from third-party ore in 2013) and total cash  
costs remaining almost flat on the back of the increased 
efficiency of open-pit mining. 
2013 highlights
Mining
Stripping volumes increased to more than 31 Mt in 2013  
(+19% compared with 2012), while the amounts of ore mined 
decreased to 2.0 Mt due to the ongoing pushback in the 
North-West and North-East pits. This did not have any impact 
on production during the year due to availability of sufficient ore 
stockpiles. A new electrical dragline excavator commissioned 
at the beginning of the year increased the efficiency of mining 
operations. Average gold grades in ore mined during the year 
have increased by 6% and 28% respectively for float and leach 
ores, while the copper grade declined by 21%, as expected  
in accordance with the mine plan, to 0.64%. 
Processing
Throughput at both flotation and leaching circuits in 2013  
was stable and comprised 1 Mt for the flotation circuit and  
2.7 Mt for the leaching circuit. In the flotation circuit, copper 
recoveries in 2013 decreased by 3% year-on-year, driven  
by significant change in the copper grade profile and related 
changes in ore technological properties, while gold grades 
remained stable. In the leaching circuit, the average grade  
grew by 9% compared with 2012 and comprised 1.3 g/t.
At Varvara, gold production for 2013 was 107 Koz,  
up 6% year-on-year. Copper production dropped  
to 4.8 Kt as a result of planned grade decline.

 2014 pRioRities
By the third quarter of 2014, we expect to complete the 
pushback in the North-West and North-East pits and 
return to a normalised stripping ratio. Most of the ore 
during the year will be sourced from the South and 
North-East pits. Some decline in grades in the leaching 
circuit in 2014 is expected, as in October 2013 Varvara 
discontinued purchases of third-party ore due to its 
declining quality.

with the feasibility study, is expected in the second quarter  
of 2014. This will enable the Board to make decisions about 
further development of the project. 
Following on from that decision, we are planning to  
commence detailed design and equipment purchases,  
as well as construction works in Unchi seaport.
02 Kutyn
Kutyn, a licence area located 113 km north-east of Albazino, 
currently has open-pittable inferred resources of 5.5 Mt  
at 4.1 g/t for 0.7 Moz of contained gold (to a depth  
of 140-240 m). Only 25% of the 120 km
2
 licence territory has 
been tested by drilling. The mineralised potential of the zone 
(inclusive of resources) is estimated at 10-15 Mt at 2.5-3.5 g/t 
for 1-1.2 Moz of gold (internal non-JORC estimate).
This deposit has two types of ore – oxidised and sulphide – 
with our current exploration efforts fully focused on oxidised 
material that can be processed by heap leaching. In 2013  
we continued step-out and in-fill drilling across all five ore 
zones, and continued scoping works on the flanks of known 
mineralisation. Drilling volumes totalled more than 15 km 
compared with 11 km in 2012. In Sedlovinnaya, Rodnikovaya 
and Geophyzicheskaya zones, we continued with 
technological mapping of ores and metallurgical  
testing of the assays taken. 
Construction of a winter road with an extended service period 
is scheduled for the beginning of 2014. Our exploration efforts 
in Kutyn will be focused on the identification of additional 
near-surface heap leachable mineralisation including 
extensions of known ore bodies.
The new JORC reserve and resource statement for Kutyn, 
based on drilling results to date, is expected by the end  
of 2014.
03 Maminskoye
Maminskoye is located in the Sverdlovsk region of Russia, 
approximately 70 km from the regional capital Ekaterinburg 
and 30 km from the city of Kamensk-Uralsk (population 
130,000). Our Voro mine is approximately 450 km to the north. 
The 17.8 km
2
 licence area is accessible by a paved highway
and is adjacent to a 10 kV power line. The Maminskoye licence 
area covers a 1,205 ha (2,978 acre) site which includes the 
potential mine, processing facilities and a waste rock stockpile. 
Since acquisition in April 2013, our exploration efforts have 
been concentrated on in-fill drilling, with 25.4 km drilled in 2013. 
Ore bodies have been drilled out to a depth of 200-250 m  
and remain open at depth and along strike in one direction.  
On the back of positive exploration results in 2013, probable 
ore reserves at Maminskoye were revalued by Polymetal  
(as at 1 January 2014) to 14.7 Mt of ore at 1.9 g/t gold, 
representing 0.9 Moz of contained gold. Mineral resources 
additional to reserves are estimated at 2.1 Mt at 1.4 g/t, 
representing 0.1 Moz of contained gold. 
In 2014, we will continue intensive exploration works at 
Maminskoye with a significant amount of drilling devoted  
to down-dip extensions of known high-grade portions  
of the deposit. Decisions about further development  
of the asset are likely to be taken in 2015.
04 PGM assets
Our PGM project now includes two exploration areas: 
Svetlobor (Urals region, acquired in 2012) and the  
Semcha licence area in Central Karelia, 350 km from  
St. Petersburg and 100 km north of Petrozavodsk. Both  
areas are in favourable locations in North-West and Central 
Russia with easy access to roads and infrastructure.
The mineralised potential of the Semcha licence area (inclusive 
of resources) was earlier estimated at 315 Mt for 10.0 Moz  
of contained Au-Pt-Pd (non-JORC estimate). In 2013, 
exploration drilling of more than 4 km was carried out  
in Semcha. As a result, we have identified gold/platinum/
palladium occurrences within a 50 km
2
 zone, with significant 
base metal credits (copper, iron, titanium, vanadium).  
The Viksha area was discovered in 2013. The width  
of 3PGE+Au specific horizon varies from 4 to 11 m, with 
open-pittable mineralised potential of 25 Mt for 1.6 Moz  
of contained 3PGE+Au (to a depth of 100 m) identified  
(internal non-JORC estimate). 
There is also additional mineralised potential of 48 Mt  
for 3.2 Moz of contained 3PGE+Au from 100 to 300 m  
depth. Favourable open-pit mining conditions are predicted  
at an approximately 8 km long reef within Viksha area. 
At Svetlobor, 10.9 km were drilled in 2013; however the 
exploration work there was slowed down by an ongoing 
forestry permits process. Drilling should resume in Q3 2014.
In 2014, at Semcha, there will be additional drilling  
on the tabular PGM-bearing reef on a regular grid along  
the known surface outcrop to a depth of 100 m.

Our decision to sustain our exploration 
programme and continue to work on the 
next generation of growth assets in the 
current market environment is a conscious 
strategic preference. However, we have  
had to slow down some projects and defer 
development decisions for key assets  
by approximately one year.
We continued to invest in exploration in 2013 with total metres 
drilled increasing 72% year-on-year to 194.9 km. Total dollar 
expenditure on exploration declined, mostly due to the 
decrease in the unit cost of drilling and a reduction in early-
stage activities such as trenching. While some optimisation  
of the portfolio of our greenfield assets took place after the 
decline in gold and silver prices, we have kept the exploration 
programme intact for key advanced exploration projects.
Our current greenfield exploration portfolio is focused  
on identifying assets with a potential resource base sufficient  
in grade and size to justify construction of a standalone mine  
at prevailing commodities prices. We are currently 
concentrating on the following key targets:
01 Svetloye
Svetloye is located 220 km south-west of Okhotsk in an 
undeveloped and sparsely populated region. It has open-
pittable inferred resources of 4.1 Mt at 5.9 g/t for 0.8 Moz  
of contained gold (to a depth of 100 m). The mineralised 
potential of the zone (inclusive of resources) is estimated  
at 30-40 Mt at 1.8-2.2 g/t for 2-2.5 Moz of gold (internal 
non-JORC estimate).
On-site heap leaching is currently the preferred route  
for development of the project. In 2013, we started the 
construction of a winter road which will enhance access  
to the deposit from the seaport of Unchi. A temporary  
storage facility has been built in Unchi. 
In 2013, 9.1 km were drilled in Svetloye with in-fill drilling 
concentrated in the Elena and Emi ore zones. The continuation  
of drilling programmes at Svetloye is contingent upon the 
extension of areas currently covered by the subsoil licence.  
As a result of the 2013 and prior-year drilling programmes and 
the metallurgical tests performed during the year, an updated

Sustainability
sust Ain Ability –  
inte GRAl to  
ouR business
We believe that a successful business  
is a sustainable business. Sustainable 
development forms an integral part  
of our business strategy, contributing  
to our global competitiveness and  
our reputation as an efficient and 
responsible company. We are firmly 
committed to the economic, environmental 
and social wellbeing of our stakeholders 
and see this as an investment for  
the future.
Stakeholder engagement
We engage with a wide range of stakeholders, who play  
an important role in helping us define our sustainability 
priorities and in providing feedback on our performance.  
It is vital, therefore, that we are open, honest and transparent  
in our dealings, and we achieve this by communicating through  
a number of different channels, including corporate reporting, 
Company news, briefings, hotlines and digital media.
We have identified five main stakeholder groups for  
Polymetal, each with its own specific interest in different 
aspects of the business:
Shareholders and investors: governance, strategy  
and sustainable financial returns;
Employees: careers, benefits, health and safety,  
corporate reputation and clear lines of communication;
Partners and suppliers: fair dealing, openness  
and transparency;
Government: compliance, transparency and  
economic development; and
Communities and NGOs: directing investments,  
openness and transparency, economic opportunity  
and long-term relationships.
Responsibility and risk assessment
Sustainability is ultimately the responsibility of our Group  
CEO, Vitaly Nesis. He is supported by Polymetal’s Technical 
Council which meets each month to monitor, among other 
issues, performance against our sustainability priorities  
and implementation across our operating companies.  
Our heads of department report to the Council on matters 
concerning employees, community outreach, health  
and safety and environmental management.
The CEO, Board of Directors and Technical Council,  
aided by the Internal Audit Department, identify risks  
to the business and associated management operations.  
Our risk management process is defined and monitored  
by the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board.
Our sustainability priorities
Through our risk management and stakeholder engagement 
programmes we have identified six key sustainability priorities, 
which are material for the business:
•	to maintain positive working relationships with local 
government, NGOs and communities by enhancing  
our partnership agreements and increasing the  
effectiveness of our investments;
•	 to attract and retain high-quality people and ensure  
and improve the quality and terms of their employment;
•	 to further improve our health and safety systems through 
more sophisticated visualisation, risk management and  
more rigorous monitoring, as well as to apply it to our 
supplier network;
•	 to gain third-party certification for our environmental 
management system and to embed the system into 
production operations; 
•	 to develop cost and energy efficiency programmes; and
•	 to enhance the rigour and transparency of our 
communications with suppliers, customers  
and partners.
our approach 
Polymetal has been a signatory of the UN Global Compact 
since 2009 and is also an active member of the UN Global 
Compact Network Russia. The UN Global Compact  
is a voluntary international standard that commits affiliated 
companies to comply with its ten principles in the areas  
of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption,  
and our overall sustainability strategy is designed to meet  
these requirements.
From an economic perspective, our objective is to generate 
sustainable value for all our stakeholders. We achieve  
this by improving operations and providing infrastructure  
such as roads and power lines, which in turn deliver wider  
benefits for the local community. We provide high-quality 
employment and financial support for local community 
initiatives. This significant direct investment, as well  
as the payment of national and local taxes, contributes  
to economic development within our key areas of operation.
We take the management of our environmental performance 
very seriously. We recognise that there is a potential risk  
of negative environmental impact from such a complex, 
geographically diverse business which uses resources  
and energy, and produces significant quantities of emissions 
and waste. To monitor and manage these environmental risks, 
we have established a management system that complies  
with international best practice and national legislation, and 
which achieved certification to ISO 14001 in March 2013.
We operate 120 production sites and processes, each  
with its own inherent risks, so ensuring a safe working 
environment for our employees is a key priority for Polymetal. 
Our approach to health and safety is underpinned by our 
employee protection and workplace safety management 
system. This is designed to detect, assess and manage 
production risks and is based on national and international 
standards of best practice. We continue to rigorously  
enhance and improve all aspects of the system.
We set great store by building strong relationships  
with the communities in which we operate, recognising  
that co-operation with local authorities and their associated 
communities is crucial to our business. We are a significant 
employer and creator of infrastructure that impacts  
upon adjacent communities and indigenous people.  
As a consequence, we have formalised our approach  
towards local and indigenous people in our Code  
of Corporate Governance and Policy on Social  
Investments, with open and regular dialogue.
Human rights
As supporters of the UN Global Compact and through  
our own corporate values, defined in the Polymetal Code  
of Conduct, we apply human rights principles rigorously  
for all our employees. We respect the human rights and 
preserve the cultural heritage of the indigenous communities  
in areas where we operate. We also seek to influence  
our partners, contractors and suppliers to apply  
the same standards. 
Polymetal’s Sustainability Report
We publish our Sustainability Report every two years.  
If you would like to learn more about our sustainability 
performance, including our compliance with the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework, our latest Sustainability 
Report is available to download from our website:  
www.polymetalinternational.com/sustainable-development. 
The next report, covering our activities during 2013-14,  
will be published in 2015. 
employees
Our employees are integral to the success of Polymetal.  
We employ nearly 9,000 people in our operations in Russia 
and Kazakhstan. We nurture their talent and commitment  
to our business with salary levels that are highly competitive 
and a social package that looks after their safety and  
wellbeing and enhances the lives of their families too.
Training at the Khakanja plant
Competitive salaries and benefits
Our salary levels comply with all the legal requirements  
in Russia and Kazakhstan. However, to attract and reward 
highly skilled staff, we offer salaries that are above the  
average in each of our operating regions, and in the Russian 
and Kazakhstan mining sectors. We also supplement  
this with a highly competitive benefits package.
In 2013 the Company spent over US$10.2 million to provide 
benefits, guarantees and compensations under its social 
package. The social package includes but is not limited  
to: benefits for employees working in remote regions;  
housing provision; financial aid; retirement benefits;  
travel costs; rotational transportation; kindergarten fees;  
and compensation for employees (or their families)  
in the case of workplace accidents. 
In 2013 the Company introduced a new scheme  
to help motivate and retain qualified employees. Under  
this, the Company assists employees with partial funding  
of mortgages to allow them to buy their own house  
or flat. During the year, 74 employees participated  
in the scheme and the Company paid out  
US$0.1 million of subsidies.

Contributing to employees’ wellbeing  
and professional development 
The Company also focuses on creating and constantly 
enhancing social and living conditions, improving our  
operating culture, maintaining employees’ health, preventing 
work-related diseases, boosting productivity and looking  
at ways to both motivate current employees and attract 
additional skilled workers. 
In 2013 the Company spent over US$4.5 million implementing 
these measures and covering a range of activities. 
The Training Centre at the Dukat operations (Magadan)  
is certified to carry out internal training and educational 
activities for 23 professions, and during the year trained  
546 employees for 14 professions. In future, we plan to replace 
external training with internal training as much as possible.  
Last year, eight employees of Polymetal Management and 
Polymetal Engineering qualified as Competent Persons in 
IMMM (the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining). This 
expands their opportunities and enables them to communicate 
effectively with colleagues from other international mining 
companies. It also expands the Company’s ability to prepare 
public exploration, mineral resources and ore reserves reports.
Diversity in the workplace
We believe in nurturing skills and talent regardless of gender. 
We have been actively recruiting and encouraging women 
within the business and, in 2013, the total number of women 
employed across Polymetal increased by 3.8% from 1,794  
in 2012 to 1,862. We have also seen a rise in the number  
of women in managerial positions to 285 in total (2012: 250),  
an increase of 14%.
Health and safety
Safe working conditions are the principal right of all employees 
and an indicator of efficient management of an operation.
Polymetal’s policy for ensuring a healthy and safe working 
environment is implemented through the current health and 
safety management system. This was developed using the 
fundamentals of international standards, contains advanced 
managerial techniques and distributes responsibility across  
all levels in order to ensure industrial safety and enable each 
employee to participate in risk management processes.  
The system complies with the internationally-recognised 
OHSAS 18001 and all the appropriate Russian  
occupational health and safety standards. 
 
In 2013, we continued to improve the health and safety 
management system, adding new techniques to identify, 
manage and visualise operational risks and engender  
a safety culture amongst employees by giving them key roles  
in assessing the safety and equipment of their workplaces. 
Suppliers and contractors 
According to the current health and safety management 
system, all contractors working on site at our operations  
must comply with Polymetal’s health and safety requirements. 
These obligations, and penalties for non-compliance,  
are stipulated within all our contracts.

2014 priorities
In 2014, our focus will be on improving the efficiency of the risk 
assessment performed on a shift-by-shift basis, emphasising 
the key role played by each employee. Before and during the 
shift, each worker assesses the safety of his/her workplace, 
entering the results into a personal risk assessment map  
as well as any suggestions on improving working conditions.  
The map is analysed by section managers and provides  
more accurate information about working conditions,  
enabling the response and risk to be managed in a timely 
manner. We will also be developing hazards visualisation,  
on-site and distance training and automated production  
control procedures. 
environmental performance 
One of Polymetal’s key priorities is to reduce the environmental 
impact of our production processes. In 2013 we updated  
our Environmental Policy to ensure improved efficiency  
in environmental management systems and continuous 
improvement across all stages of the Company’s exploration, 
mining and processing activities; wherever possible using 
modern technology, equipment and working practices 
to minimise our impact on the environment. The Company 
complies with all regulatory requirements and systematically 
monitors safety and management issues to ensure the 
business meets environmental objectives and targets.
As part of this, we have been working towards  
international certification of our environmental management 
processes. We are pleased to report that, in 2013,  
Polymetal’s environmental management system (EMS)  
was independently certified by Bureau Veritas Certification,  
in line with international standard ISO 14001-2004.  
The system supports our commitment and desire to ensure  
the effectiveness of processes, environmental protection and 
resource management as well as providing a foundation  
for continuous monitoring and improvement. We also achieved 
an additional certification audit for Mayskoye, which was 
launched later during the year.
Quality control at Lunnoye
As at 31 December 2013, the Company operates 91 hazardous 
production facilities. This has reduced since our last report due 
to changes in the classification and registration of hazardous 
facilities under Russian industrial safety legislation. Despite  
the overall reduction of hazardous facilities included in the  
state register, our operations are no less dangerous and every 
operation provides its workers with safety-at-work training, 
protective clothing and equipment, and has controls and 
processes in place to ensure safety in the workplace  
by identifying, analysing and eliminating hazardous  
and harmful factors.
Unfortunately, in 2013 there were 11 incidents at operations 
within the Group. In eight of these cases the workers had  
minor injuries and in two cases were severely injured. In the 
eleventh, Polymetal deeply regrets the death at Ozerny open-pit 
mine (Khakanja hub), where a serious violation of internal and 
statutory safety rules by a blastman resulted in his fatal injury. 
The Company has investigated the case and has already 
implemented an increase in training, a number of additional 
safety measures and enforcements to the existing safety  
rules across its operating mines. The following procedures  
will be reinforced throughout the Group:
•	on-site and distance training for employees;
•	risk assessment during each shift;
•	hazards visualisation; and
•	automated production control.

The landscape in the Khabarovsk region
The Company initiated a number of projects during 2013:
•	purchase of wastewater treatment plants for Mayskoye  
to provide the workers’ accommodation camp with  
clean water;
•	construction of solid waste and industrial waste landfill  
sites in remote areas at Goltsovoye and Mayskoye;
•	construction of a first-stage sewage system at Mayskoye;
•	reconstruction of ventilation systems at the Omsukchan 
processing plant and at Lunnoye;
•	modernisation of the cyanide solutions cleaning system  
for the Kubaka plant; 
•	construction of hydraulic structures for stormwater  
drainage at Varvara; and
•	completion of an audit carried out by the federal  
environmental prosecutor’s office confirmed that there  
had been no violations, following an enquiry from local 
residents and state inspection bodies about possible  
environmental contamination at the Amursk POX plant.
We also commenced a programme that requires  
our contractors to comply with our EMS requirements. 
In 2013 the Company’s expenditure for the implementation  
of environmental protection measures, along with construction 
and reconstruction of facilities with environmental relevance, 
amounted to US$8.1 million. Our environmental payments  
to regional budgets for the year totalled US$3.6 million.
In February 2014 we began the first stage of a supervisory 
audit to assess the effectiveness of our Company-wide  
system. This is designed to assess performance against 
environmental indicators across the Group and also assess 
implementation of the EMS. It will determine the effectiveness  
of measures aimed at reducing environmental impacts and  
will put in place plans to correct any inconsistencies identified 
during internal audit.  Strategic report

Greenhouse gas emissions
As a UK listed company, Polymetal is required to report  
its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a requirement which 
came into force on 1 October 2013. While we already monitor, 
manage and aim to minimise our environmental impacts, 
including GHG emissions, we are now reporting these 
according to the new GHG Protocol Corporate Standard 
guidelines, under the following headings:
•	direct GHG emissions;
•	indirect power CO
2
-equivalent emissions related  
to the generation of power purchased (imported)  
for the Company’s operations.
The Company used ISO 14064 as a framework for defining  
its methodology for GHG reporting.

  CO 2 emissions were calculated according to the reference book ‘International Greenhouse 
Gases Emissions Inventory Methodology’ developed by A. Zinchenko from the scientific 
and production corporation Atmosphere in St. Petersburg in 2003. 
2
  Direct emissions include: direct CO 2 -equivalent greenhouse gas methane (CH 4 )  
emissions – 536.8 tonnes; direct CO 2 emissions produced by combustion of fuel  
(diesel fuel, petrol, gas, coal) when operating own power-generating facilities, automobile 
transport, main and auxiliary mining equipment – 325,560.5 tonnes; direct CO 2 -equivalent 
emissions produced by combustion of fuel (diesel fuel, petrol, gas, coal) when operating 
own power-generating facilities, automobile transport, main and auxiliary mining  
equipment – 1,124.3 tonnes.
3
   To calculate indirect power CO 2 emissions, the Company applies principles stipulated  
in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (signed in more than 180 countries, 
including the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan) and also assumes  
that power purchased was generated in the region where the Company’s operations are 
present. The specific indicators of the indirect power CO 2 -equivalent emissions that relate 
to the generation of power purchased (imported) by the Company’s operations were taken 
from the reference data of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development entitled 
‘Development of electricity carbon emission factors for Russia. Baseline study for Russia’ 
(2010) and ‘Development of electricity carbon emission factors for Kazakhstan. Baseline 
study for the Republic of Kazakhstan (2012). CO 2 -equivalent emissions related to the 
generation of power purchased (imported) by the Company’s operations are calculated 
according to formula (3): Eelectr, CO 2 = EC*EF, (3); where: Eelectr, CO 2 = the amount  
of indirect power CO 2 -equivalent emissions related to the generation of power purchased 
(imported) by the Company’s operations, t/year; EC = power purchased (imported)  
by the Company’s operations, MW*h/year; EF = specific regional carbon emissions  
ratio for power consumers, tonnes of 2/MW*h.
4
  GHG emissions intensity indicator = GHG emissions (t)/Ore mined (10 Kt):  
2013: 725,365.5 ÷ 1,037.9 = 699; 2012: 682,558,1 : 1,259.1 = 542. 
Water resources
During 2013, we recorded positive trends in water use: both  
a 10% reduction in per unit water consumption, and a 30% 
increase in the use of recycled water. The Company now uses 
twice the amount of recycled water as it does of fresh water. 
In order to reduce any negative impact on water resources,  
we instigated a number of projects, including: the purchase  
of devices to purify water used for non-industrial purposes  
at a number of our sites; construction of hydraulic engineering 
facilities to aid stormwater drainage at Varvara; modernisation  
of the cyanide solutions cleaning system at our Kubaka plant;  
and an extensive programme of works at the Amursk plant  
to prevent pollution of surface water.
Environmental training
We invest significant resources into the education and training 
of Polymetal employees to raise awareness of and increase 
knowledge about managing and mitigating the environmental 
impacts of the Company. In particular, during 2013 many  
of our engineers and technicians received training about how  
to run and audit our environmental management system as 
part of our ISO 14001 accreditation. Employees also attended  
a number of regional and national external courses, ensuring  
that as a Company we are well informed about industry-wide 
developments, and were also involved in internal training 
sessions which supplement ongoing personal development. 
Our plans for 2014
Our 2014 action plan will focus on continuous improvement  
of our environmental management system, including 
enhancing our efficiency in respect of the most important 
aspects of the environmental impact at each operation  
and the implementation of these priorities in our standard 
operating procedures.
The top-priority tasks aimed at reducing our environmental 
impact have been identified as:
•	upgrading of the water treatment station at Lunnoye plant, 
refining wastewater treatment technologies to reduce the 
negative impact on the river Levy Bulur;
•	waste compaction at Albazino to reduce volume  
for distribution;
•	tailings ponds rehabilitation at the Kubaka plant;
•	replacement of the gas cleaning section in the CIP section  
at Voro to enhance the removal of hydrocyanides from gas;
•	detoxification of technological solutions at the Voro plant, 
aimed at a sustainable use of natural resources and  
a reduced impact on water resources;
•	design solutions for expansion of stormwater treatment 
facilities at Voro to increase the volume of sewage treatment;
•	commissioning of a household sewage system in order  
to increase sewage efficiency and commissioning  
of a solid waste and industrial waste landfill at Birkachan  
for appropriate storage of these types of waste.
Our performance 
GHG emissions  
(CO

-equivalent tonnes  
per 10 Kt of ore mined)
The use of diesel generators to power our plants, natural gas  
and coal for heating and diesel fuel for vehicles accounts for  
the bulk of our GHG emissions. 
The increased figures for 2013 are largely due to increased production  
at the Amursk plant and the recently launched Mayskoye plant, which 
both rely significantly on purchased electricity with a higher GHG 
intensity ratio.

Stripping, mined waste storage, ore processing and the use of energy 
generate air emissions including carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen 
and sulphur.
We saw an increase in all air emissions intensity in 2013 as emissions 
from heat power plants increased while the stripping volumes remained 
the same as last year but the amount of ore mined decreased compared 
to 2012.

minimise the potential impacts on people and the environment. 
During 2013, we have performed several stripping and pushback 
campaigns at Omolon, Varvara and Khakanja which increased the 
average stripping ratio for the Group as a whole, and, correspondingly, 
the amounts of waste mined.

Long-term commitment
As a taxpayer and employer in the areas in which we operate, we provide valuable financial stability to local economies.  
We are also committed to our community investment programme, which is driven by our desire to improve the quality of life  
of local communities and indigenous people. This is a long-term programme, developed in consultation with local communities, 
which enables us to maintain and enhance local infrastructure and services, retain and increase employment opportunities  
and provide relevant training and education for local people.
Our goals and achievements
Goals Main achievements in 2013
Strengthen social partnerships  
with local communities, including 
IMN communities
We invested US$5.3 million in social and charitable programmes in all areas and paid more than 
US$320.7 million in regional and local taxes. Regular charitable assistance and targeted support 
was provided to war veterans and large families. 
Following a competition for social and cultural projects in three districts, the best projects have  
been included in our social programme for 2014.
Provide comfortable living 
conditions and improve quality  
of life for the population  
in areas where we work
Construction of a residential house for employees was completed in Amursk.
A number of programmes for the population of certain territories are ongoing: improving the  
quality of children’s facilities; repairing, insulating and equipping 13 children’s facilities; building and 
equipping children’s playgrounds; management of health services and equipping local hospitals; 
and improving living conditions in remote villages.
Improve the quality of feedback 
and co-operation with local 
communities and IMN groups
We were very proactive during 2013: holding 15 open meetings with and providing feedback  
to local populations; holding public hearings on new mining activities and environmental issues; 
conducting public surveys in the Far East; and organising 15 visits to our production sites  
by members of the public, local schoolchildren, representatives of environmental protection  
bodies, IMN and veterans. 
Company representatives regularly take part in the work of local commissions on social and  
working partnerships.
Facilitate public access  
in remote areas to physical  
training and sporting events,  
and support children’s sports 
Work on the building, renovation, repairs and equipping of five sporting facilities has been 
completed, as well as three sports grounds for children. Regular support is provided to children’s 
sport clubs and sport teams. Sporting events bringing together employees and the local population 
were organised. New sports equipment was supplied to local schools and sport clubs. 
Provide residents of remote  
areas, including IMN, with 
opportunities for cultural  
and creative development
Ongoing support is provided to children’s ecological clubs and scientific research expeditions, 
ecological events and volunteering on Saturdays. 
We have funded the repair and equipment of local cultural centres. Cultural/educational projects 
included: publishing books about the traditions and culture of IMN; a competition with a cash prize 
for success in learning an indigenous language; and support for local festivals and exhibitions  
of IMN communities.

community
At Polymetal, we aim to contribute positively to the economic 
and social fabric of the communities, regions and countries  
in which we operate. In fostering mutually sustainable 
development, we invest substantially in local infrastructure  
and in enhancing social and cultural welfare. 
A traditional Festival of the North celebration at Arka village
We recognise that our operations often impact upon local 
communities and indigenous people in the areas where  
we operate. Our Code of Corporate Governance and Policy  
on Social Investments formally set our commitment to respect 
and promote fundamental human rights and the value of 
cultural heritage. We are committed to operating in accordance 
with the UN Global Compact and the UN Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Code is implemented  
by the management teams in each of our Group companies. 
Our operations – and the populations with which we interact –  
are numerous and widespread, including Russia’s Far East, 
Northern Urals, Chaun district in Chukotka Autonomous 
Territory and Taranovka district in Kazakhstan.
The principles that we adhere to when engaging with local 
communities and indigenous people in these locations are:
•	 to be open to ideas and comments from those living  
and working close to our operations; 
•	 to be transparent in our dealings by providing timely,  
relevant and accurate information on the progress  
of corporate and community investment projects; 
•	to take a long-term view of interaction and investment,  
and put in place systems for identifying investment priorities 
and monitoring progress;
•	 to identify and act on the most significant issues for local 
communities and indigenous people – entailing open and 
regular dialogue; and 
•	 to provide real and tangible benefits to local communities  
and indigenous people.
Community engagement
Our relationship with local communities is based upon  
16 agreements relating to socio-economic co-operation  
with local authorities. In line with our own codes and policies, 
we also have six agreements in place with Indigenous 
Minorities of the North (IMN) communities in our Russian  
Far East operations. These agreements are drawn up  
in consultation with IMN and local authority representatives.  
They focus on support for traditional activities, provision of fuel, 
food, vehicles and building materials, educational and cultural 
programmes designed to preserve language and traditions, 
maintaining and restoring festival and holiday traditions, 
learning about local ecosystems, exchanging knowledge  
on environmental protection and facilitating exchanges 
between others in the local area and IMN representatives. 
In 2013 we continued to implement our major IMN assistance 
programmes in areas such as deer farming, and preservation  
of native language and culture in all operating regions in the  
Far East, including organisation of traditional ethnic IMN 
festivals in the Magadan Region and Khabarovsk Territory. 
To identify relevant targeted social investments in the 
Khabarovsk Territory, in 2013 we introduced a competition 
asking public initiative groups to put forward possible  
social and cultural projects. The winners were the IMN 
representatives and their suggestions have been included  
in Polymetal’s 2014 social investment programme.
We have also focused on projects related to increasing the 
environmental awareness of the public, involving young people 
in activities and undertaking programmes with the population 
of Khabarovsk Territory and Chukotka. We responded  
in the media and at public meetings to questions raised  
in 130 applications from the local population during 2013.
Investing in communities  
Our investment priorities have been determined through 
feedback from local populations and our experience  
of working with communities and indigenous people over  
many years. At least once a year, we evaluate local community 
requirements through public meetings, questionnaires,  
surveys and one-to-one dialogue. This allows us to identify  
key investment targets and assess the impact of existing 
investments. In the main, these investments focus on the 
following activities: 
•	education and healthcare; 
•	infrastructure; 
•	 sports facilities and healthy lifestyle initiatives; and
•	 indigenous peoples’ cultural development.
In 2013, these investments totalled about US$5.3 million.

Financial review
Highlights
•	Revenue in 2013 decreased by 8% to US$1,707 million compared to 2012 (‘year-on-year’) as a result of average realised gold 
and silver prices decreasing 19% and 28% respectively year-on-year. This unprecedented price decline was to a significant 
extent offset by 14% growth in the volume of gold equivalent sold. 
•	 Group Total cash cost
1
 was US$745 per gold equivalent ounce (‘GE oz’), up 8% compared to the 2012 level. Cash costs were 
negatively affected by the elevated level of unit costs and lower recoveries during the ramp-up at the Amursk POX facility and 
at the newly launched Mayskoye mine, while the mature mines demonstrated resilient cost performance. Total cash costs  
in the second half of the year declined by 8% versus the first half of 2013 to US$721/GE oz driven by operational improvements  
at the Albazino/Amursk, where cash costs declined by 27% half-on-half to US$707/GE oz, and Omolon, where as a result  
of mine plan revision a 32% cash cost reduction to US$756/GE oz was achieved.
•	All-in sustaining cash costs
1
 comprised US$1,086/GE oz and increased slightly by 3% year-on-year, driven mostly by an 
increase in total cash costs during the period, which was largely offset by production growth and reduction of per ounce 
sustaining capital and exploration expenditure at our operating mines.
•	Adjusted EBITDA was US$598 million, a decrease of 36%, driven mainly by a decline in commodity prices.  
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, compared to 50% in 2012.
•	A non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of US$366 million resulting from the decline in gold and silver prices was recorded  
as at 31 December 2013, mainly due to the write-off of goodwill and mining assets at Varvara, Khakanja and low-grade ore 
stockpiles at Omolon. The post-tax amount recorded was US$315 million. The impairment calculations were performed  
using conservative price assumptions of US$1,200/oz for gold and US$18/oz for silver, which are meaningfully below current  
spot prices.
•	As a result of non-cash foreign exchange losses and impairment charges, the Group recorded a net loss of US$198 million  
in 2013, compared to a US$428 million net profit in 2012. Underlying net earnings (adjusted for the after-tax amount of 
impairment charges) were US$117 million.
•	The Group’s liquidity profile remained comfortable. Net debt was US$1,045 and remained almost flat compared to the 2012 
level of US$1,037 , supported by strong free cash flow generation capacity despite challenging market conditions. Free cash 
flow

 for the year was US$138 million, remaining flat year-on-year, of which US$263 million was recorded in 2H 2013 on the 
back of increased production, significant de-stockpiling, and lower operating and capital expenditure levels.

market summary
Precious metals
The year 2013 witnessed significant fluctuations in the precious metals markets, with a reversal of a positive trend that  
had dominated since 2009. In the first quarter, markets were generally stable, with the gold price fluctuating in the range  
of US$1,580-1,690/oz. However, in the middle of April gold witnessed one of the sharpest daily and weekly declines of the  
past decade, decreasing to US$1,378/oz, and then further dropping to US$1,192/oz by the end of June. This steep decline  
was prompted by significant reductions in ETF holdings and other investment demand sources, and the plans by the US Federal 
Reserve to gradually decrease the amount of monetary stimulus to the US economy. Later in the year, the gold price fluctuated 
between US$1,193/oz and US$1,420/oz, ending the year at US$1,202/oz on the back of the above-mentioned investor demand 
factors, offset by a record level of consumer demand, especially from China and India. As a result, the average LBMA gold price 
for the period decreased 16% year-on-year. Silver price dynamics followed gold with an increased level of volatility, dropping 
from US$30.9/oz as at 1 January 2013 to US$19.5/oz as at 31 December 2013. This has also resulted in a further reduction  
in the gold/silver price ratio. The average gold/silver price ratio decreased from 1/54 in 2012 to 1/59 in 2013, while  
as at 31 December 2013 it was 1/62.

Foreign exchange
The Group’s revenues and the majority of its borrowings are denominated in US Dollars, while the majority of the Group’s costs are 
denominated in Russian Roubles. Therefore changes in exchange rates affect its financial results and performance. During 2013, 
the Russian Rouble depreciated after a moderate strengthening against US Dollar in 2012. From 1 January to 31 December 2013 
the Russian Rouble depreciated against the US Dollar by 7 .6% from 30.4 RUB/US$ to 32.7 RUB/US$, while the average rate was 
down just 2.3% year-on-year from 31.09 RUB/US$ in 2012 to 31.85 RUB/US$ in 2013 providing a slight benefit to operating profit 
and cash costs. The depreciation of the Rouble had a more pronounced negative effect on the Group’s net earnings in 2013 due  
to the effect of retranslating its US Dollar debt to closing rate while the cost performance is yet to reflect the much lower rates in 
2014 seen to date. Strategic report

 Average for the period.
The Company has exceeded its original annual production guidance and produced 1,282 Koz of gold equivalent, up 21% 
year-on-year. This achievement was driven by the successful ramp-up at the Amursk POX and Mayskoye and strong operational 
delivery at the Dukat hub. 
Other developments
In March 2014, the majority of Polymetal’s employees waived their rights under the legacy Executive Incentive Plan adopted  
in 2010. A new grant of options under the new Long-term Incentive Plan is expected in April 2014 following the issuance of the 
Company’s Annual Report.

while production grew 37% and 3%, respectively. 
The average realised price for gold was US$1,326/oz in 2013, down 19% from US$1,640/oz in 2012, and slightly below the 
average market price of US$1,410/oz due to a larger volume of Polymetal’s sales recorded in the second half of the year when 
the market prices had already deteriorated. The average realised silver price was US$21.6/oz, down 28% year-on-year, and 
reflecting market price movements in the same pattern.
The share of gold sales as a percentage of total revenue increased from 52% in 2012 to 63% in 2013, with a corresponding 
decline in the share of silver sales from 45% to 35%, driven by production and sales volume movements.

Due to the decline in gold and silver prices during the period, the decline in revenue affected all operating segments of the 
Group, with the exception of Albazino/Amursk where increased production at the POX plant and off-take concentrate sales  
led to a nearly three-fold increase in dollar sales. Among the mature mines, sales generally followed production dynamics  
and gold/silver ratio price movements.
Changes in accounting policies and basis of estimates
Application of IFRIC 20 ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine’
IFRIC 20 provides guidance on the accounting for the costs of stripping activities during the production phase of a mine.  
When the benefit from the stripping activity is improved access to a component of the ore body in future periods, the stripping 
costs in excess of the average ore-to-waste ratio for the life-of-mine of that component are recognised as a non-current asset. 
IFRIC 20 became effective for the Group from 1 January 2013. 
Prior to adoption of IFRIC 20, the Group’s accounting policy was not to capitalise stripping costs during the production phase. 
Therefore, as at 1 January 2012 there were no stripping assets on the Group’s balance sheet. The adoption of IFRIC 20 has 
resulted in the capitalisation of certain stripping costs and a reduction in the cost of sales and inventory recorded in 2012.  
The stripping assets recognised as a result of the application of IFRIC 20 will also affect the level of depreciation charges  
in future periods. See details in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements. Total cash costs, adjusted EBITDA and  
other non-GAAP metrics have been restated accordingly. The capitalised stripping costs in 2013 comprised US$91 million 
compared to US$61 million in 2012 and were mainly represented by Omolon, Khakanja and Varvara.
Use of JORC reserves for depreciation calculation
From 1 January 2013, the Group began to use JORC as opposed to GKZ reserves as the basis for unit-of-production 
depreciation calculations, as management believes this revised basis better reflects the long-term mine plans, which  
are also being prepared based on JORC reserves estimates.
The increase in profit for the period due to the adoption of IFRIC 20 was almost entirely offset by the change in depreciation 
calculation basis.

Total cost of sales grew by 32% in 2013 to US$1,124 million, mainly on the back of volume-based growth in production and  
sales (21% and 14% year-on-year respectively in gold equivalent terms). Other cost drivers include domestic inflation in Russia 
(6.5% in 2013), which was only partially offset by Rouble depreciation, and a significant increase in depreciation charges  
as a result of the launch and ramp-up of the Mayskoye concentrator and the Amursk POX plant, which are now both  
in commercial production.
 
The cost of consumables and spare parts and the cost of services grew by 10% and 7% respectively, with most of the growth 
being volume-based. Specific cost increases in the period are attributable to consumables and spare parts at the Amursk POX, 
which was fully operational during the year and displayed elevated consumption rates due to limited throughput and recovery 
during the ramp-up process. Amursk POX was the main driver of increased smelting costs during the period.
The total cost of labour within cash operating costs in 2013 was US$180 million, a 22% increase mainly stemming from 
production volume growth, increase in the rates of payroll tax for highly paid employees, and growth in the average number  
of employees at Amursk and Mayskoye which are now fully in commercial production. 
Mining tax decreased by 10% year-on-year to US$109 million driven by a revenue decrease of 8%.
Depreciation and depletion was US$245 million, up 38% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the commencement of commercial 
production at the Amursk POX and the Mayskoye concentrator, as well as an increased share of underground mining at Dukat 
resulting in increased depreciation of capital underground development costs, and depreciation of capitalised stripping costs. 
US$11 million of depreciation and depletion expenses in 2013 which related to ore and concentrate stockpiles was included  
in metal inventories as at 31 December 2013.
In 2013 a net metal inventory increase of US$54 million was recorded (excluding write-downs to net realisable value). In the 
second half of the year, the Company successfully progressed with scheduled stockpile reductions, with total gold equivalent 
sales meaningfully exceeding production by 54 Koz. De-stockpiling was driven mainly by the Dukat hub, Khakanja and Albazino.

Other 14 12 +19%
Total 168 182 -7%
General, administrative and selling expenses decreased by 7% year-on-year from US$182 million to US$168 million, mainly 
because of the decrease in share-based compensation. The amount of US$24 million of share-based compensation recognised 
during 2013 represents the final accrual made in respect of the old Long-term Employee Incentive Programme (‘Old EIP’),  
which was adopted in 2010 and had a vesting date of 11 June 2013 (or, at the discretion of the participants, 11 June 2014).  
None of the options vested in June 2013, as the performance conditions (excess of price over strike price of US$16.74 per share) 
were not met. Further, in March 2014 the majority of employees waived their rights under the Old EIP in order to be able to 
participate in the new Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘New LTIP’). However, the expense previously recognised does not reverse 
as a credit to the income statement in accordance with IFRS rules as the non-vesting is related to a market-based condition. 
Should any remaining options vest in June 2014 at the revised target share price (US$18.75 per share), no additional expense  
will be recognised in the income statement. Strategic report

continued
The New LTIP was approved by the AGM in June 2013 and the first grant of options under the New LTIP is expected to take 
place in April 2014 following the issuance of the Annual Report. The share-based payment expense in relation to the New LTIP  
will therefore be recognised after grant in 2014.
Labour costs increased by 16% to US$107 million due to planned increases in administrative personnel at the new mines, 
including Amursk POX and Mayskoye, and payroll tax increases.

including penalties and accrued interest recognised in 2013, and there were no material changes to the provisions previously 
recognised. The decrease in exploration expenses from US$33 million in 2012 to US$24 million in 2013 is mainly due to a lower 
amount of exploration costs written off as generating no future benefits.

  Total cash costs comprise cost of sales of the operating assets (adjusted for depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses and write-down of inventory to net realisable value and certain 
other adjustments) and general, administrative and selling expenses of the operating assets. Gold equivalent sales volume is calculated based on average realised metal prices in the 
relevant period. Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated as total cash costs divided by total gold equivalent unit ounces sold.

In 2013 the total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold (‘TCC’) were US$745/GE oz, up 8% year-on-year due to elevated 
cost levels at the Amursk POX and Mayskoye plants during their ramp-up periods, combined with a higher share of these 
segments in total production and sales.

 Effect of mix change between mines with different cost levels.
  
Total cash cost by mine: 
•	Dukat’s total cash cost per silver equivalent ounce sold decreased by 5% year-on-year to US$11.6/ oz. This has been achieved 
on the back of sustainably strong grades and recoveries at the Omsukchan concentrator and increased throughput at both 
Omsukchan and Lunnoye plants.
•	At Voro, which continues to be our lowest cost operation, cash costs decreased further by 1% compared to 2012,  
to US$503/GE oz, despite a moderate decrease in total gold equivalent production. Cost performance was supported  
by grade profile of the primary ore processed during the period and the higher share of gold produced at the CIP plant  
versus heap leaching, as well as by robust operating performance of the mine.
•	Khakanja’s TCC was US$756/GE oz, a 23% increase year-on-year. This cost increase was driven by a scheduled decline  
in average grade processed (from 9.4 g/t to 8.1 GE g/t year-on-year), and a higher share of relatively high-cost ore from 
Avlayakan processed during the second half of the year.
•	At Varvara, TCC was US$791/GE oz, decreasing by 1% year-on-year. This decrease was achieved on the back of a stable 
grade profile and open-pit mine productivity improvements with the introduction of the new dragline excavator.
•	At Omolon, TCC amounted to US$879/GE oz, remaining almost flat compared to the 2012 level despite a moderate decline  
in average grades and production. The improvement in cost performance was mainly achieved in the second half of the year  
as a result of implemented changes to the mine plan following the decrease in gold and silver prices. A higher share of higher 
grade ore from Sopka and Tsokol, as well as suspension of mining at Birkachan during the year, contributed to the  
cost reduction. 
•	At Albazino/Amursk, TCC was US$790/GE oz, up 7% compared to 2012, due to lower throughput and recoveries at the 
Amursk POX in the first half of the year before the remedial actions were implemented. TCC improved considerably over  
the second half of the year as the POX plant reached design throughput and recovery levels. This was further supported  
by significant concentrate de-stockpiling through a combination of sales to third-party off-takers and accelerated concentrate 
processing at the POX plant after achieving design parameters.
•	 TCC at Mayskoye was US$957/GE oz, with the high level mainly associated with cost inefficiencies inherent in the ramp-up 
period of the processing plant (lower average throughput and recoveries) and a lower grade of ore processed during the 
ramp-up period. Cost levels in 2014 are set to improve as Mayskoye delivers its first full year of production.

In accordance with IFRS requirements, Polymetal conducts impairment tests for its goodwill, property, plant and equipment, 
other non-current assets and inventories at each reporting date.
Following a significant decline in market prices for gold and silver in 2013, a total pre-tax impairment charge of US$366 million 
(equivalent to a post-tax amount of US$315 million) was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as a result of these 
impairment tests. Additional impairment charges recognised in the second half of 2013 were US$61 million and mainly resulted 
from the re-optimisation of mine plans at the Omolon hub and write-off of low-grade ore stockpiles across our operations.
Polymetal used conservative price assumptions in the tests performed, with the following flat forward real prices meaningfully 
below the current spot prices:
•	Gold – US$1,200/oz
•	 Silver – US$18/oz
•	Copper – US$7 ,000/tonne.
The following major impairment losses were recognised:
•	An impairment of US$132 million in respect of Khakanja hub assets, including US$104 million of goodwill and mining assets 
and US$28 million of ore stockpiles. The impairment mainly relates to the value of Avlayakan mining assets, which were 
acquired in 2009 for stock then valued at US$60 million with a view to establishing resources sufficient for a standalone mine. 
Currently the asset operates as a satellite mine to Khakanja, which generates a significant amount of trucking and shipping 
costs which are offsetting (at the prices used) the high reserve grade of the deposit. Ore impairment is also mainly represented 
by the existing stockpiles of Avlayakan ore and low-grade ore from Khakanja. The ongoing shift to underground mining will 
enable an increase in grade profile and improve cost levels accordingly. 
•	An impairment of US$99 million was incurred in respect of Varvara, mainly represented by goodwill write-off. Due to the 
relatively low grade ore, Varvara operations are more sensitive to gold and copper prices. The impairment model does not 
include any purchased third-party ore (due to the short-term nature of the purchase arrangements), which represented about 
20% of gold equivalent production at Varvara in 2012 and 16% in 2013, and was an important contribution to the economics  
of the asset by leveraging existing processing capacity. Goodwill on the original purchase transaction arose mainly due to this 
additional contribution, which was assessed when estimating the purchase consideration paid.
•	An impairment of US$92 million was recorded in respect of Omolon hub assets, mainly represented by a US$75 million 
write-off of the low-grade ore stockpiles at Sopka (written off) and Birkachan (net realisable value reduced to reflect lower price 
assumptions). The impairment model assumes that Polymetal will not proceed with the Sopka heap leach at the prices used, 
due to a lower than required return on the capital that needs to be invested in the start of the facility, and therefore assigns zero 
value to the low-grade ore stockpiles accumulated for heap leaching. However, the construction of the heap leach at Birkachan  
is already completed and leaching is planned from 2014. At the assumed prices of US$1,200/oz for gold and US$18/oz  
for silver this would result in positive cash flow contribution, making processing of these stockpiles economic.
•	At Mayskoye, an US$16 million write-down of inventories is represented by relatively low-grade and high-cost concentrate 
produced during the first months of the concentrator operation, with higher costs inherently associated with the ramp-up  
of the processing facility. The source of impairment is expected to be non-recurring as Mayskoye had achieved design 
throughput and recovery by the end of 2013.
•	 A total US$15 million impairment of ore stockpiles was recorded at Dukat and Voro and was represented by marginal  
low-grade material.
•	Polymetal has also written off its investment in its associate Ural-Polymetal totalling US$12 million, having assessed  
the enterprise value using the assumptions above.

  The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses, write-down of inventory to net realisable 
value, share-based compensation, listing expenses, gains and losses on acquisitions and disposals, foreign exchange gain/(loss), change in fair value of derivatives, change in fair value  
of contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs, and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. The figures presented above have

In 2013, Adjusted EBITDA was US$598 million, 36% lower year-on-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%. The decrease 
was mainly driven by a 19% reduction in the average realised gold price and a 28% reduction in the average realised silver  
price, as well as a 8% increase in total cash costs. The Albazino/Amursk hub increased the Adjusted EBITDA almost threefold  
year-on-year due to significant production and sales growth, and Adjusted EBITDA at other segments declined year-on-year  
on the back of price-driven revenue decrease.  Strategic report

Other income statement items
Polymetal recorded a net foreign exchange loss in 2013 of US$74 million compared to a gain of US$7 million in 2012. These 
unrealised non-cash losses represent the appreciation of the Group’s mostly US-Dollar-denominated borrowings against the 
Russian Rouble, the functional currency of all Group companies other than Varvara. The Group’s average gross debt during  
2013 was US$987 million, with more than 95% denominated in US Dollars, while the US Dollar appreciated against the Russian 
Rouble by 8.0% during the period, from 30.4 RUB/US$ at 31 December 2012 to 32.7 RUB/US$ as at 31 December 2013.  
In 2014, this exchange rate dynamic has continued and is expected to have a more meaningful positive effect on operating  
cash cost levels.
The Company does not use any hedging instruments for managing foreign exchange risk, other than a natural hedge arising 
from the fact that the majority of the Group’s revenue is denominated or calculated in US Dollars. Though income statement 
volatility may arise in the financial reporting, Polymetal believes that the underlying matching of revenue cash flows against  
debt repayments and related interest represents an economically effective hedging strategy.
Net earnings, earnings per share and dividends
The Group recorded a net loss of US$198 million in 2013 versus a net profit of US$428 million in 2012. The loss resulted mainly 
from non-cash impairment charges (pre-tax amount of US$366 million, equal to after-tax amount of US$315 million), unrealised 
foreign exchange losses in 2013 versus smaller absolute gains in 2012, and the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA. 
Underlying net earnings (excluding the after-tax impact of impairment charges) were US$117 million, compared  
to US$431 million in 2012. The decrease in underlying net earnings was mainly a result of a decrease in adjusted EBITDA  
by US$334 million year-on-year, as well as the effects of foreign exchange.
Basic earnings per share were a loss of US$0.51 per share compared to earnings of US$1.10 per share in 2012. Underlying 
basic EPS was US$0.30 per share, compared to US$1.13 per share in 2012.
In accordance with the Company’s dividend policy, the Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of US$0.08 per share 
representing approximately 30% of the Group’s underlying net earnings for the period. During 2013, Polymetal paid a total  
of US$316 million in dividends, representing special and final dividends for FY 2012 and interim dividends for 1H 2013.

In 2013, total capital expenditure was US$357 million, down 18% year-on-year. All of the Group’s major investment projects  
are now complete with the launch of the Mayskoye concentrator in April 2013. Consequently, starting from 2H 2013 the bulk  
of the Group’s capital expenditure is now related to stay-in-business spending and exploration. In addition, the implementation  
of IFRIC 20 (refer to ‘Changes in accounting policies’ above) resulted in the partial capitalisation of production-phase stripping 
costs, all of which were previously expensed. Capital expenditure excluding stripping costs would have been US$265 million  
in 2013 (2012: US$372 million).
The major capital expenditure items in 2013 were:
•	 US$54 million was spent on completion of construction of the processing plant at Mayskoye and sustaining capital expenditure 
for the newly launched mine. The concentrator was launched in April 2013, and by the end of the year the ramp-up process 
was complete. 
•	 US$36 million was invested at Albazino/Amursk, mostly related to mining fleet expansion and continued underground 
exploration activities at Albazino, as well as investing in equipment upgrades at the Amursk POX.
•	Capital expenditure at Dukat was US$37 million, down 24% year-on-year, and is mainly represented by expansion  
of underground operations and maintenance Capex at the Lunnoye and Omsukchan plants.
•	At Varvara, capital expenditure was US$21 million and is mainly related to the expansion of the mining fleet, including  
an electrical dragline excavator commissioned in Q1 2013.
•	At Omolon, capital expenditures declined by 44% year-on-year to US$22 million due to revision of the mine plans and 
suspension of the Birkachan mine, as well as due to postponement of the Sopka and Birkachan heap leaching projects.  
The actual expenditure during 2013 is mainly related to development of Dalneye open-pit mine and maintenance Capex.
•	Across the other mature mines, Khakanja and Voro, capital expenditures declined year-on-year and were mainly represented  
by mining fleet upgrades/replacements and maintenance expenditure at the processing facilities.
•	The Company continues to invest in standalone exploration projects. Capital expenditure on exploration in 2013 was 
US$59 million compared to US$68 million in 2012, and focused mostly on Maminskoye, Svetloye, and Kutyn.
•	Capitalised stripping costs totalled US$91 million in 2013 (2012: US$61 million) and are attributable to operations with stripping 
ratios during the period exceeding their life-of-mine (‘LOM’) averages, including most importantly Khakanja, Omolon and 
Varvara. The capitalisation of stripping costs at Omolon and Varvara has resulted in increased impairment charges recorded  
in respect of those segments’ mining assets (refer to ‘Impairment charges’ above). 
•	 Total capital expenditure includes US$6 million of capitalised interest (2012: US$14 million), which declined materially  
as the Group has already commissioned all of its major growth assets, and led to an increase in finance costs recognised  
in profit and loss.  Strategic report

Operating cash flows in 2013 were under pressure from declining commodities prices. Operating cash flows before changes  
in working capital decreased by 38% year-on-year to US$450 million as a result of adjusted EBITDA decrease. Net operating 
cash flows were US$462 million, compared to US$541 million in 2012, and were almost unaffected by changes in working 
capital in 2013 (the increase in working capital in 2012 was US$184 million) despite a meaningful increase in production  
volumes and scope of operations. 
Total cash and cash equivalents increased from US$19 million as at 31 December 2012 to US$66 million  
as at 31 December 2013, with the following items affecting the cash position of the Group:
•	 operating cash flows of US$462 million;
•	 investment cash outflows of US$324 million, down 19% year-on-year and mainly represented by capital expenditure  
(down 20% year-on-year to US$319 million);
•	payment of special and regular dividends for 2012 amounting to US$316 million; and
•	an increase in borrowings of US$213 million.

The Group continues to maintain a comfortable liquidity and funding profile in the current turbulent market environment.
The Group’s net debt was almost flat and comprised US$1,045 million as of 31 December 2013, representing a net debt/
adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.75. 
The Group maintains a healthy debt structure, which is comfortable from both the liquidity and cost standpoints. In the second 
half of the year, the Group refinanced a total of US$400 million of its short-term borrowings into long-term facilities. As a result, 
the proportion of long-term borrowings increased from 48% as at 30 June 2013 to 93% as at 31 December 2013. This new 
borrowing facility led to a significant improvement of the Group’s debt maturity profile now extending to more than three years. 
In addition, as at 31 December 2013 the Group had US$1.6 billion of available undrawn facilities from a wide range of lenders, 
which maintains its operational flexibility in the current environment.
The average cost of debt remained low at 2.99% in 2013 (2012: 3.06%), supported by low base interest rates and the ability  
to negotiate competitive premiums on the back of the solid financial position of the Company and Polymetal’s excellent  
credit history. 
2014 year outlook
While we recognise that our financial performance will significantly depend on commodity price movements in the year ahead, 
Polymetal expects to deliver a resilient financial performance at the current price levels which will be driven by the  
following factors:
•	the Company is fully equipped to deliver on its production guidance of 1.3 Moz of gold equivalent for 2014;
•	 in 2014, Polymetal expects total cash costs of US$700-750/GE oz and all-in sustaining cash costs of US$975-1,025/GE oz, 
which will be supported by the ongoing devaluation of the Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge;
•	capital expenditure will decline further to US$250 million (including exploration and capitalised stripping) as there will be  
no major investment in growth projects before project development decisions are taken closer to the end of the financial year.  Strategic report

Market risk
Gold and silver price volatility may result in 
material adverse movement in the Company’s 
operating results, revenues and cash flows.
In the light of the recent decline in commodity prices, the Company  
has implemented a number of measures to maintain profitability  
and cash flow, including:
•	redistribution of ore mined volumes between deposits to achieve  
a better cost profile due to better logistics and less expensive  
mining methods;
•	suspension of high-cost operations;
•	deferral of certain marginal growth projects;
•	staffing level review and hiring freeze;
•	asset-level cost-cutting.
Key capital expenditure savings include:
•	deferral of certain marginal growth projects;
•	greenfield/brownfield exploration budget reviewed and re-prioritised;
•	certain non-core maintenance projects/mining equipment purchases 
at operating mines cancelled/delayed.
Conservative commodity price assumptions are used for future  
period budgets and life-of-mine models to ensure viability of the  
plans in the event of a sustained weakness in precious metals prices.
The Company has also developed action plans to address  
any further severe price reduction scenario.
Currently the Company does not hedge as its strategy is to offer 
stakeholders full exposure to potential gold and silver price  
upside potential.
2.1
Production risks –  
mining plans
The risk of failure to meet the planned production 
programme. Failure to meet production targets 
may adversely affect the operating performance 
and financial results of the Group. The risk of 
lower than expected metal grades or dilution  
is caused by complex mining and geological 
conditions, mainly at underground mines. 
Recoveries at the Group’s processing plants may 
not reach planned levels due to the complex 
technological properties of the ore processed.
Annual, quarterly and monthly production budgeting and subsequent 
monthly control against budget is designed to mitigate the risk. 
The effectiveness and efficiency of the production process is ensured 
by the Group’s senior engineering team. The approved production 
programme includes an increased volume of on-mine exploration 
works, such as in-fill drilling and grade control sampling.
To mitigate the risk the Group invests considerable resources  
in ore quality assessment procedures and seeks to control ore quality 
by the formation of ore stacks with the required characteristics.
2.2
Production risks –  
procurement
The Group’s production activity depends heavily  
on the effectiveness of its supply chains. These 
might be negatively affected by complex logistics 
to remote locations and delays in construction 
and delivery of purchased mining and processing 
equipment or spare parts.
The Group has implemented and constantly improves its supply  
chain system to closely link the production demand of resources with 
inventory levels, optimise the number of order placements and ensure 
in-time inventory and equipment delivery to production sites.
2.3
Production risks –  
qualified labour 
availability
Failure to retain key employees or to recruit  
new staff, mainly at the Group’s mining and 
processing facilities, may lead to increased staff 
costs, interruptions to existing operations and 
delays in new projects.
Lack of skilled and knowledgeable staff  
at remote locations may occur due to extreme 
weather conditions.
A working conditions improvement programme is in place.
Remuneration policies are designed to incentivise, motivate  
and retain key employees.
There is an increased focus on health and safety – refer to pages 50-51  
of this report – and there is active promotion of a positive corporate 
culture within the Group.
Robust risk management systems are 
critical to the long-term success of the 
Company. We believe that the creation  
of sustainable value for our stakeholders 
should be firmly based on effective risk 
identification and an appropriate response  
to each risk.
Risk management process
Polymetal’s risk management process is designed to minimise 
the potential threats to achieving our strategic objectives.
Internal control and risk management systems are continuously 
improved to add value to the business. The number of KPIs 
used to assess the qualitative measures of the key business 
activities’ performance has significantly increased over the  
past years.
The process incorporates the following stages:
•	identification and documentation of risks;
•	assessment, qualification and quantification of each risk;
•	development and implementation of risk mitigation/ 
control strategies;
•	monitoring, reporting and reviewing risks; and
•	input of effective internal control procedures.
The Audit and Risk Committee of the Board sets the agenda 
for the risk management policies and procedures of the  
Group (including the treasury policy governing management  
of financial risks) and is responsible for reviewing their 
effectiveness. Its duties include the review of:
•	policies and overall processes to identify and assess  
business risks and manage their impact on the Company 
and the Group;
•	regular assurance reports from management, internal  
audit, external audit and others on matters related to risk  
and control;
•	periodic ‘deep dives’ in significant risks; and
•	the timeliness of, and reports on, the effectiveness  
of corrective action taken by management.
Risk identification
Risk awareness is embedded within the Group and  
is grounded in our strong ethical values and proactive 
corporate culture. Our risk management philosophy  
is driven by the Company’s Board of Directors and runs 
through all our management, employee and connected 
stakeholder activities – from developing strategy  
to day-to-day operations. 
Risk management is one of the key functions of the Audit  
and Risk Committee. Strategic risks are identified by the  
Board based on a detailed understanding of the Company,  
its markets and the legal, social, political, economic, 
technological, environmental and cultural environments  
in which we operate. Our risk identification system considers  
not only single, mutually exclusive risks, but also multiple  
linked and correlated risks. 
Risk matrices and assurance maps are used to record, 
prioritise and track each risk through the risk management 
process. These are regularly reviewed by the Audit and  
Risk Committee.
Risk assessment
Once identified, potential risk factors are assessed to consider 
the impact and consequences that the event or events may have 
on achieving objectives, and the likelihood and probability of the 
event (see table on top of page 71). Together these create  
a risk profile.
Risk response
When the appropriate ranking has been identified, a response 
to each risk is formulated and implemented. This is tracked 
through a comprehensive risk assurance map. Management 
assesses the effects of a risk’s likelihood and impact, as well  
as costs and benefits of a particular risk mitigation method. 
The degree to which the response brings the risk within 
acceptable tolerance levels is then evaluated and corrective 
actions are taken where necessary.
Monitoring and reporting
Ongoing monitoring processes are embedded in Polymetal’s 
business operations. These track the effective application of 
internal control and risk management policies and procedures, 
including internal audit and specific management reviews.  
Risk matrices and assurance maps are used to re-evaluate  
and adjust controls in response to changes in the Company’s 
objectives, the business and the external environment.
Management is responsible for the implementation of effective  
follow-up procedures to ensure appropriate actions occur  
in response to changes in risk and control assessments.

Risks and risk management
continued
Risk category Risk description and potential effect Risk response
2.4
Production risks –  
reliance on 
contractors
Risk of underperformance against production 
plan, of exceeding available resources: budget 
overspending, delayed results.
A contractors’ performance control system is designed, implemented 
and applied.
3
Tax risk
Due to frequent changes in tax legislation in 
Russia and Kazakhstan, a lack of established 
practices in tax law means that additional costs 
such as taxes or penalties may arise.
The most recent Russian government initiatives 
include significant amendments to tax law 
governing operations with entities from  
off-shore jurisdictions.
The taxation risk level correlates with legal and 
political risks levels.
The Company’s policy is to comply fully with the requirements  
of applicable tax laws, providing adequate controls over tax accounting 
and tax reporting.
Given the prevailing practice accepted by arbitration courts when 
deciding on certain cases in tax disputes in 2012-13, as well as 
particular outcomes of tax disputes involving Kazakh and Russian 
subsidiaries of the Group, the tax risk is assessed as ‘High’.
The consolidated financial statements reflect provisions booked  
in connection with the Company’s evaluation of tax risks.
To date the Company is not aware of any significant outstanding tax 
claims which could lead to additional taxes accruing in the future 
(except for amounts already booked or disclosed in the Group’s 
financial statements).
4
Exploration risks
Exploration and development are time- and 
capital-intensive activities and may involve a high 
degree of risk, but are necessary for future 
growth. Failure to discover new reserves of 
sufficient magnitude could adversely affect the 
Company’s results.
Exploration risks include exploration site 
selection, defining the optimal method of 
exploration, licensing and permits, exploration 
process supply (staff, equipment etc.), exploration 
contractors’ performance control and reporting.
Potential effects include financial losses due to 
poor exploration results on selected properties, 
financial losses or unreliable exploration results 
due to use of incorrect exploration methods, 
inefficient use of the resources available or/and 
not achieving the reserve/resource targets set.
Risk and uncertainty are inherent in exploration and  
development activities.
The Group invests considerable amounts in focused exploration 
projects to obtain sufficient information about the quantity and  
quality of expected reserves and to estimate expected cash flows. 
The Group’s team of geologists and engineering specialists has  
a track record of successful greenfield and brownfield exploration 
leading to subsequent development of exploration fields for  
commercial production.
5
Construction and 
development risk
Failure to achieve the return required from major 
capital expenditure projects, such as building  
new mines and processing facilities or production 
capacity increase/renovation at existing mines,  
as a result of failure to meet project delivery 
timeline and budgets, could adversely affect the 
Group’s financial results, cash flow position and 
increase capital costs.
The Company implements global best practice in project management. 
The Group’s engineering team is responsible for the oversight of capital 
expenditure projects, including project support, co-ordination of service 
organisations, contractors, constructors and co-operation with 
regulatory bodies.
Significant elements of our exploration and development projects  
are performed by the Group in-house by Polymetal Engineering,  
a subsidiary company with significant expertise and a strong track 
record of designing and commissioning mines and processing plants.
Our techniques for construction risk management are constantly 
improved including the employment of world-class consultants with 
recognised international experience.
6
Logistics and  
supply chain risk
The Company operates in remote locations that 
require complex and significant transportation of 
ore and gold/silver concentrates, most of which is 
conducted by third-party contractors. Production 
targets may not be reached if any element of the 
logistics chain is disrupted.
To improve procurement management, in 2013 the Group restructured 
the procurement function by creating regional branches.
To mitigate the logistics risk the Group invests considerable resources 
in the construction and maintenance of permanent and temporary 
winter roads at exploration and production sites. The Group exercises 
effective control over the whole logistics chain, including selection and 
operation of contractors.
7
Health and  
safety risk
Health, safety and environment risk includes 
regulatory compliance, environmental pollution 
and damage, and personal safety.
There is labour and industrial safety control system in place that 
includes risk assessment of individual workplaces/functions, protection 
of personnel with safety equipment etc.
The Company has tightened responsibility for implementation of safety 
procedures by raising employees awareness of risk, and has developed 
additional safety measures in relation to any identified weaknesses.
Risk category Risk description and potential effect Risk response
8
Environmental risk
Major pollution arising from operations could 
include deforestation, air and water pollution  
and land contamination. Potential impacts  
include fines and penalties, statutory liability for 
environmental redemption and other financial 
consequences, which may be significant.
The Company has implemented an eco-management system  
with meets international standards, and compliance certificates  
have been received.
The Company implements a number of initiatives to monitor and limit 
the impact of its operations on the environment, including external 
expert assessment of pollution generated and adopting best practice  
in the industry for its corporate policies and procedures.
9
Mergers and 
acquisitions risks
The Group invests considerable resources in gold 
mining assets and operations in the Russian 
Federation and Kazakhstan. There is a risk  
of failure to achieve the expected benefits from 
any acquisition in the case of adverse changes  
in assumptions or any inaccuracy of estimates 
made, or where the information used for  
decision-making was incomplete or inaccurate.
Failure to deliver expected benefits from an 
acquisition can results in adverse financial 
performance, lower planned production  
volumes or problems with product quality.
Rigorous due diligence procedures are applied to the evaluation  
and execution of all acquisitions to assess the consequences of the 
acquisition, based on economic, ecological, political and social factors.
Board and/or shareholder approval is required for any acquisition.
10
Legal risk
Operating in developing countries such as Russia 
and Kazakhstan involves the risk that changes  
in tax and other legislation may occur from time  
to time. The most sensitive areas are regulation  
of foreign investments, private property, 
environmental protection and taxation. 
In recent years, however, the governments  
of both Russia and Kazakhstan have become 
more consistent regarding the introduction  
of new regulations and taxes, demonstrating  
an awareness of investment climate issues. 
However, in the application of existing legislation 
requiring interpretation, courts often uphold the 
more assertive position of the tax authorities,  
which does not always coincide with the 
Company’s position.
Polymetal has a successful track record of operating in both the 
Russian and Kazakh jurisdictions, having developed its own expertise 
in corporate, tax, licensing and other legal areas. 
The Group’s financial and legal teams monitor current legislation  
and proposed changes and incorporate these into their practice.
Corporate and operational management teams are responsible for 
meeting legal requirements in their operating activities. Head office  
and on-site legal teams ensure appropriate controls over  
compliance issues.
The Group takes into account the results of tax audits and court rulings 
when interpreting taxation rules and determining future tax positions.
11
Political risk
Operating in Russia and Kazakhstan involves 
some risk of political instability, which may include 
changes in government, negative policy shifts, 
international sanctions and civil unrest. These may 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s market 
value and operating environment.
The Group actively monitors political developments on an ongoing basis.
We aim to maintain open working relationships with local authorities  
in the countries where we operate.
12.1
Financial risks –  
cash and  
liquidity risk
The inability to raise sufficient funds to meet 
current operating or ongoing financial needs,  
to develop new projects and fund growth.
Inadequate cash management in terms of cash 
flow forecast, available resources and future 
requirements.
The Group’s treasury function is responsible for ensuring that there  
are sufficient funds in place, including loan facilities, cash flow from 
operating activities and cash on hand, to meet short-term business 
requirements. Long-term credit lines are used to finance new projects 
and organic growth.
12.2
Financial risks –  
currency risk
Currency risk arises from the Company’s  
receipts from metal sales and foreign  
currency-denominated debt, as well as the  
foreign currency-denominated cost of imported 
capital goods and consumables.
Natural hedging is used to reduce the risk exposure: revenue  
is matched with US Dollar-denominated debt.
Flexible budgeting is used to monitor the effect of exchange rate 
fluctuations on the Group’s financial results.
12.3
Financial risks –  
interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk,  
as a significant part of the Group’s debt portfolio  
is US Dollar and Euro-denominated floating  
rate borrowings.
Based on analysis of the current economic situation, the Group has 
decided to accept the risk of floating interest rates rather than hedge  
it or borrow at fixed rates.
However the Group does not rule out the possibility of fixing the  
interest rate on its borrowings in the future, should assessment  
of the ongoing economic situation suggest this may be profitable.
12.4
Financial risks –  
inflation rate risk
A higher rate of inflation may increase future 
operational costs and have a negative impact on 
the Company’s financial results if there is no 
related depreciation of the local currency against 
the US Dollar, or an increase in LBMA gold and 
silver fixings.
As part of the budgeting process, the Group estimates possible 
inflation levels and incorporates them into its cost planning.

Governance
Corporate Governance
Dear Shareholders
We remain committed to upholding good governance 
throughout every strand of our organisation. Effective corporate 
stewardship is essential in good times, but in the current 
difficult market environment, its importance as the key  
to timely and effective decision-making is vital. 
During 2013, the Polymetal Board has faced – and been equal 
to – the challenges it has met, achieving full compliance with 
the UK Code during the year and enabling us to build upon our 
track record of strong governance. We made advances in our 
executive remuneration, with our best practice scheme being 
fully endorsed by shareholders. We have maintained a sound 
system of internal control and risk management with regular 
internal audits, risk assessment and reporting, and have  
in place robust anti-corruption procedures including anti-
corruption training of all employees. We also made significant 
progress in sustainability governance and reporting, gaining 
ISO certification and producing a comprehensive report, 
compliant with the exacting standards of the Global  
Reporting Initiative (GRI). 
We regard strong governance as a dynamic process, in which 
continuous improvement is paramount. In 2013, a full formal 
Board evaluation was conducted by an independent external 
advisor, enabling us to review the Board’s effectiveness and 
identify areas for improvement. 
The Board is continuously focused on providing effective 
strategic leadership to the Company both in the best interests  
of its stakeholders and in order to ensure full accountability  
of the Company’s management to the Board. This process  
is supported by a robust internal control system embedded  
in all areas, including most importantly operations, finance,  
and sustainability. This robust system ensures delivery  
on the Company’s strategic objectives and appropriate risk 
management. A rigorous approach to succession planning  
will ensure that leadership is aligned to corporate strategy,  
both at Board and senior management levels, to help bolster 
the long-term success of the business.
Our resilient financial performance is underpinned by  
a conservative approach to funding, aimed at striking  
the right balance between equity and debt, and maintaining 
conservative liquidity and gearing. Polymetal was successful  
in further extending the maturity profile of its debt during the 
year while maintaining a safe gearing ratio and a low cost  
of debt, as well as securing substantial additional unused  
credit facilities.
We continue to strengthen and improve our business, both 
operationally and financially, but never lose sight of the Board’s 
responsibility of ensuring that the Company is run in the best 
interests of all its stakeholders through our commitment  
to the highest levels of ethical and responsible behaviour. 
Bobby Godsell
Chairman
Statement of compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Directors are committed to maintaining high standards  
of corporate governance. As a premium UK listed company, 
during the year ended 31 December 2013 Polymetal 
International was required to comply with the UK Code  
of Corporate Governance (‘the UK Code’) published in 
September 2012 and available through the UK Financial 
Reporting Council’s website or, where the provisions of the  
UK Code have not been complied with, to provide appropriate 
explanations. During 2013, the Company achieved compliance  
with all provisions of the UK Code.
As well as complying with the UK Code, the Company has 
complied with all applicable regulations of the Moscow Stock 
Exchange and Russian securities laws since admission of its 
shares to secondary trading on the Moscow Exchange  
in June 2013.
Role and structure of the Board
The Company’s Board comprises one executive Director, the 
non-executive Chairman and seven non-executive Directors. 
Excluding the Chairman, four members of the Board are 
independent non-executive Directors. Refer to the schedule 
below for the structure of the Board and its Committees, 
showing the status of each Director.
The independent non-executive Directors are those determined 
by the Board to be independent in character and judgement 
and to be free from relationships or circumstances which may 
affect, or could appear to affect, the Director’s judgement.  
The role of independent Directors on the Board is: to challenge 
the strategy and scrutinise the performance of management  
in meeting agreed goals and objectives; to monitor the 
reporting of performance of the Company; to review the 
integrity of financial information; and that the Company’s  
internal financial controls and system of risk management are 
robust and defensible. They are responsible for determining 
appropriate level of remuneration for the CEO and have a 
primary role in appointing and, when necessary, removing him. 
Directors’ interests are disclosed in annual declarations and  
the Company Secretary is notified promptly of any changes  
to those interests. Before each Board meeting, independent 
non-executive Directors reconfirm their independence and all 
Directors disclose whether they hold any interests in any 
matters to be reviewed at the Board meeting.
The significant shareholders of the Company are represented 
on the Board by Mr Yanakov (who is a representative of 
Powerboom Investments Limited); Ms Grönberg (who is  
a representative of Vitalbond Limited, A&NN and Capital 
Management Fund Limited) and Mr Duvieusart (who is a 
representative of PPF Group BV). Mr Nesis is the brother of the 
beneficial owner of Powerboom Investments Limited. Save for 
the potential conflicts inherent in these relationships, there are 
no potential conflicts of interest between the duties owed by 
the Directors or senior management to the Company and their 
private interests or other duties.
The Board has determined Charles Balfour, Jonathan Best, 
Russell Skirrow and Leonard Homeniuk to be independent 
non-executive directors. Bobby Godsell met the independence 
criteria on appointment. Jonathan Best has been on the Board 
of the Company since September 2011 and on the Board  
of JSC Polymetal since December 2006, and his 
reappointment is subject to particularly rigorous review.  
The Board believes that Mr Best continues to display all of the 
qualities of independence pursuant to the criteria set out in the 
Code. In 2012 the Company sold 100% of Amikan Holdings 
Limited, which owns the Veduga gold deposit (‘Veduga’)  
in the Krasnoyarsk region of the Russian Federation, to 
Polygon Gold Inc. (‘Polygon’). Mr Homeniuk serves as 
Polygon’s Executive Chairman and CEO. Polygon operates  
as a standalone company with independent management and 
Polymetal provides certain technical and regulatory assistance 
to Polygon on an ongoing basis. Polymetal currently holds  
a 42.6% equity ownership in Polygon and one of the four board 
seats and therefore has significant influence, but does not have 
control over its activities. The Board continues to consider  
Mr Homeniuk to be an independent non-executive Director.  
The Board concluded that the relationship between Polymetal 
and Polygon is not material, given the carrying value of its 
interest in Veduga, which is US$15.6 million and represents 
approximately 0.5% of the Group’s total assets as  
at 31 December 2013. 
The Company considers that the Board and its Committees 
have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Company to enable  
them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively. All Directors have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary, and are able to take independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Charles Balfour has informed the Board of his intention  
not to offer himself for re-election at the upcoming AGM  
of the Company and to retire as a Director at the conclusion  
of the AGM in order to pursue other opportunities. Further  
to Mr Balfour’s decision not to offer himself for re-election  
at the AGM, the Board has appointed Spencer Stuart  
as an international search firm to assist with the search  
for a replacement independent non-executive Director. 
Board meetings
In 2013, the Board met nine times. One of the meetings,  
held by way of a conference call between Messrs Godsell  
and Nesis, approved an administrative matter previously 
agreed by the whole Board. Further business was approved  
by a committee of the Board on two occasions.

Further to Mr Balfour’s decision not to offer himself  
for re-election as a Director, the Board will appoint  
a new SID following the AGM.
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting (AGM)  
to communicate with investors and to encourage their 
participation. To ensure the Company’s shareholders have  
time to consider our Annual Report and Notice of AGM  
and lodge their proxy votes in good time, all meeting materials 
are made available more than 20 working days prior to the 
AGM. Separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially 
separate subject and all resolutions are put to a poll.  
The Company also offers shareholders the option to abstain.
Shareholders who are not able to attend the AGM are 
encouraged to submit proxy votes either electronically or in 
paper format. At the Company’s 2013 AGM we received votes 
representing approximately 82% of our issued share capital. 
The results of the proxy vote are read at the meeting with the 
final results announced via the London Stock Exchange and 
available on the website.
In addition, our AGM provides a valuable opportunity for 
shareholders to meet with and put questions to the Directors  
in person. The 2013 AGM was attended by all Directors, 
including the Chairmen of the Audit and Risk, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees. Live webcast and conference 
call facilities are available for shareholders unable to be present 
in person and a recording of the AGM webcast is made 
available on the Company’s website.
The primary means of communication with the majority  
of our shareholders, who have not requested paper copies  
of our documentation, is through our corporate website  
www.polymetalinternational.com.

Roles of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer  
and Senior Independent Director
The Board has approved the division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
and the role of the Senior Independent Director (SID).
The Chairman reports to the Board and is responsible for  
the leadership and overall effectiveness of the Board and  
for setting the Board’s agenda. His responsibilities include:
•	effective running of the Board;
•	ensuring there is appropriate delegation of authority  
from the Board to executive management;
•	promoting a culture of openness and debate by facilitating 
the effective contribution of non-executive Directors in 
particular and ensuring constructive relations between 
executive and non-executive Directors;
•	encouraging active engagement by all members of the  
Board and ensuring that the directors receive accurate, 
timely and clear information; and
•	ensuring that the views of the shareholders are 
communicated to the Board as a whole.
Mr Godsell is able to commit sufficient time to his role as 
non-executive Chairman of Polymetal International and the 
Board believes that other commitments do not adversely affect 
his contribution to the Company. Mr Godsell’s other significant 
commitments are membership of the South African National 
Planning Commission, and a non-executive directorship in the 
South African Industrial Development Corporation. He is also 
Chairman of Business Leadership South Africa and a Director 
of Platmin Limited and Solar Capital. 
The CEO is responsible for the day-to-day management  
of the Group and for developing the Group’s business  
strategy, objectives, budget and forecasts and, once approved 
by the Board, overseeing their successful implementation. 
The CEO reports to the Chairman and the Board directly. 
The Board interacts with the executive management on a 
regular basis. Directors invite senior executives to attend 
relevant parts of the Board and committee meetings for 
Evaluation and re-election policies
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Mr Godsell  
and its other members are Mr Homeniuk and Mr Balfour. 
The Committee has responsibility for making recommendations 
to the Board on the composition of the Board and its 
Committees, including appointments of additional and 
replacement Directors. The Committee:
•	leads the process for Board appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board;
•	regularly reviews the Board structure, size and composition 
(including skills, knowledge, independence, experience and 
diversity) and makes recommendations to the Board about 
any changes that the Committee considers necessary;
•	considers plans and makes recommendations to the  
Board for orderly succession to the Board and to senior 
management, so as to maintain an appropriate balance  
of skills and experience within the Company and on the 
Board and to ensure progressive refreshing of the Board, 
taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing 
the Company;
•	keeps under review the leadership needs of the Group,  
both executive and non-executive, with a view to ensuring  
the continued ability of the Group to compete effectively in 
the marketplace;
•	before any appointment is made by the Board, evaluates  
the balance of skills, knowledge, experience, independence 
and diversity of the Board, and in the light of this evaluation 
prepares a description of the role and capabilities required  
for a particular appointment and the expected time 
commitment; and
•	reviews the results of the Board’s performance evaluation 
process that relates to the composition of the Board and 
whether non-executive Directors are spending enough  
time to discharge their duties.
There were no changes to the Board structure in 2013  
and the Company has not employed external search 
consultants. The Company has appointed Spencer Stuart  
as an international search firm to search for a further 
independent non-executive Director to replace Mr Balfour,  
and a replacement member of the Nomination Committee  
will be appointed following the AGM.
In accordance with the UK Code, all Directors are subject  
to annual re-election.
Full terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
The Directors’ biographical details are set out on pages  
74 to 75 ●and the Board considers that each of the Directors 
standing for re-election will be an effective contributor  
to the success of the Group. Following their performance 
evaluations, the Chairman believes that each Director standing 
for re-election continues to be effective and to demonstrate 
commitment to his or her role. A performance evaluation  
of the Chairman (including externally facilitated evaluation) was 
conducted by the Board in 2013, and the Board believes that

management and the Board.
Senior Independent Director (‘SID’)
Charles Balfour acts as the Board’s SID. Mr Balfour is available 
to shareholders and as an intermediary for the other Directors  
if necessary. He attends meetings with major shareholders  
to listen to their views in order to help develop a balanced 
understanding of the issues and concerns of major 
shareholders. Meetings between independent Directors, 
including Mr Balfour, and major institutional shareholders  
took place in 2013 as part of the Company’s investor day.  
The Board is regularly updated on shareholders’ opinions 
following meetings with the Company’s management.  
Separate meetings are held between the non-executive 
Directors without the Chairman or the CEO being present and 
between non-executive directors without the Chairman, led  
by the SID, to appraise his performance annually and on such 
other occasions as appropriate; and between the independent 
non-executive Directors without the other non-executive 
Directors being present. This includes both formal and  
informal meetings between Directors.

Upon appointment, Directors receive a full induction, including: 
information about the Company; an outline of the role of  
a Director and a summary of his or her responsibilities and 
ongoing obligations under legislation, regulation and best 
practice; a copy of the Memorandum on Inside Information, 
Insider Lists and Code of Practice on Dealing in Securities. 
Directors also receive the Company’s guidelines on matters 
reserved to the Board, terms of reference of the Board 
Committees and other governing documents of the Company. 
Directors and chairmen of the Board Committees regularly 
receive updates on changes to corporate governance  
and regulatory requirements and other changes affecting  
the Company. The Board is kept informed of relevant 
developments in the Company by way of monthly management 
reports, including comprehensive information on operating  
and financial performance and the progress of capital  
projects. A field trip to the Amursk POX plant and Albazino  
for non-executive Directors took place in August 2013.
There were two meetings of the Nomination Committee in 
2013. In 2013 the Nomination Committee organised a full 
externally facilitated Board evaluation, full details of which  
are set out further on this page. 
 
At its meetings the Committee continued discussing diversity 
and ways of helping to promote women in the Company.  
The Board welcomes diversity at all levels; it believes that  
the right way to approach diversity is not to introduce fixed 
quotas, but to seek the right qualities in every appointment, 
where competence comes first. Diversity becomes an 
additional advantage of such an approach and is in line with 
the Company’s objective of promoting women at all levels  
of the Group. Despite challenges presented by the industry  
the Company operates in, it takes steps to promote women, 
including hiring women in positions traditionally held by men.  
In 2013, the proportion of women working in the Group  
was 22%. Women represent 11% of Board members;  
22% of senior management positions; and 44% of qualified 
employees. The audit under taken in 2013 by the HR 
Department revealed no instances of discrimination towards 
employees of the Company. All candidates and employees 
have equal opportunities regardless of gender, age, race, 
nationality, language, origin, wealth, residence, religion 
and other beliefs, social membership or other  
personal circumstances. 
During the year the Nomination Committee reviewed existing 
succession planning arrangements in the Company and held 
interviews with senior managers to discuss matters that 
needed to be addressed to ensure continued effective 
performance through leadership continuity. Methods of 
building up the leadership pipeline were discussed including 
whether stronger candidates for senior management positions 
should be those with fluent English and some experience  
and/or education outside Russia along with experience of 
working in Russia and the CIS. The Nomination Committee 
acknowledges that a deeper and more rigorous approach  
to succession planning is vital for the Company’s continuing 
success so that leadership is fully aligned to corporate strategy, 
both at Board and senior management levels, and will continue 
addressing this matter in the future.
Full terms of reference of the Nomination Committee  
are available at the Company’s website:  
www.polymetalinternational.com.
The Board considers that the composition of the Board and 
the Nomination Committee complies with the requirements  
of the UK Code.
Board evaluation
Polymetal is committed to best practice in corporate 
governance and commissioned its first externally-facilitated 
Board review in 2013. This was performed by Lintstock Ltd.,  
an independent advisor with no other connection to the 
Company. The Board carried out a performance evaluation  
of itself, its Committees, the Chairman and each individual 
Director. In accordance with the UK Code, it is the Board’s 
policy that the evaluation process will be externally facilitated 
every three years. 
The evaluation process consisted of the Board reviewing its 
own performance, the performance of each Committee of the 
Board, individual Directors and the Chairman. All Directors and 
the Company Secretary completed detailed questionnaires  
on the basis of which a report was produced for the Board’s 
review. In-depth discussion of the results took place at the 
meetings of the Committees of the Board and subsequently  
at a Board meeting. Each individual director including the 
Chairman and the CEO, did not fill in questionnaires on their 
own performance and were not present at the subsequent 
discussion of their performance. Areas of review included: 
Board composition, Board expertise, Board dynamics, time 
management, Board support, Board Committees, strategic 
oversight, risk management and internal control, succession 
planning and human resource management and priorities  
for change.
The majority of areas were rated very highly with all areas 
receiving at least adequate feedback. Top priorities for the 
Board over the coming year were identified as: focusing  
on strategy; understanding the views of investors and 
shareholders; and succession planning. The top strategic 
issues facing the Company were identified as: replacing and 
growing reserves; M&A; commodity prices; cost control;  
the investor base; and maintaining the dividend.
The Board will continue to perform an annual  
self-evaluation to assess its effectiveness and identify 
development requirements.
Dear Shareholders
In 2013 the regulatory environment became more  
demanding – and the Committee’s approach reflected this, 
with its ongoing focus on active management of risks and 
robust internal control. During the year, a new effectiveness 
framework for the assessment of the Committee’s work  
was implemented. 
 
Negative market movements prompted a more rigorous 
approach towards key financial statements risks, namely 
impairments and underlying assumptions. We also 
strengthened our financial/internal controls team, with  
the aim of enhancing the quality of the reporting function  
to the Committee and the Board. 
In addition, the Committee has an ongoing responsibility  
for the review, evaluation and stewardship of the Company’s 
risk management processes to minimise the strategic risks  
to the business identified by the Board, of which market risk  
is currently our top priority.
The Audit and Risk Committee is a fully independent body, 
consisting only of independent non-executive Directors  
with relevant skills and experience in financial reporting  
and risk management.
In 2013 six meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee were 
held and further business conducted by the Committee was 
approved by written resolutions on five additional occasions.
The Audit and Risk Committee dealt with the  
following matters:
•	reviewed and recommended for approval financial and  
risk information included in the Annual Report 2012;
•	reviewed and recommended for approval Polymetal’s  
results for the six months to 30 June 2013;
•	discussed and approved the Committee work plan;
•	supervised compliance with the Company’s anti-bribery  
and corruption policy;
•	reviewed the treasury policy and recommended its approval  
by the Board;
•	reviewed the Group’s internal audit plan and monitored  
the effectiveness of internal audit;
•	reviewed the Group’s external audit plan and recommended 
for approval the interim and year end audit fees;
•	reviewed the actual audit fee in 2013 compared  
to the authorised amount;
•	approved the terms of engagement, including the 
engagement letter issued at the start of each audit  
and the scope of the audit;
•	reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the external 
auditor; reviewed non-audit work performed by the auditors;
•	recommended the reappointment of Deloitte LLP  
as external auditor; 
•	reviewed the critical risks and exposures of the Group, 
including significant judgements, impairments and tax risks;
•	reviewed the capability of the Group’s finance team; and
•	performed an externally-facilitated assessment of the 
Committee’s effectiveness.
In line with the Company’s overall approach to governance,  
we have instilled a strong culture of discipline throughout our 
business, and are confident that we have a strong system  
of flexible processes which enable the Committee  
to operate effectively.
We as a Committee remain fully focused on being an effective 
key body scrutinising the reporting, internal control and risk 
management processes in order to ensure transparency  
and objectivity of the Company’s financial statements.

An auditor assessment tool is completed each year by each 
member of the Audit Committee and by the CFO. Feedback  
is also sought from the CEO, other members of the finance 
team, divisional management and the head of internal audit. 
The assessment tool adopted is comprehensive and includes 
detailed questions which are completed by way of a formal 
questionnaire every three years, with the key areas being 
performed every year. The feedback from this process is 
considered by the Audit Committee and is provided both  
to the auditors and to management. Action plans arising are 
also reviewed by the Committee.
The effectiveness of management in the external audit process 
is assessed principally in relation to the timely identification  
and resolution of areas of accounting judgement, the quality 
and timeliness of papers analysing those judgements, 
management’s approach to the value of independent audit,  
the booking of audit adjustments arising (if any) and the timely 
provision of draft public documents for review by the auditor 
and the Audit Committee.
Every three years, the Audit Committee requests that a partner 
independent of the audit engagement team discusses the 
quality of the external audit process with the Audit Committee 
chairman and the CFO using this evaluation framework.
During this year, the Audit Committee’s focus was on:
•	Testing the recoverability of goodwill and PPE.  
The Committee examined the potential indicators of 
impairment for each of the cash-generating units and  
the life-of-mine financial models used for assessing the fair 
value less costs to sell of the individual CGUs tested for 
impairment. The Committee examined and challenged  
the commodity price, discount rate and exchange rate 
assumptions used by management in its impairment tests. 
•	Testing the existence and recoverability of metal 
inventories. The Committee examined the price 
assumptions used by management as well as unit costs  
and other internal assumptions used in determining the net 
realisable value of unfinished goods within metal inventories 
(ore and concentrate stockpiles). 
•	Testing the recoverability of exploration and 
development assets. The Committee evaluated 
management’s approach to determine whether the existing 
exploration and development asset are likely to generate 
future economic benefits, reviewing prior exploration results  
and future development plans. 
•	Provisioning and disclosure of tax exposures.  
The Committee assessed the existing and potential tax 
exposures of the Group in Russia and Kazakhstan and  
the developments of the related court cases since the  
last reporting date, and evaluated whether the amount  
of provisions recognised in the financial statements  
continued to be the best estimate for probable exposures.
•	Other items: the Committee examined the impact of the 
implementation of IFRIC 20 (‘Stripping costs’), a new 
regulation covering accounting for stripping costs, and  
the related impact on current and prior period financial 
statements. The Committee also evaluated the accounting 
policies adopted by management, internal controls and  
the risk of misstatement. 
Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee is chaired by Mr Best and  
its other members are Mr Skirrow and Mr Balfour, both 
independent non-executive Directors. The Directors consider 
that Mr Best has recent and relevant financial experience  
(refer to page 75 for details of Mr Best’s experience). In addition, 
the other members of the Committee have a wide range  
of financial and other relevant experience. As a result  
of Mr Balfour’s decision not to offer himself for re-election  
as a Director, a replacement member of the Audit and  
Risk Committee will be appointed following the AGM.
The responsibilities of the Audit and Risk Committee comprise:
•	monitoring the integrity of the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements and reviewing its annual and interim financial 
statements, including, but not limited to: the consistency of, 
and any changes to, accounting and treasury policies across 
the Company and the Group; the methods used to account 
for significant or unusual transactions; the reasonableness  
of significant estimates and judgements, taking into account 
the views of the external auditor; and the clarity and 
completeness of disclosure in the consolidated  
financial statements;
•	considering and making recommendations to the Board,  
to be put to shareholders to consider at the AGM, in relation 
to the appointment, reappointment, resignation or removal  
of the Group’s external auditor;
•	overseeing the Group’s relationship with its external auditor 
and reviewing the effectiveness of the external audit process, 
taking into account relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements; the Committee meets with the external 
auditors at least once a year, without management being 
present, to discuss their remit and any issues arising  
from the audit;
•	reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor and the appropriateness of the provision of any 
non-audit services by the external auditor, taking into 
account relevant ethical guidance;
•	reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system  
of internal controls and risk management systems;
•	monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function in the context of the Group’s overall 
risk management system;
•	reviewing the Group’s policies and procedures for preventing 
and detecting fraud, the systems and controls in place for 
preventing bribery, and its policies for ensuring that the Group 
complies with relevant regulatory and legal requirements; and
•	approving significant transactions.
Full terms of reference of the Audit and Risk Committee  
are available at the Company’s website:  
www.polymetalinternational.com.
Ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the interim 
and annual financial statements remains with the Board. 
The Committee gives due consideration to applicable laws  
and regulations, the provisions of the UK Code and the 
requirements of the Listing Rules.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee makes himself available 
to major institutional shareholders annually to discuss the 
Company’s annual reporting to shareholders as part of the 
Company’s investor day. He is also available for one-on-one 
meetings with key shareholders on their request. 
The re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s external 
auditor is reviewed annually by the Audit and Risk Committee. 
Deloitte LLP was appointed auditor in 2011, with Deloitte CIS 
having been auditor of JSC Polymetal since the last tendering 
process in 2007. The Group has a policy of tendering the 
external audit at least every ten years. The Committee’s 
assessment of the external auditor’s performance and 
independence underpins its recommendation to the Board  
to propose to shareholders the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP 
as auditor until the conclusion of the AGM in 2015. Resolutions 
to authorise the Board to re-appoint and determine the 
auditor’s remuneration will be proposed at the AGM  
on 21 May 2014.
The Board considers that the Audit and Risk Committee 
complies with the requirements of the UK Code. 
Internal control and risk management 
The Company aims to ensure that all its activities are 
adequately controlled, to mitigate risk and support the 
achievement of its objectives, while avoiding the creation  
of excessive bureaucracy. The system of internal controls  
is designed to manage rather than completely eliminate risk,  
to achieve the Company’s business objectives whilst bringing 
residual risk to an acceptable level, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
In conducting its annual review of the effectiveness of risk 
management and internal control (including financial, operating 
and compliance controls), the Board considers the key  
findings from the ongoing monitoring and reporting processes, 
management assertions and independent assurance reports. 
The Board also takes account of material changes and trends 
in the risk profile and considers whether the control system, 
including reporting, adequately supports the Board in achieving 
its risk management objectives. 
During the course of the year the Board considered the 
Group’s responsiveness to changes within its business 
environment. The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing 
process, which has been operational during the year, and  
up to the date of approval of the Annual Report, for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced  
by the Group. 
Internal audit 
The internal audit function supports this aim by providing  
the Directors, through the Audit and Risk Committee, with  
an objective evaluation of the Company’s and the Group’s 
governance framework. The internal audit function also aims  
to raise levels of understanding and awareness of risk and 
control throughout the Group. 
The Audit and Risk Committee monitors the Company’s 
relationship with its external auditor relating to the provision 
of non-audit services to ensure that auditor objectivity and 
independence are safeguarded. This is achieved by disclosure  
of the extent and nature of non-audit services (see Note 14  
to the consolidated financial statements) and the prohibition 
against selected services being provided by the external auditor. 
 
The policy governing the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor approved by the Committee defines permitted 
audit and non-audit services. 
Pre-approval thresholds are in place for the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditor, being: pre-approval 
by the CFO (if below US$5,000); by the Chairman of the Audit 
and Risk Committee (if between US$5,000 and US$20,000);  
or by the Audit and Risk Committee (if above US$20,000). 
Above a certain threshold, if it is determined that the external 
auditor has no obvious competitive advantage in the 
performance of proposed non-audit services, then the provider 
of those services must be chosen by way of a competitive 
tender. Certain types of non-audit work may be undertaken  
by the auditor without prior referral to the Audit and Risk 
Committee up to a cumulative annual value of US$100,000.  
Any further non-audit work is subject to approval by the  
Audit and Risk Committee in further tranches of US$100,000.  
In the event that the cumulative value of non-audit fees exceeds 
US$500,000 in any given year, separate approval of the  
Audit and Risk Committee is required explaining why there  
is no threat to independence. A copy of the policy is available  
on the Company’s website: www.polymetalinternational.com.
The Audit and Risk Committee has considered information 
pertaining to the balance between fees for audit and non-audit 
work for the Group in 2013 and concluded that the nature and 
extent of non-audit services provided do not present a threat  
to the external auditor’s objectivity or independence.
Review of the effectiveness of the external audit 
process and audit quality
The Audit Committee has adopted a formal framework in its 
review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and 
audit quality which includes the following areas: 
•	 the audit partners, with particular focus on the lead audit 
engagement partner;
•	 the audit team; 
•	planning and scope of the audit and identification of areas  
of audit risk;
•	execution of the audit; 
•	 the role of management in an effective audit process; 
•	communications by the auditor with the Audit Committee, 
and how the auditor supports the work of the Audit 
Committee; 
•	 how the audit contributes insights and adds value; 
•	the independence and objectivity of the audit firm  
and the quality of the formal audit report to shareholders. Governance 84/85

Audit and Risk Committee report
continued
The head of internal audit reports to the CEO and, through the 
Audit and Risk Committee, to the Board of Directors. Where 
relevant, the internal audit function will additionally report its 
findings to members of the Company’s executive management.
The internal audit function’s annual work plan is designed to 
focus on matters arising from the operational risk matrix and  
is approved by the Audit and Risk Committee in advance. 
The internal audit function uses an annual self-certification 
process, which requires managers throughout the Group  
to personally confirm the testing of internal controls and 
compliance with Group policies within their business  
or function and the steps taken to address actual  
or potential issues that are identified. 
Management provides a timely response to issues raised  
by internal audit. Where possible, the issues are resolved  
within one reporting period. 
Internal control framework and activities 
The management structure of the Group and internal policies 
and procedures are aimed at maintaining a robust control 
framework within the Group which will result in the 
achievement of strategic objectives within the set risk  
tolerance levels. 
 
This framework includes: 
•	an appropriate tone set from the top (Board level),  
aimed at building the appropriate control environment; 
•	a proper risk identification and management system  
(for more detail please refer to page 70-71); 
•	a strict division of responsibilities and adequate delegation  
of authority; 
•	specific control activities implemented at all levels of the 
Group; and 
•	a periodic review of the effectiveness of internal controls. 
The governance framework reflects the specific structure and 
management of the Group, where authority and control are 
delegated by the Board to different levels, from the CEO to the 
managers of the Group’s operating entities and then downward 
to business and project managers as appropriate. 
Within this framework, authority is delegated within clearly 
prescribed limits and decisions are escalated where either 
project size or risk profile require a higher level of authority. 
In addition to controls operating in specific areas (production, 
exploration, construction, procurement), the control framework 
also includes a set of common procedures for financial 
accounting, reporting and budgeting – see details below. 
The Board confirms that the actions it considers necessary 
have been or are being taken to remedy any failings  
or weaknesses in the Group’s system of internal controls.  
Controls over IT systems used in financial accounting 
and reporting
The Group uses a 1C: Enterprise 8 ERP system for automation 
of everyday enterprise activities. These include various 
business tasks of the economic and management functions,  
such as management accounting, business accounting,  
HR management, supplier relationship management (‘SRM’) 
and material requirements planning (‘MRP’). Polymetal  
also uses the ERP system for budgeting, accounting,  
HR record-keeping and payroll, supply chain management, 
operational reporting and procurement. The Group operates  
an IT management framework based on COBIT (Control 
Objectives for Information and Related Technology), which 
provides a complete set of high-level requirements to be 
considered for effective control of each IT process.
UK Bribery Act 2010
The Company and its Directors are committed to ensuring 
adherence to the highest legal and ethical standards.  
This must be reflected in every aspect of the way of the  
Group operates. Bribery is a criminal offence in the countries  
in which the Group operates. Corrupt acts expose the  
Group and its employees to the risk of prosecution, fines  
and imprisonment, as well as endangering the Company’s 
reputation. The Group has a Code of Conduct in place,  
which refers to anti-bribery and corruption policy. The Policy 
extends across all the Group’s business dealings in all 
countries and territories in which the Group operates and 
applies to all employees of the Group, as well as relevant 
business partners and other relevant individuals and entities. 
The Board attaches the utmost importance to this policy and 
applies a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to acts of bribery and 
corruption by any of the Group’s employees or by business 
partners working on the Group’s behalf. The Policy prohibits 
the payment, offer or authorisation of bribes, the receipt or 
acceptance of a bribe, or the payment, offer or promise to pay 
any facilitating payments. Any breach of this policy is regarded 
as a serious matter by the Company and is likely to result  
in disciplinary action.
As part of its implementation of internal procedures to comply 
with the UK Bribery Act, the Group has in place a formalised 
whistle-blowing policy which describes processes in place for 
staff to communicate, in confidence, concerns about possible 
improprieties, unethical or illegal activities and ensures that 
arrangements are in place for independent investigation  
of such matters.
The Company affirms that it has not denied any personnel 
access to the Audit and Risk Committee and that it has 
provided protection to whistle-blowers from adverse  
personnel action.
The Code of Conduct is available on the website. Copies of  
the anti-bribery and corruption policy and the whistle-blowing 
policy are available on request from the Company’s offices. 
This has involved considering the matters reported to it  
and developing plans and programmes that it considers  
are reasonable in the circumstances. Based on the results  
of the review of risk management and internal control activities, 
undertaken by the Board and the Audit and Risk Committee 
the Board considers that the risk management and internal 
control systems are in accordance with the Revised Guidance 
for Directors on the UK Code. 
Financial reporting systems
The quality of financial accounting and reporting is ensured 
through a set of control procedures in the following areas: 
accounting methodology, preliminary review of new 
transactions, documentation, accounting techniques  
and financial closing procedures.
Accounting policies are developed centrally for each of the 
Group’s subsidiaries and are adapted for the peculiarities  
of each entity and Group-wide policies. Employees responsible 
for accounting and reporting functions have powers to review 
upcoming transactions and propose adjustments, where 
necessary, to ensure proper accounting and tax treatments.
The use of a centralised ERP system in each of the Group 
companies ensures unification of the business and accounting 
processes. The Group implements a multi-level set of controls 
over financial and accounting data recorded in the system. 
These controls involve the accounting department of each 
subsidiary, senior management of the subsidiary and controls 
at the head office level. In addition, the accounting and 
reporting data are regularly audited by internal and  
external auditors.
Procedures for approval of capital and  
current expenditures
The Company prepares annual operating and capital 
expenditure budgets based on its current and strategic goals 
and objectives. In addition to periodic control of actual financial 
performance versus budgeted, a procedure of ongoing  
control and authorisation of expenses is in place. The current 
system of pre-approval of significant transactions, along with 
accounting procedures in the ERP system, achieves a level  
of control over the amount and appropriateness of expenses.
Treasury operations
The Group operates a centralised treasury function, which  
is responsible for payments on behalf of all subsidiaries of the 
Group. Use of such a centralised system achieves the best level 
of control over the payments function without compromising the 
speed and reliability of payments. All transactions with banks 
on accounts maintenance, deposits and borrowings and 
foreign currency transactions are also performed at head  
office level in compliance with the treasury policy approved  
by the Board. Governance 86/87

Directors’ report
The Directors submit the Annual Report of Polymetal 
International Plc together with the audited financial  
statements of Polymetal International Plc for the year  
ended 31 December 2013.
Corporate governance
Refer to pages 77 to 80 for a description of the Group’s  
corporate governance structure and policies.
Going concern
In assessing its going concern status, the Group has taken 
account of its financial position, anticipated future trading 
performance, its borrowings and other available credit facilities, 
and its forecast compliance with covenants on those 
borrowings and its capital expenditure commitments and 
plans. As at 31 December 2013, the Group held US$66 million 
of cash and had net debt of US$1,045 million, with US$1,324 
million of undrawn but committed facilities available subject  
to the Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA covenant compliance.
 
The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and 
projections, having taken account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, show that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for  
at least the next 12 months from the date of this report and that 
it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2013.
Financial and business reporting
The Board believes that the disclosures set out in the Strategic 
report on pages 1 to 73 of this Annual Report provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Directors
The Directors, their status and Board Committee memberships 
are set out on pages 74-75 and 78 of the Report.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The Board may appoint a person who is willing to act to be  
a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional Director 
and in either case whether or not for a fixed term. Irrespective 
of the terms of his or her appointment, a Director so appointed 
shall hold office only until the next following AGM. If not 
reappointed at such Annual General Meeting, he or she shall 
vacate office at its conclusion.
The Company may by ordinary resolution remove any Director 
from office (notwithstanding any provision of the Company’s 
Articles or of any agreement between the Company and such 
Director, but without prejudice to any claim he or she may have 
for damages for breach of any such agreement). No special 
notice needs to be given of any resolution to remove a Director 
and no Director proposed to be removed has any special right 
to protest against his or her removal. The Company may,  
by ordinary resolution, appoint another person in place  
of a Director removed from office.
Directors’ interests
Information on Directors’ interests in shares of the Company  
is set out in the Remuneration report on page 98.
Directors’ indemnities
To the extent permitted by the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, 
the Company has indemnified every Director and other officer  
of the Company (other than any person (whether an officer  
or not) engaged by the Company as auditor) out of the assets 
of the Company against any liability incurred by him or her  
for negligence, default, breach of duty, breach of trust  
or otherwise in relation to the affairs of the Company.  
This provision does not affect any indemnity that a Director  
or officer is otherwise entitled to.
Political donations
The Company may not make a political donation to a political 
party or other political organisation, or to an independent 
election candidate, or incur any political expenditure, unless 
such donation or expenditure is authorised by an ordinary 
resolution of shareholders passed before the donation is made 
or the expenditure incurred. No such donations were made  
in 2013 (2012: none).
Capital structure
The structure of the Company’s share capital is detailed  
in Note 32 to the financial statements. 
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding  
or on the transfer of shares, which are both regulated  
by the Articles of the Company and applicable legislation. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between 
holders of the Company’s shares that may result  
in restrictions on the transfer of shares or on voting rights.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter  
or terminate upon a change of control of the Company,  
such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements and 
employees’ share plans. None of these is considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the 
Group as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not aware  
of any agreements between the Company and its Directors  
or employees that provide for compensation for loss of office  
or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Substantial shareholdings in the Company are disclosed  
on page 162.
Details of employee option schemes are set out in the 
Remuneration report on pages 90 to 100.
There were no acquisitions of the Company’s own shares in 
2013. At 31 December 2013, the Group and its subsidiaries 
held no treasury shares (31 December 2012: no shares). As at 
31 December 2013, the Company had shareholders’ authority 
to purchase up to 38,947 ,286 of its own ordinary shares.
The Articles of the Company can be altered by a special 
resolution of the Company. A resolution is a special resolution 
when it is passed by three-quarters of the members  
who (being entitled to do so) vote in person, or by proxy,  
at a general meeting of the Company.
Pursuant to the Company’s Articles, the Directors have the 
power to allot Equity Securities (as defined in the Articles).  
At the AGM of the Company held in 2013, the power to allot 
Equity Securities was renewed up to an aggregate number  
of 129,824,288 ordinary shares, provided that the Directors’ 
power in respect of such an amount may only be used in 
connection with a pre-emptive issue (as defined in the Articles). 
The Directors are further empowered pursuant to Article 12.4 
of the Company’s Articles to allot Equity Securities for cash  
as if Article 13 of the Articles (Pre-emptive rights) did not apply 
and for the purposes of paragraph (b) of Article 12.4 of the 
Articles, the Non Pre-emptive Shares (as defined in the 
Articles) are an aggregate number of up to 19,473,643  
ordinary shares. In 2013, the Company used the above  
powers to allot 5,491,661 new ordinary shares relating  
to the Maminskoye acquisition.
Pursuant to Article 57 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991,  
the Company is authorised to make market purchases  
of ordinary shares of the Company, provided that:
•	the maximum number of ordinary shares to be  
purchased is 38,947 ,286 ordinary shares;
•	the minimum price (excluding expenses) which  
may be paid for each ordinary share is 1 penny;
•	the maximum price (excluding expenses) which may  
be paid for each ordinary share is the higher of:
a. an amount equal to 105% of the average of the middle 
market quotations of an ordinary share in the Company  
as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official 
List for the five business days immediately preceding the 
day on which the ordinary share is contracted to be 
purchased; and
b. an amount equal to the higher of the price of the last 
independent trade of an ordinary share and the highest 
current independent bid for an ordinary share as derived 
from the London Stock Exchange Trading System;
•	pursuant to Article 58A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, 
the Company may hold as treasury shares any ordinary 
shares purchased pursuant to the authority conferred  
in this Resolution.
The authorities above shall, unless previously revoked or 
varied, expire at the conclusion of the Company’s next  
AGM (or, if earlier, at the close of business on the date which  
is 15 months after the date of the resolution, which granted 
them, being 12 December 2014).
Approval of share issues, consideration for which does not 
exceed US$15 million, is delegated to a committee of the CEO, 
the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee and the SID.  
If the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee and/or the 
SID are not available, then any independent non-executive 
Director(s) may act as their alternates on the Committee.
Dividends
The Group’s loss for the year ended 31 December 2013
attributable to equity holders of the Company was  
US$198 million (2012: profit US$428 million). Underlying  
net earnings (adjusted for the after-tax amount of
impairment charges) in 2013 were US$117 million  
(2012: US$431 million). In August 2013 the Company  
declared an interim dividend of US$0.01 per share which  
was paid in September 2013. The Directors have proposed  
the payment of a final dividend of US$0.08 per share  
(2012: US$0.31 per share). In addition, a special dividend  
of US$0.50 per share was declared by the Company  
in December 2012 and paid in January 2013.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of shareholders of the Company will take place  
on 21 May 2014 at 11.00 am (BST) in Le Hocq Suite, Radisson 
Blu Waterfront Hotel, Rue de l’etau, St Helier, Jersey JE2 3WF, 
Channel Islands. A webcast will be available for shareholders 
who will not be able to attend the meeting in person.
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval  
of this Annual Report confirms that:
•	so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
•	the Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Group’s auditor is aware of that information.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office 
as auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed 
at the forthcoming AGM. The Audit and Risk Committee 
reviews both the level of the audit fee and the level and nature 
of non-audit fees as part of its review of the adequacy and 
objectivity of the audit process.
Having taken all matters considered by the Board and brought 
to the attention of the Board during the year into account,  
we are satisfied that the Annual Report, taken as a whole,  
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Annual Report 2013

Remuneration report
Dear Shareholders
2013 was a challenging year for all mining companies when 
adverse movements in commodity prices forced the sector  
to focus on controlling costs, producing robust operating 
performance and maintaining capital discipline. With this  
in mind, the Remuneration Committee decided that any 
significant changes to the remuneration of Directors and 
officers of the Company during 2014 would be inappropriate. 
Instead we have put our efforts into finalising the Performance 
Share Plan, approved at last year’s AGM.
As a FTSE250 company, whose shares are listed on the 
London Stock Exchange, we believe that our shareholders 
rightfully expect Polymetal to comply with the strictest of 
corporate governance requirements. We remain committed  
to full adherence to all regulatory requirements and, as such, 
also reflect this in our remuneration policies and decisions.  
As a result, we consistently receive over 95% of the votes  
in favour of AGM resolutions related to remuneration and  
to reappointment of Directors. This unequivocal backing from 
shareholders in support of the Company’s decisions is very 
heartening as we strive to develop our remuneration policies  
in line with best practices, and substantially aligned with the 
business strategy and performance.
Polymetal’s remuneration policy remains a key element  
in providing a clear framework to motivate, incentivise and 
retain our senior management team. With the introduction  
of a significant amount of changes to disclosure requirements, 
this has been a challenging reporting year. However,  
I believe that Polymetal’s remuneration structure is both 
straightforward and substantially aligned with shareholder 
interests – as evidenced by the overwhelming support that  
this received at the 2013 AGM. This has enabled us to meet  
the challenge with relative ease. 
Remuneration philosophy
The focus on sustainable shareholder value creation  
is the cornerstone of our executive remuneration system. 
The Company’s remuneration policy is set to ensure that 
Directors are fairly rewarded with regard to the responsibilities 
undertaken, and considers comparable pay levels in the 
countries of operation and the international mining industry. 
The executive remuneration strategy, and underlying policy, 
supports this by enabling the Company to attract and retain 
talent that will maximise shareholder value.
Corporate and individual performance is taken into account  
in setting pay levels for the CEO, and this is reviewed  
on an annual basis to ensure it remains in line with  
companies of a similar nature, size and complexity.  
An external benchmarking is undertaken every three years  
in order to ensure comparability with other gold mining 
companies worldwide and London-listed peers (such 
benchmarking was last performed in 2012). Remuneration 
levels for non-executive Directors are based on comparable 
levels for companies of a similar nature, size and complexity, 
and take into account specific responsibilities undertaken. 
Context to the Committee’s decisions
2013 was a challenging year for all mining companies.  
At Polymetal, we continued to concentrate on controlling  
costs, delivering robust operating performance and maintaining 
capital discipline. However, despite resilient operating and cost 
performance, the financial results of the Company in 2013 were 
inevitably affected by the market conditions. Our net profit and 
dividends decreased on the back of significant decline in 
commodities prices, however we were able to sustain free 
cash flow as a result of decrease in capital expenditure and 
production growth.
Another challenge was to stay on top of the changing 
remuneration disclosure requirements and ensure that all 
procedures are put in place to be fully compliant. These 
priorities are reflected in our remuneration decisions when 
awarding performance bonuses to the CEO and senior 
employees and reviewing their base salaries.
Key committee decisions
•	 In 2013 the Remuneration Committee concentrated  
on finalising the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which  
was supported by 99.82% of shareholders who voted on it.  
The plan includes a total shareholder return (TSR) underpin 
stipulating that no options will vest in the event that TSR for 
the period is negative. Other features include the mandatory 
deferral of 50% of an annual bonus for three years in shares, 
clawback provisions, a one year holding period for all plans, 
and a substantial minimum shareholding requirement for the 
Company’s executives.
•	 Due to unfavourable market conditions, the Remuneration 
Committee decided that any significant changes to the 
existing approach to remuneration of Directors and senior 
officers of the Company in 2014 would be inappropriate.
•	The Committee approved the increase in Rouble based  
Chief Executive’s base salary for 2014 by 8% (there  
was no increase in 2013 versus 2012), which partially 
compensates for the more significant depreciation  
of the Rouble against the US Dollar (14%) and inflation.  
The US Dollar equivalent of the Chief Executive’s base  
salary would decrease by 5%.
•	Annual bonus of 88% of the maximum opportunity  
was awarded to the Chief Executive in respect of 2013. 
Changes during the year
•	 In the context of the changing regulations, Polymetal did  
not have to make additional changes to its existing executive 
remuneration structure. It formalised some of the existing 
procedures, adopted changes required by the new regulation 
and presents in this annual report a comprehensive yet simple 
remuneration strategy and seeks shareholder approval of the 
policy, which will come into effect immediately after the AGM 
2014 and will apply for three years. 
•	 Subsequent to 2013 year-end, 99% of employees entitled  
to the legacy long-term incentive plan waived their 
entitlement to these options and will be granted options  
under the new LTIP .
Approach to disclosure
This Report sets out the Company’s remuneration policy  
and implementation for its Directors and provides details  
of their remuneration and share interests for the year ended  
31 December 2013. The Board believes that for a Company 
whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange  
it is expected that the Directors’ remuneration policy report  
and annual remuneration report of the Company should be 
approved by shareholders, and it is an element of good 
corporate governance for the Company to seek this. 
Accordingly, the Directors’ remuneration policy report  
will be put to a binding shareholder vote and the Directors’ 
annual remuneration report will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company on 21 May 2014.
On behalf of the Committee, I welcome feedback from 
shareholders and look forward to receiving your support  
at the AGM.
Yours sincerely,

Director base fee:
− Committee Chairmanship fee; 
− Committee membership fee;
−  Board and Committee

Remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for the other members of the Company’s executive team and broader management team of the  
Group is consistent in both structure and KPIs with the policy in respect of the Chief Executive Officer. Whilst the value of 
remuneration will vary throughout the Group, depending upon the individual’s role, criticality to the business and level of seniority, 
the remuneration of all senior executives consists of a base salary, an annual bonus and participation in the new LTIP (the PSP 
and DSA). Employees up to three levels below the Board (approximately 300 employees throughout the Group) are expected  
to participate in the LTIP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The PSP policy grant level is 150% of base salary  
for the CEO, 100% for Executive Committee members and 50-100% for employees of the level below the Executive Committee. 
Shareholding requirements are also set below Board level. The DSA operations mirror the arrangement set out for executive 
Directors in the policy table, where 50% of the annual bonus is compulsorily deferred into shares and released annually  
to employees over a period of three years. 
Remuneration policy for the wider group of employees is aimed at aligning pay with the achievement of targeted results for each 
employee. The Company’s policy on fair pay leads to the payment of additional remuneration for employees living in difficult 
climatic locations and the delivery of appropriate levels of pay for different levels of work. The bonus component of remuneration 
for mid-level management and operational staff is measured based on the achievement of production targets, increasing  
output, the level of justified cost savings and health and safety records. In terms of pension arrangements, the Company applies 
a consistent approach for the CEO and other employees and adheres to the mandatory pension contributions required under 
applicable laws.
Salaries are considered for annual increases based on the Company’s performance results, inflation rates and the competitive 
level of salaries versus the wider market.
Notes to the policy table 
Performance measures and targets
The Committee selected the performance conditions indicated in the policy table because they are central to the Company’s 
overall strategy, and are the key metrics used under the annual bonus and LTIP by the CEO to oversee the operation  
of the business. 
Performance targets for all our incentive plans are reviewed annually, and where appropriate are typically set at a level that is in 
line with the Company’s forecasts.

LTIP Introduction of new plan (LTIP) and removal of EIP. See below for details
Non-executive Directors No changes made
The new LTIP
In April 2013, following a detailed review of market practice and the remuneration packages of the Company’s executive 
management, carried out at the request of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors proposed to put in place  
a new long-term incentive programme (the ‘Performance Share Plan’ or ‘PSP’) after the potential vesting of awards under  
the current Long-term EIP . 
The key terms of the new LTIP are described in the policy table above.
The Board believes that the new LTIP will ensure continued alignment of the executive team’s performance with shareholder 
interests and will reward superior long-term performance and the creation of sustainable shareholder value. The Board  
also believes that the LTIP is in line with UK best practice and fully follows the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance  
Code and other relevant guidelines, while also containing features which are superior to common practice in the UK –  
such as a positive TSR underpin for vesting of the LTIP .
The PSP was put to a shareholder vote at the AGM in June 2013 and, following approval by 99.82% of shareholders,  
will be implemented upon vesting of the current EIP after June 2014 or, for those participants who have waived their rights  
under the EIP, from April 2014. 
Illustration of application of remuneration policy
The composition and structure of the remuneration package for the CEO under three performance scenarios  
(Maximum performance, Target performance and Minimum performance) is set out in the charts below. 
These charts show that the proportion of remuneration delivered through short-term and long-term incentive schemes is in line 
with our remuneration policy and changes significantly across the three performance scenarios. As such, the package promotes 
the achievement of both short-term and long-term performance targets and drives the alignment of the CEO’s interests with the 
interests of shareholders.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay a competitive overall package as appropriate to attract and 
motivate the right talent for the role. If an executive is promoted to the Board from within the Company, any pre-existing awards 
or benefits that were made available to him or her prior to becoming a Director (and not in anticipation of an imminent promotion 
to the Board) will be retained and allowed to vest or be provided under the original terms.
The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for 
the appointment of an executive Director. Any new Director’s remuneration package would include the same elements, be set at 
a level consistent with the scope of the role (at a level not exceeding that of the CEO as set out in the remuneration policy table) 
and be subject to the same constraints as those of existing Directors performing similar roles, as shown below.
Area
Policy and operation
Base salary  
and benefits
•	The base salary level will be set by taking into account the experience of the individual and the salaries paid  
in comparable companies.
•	Depending on the circumstances of any particular appointment, the Committee may choose to set the base salary 
below market median and increase the amount paid over a period of time to achieve alignment with market levels for 
the role (with reference to the experience and performance of the individual), subject to the Company’s ability to pay.
•	In line with the remuneration policy, as set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table, no benefits will be provided 
to recruited Directors.
Pension •	Pension contributions will be limited to the mandatory contributions required by Russian or any other applicable law, 
as set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table.
Annual bonus •	The Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme as set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration policy table. The maximum annual opportunity is 150% of base salary.
•	50% of any bonus is deferred into shares under the DSA, as set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table.
Long-term  
incentives
•	The executive Director will be eligible to participate in the LTIP at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion in line  
with the details set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table. The maximum annual grant permitted under the 
scheme rules is 200% of base salary and the normal grant level is up to 150% of base salary. Performance measures 
would apply, as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Replacement  
awards
•	The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards so that overall they are no more generous in terms  
of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited as a consequence of the individual joining the 
Company. In determining the quantum and structure of any replacement awards, the Committee will seek to replicate 
the fair value and, as far as practicable, the timing, form and performance requirements of the forfeited remuneration. 
The maximum value of replacement awards is capped at 50% of the individual’s base salary, and at least 50%  
of any replacement award should be delivered in the Company’s shares. 
Other •	Should relocation of a newly recruited executive Director be required, reasonable costs associated with this 
relocation will be met by the Company. Such relocation support may include, but not be limited to: payment  
of legal fees; removal costs; temporary accommodation/hotel costs; a contribution to stamp duty; and replacement 
of non-transferrable household items. In addition, and in appropriate circumstances, the Committee may grant 
additional support in relation to the payment of school fees and the provision of tax advice.
•	The Company will reimburse the executive Director for all reasonable expenses which he/she may incur while 
carrying out executive duties.

Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
Loss of office policy
The Committee’s approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take into account individual 
circumstances, including the reason for termination, contractual obligations of both parties as well as applicable share plan  
and pension scheme rules (including any relevant performance conditions).
Please note that Mr Nesis is a Director of both Polymetal International plc and JSC Polymetal, a 100% subsidiary  
of the Group incorporated in Russia. Further details are set out in the Current Directors’ service contracts section below.
The table below summarises the key elements of the executive Director service contracts and policy on payment for loss  
of office.
Area
Policy and operation
Notice period Polymetal International JSC Polymetal
6 months from Company With immediate effect from Company
6 months from Director 1 month from Director
Compensation  
for loss of office in 
service contracts
•	No entitlement in respect of directorship of Polymetal International.
•	Up to three times average monthly salaries in respect of directorship of JSC Polymetal.
Treatment of annual 
bonus awards
•	Where an executive Director’s employment is terminated after the end of the performance year, but before the 
payment of the annual bonus is made, the executive may be eligible for an annual bonus award for that performance 
year subject to an assessment based on performance achieved over the period. No award will be made in the event 
of gross misconduct.
•	Where an executive Director’s employment is terminated during a performance year, a pro-rated annual bonus award 
for the period worked in that performance year may be payable, subject to an assessment based on performance 
achieved over the period.
Treatment of  
unvested Deferred 
Share Awards  
under plan rules
•	In normal circumstances, Deferred Share Awards will continue until the normal time of vesting upon cessation  
of employment by way of injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, or any other circumstances which the 
Committee determines. 
•	Alternatively, the Board may determine that Deferred Share Awards will vest immediately. In both circumstances  
there would be no pro-rating of the Deferred Share Awards for time from the award date until cessation  
of employment or for performance.
Treatment of  
unvested Performance 
Share Plan awards 
under plan rules
•	Any outstanding award will lapse at cessation of employment with the Company, unless the reason for cessation  
due to death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, or any other circumstances which the Committee 
determines, when the award will vest as normal in accordance with the terms of the award.
•	Alternatively, the Committee may determine that a proportion of the award will vest immediately, with the proportion 
determined by the Committee, taking into account (where relevant) the extent to which the performance conditions 
have been met or are likely to be met at the end of the performance period, and any other factors the Committee 
may consider relevant.
•	The number of shares shall also normally be pro-rated down to reflect the reduced service period.
Exercise  
of discretion
•	Any discretion available in determining the treatment of incentives upon termination of employment is intended  
only to be relied upon to provide flexibility in unusual circumstances.
•	The Committee’s determination will take into account the particular circumstances of the Director’s departure  
and the recent performance of the Company.
Change of control In relation to Performance Share Plan awards:
•	each or any award will not vest where there is a corporate event resulting in a new person or company acquiring 
control of the Company, but will instead be exchanged for new awards, on an equivalent basis, over shares in the 
new company; or
•	the Committee may determine that a proportion of the awards shall vest or become exercisable (as the case may 
be), taking into account such factors as the Committee may consider relevant including, but not limited to, the length 
of time the award has been held at the time the change of control event occurs and having regard to performance 
targets or other performance conditions imposed on the award.
In relation to the Deferred Share Awards, the Committee may determine that a proportion of the awards shall vest, 
taking into account such factors as the Committee may consider relevant. Governance 96/97

Annual bonus targets and outcomes
The targets for annual bonus measures are considered commercially sensitive because of the information that their disclosure 
may provide to the Company’s competitors, given that these competitors are largely based outside of the UK and hence are  
not subject to the same reporting requirements as the Company. Performance against these targets is set out below:
Measures
Weight Below Target Maximum
Achieving production budget 30% ●
Total Cash Cost per ounce of gold equivalent produced 30% ●
Completion of new projects on time and within budget 30% ●
Health and safety 10% ●
This resulted in the CEO receiving a bonus of 88% of maximum opportunity for the year (133% of salary; US$599,624). 
LTIP
No share options vested or were exercised in 2013. No options were granted to Mr Nesis or other Directors in 2013.  
The EIP was adopted in September 2010, prior to the Company’s IPO, to reward key senior executives, including the CEO,  
for increasing the share price and delivering superior performance over a long-term period. 
12,000,000 options were granted to Mr Nesis under the EIP with a vesting date in June 2014, subject to a vesting condition.  
As at the date of this Report, Mr Nesis has waived all his rights under the legacy Long-term EIP .

Percentage change in CEO remuneration 
Excluding the value of long-term incentives, the percentage change in total remuneration for the CEO was 4% increasing  
from US$1,037 ,413 in 2012 to US$1,081,572 in 2013. The average percentage change in total remuneration for all employees  
in the year was 3%.
To ensure the comparability of this figure, and to minimise distortions, the all-employee remuneration figure is on the basis  
of full-time permanent employees.

Implementation of remuneration policy in the following financial year
In 2014 the Committee intends to implement the executive and non-executive Director remuneration policies as follows:
Base salary
The policy for determining 2014 base salaries will remain unchanged. Base salary for the CEO for 2013 and 2014 is set out below:

  Base salary for 2014 is translated at the closing exchange rate of the Rouble to the US Dollar stated by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation as of 22 March 2014.  
Base salary for 2013 is translated at the average exchange rate of Rouble to US Dollar stated by Central Bank of Russian Federation during 2013. 
The Remuneration Committee decided to increase the base salary of the CEO in 2014 in Rouble terms for the first time since 
2011, having taken into account the inflation in Russian Federation, as well as significant devaluation of the Russian Rouble 
against the US Dollar during the period. The US Dollar equivalent of the base salary has decreased by 5% compared to 2013  
as a result of the Rouble devaluation.
Pension and benefits
No pension or benefits plans are in place for 2014, except for the defined pension contributions to the mandatory pension fund  
of the Russian Federation. 
Annual bonus
The targets for annual bonus measures are considered commercially sensitive, particularly in the gold mining industry, because  
of the sensitivity of information that their disclosure may provide to the Company’s competitors, given that these are largely 
based outside the UK and hence are not subject to the same reporting requirements as the Company.
Long-term Incentive Plan (Deferred Share Awards Plan and Performance Share Plan)
Deferred Share Awards Plan
The Committee intends to defer annual bonus awards earned for the 2014 performance period in line with policy. Governance 100/101

Governance
Performance Share Plan 
The Committee intends to make an award under the PSP to the CEO in 2014, in line with the disclosed policy on pages 90-91.
Vesting is based on relative TSR measured against the constituents of the FTSE Gold Mines Index and on the Company’s 
absolute TSR. Peers are ranked and the Company’s position determines vesting:
TSR vs. FTSE Gold Miners Payout
Below threshold Below median performance 0%
Threshold Median performance 20%
Maximum Upper decile performance 100%
Straight-line vesting will occur between the points set out above. No award will vest for performance below median,  
or if the Company’s absolute TSR performance is negative, regardless of relative performance.
Non-executive Directors
The policy for determining non-executive Directors’ fees will be unchanged from 2013. Fee rates for 2013 and 2014  
are set out below:

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive Directors who have no personal financial interest, 
other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided. As a result of Mr Balfour’s decision not to offer himself for re-election 
as a Director, a replacement member of the Remuneration Committee will be appointed following the AGM. In 2012 the 
Company sold 100% of Amikan Holdings Limited, which owns the Veduga gold deposit (‘Veduga’) in the Krasnoyarsk region  
of the Russian Federation, to Polygon Gold Inc. (‘Polygon’). Mr Homeniuk serves as Polygon’s Executive Chairman and CEO. 
Polygon operates as a standalone company with independent management and Polymetal provides certain technical and 
regulatory assistance to Polygon on an ongoing basis. Polymetal currently holds 42.6% equity ownership in Polygon and one  
of the four board seats and therefore has significant influence, but does not have control over its activities. The Board continues 
to consider Mr Homeniuk to be an independent non-executive Director. The Board concluded that the relationship between 
Polymetal and Polygon is not material, given the carrying value of its interest in Veduga in the Group’s financial statements which  
is US$15.6 million and represents approximately 0.5% of the Group’s total assets as at 31 December 2013.
The membership of the Remuneration Committee is shown in the table below.

The principal functions of the Remuneration Committee under its terms of reference are:
•	to make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s policy on the remuneration of executive management;
•	to determine, within agreed terms of reference, the remuneration of the Chairman and specific remuneration packages for each 
of the Executive Director, the Company Secretary and the members of senior management, including pension rights and any 
compensation payments;
•	to formulate suitable performance criteria for the performance-based pay of executive management;
•	to review and oversee all aspects of any executive share scheme operated by or to be established by the Company; and

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
Further business conducted by the Remuneration Committee was approved by written resolutions on two further occasions.
In 2013 the meetings of the Committee covered the following key areas:
•	reviewed and approved Board expenses and reimbursement policy;
•	reviewed and approved bonuses for 2012; 
•	 reviewed individual and corporate performance of the CEO and senior executives, and set KPI levels for 2013; 
•	approved Remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2012;
•	following review of the Company’s remuneration policy and practices to ensure that they remain aligned with the objectives of 
the business and in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and best practice, the Committee proposed the introduction 
of the new Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP), to replace the Employee Incentive Programme once it expires. This LTIP was 
approved by shareholders at the AGM held in 2013; 
•	reviewed proposed changes to the remuneration report regulations and agreed the approach to disclosure in future years. 
Although these regulations are not expected to formally apply to the Company, the Committee believes that as a FTSE 250 
company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, it is in keeping with good corporate governance to 
voluntarily adopt the new disclosure provisions, including carrying out a binding vote on remuneration policy at the 2014 AGM.
•	The Board considers that the composition and work of the Remuneration Committee complies with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. Following external Board evaluation, the Committee reviewed its performance and noted 
feedback provided with the assistance of external consultants.
Statement of voting at AGM
At the 2013 AGM, held on 12 June, votes for the Remuneration report were as follows:
Votes for
Votes against Withheld
320,242,860 (99.75%) 809,134 (0.25%) 32,095
At this meeting, the Company’s new long-term incentive plan was put to a vote, with 99.82% of shareholders in favour of the 
introduction of the new plan.
Advisors
The Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) as independent external remuneration consultants to provide 
support in relation to the design and operation of the new LTIP and on the changes associated with the new remuneration report 
regulations. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group (‘RCG’) and a signatory of the RCG Voluntary Code  
of Practice, and incorporates the principles of Voluntary Code of Practice into its engagement. No other services were provided 
by PwC during 2013. Fees paid to PwC in relation to remuneration services provided to the Committee in 2013 totalled 
US$54,500, with fees quoted in advance and based on the level of complexity of the work undertaken. The Committee  
reviews the objectivity and independence of the advice it receives from PwC at a private meeting held on an annual basis. 
During its work in 2013, the Committee was also aided by the Chief Executive Officer, and senior finance and human resources 
executives of the Company.
PWC’s appointment was made by way of a competitive tender, results of which were presented to the Remuneration Committee 
for approval.

Financial statements
Directors’ responsibility statement Independent auditor’s report to the members of Polymetal International plc
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
for use in the European Union (IFRS). The financial statements are required by law to be properly prepared in accordance  
with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for  
each financial year the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation  
of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation  
and presentation of financial statements’.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, the Directors 
are also required to:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and  
understandable information;
•	provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and  
financial performance; and 
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps  
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK and Jersey governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
•	the management report, which is incorporated into the strategic report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board
Bobby Godsell 
Chairman of the Board of Directors
Vitaly Nesis
Chief Executive
30 March 2014
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
•	give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the group’s loss  
for the year then ended;
•	have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union; and
•	have been prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Statement of Cash flows and the 
related notes 1 to 37. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union.
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 86 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
•	we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate; and
•	we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s  
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Recoverability of PP&E and Goodwill 
Recoverability of PP&E and goodwill is dependent  
on several assumptions, the determination of which  
requires a significant level of judgement (see note 18).
Management has assessed whether any indicators of impairment 
existed at its seven cash generating units (‘CGUs’) (as set out  
in Note 5). Where an indicator of impairment was identified,  
it assessed the recoverable amount of the CGU to ensure  
this was not less than its net book value.
We critically assessed developments in the wider economic 
environment and the performance of the CGUs in the year  
through visiting certain operations and meeting with local  
and Group operational management, to challenge management’s 
assessment of the existence of impairment indicators.
Where indicators were identified and valuations were performed,  
our audit procedures included testing the principles and integrity  
of the models and challenging assumptions through comparison  
with externally and internally derived data for the key inputs such  
as the discount rate used, expected metal prices, and foreign 
exchange rates.
Recoverability of Exploration and Development (E&D) assets
Recoverability is dependent on the expected future success  
of exploration activities. E&D expenditure is capitalised once it has 
been determined that the mineral property can be economically 
developed. The valuation assessment of each asset’s future 
prospectivity requires significant judgement.
At 31 December 2013 the group held US$337 million in respect  
of E&D expenditure on the Balance Sheet.
Management undertook a detailed valuation of E&D assets  
for impairment, which included a summary of the group’s current 
licence obligations and an assessment of the likelihood of future 
success of exploration activities as well as management’s  
future plans for further E&D expenditure were prepared  
on a consistent basis.
We assessed the recoverability of the assets by meeting with 
operational management to discuss material E&D assets, reviewing 
drilling and other testing results in the year and confirming future 
development plans. We reviewed Board-approved budgets for 
2014/5 to check that exploration projects were committed and  
we performed detailed testing to assess the validity of costs 
capitalised in the year. Financial statements 104/105

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Existence and valuation of metal inventories
Management’s determination of the contained metal levels  
in ore stockpiles and work in progress involves the use  
of sampling techniques and theoretical models.
The assessment of the recoverability of metal inventories  
requires judgement both in terms of calculating the expected  
costs to process and refine ore stock piles to produce concentrate 
or doré for sale, and in terms of estimating future gold, silver  
or copper prices to be realised on sale.
At 31 December 2013 the group held US$438 million in respect  
of metal inventories on the Balance Sheet.
We tested the existence of metal inventories through attending inventory 
counts conducted by management at material operating locations and 
performing detailed roll forward testing from the count dates through  
to year end by testing management’s metal inventory models. 
We tested the recoverability of metal inventories through the 
recalculation of projected net realisable values based on expected 
commodity prices (which were consistent with prices used in the 
Group’s PP&E and goodwill impairment calculations) and costs  
to complete. We also performed a detailed analytical review  
of management’s inventory costing calculations.
We tested inventories for obsolescence by reviewing management’s 
strategic mine plans and assessing whether there was appropriate 
provisioning in place, where stockpiles are no longer expected  
to be used.
Provisioning and disclosure in respect of income tax and mineral extraction tax liabilities
Russian and Kazakh tax legislation is subject to varying 
interpretations and management’s interpretation as applied  
to the transactions and activity of the Group may be challenged  
by the relevant regional and federal authorities.
The determination of whether a potential exposure is probable, 
possible or remote requires significant judgement.
We examined the Group’s assessment of its potential tax exposures, 
including related interest and penalties, and we utilised tax audit 
specialists, both in Russia and in Kazakhstan, to assess the likelihood 
of an exposure crystallising.
We reconciled court documentation received to provisions 
recognised or settlements paid and disclosures made in Note 16.  
We considered the impact of court cases on other exposures 
identified. We agreed payments made to bank statements.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 83.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified  
with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope 
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be US$16 million, which is 5.6% of adjusted pre-tax profit, and less than 1% of equity. 
Pre-tax profit is adjusted for the materiality calculation to exclude one-off impairments, write-downs and net foreign exchange 
losses recognised which would, if included, significantly distort the materiality calculation year on year.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of US$320,000,  
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the 
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement across the Group. Our audit scope focused primarily on the seven key 
operating segments (Voro, Khakanja, Dukat, Omolon, Varvara, Amursk-Albazino and Mayskoye) plus the Head Office entity  
such that 100% of revenues and over 99% of total assets were subject to a full scope audit.
The Group audit team was involved in the work of the component auditors at all stages of the audit process. The signing partner 
and senior members of the Group engagement team visited the head offices in St. Petersburg several times in the past year  
and have also visited at least one of the key business units, at least once a year, since our appointment as external auditors.  
The Group audit team directed and reviewed in detail the work performed on significant risks by the component auditors.
Our audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component; which were lower than  
group materiality.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•	proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or proper returns adequate for our audit  
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
•	the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if in our opinion information  
in the Annual Report is:
•	materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
•	 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the course  
of performing our audit; or
•	otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during 
the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether  
the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider  
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Other matters
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance  
with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied to the company.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that 
our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team, strategically focused second partner reviews and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Going concern
In assessing its going concern status, the Group has taken account of its financial position, anticipated future trading performance, 
its borrowings and other available credit facilities, and its forecast compliance with covenants on those borrowings and its  
capital expenditure commitments and plans. As at 31 December 2013, the Group held US$66 million of cash and had net debt  
of US$1,045 million, with US$1,324 million of undrawn but committed facilities available subject to the Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA 
covenant compliance.
 
The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, having taken account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months 
from the date of this report and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Basis of presentation
The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 are prepared in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements have  
been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments and share-based payments which are 
measured at fair value. 
The accounting policies set out in Note 2 have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2013. 
New and amended standards adopted by the entity
IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine
In October 2011, the IASB issued IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine. IFRIC 20 provides 
guidance on the accounting for the costs of stripping activities during the production phase of a mine. When the benefit from  
the stripping activity is the improved access to a component of the ore body in future periods, the stripping costs in excess  
of the average ore to waste ratio for the life of mine of that component are recognised as a non-current asset. After initial 
recognition, the stripping activity asset is depreciated on a systematic basis (unit-of-production method) over the expected  
useful life of the identified component of the ore body made accessible as a result of the stripping activity.
 
The Group has adopted IFRIC 20 retrospectively according to the transitional provisions, and the 2012 results have been  
restated accordingly. Prior to adoption of IFRIC 20, the Group’s accounting policy was to expense all the production stripping 
costs as incurred therefore at 1 January 2012 there were no deferred stripping assets on the Group’s balance sheet, and  
no restatement was required at that date. 
 
The adoption of IFRIC 20 has resulted in capitalisation of certain waste stripping costs within property, plant and equipment  
and a reduction in cost of sales and metal inventories in the year ended 31 December 2012. For further detail of the effect  
on the Group financial statements the year ended 31 December 2012 please refer to Note 35.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income
The amendments to IAS 1 impact the Group’s statement of comprehensive income by requiring the grouping of items  
presented in other comprehensive income based on whether or not they will be reclassified to profit or loss in future. 
Adoption of the amendment did not impact earnings per share.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The amendments to IFRS 7 require entities to disclose information about rights of offset and related agreements for financial 
instruments under an enforceable master netting agreement or similar arrangements. 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IFRS 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value when such measurements are required or permitted  
by other standards. The application of IFRS 13 has not materially affected the fair value measurements carried out by the  
Group. IFRS 13 also requires specific disclosures on fair values, some of which replace existing disclosure requirements  
in other standards, including IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. The additional disclosure requirements are reflected 
within the relevant notes to the financial statements.
Changes in accounting estimates
From 1 January 2013, the Group began to use JORC as opposed to GKZ reserves as the basis for the unit-of-production 
depreciation calculations as management believes this revised basis better reflects the long-term mine plans which are  
also being prepared based on JORC reserves estimates. The impact on the total depreciation charge for the year ended 
31 December 2013 was an increase of US$40 million.
Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted
The following new, amended or revised IFRS accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted are not expected  
to have a significant impact on the Group:
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements  
that addresses accounting for consolidated financial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities.  
IFRS 10 provides a single basis for consolidation with a new definition of control. The standard applies to annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014 for companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the EU.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities – Non-monetary 
Contributions by Venturers. Under IFRS 11 a joint arrangement is classified as either a joint operation or a joint venture, and  
the option to proportionately consolidate joint ventures has been removed. Interests in joint ventures must be equity accounted.  
This standard applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 for companies reporting under IFRS as adopted  
by the EU. Financial statements 112/113

1. General continued 
IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities will accompany IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. This standard combines the disclosure 
requirements previously covered by IAS 27 , related to consolidated financial statements, IAS 31 Interest in Joint Ventures and  
IAS 28 Investments in Associates, as well as including additional disclosure requirements. This standard applies to annual  
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 for companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Amendments have been made to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and it has been reissued  
as IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements. The revised standard prescribes the accounting and disclosure requirements  
for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates when an entity prepares separate financial statements.  
The accounting and disclosure requirements for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in consolidated 
financial statements are prescribed by IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12. The revised standard is to be applied for annual  
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 for companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the EU. 
Amendments have been made to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and it has been reissued as IAS 28 Investments  
in Associates and Joint Ventures. The revised standard prescribes the application of the equity method when accounting  
for investments in associates and joint ventures. The revised standard is to be applied for annual periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2014 for companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments – Presentation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and,  
if applicable, special purpose entities, from the date that control effectively commenced until the date that control effectively 
ceased. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity  
so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies  
into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group balances, transactions and any unrealised profits or losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated  
on consolidation.
Changes to the Group’s ownership interests that do not result in a loss of control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as 
equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change 
in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted 
and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Parent.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on the disposal is calculated as the difference between  
1) the aggregated fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and 2) the previous  
carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and non-controlling interests.
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion  
of the fair values of net assets recognised at acquisition. Thereafter, a share of the profit or loss for the financial year and other 
movements in the net assets or liabilities of the subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interests as shown in the income 
statement and balance sheet.
Business combinations
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination.  
When acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed constitute an integrated set of activities, whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed  
as a business by a market participant, and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination, using the guidance 
provided in the standard. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for  
each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred  
or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs  
are recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred. Transaction costs incurred in connection with the  
business combination are expensed. Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition may include an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration 
transferred in a business combination. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition 
retrospectively with the corresponding adjustment against goodwill where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. 
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement 
period about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The measurement period may not exceed one  
year from the effective date of the acquisition. The subsequent accounting for contingent consideration that does not qualify  
for as a measurement period adjustment is based on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration  
that is classified as equity is not subsequently remeasured. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or liability  
is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent  
Assets or IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement with the corresponding amount being recognised  
in profit or loss.
The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
•	 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised  
and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits, respectively;
•	liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment 
arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured  
in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment at the acquisition date; and
•	assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale  
and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured 
to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised  
in the consolidated income statement. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have 
previously been recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest 
was disposed of.
Goodwill and goodwill impairment
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests  
in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the 
acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, 
the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest  
in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill  
is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised  
for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Acquisition of mining licences
The acquisition of mining licences is often effected through a non-operating corporate entity. As these entities do not represent  
a business, it is considered that the transactions do not meet the definition of a business combination and, accordingly,  
the transaction is accounted for as the acquisition of an asset. The net assets acquired are accounted for at cost.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 
venture. Significant influence constitutes the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee 
but does not extend to a control or joint control over the enactment of those policies. The results and assets and liabilities  
of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Financial statements 114/115

2. Significant accounting policies continued 
Equity method of accounting
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity (investee) is initially recognised in the 
consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income of the investee. When the Group’s share of the losses of an associate exceeds the Group’s interest  
in that entity, the Group ceases to recognise its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent  
that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of an investee at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying 
amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and  
contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The requirements of IAS 39 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect  
to the Group’s investments. Where an indicator of impairment exists or the carrying value of the asset contains goodwill with  
an indefinite useful life, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance 
with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (IAS 36) as a single cash generating unit through the comparison of its recoverable amount 
(the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms  
part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36.
When a Group entity transacts with its investees, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the investee are 
recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not related  
to the Group.
Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment  
in which it operates. For all Russian entities the functional currency is the Russian Rouble (RUB), as well as for the investment 
holding companies, including Polymetal International plc. The functional currency of the Group’s entity located in Kazakhstan 
(JSC Varvarinskoye) and operating with significant degree of autonomy is the Kazakh Tenge (KZT).
The Group has chosen to present its consolidated financial statements in US Dollars (US$), as management believes  
it is a more convenient presentation currency for international users of the consolidated financial statements of the Group  
as it is a common presentation currency in the mining industry. The translation of the financial statements of the Group  
entities from their functional currencies to the presentation currency is performed as follows:
•	all assets and liabilities are translated at closing exchange rates at each reporting period end date;
•	all income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the periods presented, except for significant 
transactions that are translated at rates on the date of such transactions;
•	resulting exchange differences are included in equity and presented as movements relating to the effect of translation  
to the Group’s presentation currency within the Translation reserve; and
•	 in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash balances at the beginning and end of each reporting period presented  
are translated using exchange rates prevalent at those respective dates. All cash flows in the period are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the periods presented, except for significant transactions that are translated at rates on the date  
of transaction.
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving 
loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a jointly controlled 
entity that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes  
a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable  
to the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.
In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, 
the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised 
in the consolidated income statement. For all other partial disposals (i.e. reductions in the Group’s ownership interest in associates 
or jointly controlled entities that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share  
of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets and liabilities acquired arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each 
reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity.
Exchange rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements were as follows:
31 December
2013
31 December
2012
Russian Rouble/US Dollar
Year end 32.73 30.37
Average for the year 31.85 30.09
Kazakh Tenge/US Dollar
Year end 153.61 150.74
Average for the year 152.14 149.11
The Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge are not freely convertible currencies outside the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan 
and, accordingly, any translation of Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge denominated assets and liabilities into US Dollar for the 
purpose of the presentation of consolidated financial statements does not imply that the Group could or will in the future realise 
or settle in US Dollars the translated values of these assets and liabilities.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currencies (foreign currencies) are recorded at the exchange rates 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated  
at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Non monetary items carried at historical cost are translated at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Non-monetary items carried at fair value are translated at the exchange  
rate prevailing on the date on which the most recent fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising from changes  
in exchange rates are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Mining assets
Mining assets and leases include the cost of acquiring and developing mining assets and mineral rights. Mining assets are 
depreciated to their residual values using the unit-of-production method based on proven and probable ore reserves according 
to the JORC Code, which is the basis on which the Group’s mine plans are prepared. Changes in proven and probable reserves 
are dealt with prospectively. Depreciation is charged on new mining ventures from the date that the mining asset is capable  
of commercial production. In respect of those mining assets whose useful lives are expected to be less than the life of the mine, 
depreciation over the period of the asset’s useful life is applied. 
Capital construction-in-progress assets are measured at cost less any recognised impairment. Depreciation commences  
when the assets are ready for their intended use. Mineral exploration and evaluation costs, including geophysical, topographical, 
geological and similar types of costs, are capitalised if management concludes that future economic benefits are likely  
to be realised and determines that economically viable extraction operation can be established as a result of exploration  
activities and internal assessment of mineral resources.
Non-mining assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When parts  
of an item of property, plant and equipment are considered to have different useful lives, they are accounted for and depreciated 
separately. Depreciation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Estimated useful lives are as set out below:
Machinery and equipment Up to 20 years
Transportation and other assets Up to 10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal  
with the asset’s carrying amount at the date. The gain or loss arising is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Stripping costs
When it has been determined that a mining asset can be economically developed as a result of established proven and probable 
reserves, the costs to remove any overburden and other waste materials to initially expose the ore body, referred to as stripping 
costs, are capitalised as a part of mining assets.
During the production phase of a mine when the benefit from the stripping activity is the improved access to a component  
of the ore body in future periods, the stripping costs in excess of the average ore to waste ratio for the life of mine of that 
component are recognised as a non-current asset. After initial recognition, the stripping activity asset is depreciated  
on a systematic basis (unit-of-production method) over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore  
body made accessible as a result of the stripping activity. Financial statements 116/117

Estimated ore reserves
Estimated proven and probable ore reserves reflect the economically recoverable quantities which can be legally  
recovered in the future from known mineral deposits. The Group’s reserves are estimated in accordance with JORC Code.
Leases
Finance leases
Leases under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Assets subject to finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment at the lower of fair value or present value  
of future minimum lease payments at the date of acquisition, with the related lease obligation recognised at the same value.  
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their estimated economic useful lives or over the term of the lease,  
if shorter. If there is reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the period  
of expected use is useful life of the asset.
Finance lease payments are calculated using the effective interest rate method, and allocated between the lease finance cost, 
which is included in finance cost, and the capital repayment, which reduces the related lease liability payable to the lessor.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals  
arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
An impairment review of property, plant and equipment is carried out when there is an indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the estimated recoverable 
amount of the asset in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which  
the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.  
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised  
as an expense immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased  
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed  
the original carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately.
Inventories
Metal inventories
Inventories including refined metals, metals in concentrate and in process, doré and ore stock piles are stated at the lower  
of production cost or net realisable value. Production cost is determined as the sum of the applicable expenditures and 
expenses incurred directly or indirectly in bringing inventories to their existing condition and location. Refined metals are valued  
at the average total cost of production per saleable unit of metal. Work in-process, metal concentrate and doré are valued  
at the average total production costs at each asset’s relevant stage of production. Ore stock piles are valued at the average  
cost of mining that ore. Where ore stock piles are not expected to be processed within 12 months, those inventories are 
classified as non-current.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for that product based on prevailing spot metal prices, less estimated 
costs to complete production and selling costs.
Consumables and spare parts
Consumables and spare parts are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average 
moving cost. The portion of consumables and spare parts not reasonably expected to be used within one year is classified  
as a long-term asset in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price  
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable  
to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate,  
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair  
value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Financial Instruments Designated as Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
A financial instrument other than a financial instrument held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
•	 such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise  
arise; or
•	 the financial instrument forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment 
strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
•	it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition  
and Measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial instruments at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit  
or loss. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 30.
Effective interest rate method
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating interest 
income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts  
or payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction 
costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter 
period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: FVTPL, available for sale (AFS) financial 
assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and  
is determined at the time of initial recognition. No financial instruments have been classified as available for sale.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for financial instruments other than those financial assets classified  
as at FVTPL.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is determined by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition  
of interest would be immaterial.
AFS financial assets
Investments other than those classified as held for trading, held-to-maturity or loans and receivables are classified as available  
for sale financial assets. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and unrealised gains and losses are recognised  
in equity until the investment is disposed or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity  
is included in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. 
For equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost  
is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
•	significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
•	 breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
•	 it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation; or
•	 the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties. Financial statements 118/119

2. Significant accounting policies continued 
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognised is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective 
interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception  
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable  
is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and 
the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment 
at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment  
not been recognised.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when  
it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, 
the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise  
the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest  
rate method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they 
expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and  
payable is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to certain risks. Further details  
of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 30.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the 
timing of the recognition in the consolidated income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics 
are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the hybrid contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets  
is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three 
months or fewer, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation  
at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured 
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Environmental obligations
An obligation to incur environmental restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs arises when disturbance is caused  
by the development or ongoing production of mining assets. Such costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other 
site preparation work, discounted to their net present value using a risk-free rate applicable to the future cash flows, are provided 
for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement over the life of the operation, through the depreciation of the asset in the cost of sales line 
and the unwinding of the discount on the provision in the finance costs line. Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage 
which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and recognised in the 
consolidated income statement as extraction progresses.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work (that result from 
changes in the estimated timing or amount of the cash flow or a change in the discount rate), are added to or deducted from the 
cost of the related asset in the current period. If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess  
is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
The provision for closure cost obligations is remeasured at the end of each reporting period for changes in estimates and 
circumstances. Changes in estimates and circumstances include changes in legal or regulatory requirements, increased 
obligations arising from additional mining and exploration activities, changes to cost estimates and changes to the risk free 
interest rate.
Employee benefit obligations
Remuneration paid to employees in respect of services rendered during a reporting period is recognised as an expense in that 
reporting period. The Group pays mandatory contributions to the state social funds, including the Pension Fund of the Russian 
Federation and Kazakhstan, which are expensed as incurred.
 
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Income taxes are computed  
in accordance with the laws of countries where the Group operates.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated 
income statement because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods  
and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have  
been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities  
in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible 
temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected  
to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent  
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability  
is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end  
of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow 
from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount  
of its assets and liabilities. Financial statements 120/121

2. Significant accounting policies continued 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against  
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends  
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when they relate to items that are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred 
tax also recognised in consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current  
tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting  
for the business combination.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived principally from the sale of gold and silver bullions and copper, gold and silver concentrate and is measured 
at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts.
Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion and sale of copper, gold and silver concentrate is recognised when the risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer, the Group retains neither a continuing degree of involvement nor control over 
the goods sold, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with 
the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion represents the invoiced value of metal 
shipped to the buyer, net of value added tax (VAT).
Sale of gold and silver bullion
The Group processes doré produced in the Russian Federation (at Dukat, Khakanja, Voro, Omolon, and Amursk-Albazino)  
into London Good Delivery Bars prior to sale. This final stage of processing is carried out on a toll-treatment basis at four 
state-owned refineries. The Group sells gold and silver bullion to banks through long-term agreements. The sales price,  
as determined in the agreement, may be variable based upon the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) spot price  
or fixed. But the Group’s policy is not to enter into fixed price contracts. For domestic sales, title passes from the Group to the 
purchaser at the refinery gate with revenue recognised at that point. For export sales, once the gold and/or silver bars have been 
approved for export by Russian customs, they are then transported to the vault of the purchaser, which is typically located  
in London. Title passes and revenue is recognised at the point when the gold and/or silver bars are received by the purchaser.
Sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate
The Group sells copper, gold and silver concentrate under pricing arrangements where final prices are determined by quoted 
market prices in a period subsequent to the date of sale. Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on forward prices  
for the expected date of final settlement. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment, which is also when risks and rewards 
pass to the buyer. Revenue is calculated based on the copper, gold and silver content in the concentrate and using the forward 
London Bullion Market Association (LMBA) or London Metal Exchange (LME) price to the estimated final pricing date, adjusted 
for the specific terms of the relevant agreement. Until final settlement occurs, adjustments to revenue are made to take into 
account the changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay. Revenue is presented net of refining and 
treatment charges which are subtracted in calculating the amount to be invoiced
The Group’s sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate are based on a provisional price and as such, contain an embedded 
derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable 
from the sale of the concentrate at the forward exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not 
qualify for hedge accounting, is measured at FVTPL with changes in its fair value recognised within revenue in the consolidated 
income statement for each period prior to the final settlement.
Share-based compensation
The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to its accounting for share-based compensation. IFRS 2 requires companies 
to recognise compensation costs for share-based payments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded in 2010 was calculated by the Group at the grant date using  
the two-stage Monte-Carlo simulation model. The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period  
of the awards. No other share based payment awards were issued by the Group during the year ended 31 December 2013. 
The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as a general, administrative and selling expense over the vesting period with  
a corresponding increase in the share-based compensation reserve. Upon the exercise of the awards, the proceeds received, 
net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to the stated capital account, and the amounts recognised within 
the share-based compensation reserve transferred to retained earnings.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share calculations are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method, whereby the proceeds from the potential exercise  
of dilutive stock options with exercise prices that are below the average market price of the underlying shares are assumed  
to be used in purchasing the Company’s common shares at their average market price for the period.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that management has  
made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in consolidated financial statements.
Production start date
The Group assesses the stage of each mine or plant construction project to determine when an asset moves into the 
commercial production stage. The criteria used to assess the start date are determined by the unique nature of each 
construction project and include factors such as the complexity of a plant and its location.
The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the mine is substantially complete and ready  
for its intended use and moves into the production stage. Criteria considered but are not limited to the following:
•	 the level of capital expenditure incurred compared to the construction cost estimates;
•	the completion of a sufficient level of testing on the mine plant and equipment;
•	 the ability to produce gold, silver or copper in saleable form (within specifications); and
•	 the ability to sustain ongoing commercial levels of production.
When a construction project moves into the commercial production stage and depreciation commences, the capitalisation  
of certain mine construction costs and interest ceases and costs are either regarded as inventory or expensed, except  
for capitalisable costs related to mining asset additions or improvements, underground mine development or ore  
reserve development.
The Omolon Merrill-Crowe plant achieved commercial production in April 2012.
Amursk POX achieved commercial production in November 2012.
The Mayskoye plant and underground mine reached commercial production in April 2013.
Acquisitions
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination.  
When acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed constitute an integrated set of activities and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination,  
using the guidance provided in the standard. In making this determination, management evaluates the inputs, processes  
and outputs of the asset or entity acquired. 
As a result of this evaluation process, management has determined that its 2012 acquisitions of Olcha, Semchenskoye and 
Svetlobor did not meet the definition of a business combination and as such the Group has accounted for these transactions  
as asset acquisitions (see Note 4). 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
The determination of estimates requires judgements which are based on historical experience, current and expected economic 
conditions, and all other available information. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end  
of the reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial period.
The most significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to:
•	 fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations;
•	 ore reserve estimates;
•	depreciation;
•	impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment;
•	 stock piles and work in-process;
•	 s ha r e - b a s e d c om p e n s a t i o n ;
•	 e n v i r o nm e n t a l obl i g a t i o n s ;
•	 c o n t i ng e nc i e s ; a nd
•	income taxes. Financial statements 122/123

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued 
Fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations
In accordance with the Group’s policy, the Group allocates the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed based on their fair values as estimated on the date of acquisition. Any difference between the cost of the acquired 
entity and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Group exercises significant 
judgement in the process of identifying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, valuing these assets and liabilities, and 
estimating their remaining useful lives. The valuation of these assets and liabilities is based on assumptions and criteria that,  
in some cases, include management’s estimates of discounted future cash flows. 
If actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions considered, the Group may have to adjust its estimates of the 
fair values of assets and liabilities recognised and the goodwill balance during the measurement period. Such a remeasurement 
could have an impact on the amounts reported in the consolidated income statement in current and future periods.
Ore reserve estimates
An ore reserve estimate is an estimate of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s 
properties. Ore reserve estimates are used by the Group in the calculation of: depletion of mining assets using the units-of-
production method; impairment charges and in forecasting the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land restoration 
costs. Also, for the purpose of impairment review and the assessment of the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land 
restoration costs, management may take into account mineral resources in addition to ore reserves where there is a high degree 
of confidence that such resources will be extracted.
In order to calculate ore reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about geological, technical and economic factors, 
including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, 
commodity prices, discount rates and exchange rates. Estimating the quantity and/or grade of ore reserves requires the size, 
shape and depth of ore bodies to be determined by analysing geological data such as the logging and assaying of drill samples. 
This process may require complex and difficult geological judgements and calculations to interpret the data.
Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period as additional geological data becomes available during the course  
of operations or if there are changes in any of the aforementioned assumptions. Such changes in estimated reserves may affect 
the Group’s financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including the following:
•	asset carrying values due to changes in estimated future cash flows;
•	 depletion charged in the consolidated income statement where such charges are determined by using the  
units-of-production method;
•	 provisions for decommissioning and land restoration costs where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations  
about the timing of the payment of such costs; and
•	carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities where changes in estimated reserves affect the carrying value  
of the relevant assets and liabilities.
Depreciation
Mining assets are depreciated using the units-of-production method except where the useful lives of the assets are shorter  
than the life of mine. The units-of-production depreciation calculations are based on proved and probable reserves under  
the JORC Code (JORC), which is the basis on which the Group’s mine plans are prepared as the useful lives of these assets  
are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. For other property, plant and equipment, the straight-line method  
is applied over the estimated useful life of the asset which does not exceed the estimated mine life. 
The calculation of the units-of-production rate of depreciation could be impacted to the extent that actual production  
in the future is different from current forecast production based on proved and probable ore reserves. This would generally  
arise when there are significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in estimating ore reserves.
Impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment
The Group considers both external and internal sources of information in assessing whether there are any indications that 
goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment owned by the Group are impaired. External sources of 
information the Group considers include: changes in the market and economic and legal environment in which the Group 
operates, that are not within its control and that affect the recoverable amount of goodwill, mining assets or other property,  
plant and equipment.
Internal sources of information the Group considers include the manner in which mining properties, plant and equipment are 
being used or expected to be used and indications of economic performance of the assets. In determining the recoverable 
amounts of the Group’s mining assets and other property, plant and equipment, the Group’s management determines the fair 
value less costs to sell by estimating the discounted future after-tax cash flows expected to be derived from the Group’s mining 
properties, costs to sell the mining properties and the appropriate post-tax discount rate. Reductions in metal price forecasts, 
increases in estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount  
of recoverable reserves and resources and/or adverse current economics can result in a write-down of the carrying amounts  
of the Group’s goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment.
In making the assessment for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are allocated to an appropriate 
cash-generating unit. Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets that do not generate independent  
cash inflows to appropriate cash-generating units, and also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash flows within  
the value-in-use calculation. Subsequent changes to the cash-generating unit allocation or to the timing of cash flows could 
impact the carrying value of the respective assets.
Stock piles and work in-process
In determining mine operating costs recognised in the consolidated income statement, the Group’s management makes 
estimates of quantities of ore stacked on leach pads and in process and the recoverable gold and silver in this material  
to determine the average costs of finished goods sold during the period. Changes in these estimates can result in a change  
in mine operating costs of future periods and carrying amounts of inventories. At 31 December 2013 the carrying value  
of the ore stock piles was US$194 million and work in-process was US$78 million.
Share-based compensation
In November 2010, the Group issued equity-settled share appreciation rights to certain employees. Equity-settled share 
appreciation rights are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the awards is expensed as services are rendered over the vesting period, based  
on the Group’s estimate of the rights that will eventually vest.
The fair value of share-based compensation was measured using the Monte-Carlo two-stage simulation model. The expected  
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioral considerations. The awards include an option, exercisable at the discretion of the participant,  
to defer the measurement period by one year from June 2013 to June 2014. For further details see Note 33.
As at 31 December 2013, all options issued are fully vested and no unrecognised share-based compensation expense  
remains. No other share based payment awards were issued by the Group during the year ended 31 December 2013.
Environmental obligations
The Group’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the 
environment. The Group’s provision for future decommissioning and land restoration cost represents management’s best 
estimate of the present value of the future cash outflows required to settle the liability which reflects estimates of future costs, 
inflation, movements in foreign exchange rates and assumptions of risks associated with the future cash outflows; and the 
applicable interest rate for discounting the future cash outflows. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ materially 
from the estimates. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations, life of mine estimates and discount  
rates could affect the carrying amount of this provision.
Contingencies
By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment  
of such contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgements and estimates of the outcome of future events.
Income Taxes and Mining Taxes
The Group is subject to income tax and mining taxes in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Mining taxes do not meet  
the definition of a tax under IAS 12 Income taxes. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for these taxes  
due to the complexity of legislation. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination  
is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes, 
penalties and interest will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially 
recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination  
is made.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The estimation of that probability includes 
judgements based on the expected performance. Various factors are considered in order to assess the probability of the future 
utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plan, expiration of tax losses carried forward,  
and tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from these estimates or if these estimates must be adjusted in future periods, 
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected. Financial statements 124/125

4. Acquisitions and disposals
(a) Business combinations and asset acquisitions
Olymp Ltd.
On 24 January 2013 the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of Olymp Ltd., a Russian legal entity holding the mining  
and exploration licence for the Olcha gold-silver deposit in exchange for 775,000 new ordinary shares in Polymetal. 
Olymp Ltd. does not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus it is accounted for as an acquisition of  
a group of assets. The Group purchased mineral rights at cost of US$13.4 million and other current liabilities of $(0.01) million.
ZAO ‘Maminskaya Gornorudnaya kompania’
On 20 February 2013 the Group entered into a binding memorandum of understanding with Vitalex Investments Ltd and 
Arrowline Investments Ltd to acquire a 100% interest in ZAO ‘Maminskaya Gornorudnaya kompania’ (‘MGK’), which holds  
an exploration and mining licence for the Maminskoye gold mining field (‘Maminskoye’). 
On 9 April 2013 the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the ordinary share capital and debt in MGK. The consideration 
for the equity investment was US$3.9 million payable in cash and 5,491,661 of Polymetal’s ordinary shares valued at the 
acquisition date at US$74.6 million. The debt investment in MGK was acquired for consideration payable in cash and equalling  
its carrying value of US$8.0 million.
MGK meets the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus it was accounted for at fair value using the  
acquisition method. 
The allocation of the purchase price based on the consideration paid and the fair value of the assets acquired was as follows:
US$’000
Net assets acquired
Mineral rights 115,127
Property, plant and equipment 2,952
Non-current liabilities (9,896)
Deferred tax liability (23,025)
Other assets, net 1,400
Net assets acquired 86,558
Consideration:
Fair value of shares issued in Polymetal International plc 74,624
Cash consideration for equity investment 3,900
Cash consideration for debt investment 8,034
Total consideration 86,558
In the prior year, the following transactions took place:
Veduga 
On 7 February 2012 the Group completed the acquisition from AngloGold Ashanti Holdings PLC (AngloGold) of AngloGold’s 
50% interest in various companies held in joint venture with Polymetal comprising the AngloGold Ashanti – Polymetal Strategic 
Alliance for US$20 million. It subsequently entered into a series of transactions with new investors (unrelated parties), retaining  
a 42.65% economic interest in the principal asset – the Veduga licence. See Note 21 for further information.
Semchenskoye Zoloto
On 22 August 2012 the Group acquired 100% interest in ‘Semchenskoye Zoloto LLC’ (Semchenskoye Zoloto) from Suntsov V.A. 
(25% interest) and Polister Limited (75% interest), both unrelated parties. Semchenskoye Zoloto holds the exploration licence  
for Semchenskoye field in Karelia. The Group paid cash consideration of US$0.8 million; in addition, a contingent consideration 
of US$0.5 million is payable by the Group in case the exploration of the licence area proves to be successful and the mining 
licence for the new gold deposit is received before 25 December 2014. Another US$1.2 million is payable depending on the level  
of proved and probable ore reserves of the new deposit. 
After evaluation of the possible outcome of the contingency, the Group estimated fair value of the contingent consideration  
to be US$0.1 million.
Semchenskoye Zoloto does not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008), thus it was accounted  
for as an acquisition of a group of assets. The Group purchased mineral rights of US$0.8 million and other current liabilities  
of US$0.024 million.
Svetlobor
On 17 December 2012, the Group acquired 24.99% interest in JSC Nevyansk Group (NG), a Russian legal entity whose  
wholly-owned subsidiary holds a mining and exploration licence for the Svetlobor area. The Group issued consideration  
in the form of 130,053 new ordinary shares in the Company. Simultaneously, CJSC VTB Capital (VTB) purchased a 75.01% 
stake in NG in exchange for 390,369 new Polymetal ordinary shares, which were subscribed for by a subsidiary of VTB  
for a total cash consideration of US$6.9 million. 
 
The Group also entered into legally binding agreement to acquire the 75.01% stake in NG from VTB, as soon as this transaction 
is approved by the Government Commission on Monitoring of Foreign Investments, for cash consideration of US$6.9 million, 
plus any interest accrued on this amount at a rate of 7.25% per annum.
 
The Group determined 17 December 2012 to be the date when it obtained control over NG, and consolidated the acquiree from 
that date. The cash received from VTB has been accounted for as a loan and included within borrowings (Note 26). NG does  
not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) and this transaction has been treated as an acquisition of assets.  
The allocation of the consideration paid to the assets acquired was as follows:
 
US$’000
Net assets acquired 
Mineral rights 9,449 
Other assets 299 
Other liabilities (11)
Net assets acquired 9,737 
Consideration: 
Fair value of shares issued 9,737 
(b) Disposal of subsidiary
Habarovsk Exploration Company LLC
On 22 October 2013 the Group sold its subsidiary Habarovsk Exploration Company LLC for US$3.5 million in deferred cash 
consideration to an unrelated party. The loss on disposal was calculated as follows:
US$’000
Property, plant and equipment 7,124
Other non-current assets 1,395
Current assets 4,374
Current liabilities (598)
Non-current liabilities (10,121)

5. Segment information
The Group has seven reportable segments:
•	 Voro (CJSC Gold of Northern Urals);
•	 Khakanja (LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company);
•	Dukat (CJSC Magadan Silver; Olymp LLC);
•	 Omolon (Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC);
•	Varvara (JSC Varvarinskoye);
•	Amursk-Albazino (Albazino Resources Ltd, Amursk Hydrometallurgical Plant LLC); and
•	Mayskoye (Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC).
Reportable segments are determined based on the Group’s internal management reports and are separated based on the 
Group’s geographical structure. Minor companies and activities (management, exploration, purchasing and other companies) 
which do not meet the reportable segment criteria are disclosed within corporate and other segment. Each segment is engaged 
in gold, silver or copper mining and related activities, including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. The Group’s 
segments are all based in the Russian Federation, except for Varvara which is based in Kazakhstan.
The measure which management and the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the CODM) use to evaluate the performance  
of the Group is segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortization, 
impairment of non-current assets, write-downs of inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation expenses, 
rehabilitation expenses, gains or losses arising on acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries, foreign exchange gains or losses, 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs, income tax expenses and other tax 
exposure accrued within other operating expenses. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent  
with those of the Group’s accounting policies under IFRS as described in Note 2.
Revenue shown as corporate and other comprises, principally, intersegment revenue relating to the supply of inventories,  
spare parts and fixed assets, and rendering management services to the Group’s production entities. Intersegment revenue  
is recognised based on costs incurred plus a fixed margin basis. External revenue shown within corporate and other represents 
revenue from services provided to third parties by the Group’s non-mining subsidiaries. 
Business segment current assets and liabilities, other than current inventory, are not reviewed by the CODM and therefore  
are not disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.
The segment Adjusted EBITDA reconciles to the profit before income tax as follows:

7. Cost of sales excluding write-downs of metal inventories to net realisable value continued 
Mining tax is a royalty payable in Russian Federation and Kazakhstan which is calculated based on the value of the precious 
metals extracted in the period. This value is usually determined based on the realised selling price of precious metals or, in case  
if there were no sales during the period, cost of sales of metals extracted (Russian Federation) or the average market price 
(Kazakhstan) during the period. 
Mining tax in respect of the metal inventories produced during the year is recognised within cost of sales, while the additional 
mining tax accruals in respect of various disputes with tax authorities are recognised within other expenses (see Note 12).

Total income tax expense 40,417  222,868 
The actual tax expense differs from the amount which would have been determined by applying the statutory rate of 20%  
for the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan to profit before income tax as a result of the application of relevant jurisdictional tax 
regulations, which disallow certain deductions which are included in the determination of accounting profit. These deductions 
include share-based payment expenses, social related expenditures and other non-production costs, certain general and 
administrative expenses, financing expenses, foreign exchange related and other costs.
In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the Russian Federation  
and Kazakhstan. Out of the large operating companies of the Group, tax authorities have audited CJSC Gold of Northern Urals 
up to 2011, Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC, LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company CJSC and Mayskoye Gold 
Mining Company LLC up to 2010, CJSC Magadan Silver for the period up to 2009, JSC Varvarinskoye for the period up to 2010. 
According to Russian and Kazakhstan tax legislation, previously conducted audits do not fully exclude subsequent claims 
relating to the audited period. 
Income tax and other expenses arising in respect of lost litigation
At 31 December 2012
During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group provided for certain expenses and tax exposures in respect  
of lost litigation.
The additional income tax charges incurred in respect of litigations during the year ended 31 December 2012 total 
US$27 .5 million and comprised US$14.5 million paid out in respect of a case concerning Magadan Silver sales to ABN AMRO  
in 2007 and US$13.0 million in respect of cases relating to the deductibility of transportation and processing expenses and  
of foreign exchange losses in Varvara. Including US$5.1 million of additional income tax exposures provided for and 
US$17.1 million excess profit tax in Kazakhstan recognised for the first time in 2012, a total additional income tax  
expense of US$49.6 million was recognised in the year ended 31 December 2012. 
The Group also recognised mining taxes, interest and penalties totalling US$65.9 million which were recognised within  
Other Operating Expenses (see Note 12). These expenses comprised US$15.0 million paid out in respect of the Magadan  
Silver/ABN AMRO case, US$9.2 million provided for in respect of the Magadan Silver Mineral Extraction Tax case,  
US$10.1 million paid out in respect of Varvara litigation and US$31.6 million in respect of other exposures. 
At 31 December 2013
During the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group paid US$8.3 million of mining taxes, interest and penalties in respect  
of the Magadan Silver Mineral Extraction Tax case, US$17.1 million of Varvara Excess Profits Tax provided for in 2012 and 
US$7.3 million of various Varvara exposures. 
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2013, no additional significant income tax and mining tax exposures have  
been provided for.
Other exposures considered possible but not probable and therefore not provided for total to US$22.3 million 
(31 December 2012: US$3 million) and are described in Note 29.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is attributable to the temporary differences that exist between the carrying amounts of assets  
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.

16. Income tax continued 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. The following analysis 
shows deferred tax balances presented for financial reporting purposes:

Deferred tax liabilities (63,085) (82,760)
Deferred tax assets 88,484 58,024 
Total  25,399  (24,736)
Tax losses carried forward represent amounts available for offset against future taxable income generated by JSC Omolon Gold 
Mining Company, ZK Mayskoye LLC, Albazino Resources LLC, Amursk Hydrometallurgy Plant LLC and the Company during the 
period up to 2023. Each legal entity within the Group represents a separate tax-paying component for income tax purposes.  
The tax losses of one entity cannot be used to reduce taxable income of other entities of the Group. As at 31 December 2013 
and 31 December 2012 the aggregate tax losses carried forward were US$426.8 million (RUB13.9 billion) and US$288.1 million 
(RUB 8.8 billion), respectively.
The Group believes that recoverability of the recognized deferred tax asset (DTA) of US$88.5 million at 31 December 2013  
is more likely than not based upon expectations of future taxable income in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan and 
available tax planning strategies.
Losses incurred in certain taxable entities in recent years have created a history of losses as of 31 December 2013. The Group 
has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to overcome the recent history of losses based on forecasts of sufficient taxable 
income in the carry-forward period.
The Group’s estimate of future taxable income is based on established proven and probable reserves which can be 
economically developed. The related detailed mine plans and forecasts provide sufficient supporting evidence that the  
Group will generate taxable earnings to be able to fully realise its net DTA even under various stressed scenarios. The amount  
of the DTA considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during  
the carry forward period are reduced due to delays in production start dates, decreases in ore reserve estimates, increases  
in environmental obligations, or reductions in precious metal prices. The Group’s tax losses carried forward expire as follows:

31 December 2023 176,034
Total loss carried forward for tax purposes 426,858
The deferred tax liabilities for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group subsidiaries have 
not been recognised as the Group has determined that the undistributed profit of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the 
foreseeable future. The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, for which deferred tax liabilities have 
not been recognised, amount to US$1,802 million (2012: US$1,712 million).
17. Dividends
A final dividend has been proposed in relation to the year of 8 cents per share giving a total expected dividend  
of US$31.2 million. This is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has therefore  
not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
 
On 23 September 2013 an interim dividend of 1 cent per share was paid to shareholders by the Company resulting in cash 
outflows of US$3.9 million. 
On 17 June 2013 a final dividend for 2012 of 31 cents per share was paid to shareholders by the Company resulting in cash 
outflows of US$121.2 million. On 16 January 2013, a special dividend of 50 cents per share was paid to shareholders by the 
Company resulting in cash outflows of US$191.3 million.
On 14 June 2012 a final dividend for 2011 of 20 cents per share was paid to shareholders by the Company resulting in cash 
outflows of US$76.5 million.
18. Impairment losses
At 30 June 2013, due to significant decline in gold, silver and copper market prices in first quarter 2013, the Group carried  
out an impairment review of its property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other non-current assets. As a result of this review, 
total impairment charges of US$199.1 million were recognised as at 30 June 2013.
During second half of the year ended 31 December 2013 there was a stabilisation in gold, silver and copper market prices. 
Therefore, the impairment review was performed only for the Omolon cash generating unit, where individual impairment 
indicators exist due to downgrades in reserves and changes in the life of mine plan. As a result, a further impairment  
of US$12 million was recognised as at 31 December 2013.
In the view of management there are no indicators of impairment (or impairment reversal) for other cash generating units  
as at 31 December 2013 and no further impairment as at 31 December 2013 was recognised. 
Total impairment charges of US$213.4 million (2012: nil) recognised during the year ended 31 December 2013 comprise

Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment
Each cash generating unit is determined on the basis of Group’s geographical structure and equals to the Group’s reporting 
segments (refer to Note 5). The carrying amount of cash generating units excludes certain exploration assets included within  
the segment assets which are currently under development and have not reached a stage where there is enough information  
to estimate the future cash flows that might be eventually generated by the project. The following amounts are excluded from 
cash generating units carrying amounts: US$36.7 million. These were assessed for impairment separately.
The carrying amounts of all the cash-generating units were assessed against their recoverable amounts determined based  
on a fair value less costs to sell calculation. Fair value is based on the application of the Discounted Cash Flow Method (DCF) 
using post-tax cash flows. The DCF method is attributable to the development of proved and probable reserves and certain 
resources where a relevant resource-to-reserve conversion ratio can be reasonably applied.
The Group used a post-tax real discount rate of 7.1% (2012: 7.1%) in the DCF calculations which is equal to its nominal  
weighted average cost of capital of 9% (2012: 9%) translated into real terms. The DCF method used is based on the following key 
assumptions:
Commodity prices
Commodity prices are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked against external sources of information. In the 
impairment tests performed, the flat real long-term gold, silver and copper prices of US$1,200 per ounce, US$18 per ounce  
and US$7 ,000 per tonne, respectively, have been used to estimate future revenues. Financial statements 136/137

Proved and probable reserves and mineral resources
Production volumes are derived from the detailed long-term life of mine plans which are based on JORC proven and probable 
reserves and certain mineral resources (using a relevant resource-to-reserve conversion ratio) at the end of the period. 
Production costs
Production costs are based on management’s best estimates over the life of the mine, and reflect past experience.
Impairment of investment in associate
The Group has fully written off its investment in JSC Ural-Polymetal as the carrying values of the exploration assets this associate 
holds are not considered recoverable. In management’s view there are no indicators of a reversal as at 31 December 2013.

Mining assets at 31 December 2013 included mineral rights with net book value which amounted to US$376.3 million  
(31 December 2012: US$367.8 million). Mineral rights of the Group comprise assets acquired upon acquisition of subsidiaries 
and asset acquisitions.
IFRIC 20 was adopted from 1 January 2012 (see note 35). Comparative balance were restated to recognise stripping assets  
of US$56.3 million at 31 December 2012. At 31 December 2013 stripping costs of US$91.3 million have been capitalised  
within Mining assets.
Transfers from Capital construction in-progress to Mining assets during the year relate mainly to Mayskoye (transfers amounting 
to US$133 million), where assets reached commercial production in April 2013.
The additions and the disposals of property, plant and equipment in the year ended 31 December 2012 are shown net of 
US$67 .8 million of exploration and development assets recognised on acquisition of a controlling interest in Amikan Holding Ltd 
in February 2012 and subsequently derecognised on loss of control in that entity following its disposal in May 2012 (see Note 21).
No property, plant and equipment were pledged as collateral at 31 December 2013 or at 31 December 2012.
Impairment losses recognised during the year ended 31 December 2013
During the current year, as a result of significant gold, silver and copper market price declines below levels used in the  
Group’s 2012 impairment tests, the Group carried out a review of the recoverable amount of its property, plant and equipment. 
The review led to the recognition of impairment losses of US$125.1 million, which has been recognised in the income statement.

Impairment losses recognised during the year ended 31 December 2013
As a result of significant gold, silver and copper market prices decline below levels used in the Group’s 2012 annual  
impairment tests during the period ended 30 June 2013, the Group carried out a review of the recoverable amount of goodwill  
at 30 June 2013. The review led to the recognition of an impairment charge of US$76 million of goodwill, which has been 
recognised in the income statement. Refer to Note 18 for details.
During the second half of 2013 there was a stabilisation of gold, silver and copper market prices. In management’s view there are 
no indicators of impairment as of 31 December 2013 and no further impairment of goodwill at 31 December 2013 was recognised. 
Sensitivity analysis
For the cash-generating units where the goodwill was not fully impaired at 31 December 2013, being Dukat and Mayskoye, 
management has performed an analysis as to whether a reasonably possible adverse change to any of the key assumptions 
would lead to an impairment. 
The following scenarios were considered as reasonably possible and were used for this sensitivity analysis:
•	 5% simultaneous decrease in gold and silver prices over the life of mine;
•	5% increase in operating expenses over the life of mine; and 
•	0.5% increase in the discount rate applied. Financial statements 138/139

20. Goodwill continued
Each of the sensitivities above has been determined by assuming that the relevant key assumption moves in isolation, and 
without regard to potential mine plan changes and other management decisions which would be taken to respond to adverse 
changes in existing management projections.
An adverse change in a key assumption described above would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed  
the aggregate recoverable amount of the Dukat and Mayskoye cash-generating units.

Equity investment in Polygon Gold Inc.
Polygon Gold Inc. (‘Polygon’), a private shell company, was initially set up between Polymetal and Tyner Enterprises Inc.  
(‘Tyner’) who initially held 250 and 100 shares respectively in the new venture. Tyner is controlled and managed  
by Len Homeniuk, a non-executive Director of Polymetal International plc.
On 7 February 2012, the Company acquired AngloGold’s 50% equity interest and debt investments in the various joint venture 
companies held with Polymetal (Note 4). The principal company acquired was Amikan Holding Limited, which owns the Veduga 
gold deposit in the Krasnoyarsk region of the Russian Federation, with other entities acquired not holding any material assets  
or liabilities.
The total gain on acquisition of the remaining interest in the joint venture was US$21.1 million, comprising a US$12.7 million 
revaluation to fair value of previously held interest and a bargain purchase gain of US$8.4 million. The bargain purchase gain 
resulted from AngloGold Ashanti Limited strategic decision to exit the Russian Federation.
On 14 May 2012, Polymetal sold 100% of Amikan Holding Limited to Polygon in exchange for consideration of US$20 million  
in cash and 750 ordinary shares of Polygon. In addition, Sibproekt LLC (‘Sibproekt’), an unrelated local partner, provided  
a US$21 million loan to Polygon and received 100 newly issued Polygon shares for no consideration. This resulted in Polymetal 
holding an initial 81.8% equity ownership in Polygon. Under the new shareholder agreement, Polymetal obtained one of the  
four board seats giving it significant influence. The investment has been accordingly recognised as an investment in associate.
On 4 June 2012, Polygon’s share capital was increased to 1,571 shares by the issuance of 471 new shares to an affiliate of 
Gazprombank OJSC (‘Gazprombank’) for a total consideration of US$14.2 million paid in cash. The proceeds from the offering 
will be used to finance the Veduga project and repay part of Polygon’s debt. In addition, Gazprombank has expressed an interest 
in providing project financing to Polygon to develop Veduga into a producing mine.
On 7 June 2012, Polymetal sold 230 of its shares in Polygon to Sibproekt for a total consideration of US$8.0 million payable  
in cash, US$5 million of which was paid with US$3.0 million payable by 28 February 2013.
The Group’s equity ownership in Polygon Gold Inc. has now decreased to 42.65%. It continues to exercise significant influence 
over Polygon.
Equity investment in JSC Ural-Polymetal
At 1 January 2013 the group held 33.3% of JSC Ural-Polymetal, a Russian entity which holds an operating copper and zinc  
open pit mine and a processing plant. As a result of an impairment review performed as at 30 June 2013, the investment  
in JSC Ural-Polymetal was written off to nil (see Note 18). 
On 29 October 2013 the Group acquired an additional 16% interest in JSC Ural-Polymetal for $2.5 million, taking its share  
in the business to 49.9%. In management’s view it continues to hold significant influence in JSC Ural-Polymetal however  
it does not have the ability to exercise control. As a result of an impairment review performed at 31 December 2013 the additional 
investment in JSC Ural-Polymetal was also written off, as the project development is at an early stage and a new NPV estimate 
for the assets cannot be prepared at this stage. Therefore and consistently with the assumptions used as at 30 June 2013,  
full investment in Ural-Polymetal is written off.

After the related tax credit of US$30.7 million, the post-tax impairment charge is US$122.6 million.
Write-downs of metal inventories to net realisable value were recognised during the year ended 31 December 2013 in amount  
of US$153 million as a result of decline in gold, silver and copper prices. The key assumptions used as at 31 December 2013  
in determining net realisable value of inventories (including the commodity price assumptions) were consistent with the 
assumptions used in the impairment review of goodwill and non-current assets (see Note 18).
In addition, during the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group wrote-down US$4.6 million of costs (2012: US$5.6 million)  
in Omolon which did not significantly enhance the value of the ore stock piles.
During the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group provided for obsolete consumables and spare parts inventory in the amount 
of US$10.7 million (year ended 31 December 2012: reversal of US$3.3 million).
The amount of inventories held at net realisable value at 31 December 2013 is US$100.7 million (31 December 2012: US$7 million).

Trade receivables mainly relate to JSC Varvarinskoye for their sales of provisionally priced copper and gold concentrate,  
and to CJSC Magadan Silver and Albazino Resources Ltd for their sales of provisionally priced silver concentrate. Of the trade 
receivables balance as of 31 December 2013, US$12.5 million (2012: US$47.0 million) is due from one customer. There are  
no other customers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade receivables.
The average credit period on sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate at 31 December 2013 was 25 days (2012: 30 days).  
No interest is charged on trade receivables. The Group’s allowance for doubtful debt relates to its non-trade receivables.  
There are no trade receivables either past due or impaired as at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: US$nil).
Non-trade receivables include amounts receivable from sale of fuel or operating lease of machinery to contractors. The average 
credit period for non-trade receivables at 31 December 2013 was 36 days (2012: 93 days). No interest is charged on short term 
non-trade receivables.
Non-trade receivables disclosed above include those that are past due at the end of the reporting period for which  
the Group has not recognised a bad debt allowance because there has not been a significant change in credit quality  
and the amounts are still considered to be recoverable. Such past due but not impaired receivables amounted to  
US$4.7 million as at 31 December 2013 (2012: US$3.7 million). The Group does not hold any collateral or other security  
over these balances nor does it have a legal right of offset against any amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty.

Bank loans
The Group has a number of borrowing arrangements with various lenders. These borrowings consist of unsecured and secured 
loans and credit facilities denominated in Rubles, US Dollars, Euro and Canadian Dollars. Where security is provided it is in form 
of pledge of revenue from certain sales agreements.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group drew down a total of US$3,100 million and repaid US$2,887 million,  
a net drawdown of US$213 million. 
The Group secured new facilities in the year for a total amount of US$975 million with unrelated parties. These credit facilities  
are repayable between first quarter 2014 and fourth quarter 2018 and bear interest at a rate of between Libor +2.35%  
and Libor +3.05%.  Financial statements 142/143

26. Borrowings continued 
At 31 December 2013, the Group had undrawn borrowing facilities of US$1,324 million (31 December 2012: US$913 million).  
The Group complied with its debt covenants throughout 2013 and 2012. The table below summarises maturities of borrowings:

Amounts paid in the year (901) (1,479)
Translation effect (4,322) 2,970
Closing balance 65,364 66,693
 
Rehabilitation expenses relate to the increase of the environmental obligation which arises on production phase of mining 
activities. During the year ended 31 December 2013 rehabilitation expenses amounting to US$0.3 million (2012: US$1.1 million ) 
were removed from cost of production and capitalised through the application of IFRIC 20 (see note 35). 
The principal assumptions used for the estimation of environmental obligations were as follows:
 
2013 2012
Discount rates 5.78%-8.43% 3.74%-6.9%
Inflation rates 4.12%-5.77% 5.67%-7.21%
Expected mine closure dates 2-19 years 2-22 years
The Group does not hold any assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling environmental obligations.

In 2013, the average credit period for payables was 34 days (2012: 51 days). There was no interest charged on the outstanding 
payables balance during the credit period. The Group has financial risk management policies in place, which include budgeting 
and analysis of cash flows and payment schedules to ensure that all amounts payable are settled within the credit period.
29. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments
Capital commitments
The Group’s budgeted capital expenditure commitments as at 31 December 2013 amounted to US$22.3 million  
(2012: US$37 million).
Forward sale commitments
The Group has certain physical gold and silver forward sale commitments which are priced at the prevailing market price, 
calculated with reference to the LBMA or LME gold price, which are accounted for as executed as the Group expects to  
and has historically physically delivered into these contracts.
Operating leases: Group as a lessee
The land in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan on which the Group’s production facilities are located is owned  
by the state. The Group leases this land through operating lease agreements, which expire in various years through to 2058.
Future minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating lease agreements at the end of the period  
were as follows:

Contingencies
Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. 
Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transaction and activity of the companies of the Group may  
be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities and as a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest 
may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding 
the year of review. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
During 2012 and 2013 the Group has been involved in a number of litigations in Russia and in Kazakhstan. See Note 16  
for details of these cases and their outcomes. In addition to the cases detailed within Note 16, management has identified  
a total exposure (covering taxes and related interest and penalties) of US$22.3 million in respect of contingent liabilities  
(2012: US$3 million).
30. Fair value accounting
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition  
at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable as follows:
•	Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets  
or liabilities;
•	Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
•	Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability  
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Financial statements 144/145

– 59,508 (25,276) 34,232
During the reporting periods, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.
Receivables from provisional copper, gold and silver concentrate sales
The fair value of receivables arising from copper, gold and silver concentrate sales contracts that contain provisional pricing 
mechanisms is determined using the appropriate quoted forward price from the exchange that is the principal active market  
for the particular metal. As such, these receivables are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Contingent consideration liabilities
In 2008, the Group recorded a contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of 98.1% of the shares in JSC Omolon 
Gold Mining Company (Omolon). The fair value of the contingent consideration liability was determined using a valuation model 
which simulates expected production of gold and silver at the Kubaka mine and future gold and silver prices to estimate future 
revenues of Omolon. This liability is revalued at each reporting date based on 2% of the life of mine revenues with the resulting 
gain or loss recognised in the consolidated income statement. The liability recognised at 31 December 2013 was US$15.5 million 
(2012: US$25.3 million).
The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Group’s Level 3 financial liabilities for the year  
ended 31 December 2013:

Total 15,523  25,276 
Additions in the year ended 31 December 2012 represent the contingent consideration payable by the Group  
on Semchenskoye Zoloto acquisition (see Note 4 for further details).
The directors consider that a reasonably possible change in a valuation assumption would not have a material effect  
on the Group.
Commodity forward contracts
The Group enters into forward contracts for the physical delivery of metals which will be priced according to the prevailing 
London Bullion Market Association or London Metal Exchange index. The Group’s policy is not to enter into fixed priced 
contracts. The forward sales contracts qualify for the normal purchase/sales or ‘own use’ exemption for accounting  
purposes and are outside the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
31. Risk management activities
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains from 
prior years.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as detailed in Note 26 offset by cash and bank balances  
as detailed in Note 25) and equity of the Group (comprising the Stated Capital account, reserves and retained earnings  
as detailed in Note 32.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure  
of the Group on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated  
with each class of capital.
Major categories of financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, derivatives, finance lease liabilities, trade and other payables.  
The Group has various financial assets such as accounts receivable, loans advanced and cash and cash equivalents.

Trade and other payables exclude employee benefits and social security.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and short-term debt 
recorded at amortised cost approximate to their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments. The estimated 
fair value of the Group’s long-term debt, calculated using the market interest rate available to the Group as at 31 December 2013, 
is US$1,017 million, and the carrying value as at 31 December 2013 is US$1,111 million (see Note 26). Carrying values of the 
other long-term loans provided to related parties as at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 approximated to their  
fair values.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency and commodity price risk, interest rate,  
credit and liquidity risks.
At the end of the reporting period, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk for receivables designated at FVTPL.  
The carrying amount reflected above represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for such receivables.

31. Risk management activities continued 
Foreign currency and commodity price risk
In the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions for the sale of its commodities, denominated in US Dollars. 
In addition, the Group has assets and liabilities in a number of different currencies (primarily Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge). 
As a result, the Group is subject to transaction and translation exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group does not use derivative instruments to currently hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The carrying amounts of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than functional currencies  
of the individual Group entities at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 were as follows:

Currency risk is monitored on a monthly basis by performing a sensitivity analysis of foreign currency positions in order  
to verify that potential losses are at an acceptable level.
The table below details the Group’s sensitivity to changes in exchange rates by 10% which is the sensitivity rate used  
by the Group for internal analysis. The analysis was applied to monetary items denominated in respective currencies  
at the reporting dates.

Provisionally priced sales
Under a long-established practice prevalent in the industry, copper, gold and silver concentrate sales are provisionally priced  
at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalised in a contractually specified future period (generally one to three 
months) primarily based on quoted LBMA or LME prices. Sales subject to final pricing are generally settled in a subsequent 
month. The forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenue.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.  
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Group 
does not currently hedge its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section  
of this note.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end of the reporting 
period was outstanding for the whole period. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk 
internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change  
in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 would have decreased/increased by US$9.8 million (2012: US$7.7 million). This is mainly attributable 
to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the increase in variable rate  
debt instruments.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer may default or not meet its obligations to the Group on a timely basis, leading to financial 
losses to the Group. The Group’s financial instruments that are potentially exposed to concentration of credit risk consist primarily 
of cash and cash equivalents and loans and receivables.
Accounts receivable are regularly monitored and assessed and where necessary an adequate level of provision is maintained. 
Trade accounts receivable at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 are represented by provisional copper, gold and  
silver concentrate sales transactions. A significant portion of the Group’s trade accounts receivable is due from reputable  
export trading companies. With regard to other loans and receivables the procedures of accepting a new customer include  
checks by a security department and responsible on-site management for business reputation, licences and certification, 
creditworthiness and liquidity. Generally, the Group does not require any collateral to be pledged in connection with  
its investments in the above financial instruments. Credit limits for the Group as a whole are not set up.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies. The major financial assets at the balance sheet date other than trade accounts receivable presented  
in Note 24 are cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2013 of US$65.6 million (2012: US$18.6 million).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to settle its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group’s liquidity position is carefully monitored and managed. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining detailed 
budgeting, cash forecasting processes and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities to help ensure  
that it has adequate cash available to meet its payment obligations.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. 
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which 
the Group can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are 
floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period. The contractual 
maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

Retained earnings
Reserves available for distribution to shareholders are based on the available cash in the Company under Jersey law. The ability 
to distribute cash up to the Company from the Russian and Kazakh operating companies will be based on the statutory historical 
information of each stand-alone entity, which is prepared in accordance with Russian or Kazakh accounting standards and 
which differs slightly from IFRS. Russian legislation identifies the basis of distribution as accumulated profit. However, current 
legislation and other statutory regulations dealing with distribution rights are open to legal interpretation; consequently, actual 
distributable reserves may differ from the amount of accumulated profit under Russian statutory accounting rules. Financial statements 148/149

Weighted average number of shares: Diluted loss/earnings per share
The Group had potentially dilutive securities, namely the Group’s equity-settled share appreciation plan, which was established 
during 2010 (see Note 33).
Both basic and diluted loss/earnings per share were calculated by dividing loss/profit for the year attributable to equity holders  
of the parent by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares before/after dilution respectively. The calculation 
of the weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution is as follows:
Year ended
31 December
 2013
Number
31 December
 2012
Number
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares 387,932,387 382,705,692
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution 387,932,387 382,705,692
The outstanding LTIP awards at 31 December 2013 and 2012 represent anti-dilutive potential ordinary shares with respect  
to earnings per share for continuing operations. Therefore, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for the current  
and prior year.
33. Share-based payments
The US$24 million share based payment expense recognised during 2013 (2012: $54 million) represents the final accrual  
made in respect of the Long-term employee incentive programme (adopted in 2010). The options vested in June 2013 however 
recipients had the option to defer their measurement period by one year to June 2014 (though in doing so the benchmark share 
price needed to receive the awards, would increase). 
Following significant gold and silver price declines in April 2013, the Company’s share price fell below the minimum target price 
such that no LTIPs would have been awarded to option holders in June 2013. All recipients opted to defer their measurement 
period to 2014 and with it the award vesting dates, albeit sufficiently close to the original June 2013 vesting date such that the 
share based payment expense had already been fully recognised in the Income Statement.
At the Annual General Meeting in June 2013, shareholders approved the new Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘New LTIP’).  
The first grant of options under the New LTIP is expected to take place in April 2014 provided that the relevant participants  
do not hold any options under the Old EIP . Share-based payment expenses in relation to the New LTIP are therefore expected  
to be recognised in 2014.
 
The fair value of the awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2010, was estimated using a two–stage Monte-Carlo 
model. The fair value determined was then recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Use of two-stage Monte-
Carlo option pricing requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. The following 
assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value:
•	 Expected forfeitures. This assumption is estimated using historical trends of executive Director and employee turnover.  
As the Group typically only grants awards to senior employees and the turnover rate for such employees is minimal, the  
Group has estimated expected forfeitures to be 5%. Estimated forfeitures are adjusted over the requisite service period  
to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are 
recognised in the period of change and impact the amount of expense to be recognised in future periods.
•	 Expected volatility. Expected volatility has been estimated based on an analysis of the historical stock price volatility  
of the JSC Polymetal GDRs from February 2007 , when the JSC Polymetal GDRs became publicly traded.
•	 Expected life. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option of 3.6 years. As the Plan has  
a 2.6 years vesting condition and the participant may exercise their right to redeem shares within one year after vesting  
occurs, the Group used the 2.6 years expected term for the first stage of the Monte-Carlo simulation (the First date)  
and 3.6 years for the second stage (the Second date).
•	Fair value of common stock is equal to the market price of JSC Polymetal’s underlying Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs)  
at the grant date.
•	 Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free rate is based on US Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the 
expected life assumed at the date of grant.
At the grant date, the Group had not historically declared dividends and management believed the Company would not declare  
a dividend over the life of the option. As such, the expected annual dividend per share was therefore nil. Any subsequent change 
in dividend policy will be taken into account when valuing options granted in the future.
Risk free rate 0.79% for the First date, 1.24% for the Second date
Expected dividend yield Nil
Expected volatility 40%
Expected life, years 2.6 for the First date, 3.6 for the Second date
Fair value per share (US Dollars) 16.97
34. Related parties
Related parties are considered to include shareholders, affiliates, associates, joint ventures and entities under common 
ownership and control with the Group and members of key management personnel. In the course of its business the  
Group entered into various transactions with Nomos-Bank (an entity in which Alexander Nesis, a significant shareholder  
of the Company, also previously held a substantial interest) and equity method investees as presented in tables below.
Nomos-Bank ceased to meet the definition of a related party from 27 February 2013 due to changes in its shareholder structure 
and composition of its Board of Directors. However in line with IAS 24 Related Party Transactions, deposits or borrowings taken 
out with Nomos where terms were agreed prior to this date, continue to be recognised as related party transactions.

Gold equivalent data is based on reporting of metal equivalent ratios provided below. Lead and zinc ore reserves and mineral 
resources have not been assessed in this report due to immateriality.
Reporting of metal equivalents
Silver/gold equivalent conversion ratio for precious metals deposits
GE = Ag/k
Where k is the silver to gold equivalent conversion rate based on the difference in respective metals’ value using the following formula:
k = ((Au price/31.1035 – (Au price/31.1035 – treatment charge Au)*(Royalty Au)/100 – (treatment charge Au))*(recovery Au)/ 
((Ag price/31.1035 – (Ag price/31.1035 – treatment charge Ag)*(Royalty Ag)/100 – (treatment charge Ag))*(recovery Ag));
where Royalty is the mineral extraction tax at applicable rate, recovery – life-of-mine expected recovery of the respective the metal in the 
processing technology applied.

Silver to gold equivalent conversion ratios were not recalculated to deposits that were evaluated in 2011-2012.
Gold equivalent conversion ratio for polymetallic deposits
GE = Me/k
Where Me is the evaluated metal content (copper, silver);
where k is the silver to gold equivalent conversion rate that is calculated considering the difference in metals value issuing the following formula;
for silver (similar to the formula for precious metals deposits), for copper (%):
k = 100*((Au price/31.1035-treatment charge Au)*(1-royalty Au%/change Au%)*(recovery Au%))/((Cu price-treatment charge Cu)* 
(1-royalty Cu%/recovery Cu%)*(recovery Cu%));
where Royalty is the mineral extraction tax at applicable rate, recovery – life-of-mine expected recovery of the respective the metal in the

Grade means the relative amount of metal in ore, 
expressed as grams per tonne for precious 
metals and as a percentage for most  
other metals
Head grade the grade of ore coming into a processing plant
Heap leach a technological operation in which crushed 
material is laid on a sloping, impervious pad 
where it is leached by cyanide solution  
to dissolve gold and/or silver. Metals are 
subsequently recovered from pregnant leach 
solution by CIC or the Merrill-Crowe process
Inconel an alloy of nickel, chromium, and iron that  
is highly resistant to high temperatures  
and corrosion
Indicated  
resource 
means that part of a resource for which  
tonnage, grade and content can be estimated 
with a reasonable level of confidence. It is based 
on exploration, sampling and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes. The locations are  
too widely or inappropriately spaced to  
confirm geological and/or grade continuity  
but are spaced closely enough for continuity  
to be assumed
Inferred resource means that part of a resource for which tonnage, 
grade and content can be estimated with a low 
level of confidence. It is inferred from geological 
evidence and assumed but not verified 
geological and/or grade continuity. It is based  
on information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which 
may be limited or of uncertain quality  
and reliability
In-fill drilling a conventional method of detailed exploration  
on already defined resource of reserve, 
consisting of drilling on a denser grid to allow 
more precise estimation of ore bodyparameters 
and location
Leaching the process of dissolving mineral values from 
solid into liquid phase of slurry
Measured 
resource 
means that part of a resource for which tonnage, 
densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade 
and mineral content can be estimated with  
a high level of confidence. It is based on detailed 
and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.  
The locations are spaced closely enough  
to confirm geological and grade continuity
Production the amount of pure precious metals, measured 
in thousands of ounces for gold, millions of 
ounces for silver and tonnes for copper, 
produced following processing
Proved reserves the economically mineable part of a measured 
resource, which represents the highest

and/or indicated mineral resource. It takes into 
account mining dilution and losses. Appropriate 
assessments and studies have been carried out, 
and include consideration of and modification  
by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, 
economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors. These 
assessments demonstrate at the time of 
reporting that extraction could reasonably be 
justified. Reserves are subdivided in order of 
increasing confidence into probable reserves 
and proved reserves
Resources a concentration or occurrence of material of 
intrinsic economic interest in or on the earth’s 
crust in such form, quality and quantity that  
there are reasonable prospects for eventual 
economic extraction. The location, quantity, 
grade, geological characteristics and  
continuity of resources are known, estimated  
or interpreted from specific geological evidence 
and knowledge. Resources are sub-divided  
in order of increasing geological confidence,  
into inferred, indicated and measured categories
SAG mill a semi-autogenous grinding mill, generally used

in many ore deposit types
Stope a large underground excavation entirely  
within an ore body, a unit of ore extraction
Strike a horizontal extension of an ore body  
or mineralisation
Stripping the mining of waste in an open pit mine
Merrill-Crowe 
process
a technological operation for extraction  
of gold and/or silver after cyanide leaching.  
In the first step slurry containing gold and/or 
silver is separated into liquid and solid phases  
by washing the solids off in countercurrent 
decantation thickeners. In the second step 
pregnant leach solution (liquid phase of slurry)  
is filtered to remove impurities and deaerated.

solid bed of claylike material where they replace 
zinc particles which pass into a solution. 
Merrill-Crowe is preferentially used  
for silver-rich ores

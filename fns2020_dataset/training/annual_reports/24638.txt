Chairman’s statement
Your Board is pleased to report positive 
results for 2013 as Helios Underwriting plc 
("HUW"). We continue to enjoy a close 
association with the Hampden Group of 
companies; however, as we enter this exciting 
stage in the Company’s development we felt 
that the time was right for a more distinct 
identity under a new name. In Greek mythology, 
Helios was the sun god, the son of Hyperion, 
depicted as driving his chariot across the 
sky from east to west daily. Accordingly our 
new name emphasises our continued focus 
– to shine a light on the opportunities that 
exist within the Lloyd’s market. 
The profit after tax of £731,000 for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 compares with 
profit after tax of £763,000 for 2012. This 
result includes a net charge of £427,000 
in respect of goodwill and amortisation. 
Excluding this, the operating profit before 
tax for the year of £1,280,000 shows a 
significant improvement on 2012 (£681,000) 
and on this key measure 2013 is our best 
year to date.
Net assets have increased to £9.8m which 
equates to £1.15 per share and when the 
unamortised value of capacity is added 
back it shows a value of £1.51 per share. 
For the first time, we are pleased to have the 
ability to publish an independent valuation of 
the Group’s Limited Liability Vehicles 
("LLVs"). Humphrey & Co is the market’s 
primary provider of vendor valuations of 
LLVs. The aggregate value as at 
31 December 2013 of HUW’s subsidiaries 
owned at that date is £7.6m. When 
combined with audited adjusted net assets 
of the holding company at the same date, 
we arrive at a total valuation of HUW of 
£14.7m or £1.72 per share.
During 2013 we acquired four LLVs at what 
we believe to be attractive prices. Already in 
2014 we have made three more acquisitions 
and have identified significant scope for 
further growth.
In addition to increased underwriting, one of 
the key by-products of all these acquisitions 
was the increased exposure to their open 
years of 2011 (now closed), 2012 and 2013, 
which were at varying degrees of maturity 
at the time of purchase. While a price is paid 
for these open years, HUW benefits from 
any improvements between the acquisition 
date and closure, as well as affording us the 
opportunity to participate in future underwriting.
The total amount of premium limit purchased 
last year over the three open years was in 
excess of £11.6m. Furthermore some of 
the underwriting vehicles own significant 
Funds at Lloyd’s. They may also have other 
assets which can be invested, or if surplus 
to underwriting requirements can be 
released to fund further purchases. 
Our advisers expect that Lloyd’s, as a whole, 
will continue to trade profitably in most years. 
Despite increased competition in most classes 
and the expectation of lower investment 
returns we will continue to seek to achieve 
our objective of market out-performance 
through a focus on quality syndicates, 
judicious use of reinsurance and continuing 
our acquisition strategy.
A major strategic development for HUW 
during the year was the introduction of our 
50% quota share arrangement with XL Re. 
Not only does this help shape our risk/reward 
profile in a favourable direction, but the 
ability of HUW to attract a partner of the 
calibre and global scale of XL Re clearly 
reflects positively on our business, team, 
portfolio and prospects in general.
At this point, I would therefore like to thank 
Nigel for his crucial role in our achievements 
during 2013, his first full year with HUW as 
Chief Executive. His tireless efforts on behalf 
of the board and shareholders to drive the 
business forward lead me to have great 
confidence in our future prospects.
As the Group operates in the cyclical and 
volatile insurance market significant volatility 
in future results is to be expected. The Group 
manages its capital with a view to supporting 
the development of the business, including 
supporting increases in the Group’s 
underwriting through the acquisition of 
further capacity, whilst maintaining the 
required level of stability of the Group to 
provide a degree of security to shareholders. 
We continue to support the principle of a 
share buy-back policy for occasions when 
the board feels it is prudent to do so, but it 
is not currently anticipated that the buy-back 
authority will be used at this time as the Group 
continues to focus on the growth of its 
underwriting business.
The operating profit before tax for the 
year of £1,280,000 shows a significant 
improvement on 2012 and on this key 
measure 2013 is our best year to date.

Non-executive Chairman Annual report and financial statements 2013 | Helios Underwriting plc | 03
Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report
Against the backdrop of this capital 
management policy and our significant 
progress over the past year, the Board has 
concluded that it is the right time to introduce 
the payment of a modest and sustainable 
base annual dividend, to be paid as a single 
final dividend. This base annual dividend, 
which is not expected to grow significantly, 
will be supplemented, when circumstances 
allow, by an annual special dividend which, 
when paid, will target an amount between 20% 
and 30% of cash received by the Group in 
relation to the most recently closed year of 
account, such profits normally being finalised 
and received by the Group approximately 
30 months following the end of the relevant 
calendar year. Payment of any special dividend 
will be dependent on the performance of the 
Group’s underlying business, any business 
requirements resulting from major market 
events in the intervening period, and on 
opportunities for growth through the 
acquisition of additional capacity. 
The Board is pleased to recommend a 
maiden final dividend for 2013 of 1.5p 
per share together with a special dividend 
of 3.0p per share payable to shareholders 
on the register on 6 June 2014. Both are 
subject to shareholder approval at the AGM. 
The special dividend equates to approximately 
20% of the £1.3m cash released from the 
2011 year of account net of Hampden 
Agencies’ fees and profit commission, 
including the cash released from the three 
acquisitions completed in 2014 from which 
HUW will benefit. These dividends amount 
to an aggregate payment of £384,000. 
If approved, it is expected that the final and 
special dividend will be paid to shareholders 
as a single payment on 4 July 2014.

Chief Executive’s review
The 2011 underwriting year of account 
which closed at 31 December 2013 
performed well, producing a profit of 
£1,207,000, compared to a profit of 
£401,000 for the 2010 year of account 
at 31 December 2012. This represents 
a profit of 7.58% on 2011 capacity 
(Lloyd’s overall market result was 4.02%) 
compared to a profit of 2.55% for the 
2010 account which was 0.06% above 
the Lloyd’s market average result of 
2.49%. The 2012 year of account is 
estimated to outperform Lloyd’s with a 
profit of 7.51% at the mid-point estimate 
(Lloyd’s 5.61%). As you will note from the 
chart, the final result typically represents 
an improvement over the initial estimates.
Our combined ratio for 2013 was 
a creditable 83.5% on this key 
measure, our best result to date.

Chief Executive’s review continued
A complete set of published estimates is not 
available for the 2013 year of account until 
the end of May 2014, however, we have 
already received estimates accounting for 
57% of HUW’s capacity averaging a 6.1% 
mid-point profit. Hampden Agencies retains 
its forecast of a profit in the range of 2.5% 
to 7.5% for the 2013 account for Hampden 
Agencies clients on average. 
The traditional method for comparing the 
performance of competing insurance business 
is an analysis of the combined ratio, which is 
the sum of net claims and expenses divided 
by net earned premiums. The combined ratio 
of HUW’s portfolio for 2013 was a creditable 
83.5% on this key measure, our best result to 
date, with the underwriting result benefiting 
from a benign year for catastrophe losses. 
HUW strongly outperformed both the Lloyd’s 
market combined ratio of 86.8% and a peer 
group of eleven competing insurance and 
reinsurance companies whose average 
combined ratio was 93.4%.
Net tangible assets per share fell marginally 
by 4% during 2013, principally as a result 
of the four acquisitions made in the year. 
Year end net tangible assets were £6.897m 
with the balance of Lloyd’s minimum capital 
requirement in November 2013 of £11.088m 
being supplied by Letters of Credit from 
quota share reinsurance capital providers 
from which we benefit from both a fee and 
profit commission. 
Our strategic objective is to underwrite at 
Lloyd’s with superior capital efficiency, lower 
risk and higher return. Our quota share 
agreement with XL Re released over £4m 
from our Funds at Lloyd’s ("FAL") to provide 
a modest war chest and during the year we 
acquired over £5m of underwriting capacity 
for the 2014 year of account through a 
series of transactions. We continue to see 
a strengthening flow of vehicles for sale at 
attractive prices. This is partly due to the 
age profile of the investor population, some 
of whom may wish to take profits after a 
long run of favourable results combined 
with tax benefits for those that wish to 
sell as going concerns. The two charts 
show how our capacity and underwriting 
profits by year of account have grown 
through our acquisitions to date.
The quota share has also improved our  
risk/reward ratio since we retain the earnings 
for the more certain underwriting years prior 
to 2013. I am pleased to report that the 
agreement has been renewed for the 2014 
account. Increasing our scale has also 
allowed us to negotiate our fees with some 
of our advisers and while some of the terms 
have a delayed effect they will significantly 
improve results over time.

Classes of business for 2014
Helios Underwriting’s portfolio for 2014 
continues to provide a good spread of 
business across managing agents and 
classes of business with motor and 
liability providing a balance to the 
catastrophe exposed reinsurance and 
property business, as well as contributing 
through diversification to lower capital 
requirements. The two largest classes 
of business remain reinsurance and 
US dollar property insurance.
We continue to actively increase our 
exposure to higher quality syndicates and 
ended the year with approximately 75% 
of our capacity supporting syndicates 
rated either A (superior) or B (above 
average) by Hampden Agencies. HUW’s 
portfolio for 2014 continues to provide a 
good spread of business across 
managing agents and classes of 
business. 25.6% of the capacity is in the 
three syndicates rated “A” by Hampden 
Agencies, being Syndicates 386, 609 and 
2791, with Kiln Syndicate 510 being the 
largest holding at 13.6% of capacity. The 
top ten syndicates comprise 78.5% of 
the portfolio. Two new syndicates were 
joined for 2014. The chart demonstrates 
how we have steadily improved our 
focus on our core six syndicate 
holdings whilst still maintaining 
appropriate diversification.

Chief Executive’s review continued
We welcome Paul Lumbis to the management 
team. Paul joined us on a consultancy basis 
in July 2013 and has since been appointed 
as Group Chief Financial Officer. Paul’s 
financial acumen, his expertise in the world 
of corporate finance and long association 
with the insurance markets equips him 
extremely well to be of significant value 
as we continue to grow.
As we have grown we have also improved 
the infrastructure supporting the day to day 
functioning of the Company. In March this 
year we announced the appointment of 
Westhouse Securities Limited as the 
Company’s broker. We have also appointed 
a new Group Company Secretary and 
retained Haggie Partners to provide public 
relations support. Smith & Williamson 
Corporate Finance Limited continue to act 
as our nominated adviser, with Hampden 
Group continuing to provide back office 
support and Hampden Agencies acting as 
our members’ agent and Lloyd’s adviser, 
as well as providing syndicate research. 
With continued significant opportunities for 
growth ahead, we are pleased to have the 
support of a broader advisory team, all of 
whom have extensive expertise and 
experience in the Lloyd’s market.
A by-product of the worsening conditions in 
the reinsurance market is that some traditional 
reinsurance products are now once again 
available on terms acceptable to HUW. 
We will investigate whether we wish to avail 
ourselves of such opportunities with a view 
to further increasing our capital efficiency.
Our investment strategy announced last 
year remains unchanged with the majority 
of our portfolio being split roughly half in 
the CF Ruffer Total Return Fund and the 
CF Ruffer Absolute Return Fund (both 
managed by Ruffer LLP) and half in the 
Trojan Fund (managed by Troy Asset 
Management Limited). The amount invested 
has reduced significantly as a result of the 
investment in acquisitions but over the 
period the total return from the two funds 
has been 3.4% which has significantly 
beaten cash. 
The investment of these assets gives the 
shareholder the ability to obtain an investment 
return as well as a return from taking 
underwriting risk. Over many years this 
double use of assets has been one of the 
attractions of investing at Lloyd’s.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties to the 
Group’s future cash flows will arise from the 
Group’s participation in the results of Lloyd’s 
syndicates. These risks and uncertainties are 
mostly managed by the syndicate managing 
agents. The Group’s role in managing these 
risks and uncertainties, in conjunction with 
Hampden Agencies Limited, is limited to 
a selection of syndicate participations, 
monitoring the performance of the syndicates 
and the purchase of appropriate member 
level reinsurance.
With effect from the 2013 year of account, the 
Group benefits from a strategic collateralised 
quota share arrangement with XL Re for 50% 
of its business. The Group anticipates this 
being a strategic long-term relationship. 
However, the contract is annually renewable 
and the Group has a contingency plan in 
place in the event of non-renewal under 
both normal and adverse market conditions.
Further information on risk management 
is disclosed in Note 3 to the Financial 
Statements.
2013 has been a transformational year for HUW . We have 
redefined our strategy, refined our portfolio of existing 
syndicates, launched a 50% quota share with XL Re, made 
further acquisitions, implemented a new investment policy 
and strengthened the management and advisory teams. 
We look forward to the future with great enthusiasm.

Corporate, social and 
environmental responsibility
The Group aims to meet the expectations 
of its shareholders and other stakeholders 
in recognising, measuring and managing 
the impacts of its business activities. The 
majority of the Group’s business activities 
are carried out by the syndicates in which 
activities, including employment of syndicate 
staff, are the responsibility of the syndicate 
managing agents. Each managing agent 
also has responsibility for the environmental 
activities of each syndicate although, by 
their nature, syndicates do not produce 
significant environmental emissions.
For the reasons described above, the Board 
of Directors does not consider it appropriate 
to monitor or report any performance indicators 
in relation to corporate, social or 
environmental matters.
Outlook
The underwriting environment in 2014 continues to be challenging. Opportunities remain, 
however, particularly for higher quality syndicates, not least in the more effective purchase 
of better priced outward reinsurance, but also for nimble underwriting to exploit the more 
profitable niche classes for which Lloyd’s has such a well earned reputation. HUW’s 
strategy and business model is based on backing the best underwriters and syndicates 
as we seek out-performance of the average market experience. We will continue to explore 
options for making capital available for acquisitions, both through further potential quota 
share arrangements and through other capital raising alternatives.
In summary, 2013 has been a transformational year for HUW. Over the past 12 months, 
we have redefined our strategy, refined our portfolio of existing syndicates, launched a 
50% quota share with XL Re, made further acquisitions, implemented a new investment 
policy and strengthened the management and advisory teams. We look forward to the 
future with great enthusiasm.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
continued
The two major risks faced by insurers and 
reinsurers are deficient loss reserves and 
inadequate pricing, which, taken together, 
account for 43.4% of insurer impairments 
according to A M Best. The pricing cycle is 
easier to identify in real time. The reserving 
cycle is more difficult to identify in real time 
as typically reserving standards slip after a 
period of reserve releases and there is a lag 
before this is recognized. HUW approaches 
the management of portfolio risk by diversifying 
across classes of business, syndicates and 
managing agents and with the advice of 
Hampden Agencies understanding the cycle 
management and reserving strategy of each 
syndicate as well as the rate environment. 
We also assess the downside in the event of 
a major loss through monitoring the aggregate 
losses estimated by managing agents to 
realistic disaster scenarios (RDS’s). Risk is 
assessed in the context of potential return 
with catastrophe exposure being actively 
managed dependent on market conditions.
The RDS events comprise 14 compulsory 
events including a Florida hurricane, 
Californian earthquake and Japanese 
earthquake, together with six scenarios 
subject to de minimis reporting of the more 
difficult to model liability or political risk 
scenarios. The largest losses modelled for 
2014 remain $125bn for a Florida windstorm 
in both Miami Dade and Pinellas. The largest 
earthquake loss modelled remains in 
California with a $78bn industry loss for 
both Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
HUW’s largest modelled exposures net of 
reinsurance as a percentage of gross premiums 
are similar for 2014 compared with 2013. 
The largest for 2014 is the larger of Two 
Windstorm Events consisting of a North-East 
US hurricane, immediately followed by a 
South Carolina hurricane at 32.2% of gross 
premium, net of reinsurance (29.7% in 
2013). The next largest is the Gulf of Mexico 
windstorm at 30.4% net (28.9% in 2013).

2013 major losses at Lloyd’s were £873m 
(15 year average: £1,572m)
According to the latest Swiss Re Sigma study, 
issued in March 2014, insured losses from 
natural catastrophes and man-made disasters 
in 2013 were around $45bn compared with 
$81bn in 2012. Major insured losses in 2013 
were just under the ten year average of 
$48bn a year at 2012 prices. 
The most costly insured losses in 2013 were 
the flooding in June affecting central and 
eastern Europe costing $4.1bn, and hailstorm 
Andreas in Germany and France costing 
$3.8bn the following month. Floods in Canada 
in June 2013 cost $1.9bn while a deadly 
tornado in Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013 
is estimated to have cost $1.8bn in insured 
claims, the most from a single weather event 
in the US in 2013. The largest loss of life was 
from Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 
November, where 7,500 died or went missing 
but insured losses were modest at $1.5bn 
compared with $12.5bn of economic losses. 
As a market, 2013 was a benign year for 
catastrophes with Lloyd’s net ultimate claims 
at 31 December 2013 estimated at £873m 
(£1.8bn in 2012), which is significantly below 
the 15 year average of £1.572bn and a 
significant reduction on the record claims 
suffered in 2011 of £4.7bn. 
US property/casualty industry made its 
first underwriting profit in 2013 since 2007
The underwriting results of the US property/
casualty insurance industry improved in 
2013 with the first underwriting profit being 
declared since 2007, benefiting from 
reduced catastrophe losses and increasing 
rates. Net insured losses from catastrophes 
fell to $14.1bn from $33.1bn in 2012. Net 
gains from underwriting were $15.5bn 
compared with net losses the previous year 
of $15.4bn. Net investment gains (income 
and realised capital gains) enabled an improved 
overall net profit after tax of $63.8bn compared 
with $35.1bn in 2012. The return on average 
policyholders’ surplus was 10.3%, its highest 
level since the 12.4% return in 2007.
Capital levels ended 2013 at record 
highs for both insurers and reinsurers
Capital levels at year end 2013 were again 
at record highs for both insurers and reinsurers. 
At Lloyd’s total net resources increased by 
4% in 2013 to a record £21.2bn with the 
solvency surplus improving marginally to a 
record £3.1bn. The policyholders’ surplus of 
the US property/casualty industry, a proxy 
for underwriting capacity, grew by 11.3% 
($66.3bn) in 2013 to a record $653.3bn. 
Reinsurance capital also grew, but by a 
more modest 7% ($35bn) to a record 
$540bn at year end 2013, according 
to reinsurance broker Aon Benfield. 
Influx of alternative capital 
adds to record capital
During 2013, industry capital was boosted 
by improved operating results, in part driven 
by a sharp fall in insured losses from natural 
catastrophes and man-made disasters. The 
most significant trend to affect the reinsurance 
market in 2012/2013 was the growing supply 
of alternative capital which is both a threat 
and an opportunity to the traditional 
reinsurance equity backed model. Alternative 
capital may be used as quasi capital by the 
reinsurance industry but may also compete 
with traditional equity backed reinsurance 
companies. Investor interest has been 
generated from a wide range of sources 
including pension funds, life assurers, 
endowments and high net worth family trusts. 
Reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter estimates 
that between January 2012 and December 
2013 approximately $15bn of new capital 
has entered the reinsurance market and 
now provides total alternative capital of 
$45bn or 15% of global property 
reinsurance limits. 
Insurance industry has become more 
disciplined at deploying its capital
Historically, the industry has on average 
been unsuccessful in controlling the supply 
of capacity, which has contributed to cyclical 
downturns benefiting policyholders rather 
than shareholders. In recent years, a number 
of companies have shown a willingness to 
return excess capital to shareholders through 
share buy backs or special dividends, 
demonstrating a focus on shareholder value 
and mitigating the pressure to deploy excess 
capital by writing additional business, which 
is likely to be under-priced. 
Demand – positive signs continue 
for US insurance marketplace
Insurance demand, measured by premium, 
has grown over the long term, being linked 
to growth in GDP and levels of insurance 
penetration. During the great recession of 
2007–2009 US net written insurance premiums 
fell by an aggregate 6.8% the first three year 
decline since 1930–1933. Growth in overall 
net premiums, a proxy for demand, accelerated 
in the US to 4.6% in 2013 from 4.3% in 2012. 
Premium growth in Q4 2013 was the 15th 
consecutive quarter of growth with average 
commercial lines rates up for the tenth 
consecutive quarter. However, reinsurance 
demand has been adversely affected at 
1 January 2014 by the trend of major 
insurance groups to retain more premium 
volume and risk on their own growing 
balance sheets, according to Willis Re.
The demand component has been boosted 
by a combination of increasing premium 
rates and the recovering US economy 
contributing to organic growth. Encouragingly, 
net written premium has now overtaken its 
previous peak in 2006. While demand for 
insurance continues to be impacted by 
sluggish economic conditions, the benefits 
of even slow growth will compound over 
time. US real GDP growth was 1.8% in 
2011, 2.2% in 2012 and 1.9% in 2013.
Organic growth opportunities which would 
ordinarily use up surplus capital have been 
limited in this cycle with GDP growth, whether 
measured in nominal or real terms, being 
the slowest of any expansion since 1948. 
The economy’s capacity utilisation is still 
below pre-recession levels with the US 
operating at 79.2% of industrial capacity 
in December 2013, although well above 
the June 2009 low of 66.9%. 
Lloyd’s is well placed to take advantage 
of an improving excess and surplus lines 
(E&S) segment of the US insurance market. 
In 2012, according to AM Best, Lloyd’s had 
an 18.0% (18.6% in 2011) share of the US 
E&S market with its next biggest competitor 
being AIG with 14.5% (17.2% in 2011). 
Lloyd’s total E&S premium grew by 10% 
from $5.7bn in 2011 to $6.3bn in 2012, 
benefiting from a combination of GDP 
growth and an increased flow of business 
as admitted carriers moved away from 
underwriting more difficult risks.

Lloyd’s Adviser’s report continued
The investment environment
The investment environment remains critical 
in order to understand the insurance industry, 
both from a balance sheet perspective 
(the asset side) and from a profit and loss 
perspective. In an era of low inflation and 
low interest rates, the only way for an insurer 
to make an acceptable return on equity for 
its investors is to make an underwriting profit 
and repay surplus capital to shareholders. 
At previous cycle turning points, premium 
rates have turned up due to capital being 
depleted either through a period of reserve 
deteriorations or through significant “market 
changing” catastrophe losses. In this cycle, 
the upturn in US insurance rates has begun 
without either of these factors being present. 
In our view, the principal reason for the upturn 
in US insurance rates is the investment 
environment of low interest rates with the 
US Federal Reserve actively signalling that it 
is determined to keep interest rates low until 
unemployment drops below 6.5% or until 
inflation expectations exceed 2.5%. 
Even with the recent rises in interest rates, 
the treasury yield curve remains close to its 
most depressed level in at least 45 years. 
A US Treasury five year bond bought at a 
yield of 1.55% on 31 December 2008 on 
reinvestment on 31 December 2013 would 
only yield 1.75%. The significance of this is 
not lost on insurance company management 
who realise that combined ratios must be 
lower in today’s depressed investment 
environment to generate a risk appropriate 
return on equity. In 2012, the Insurance 
Information Institute calculated that a 
combined ratio of about 100%, i.e. a break 
even underwriting result, would generate 
a return on equity of around 7% which 
compares with 10% in 2005 and 16% in 
1979 for the same 100% combined ratio.
The investment component of the return 
on equity by line of business is particularly 
important in capital intensive lines such as 
reinsurance, or casualty business where 
claims may not be paid out for a number 
of years. Apart from controlling expenses 
the main way for insurance company 
management to compensate for this “lost 
investment income” is to encourage their 
underwriters to put rates up. 
The trend in declining yields from 2007 can be 
seen in the chart below which shows both the 
two year and five year US Treasury from 2005 
to May 2013. As of 30 April 2014 the two year 
is yielding 0.42% and the five year 1.69%.
Rating – 2013 was a tale of two halves in reinsurance – momentum slows down for US reinsurance
The principal driver of underwriting profitability 
is the level of premium rates combined with 
policy terms and conditions. 
The surge in alternative reinsurance capital 
supplied by third party investors had a 
greater-than-expected impact at the 
mid-year 2013 renewals, particularly for Florida, 
with Guy Carpenter reporting 15% rate 
reductions while loss-free US property 
catastrophe programmes decreased by 
between 12.5% and 30% at 1 July. The 
mid-year renewals were in marked contrast 
to the stable rates seen earlier in the year. 
The weighted average rate change for US 
property catastrophe reinsurance business in 
2013 was approximately 7%. Rate reductions 
continued at the 1 January 2014 US renewals 
averaging 15% (9% compared with 1 January 
2013 rates) with competition being spurred 
by the absence of a major hurricane in 2013. 
Rate reductions continued at the 1 April 2014 
renewals which comprise the entire Japanese 
market and a few large US programmes. 
Willis Re estimated that excess of loss 
covers for Japanese earthquake risks fell by 
12.5% to 17.5% with typhoon rates falling 
by 10% to 15%. US premiums paid by 
nationwide insurers fell by 10% to 20% 
for catastrophe loss-free accounts and by 
up to 10% for loss-hit renewals. In addition, 
terms and conditions have begun to be 
relaxed and multi-year contracts offered.
The impact of terms and conditions on 
prospective underwriting return is much 
more difficult to measure than that of rate. 
It is only after a loss that the impact of a 
broadening of cover is fully appreciated. 
The 1 January 2014 renewal season brought 
signs that underwriters are now prepared to 
broaden cover and increasingly offer multi-year 
contracts, expansion of hours clauses, less 
punitive reinstatement provisions and expanded 
coverage for terrorism, cyber and workers’ 
compensation risk have been mentioned. 
Willis Re comments that “experienced 
reinsurers will remember that the relaxation 
of terms and conditions more so than price 
reduction caused the real damage in the last 
soft market cycle”. However, while rate 
using Guy Carpenter’s rate on line index for 
US business is 20% down on the average 
between 2006 and 2013 at 1 January 2014, 
it is still 14% above rates in 2005.

Corporate governance Financial statements Strategic report Strategic report
Lloyd’s Adviser’s report continued
In contrast, we are now seeing a sustained 
upturn in property and casualty insurance 
rates in the United States, which does not 
suffer from the ease of entry of alternative 
sources of capital seen in the reinsurance 
sector. After nearly eight years of decreases, 
the first increase we saw was in the third 
quarter of 2011 and by the first quarter of 
2013 rate increases had accelerated to 5.2% 
using data supplied by the Council of Insurance 
Agents and Brokers, the largest increase 
since 2003. Rate increases moderated over 
the course of 2013, to 4.3% at Q2, to 3.4% 
at Q3 and to 2.1% at Q4. This has continued 
in 2014 with rates increasing by 1.5% in 
Q1 2014. 
Going forward, the US insurance pricing 
cycle, given the absence of reserve 
deteriorations from the prior years at a 
market aggregate level, may prove more 
muted than in the past. 
The implications for a more muted pricing 
cycle are that the upward trend in rates could 
slow down further or potentially come to an 
end during 2014. Already we have seen rates 
reduce for larger insurance risks such as 
energy, large property and aviation. Outside 
of the US, rate competition has returned to 
the UK motor market following the introduction 
of new legislation implemented in July 2013 
with rates for comprehensive private car 
business falling by 14.1% in the twelve months 
to December 2013, according to the AA. In 
the first quarter of 2014 rates private car 
comprehensive rates fell a further 5.6%.
Insurance broker Marsh reports that global 
insurance rates, as tracked by the Marsh 
Risk Management Global Insurance Index, 
continued their downward trend in the fourth 
quarter of 2013. The only exception to the 
global trend was the US where the composite 
index showed a modest increase for the 
eighth consecutive quarter. 
At an aggregate level, industry results and 
Lloyd’s results continued to benefit from 
favourable prior year releases which are 
proving to be more persistent and higher 
than was envisaged even twelve months 
ago. This evidence suggests that the 
insurance industry is better at using 
technology, historical data and modelling to 
price new business and estimate losses, 
which should inherently translate into more 
stable profitability and pricing cycles.
Prospects for 2014
Our formal profit target for the 2014 account 
(assuming an average year for catastrophe 
losses) is a range of 0% to 7.5% on capacity, 
for the average Hampden client, which is 
lower than the 2.5% to 7.5% we set for the 
2013 account in September 2012, and reflects, 
in the main, the softening of reinsurance rates. 
We expect rate increases to continue in 2014 
for small and medium US property and casualty 
accounts but at a lower level of increase than 
seen in 2013. Risks to this expectation are 
if there is renewed economic weakness 
affecting demand compared with the current 
moderate GDP growth or if rate competition 
were to increase in part due to reductions 
in reinsurance pricing. 
Overall we estimate that rates will reduce 
by 4.1% in 2014, which compares with our 
initial estimate of a reduction of 2.3% on 
average. Further reductions in reinsurance 
rates are expected in July following on 
from the reductions at mid-year in 2013, 
1 January 2014 and the reductions at 
1 January, 1 April, and 1 June 2014. 
Since 2006 US reinsurance rates have been 
amongst the most attractive of any class of 
business and have made a significant 
contribution to Lloyd’s profitability in this 
period. Despite rate reductions, there 
remains a reasonable technical margin 
on US business, albeit not the exceptional 
margin experienced between 2006 and 
2009. The influx of alternative capital is not 
only squeezing margins on reinsurance 
business but also leading to pressure on 
signings and therefore adding to the potential 
for reduced income. The traditional reinsurance 
market has also responded to increasing 
competition by relaxing policy terms and 
conditions as well as being prepared to 
enter multi-year contracts. Due to reinsurance 
rate reductions, the balance of risk and reward 
on US business is beginning to shift from 
net sellers of reinsurance to net buyers 
of reinsurance.
Despite our continued optimism on the rate 
outlook for US insurance business, additional 
capital is being deployed by Berkshire 
Hathaway with its entry into the US excess 
and surplus lines market and its participation 
on 7.5% of Aon’s retail placements with 
Lloyd’s participation. Both moves have the 
potential to impact margins negatively in 
2014 and beyond. The effect should be 
mitigated by Berkshire Hathaway’s reputation 
for pricing discipline. As the reinsurance 
market softens more reinsurers are expected 
to follow Berkshire Hathaway’s lead by 
allocating capital to insurance operations.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities • Y ear ended 31 December 2013
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, Report of the Directors and the Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to:
 » select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 » make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
 » state whether IFRS, adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the 
Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  Corporate governance Strategic report

Independent auditors’ report • To the members of Helios Underwriting plc
We have audited the Financial Statements of Helios Underwriting plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial 
Position, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flow, the Consolidated and Parent Company 
Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company Financial Statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone, other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’ s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group and Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial Statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited Financial Statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion:
 » the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 » the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union;
 » the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 » the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors for the financial year for 
which the Financial Statements are prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
 » adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 » the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 » certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 » we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the financial statements • Y ear ended 31 December 2013
1. General information
The Company is a public limited company listed on AIM and incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements 
(the “Financial Statements”) are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years 
presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as endorsed by the European Union (“EU”), IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set 
out below.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
The Group participates in insurance business through its Lloyd’s member subsidiaries. Accounting information 
in respect of syndicate participations is provided by the syndicate managing agents and is reported upon by 
the syndicate auditors.
Going concern
The Group and Company have net assets at the end of the reporting period of £9,826,000 and £11,162,000 respectively.
The Company’s subsidiaries participate as underwriting members at Lloyd’s on the 2011, 2012 and 2013 years 
of account and they have continued this participation since the year end on the 2014 year of account. This underwriting 
is supported by funds at Lloyd’s totalling £4,669,000 (2012: £7,173,000), and letters of credit provided by XL Re 
through the Group’s quota share reinsurance agreement totalling £4,118,000 (2012: £nil).
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to meet 
their underwriting and other operational obligations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual Financial Statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The following are IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 
on or after 1 January 2013 that had a material impact on the Group’s Financial Statements.
 » Amendment to IAS 1 “Financial Statement Presentation” regarding other comprehensive income became effective 
during the period. Items in the Consolidated Income Statement that may be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequently 
periods are now presented separately from items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
 » IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” became effective during the period. The standard requires specific disclosures 
on fair values, some of which replace existing disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”. 
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate 
to their book values due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments. Available for sale financial assets 
consist of equity investments whose fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices (level 1 in the 
fair value measurement hierarchy).
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and have not been applied in preparing these Financial Statements. None 
of these are expected to have a significant effect on the Financial Statements of the Group. The Group intends 
to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.
 » IAS 27 “Separate Financial Statements”, replaces the current version of IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements” as a result of the issue of IFRS 10. The revised standard includes the requirements relating 
to separate Financial Statements. The revised standard becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2014.
 » IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”, replaces the current version of IAS 28 “Investments in 
Associates”, as a result of the issue of IFRS 11. The revised standard includes the requirements for associates 
and joint ventures that have to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 1. The Group is yet to assess 
full impact of the revised standard and intends to adopt IAS 28 (revised) no later than the accounting period 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014. Corporate governance Strategic report
Annual report and financial statements 2013 | Helios Underwriting plc | 25
Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued • Y ear ended 31 December 2013
2. Accounting policies continued
International Financial Reporting Standards continued
 » Amendment to IAS 19 “Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions”, provides guidance added to IAS 19 
“Employee Benefits” on accounting for contributions from employees or third parties set out in the formal terms 
of a defined benefit plan. The Directors do not believe that this will have an impact on the Group, however, and 
will be adopted no later than accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014, subject to endorsement, 
by the EU.
 » Amendment to IAS 32 “Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, adds application guidance to address 
inconsistencies identified in applying some of the criteria when offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. 
This includes clarifying the meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off” and that some gross 
settlement systems may be considered equivalent to net settlement. The Group is yet to assess the full impact 
of the amendment to IAS 32 and intends to adopt the amended standard no later than the accounting period 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 » Amendment to IAS 36 “Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets”, to reduce the circumstances 
in which the recoverable amount of assets or cash-generating units is required to be disclosed, clarify the disclosures 
required, and to introduce an explicit requirement to disclose the discount rate used in determining impairment 
(or reversals) where recoverable amount (based on fair value less costs of disposal) is determined using a present 
value technique. The Group is yet to assess full impact of the revised standard and intends to adopt the amendment 
to IAS 36 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 » Amendment to IAS 39 “Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting”, make it clear that there 
is no need to discontinue hedge accounting if a hedging derivative is novated, provided certain criteria are met. 
The Group is yet to assess full impact and intends to adopt the amendment to IAS 39 no later than the accounting 
period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 » IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and 
financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces parts of IAS 39 that relate 
to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into 
two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination 
is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial 
instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics for the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard 
retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for 
financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’ s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive 
income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The Group is yet to 
assess IFRS 9’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 
1 January 2014, subject to endorsement by the EU. The Group will also consider the impact of the remaining 
phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the Board.
 » IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control 
as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated Financial Statements 
of the parent company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control 
where this is difficult to assess. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 10’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 10 
no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 » IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” provides for a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the 
rights and obligations of the arrangement, rather than its legal form. There are two types of joint arrangement: 
joint operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where a joint operator has rights to the assets and 
obligations relating to the arrangement and therefore accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expenses. Joint ventures arise where the joint venture has rights to the net assets of the arrangement and 
therefore equity accounts for its interest. Proportional consolidation of joint ventures is no longer allowed. 
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 11’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 11 no later than the accounting 
period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 » IFRS 12 “Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities” includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests 
in entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off Statement of Financial 
Position vehicles. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 12’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 12 no later than the 
accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014. 26 | Helios Underwriting plc | Annual report and financial statements 2013

2. Accounting policies continued
International Financial Reporting Standards continued
 » Amendments to IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”, IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” and IFRS 12 
“Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities” clarify the IASB’s intention when first issuing the transition guidance 
in IFRS 10, provide similar relief in IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 from the presentation or adjustment of comparative 
information for periods prior to the immediately preceding period, and provide additional transition relief by 
eliminating the requirement to present comparatives for the disclosures relating to unconsolidated structured 
entities for any period before the first annual period for which IFRS 12 is applied. The Group plans to adopt 
these amendments no later than the annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 » Amendments to IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”, IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities” 
and IAS 27, “Separate Financial Statements”, provide “investment entities” (as defined) an exemption from the 
consolidation of particular subsidiaries and instead require that an investment entity measure the investment 
in each eligible subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
or IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. The Group is yet to assess the full impact 
of these amendments and intends to adopt the amended standards no later than the accounting period 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 » IFRIC 21 “Levies” provides guidance on when to recognise a liability for a levy imposed by a government, both 
for levies that are accounted for in accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets” and those where the timing and amount of levy is certain. It provides the following guidance on 
recognition of a liability to pay levies:
 » the liability is recognised progressively if the obligating event occurs over a period of time; and
 » if an obligation is triggered on reaching a minimum threshold, the liability is recognised when that minimum 
threshold is reached.
  The Group is yet to assess the full impact and intends to adopt the standard no later than the accounting period 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014, subject to endorsement by the EU.
“Annual Improvements 2010–2012 Cycle” sets out amendments to various IFRS and provides a vehicle for making 
non-urgent but necessary amendments to IFRS: 
 » IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”: amendment to the definition of a vesting condition;
 » IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”: amendments to the accounting for contingent consideration 
in a business combination;
 » IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”: amendments to the aggregation of operating segments and the reconciliation 
of the total of the reportable segments’ assets to the entity’s assets;
 » IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”: amendments to short-term receivables and payables;
 » IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment”: amendments to the revaluation method in relation to the 
proportionate restatement of accumulated depreciation;
 » IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”: amendments regarding key management personnel; and
 » IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”: amendments to the revaluation method in relation to the proportionate 
restatement of accumulated depreciation.
The Group intends to adopt the amended standards no later than the annual period beginning on or after 1 July 2014, 
subject to EU endorsement.
“Annual Improvements 2011–2013 Cycle” sets out amendments to various IFRS and provides a vehicle for making 
non-urgent but necessary amendments to IFRS:

Underwriting
Premiums
Gross premium written comprise the total premiums receivable in respect of business incepted during the year, 
together with any differences between booked premiums for prior years and those previously accrued, and include 
estimates of premiums due but not yet receivable or notified to the syndicates on which the Group participates, less 
an allowance for cancellations. All premiums are shown gross of commission payable to intermediaries and exclude 
taxes and duties levied on them.
Unearned premiums
Gross premium written are earned according to the risk profile of the policy. Unearned premiums represent the proportion 
of gross premium written in the year that relate to unexpired terms of policies in force at the end of the reporting period 
calculated on a time apportionment basis having regard, where appropriate, to the incidence of risk. The specific 
basis adopted by each syndicate is determined by the relevant managing agent.
Deferred acquisition costs
Acquisition costs, which represent commission and other related expenses, are deferred over the period in which 
the related premiums are earned.
Reinsurance premiums
Reinsurance premium costs are allocated by the managing agent of each syndicate to reflect the protection 
arranged in respect of the business written and earned.
Reinsurance premium costs in respect of reinsurance purchased directly by the Group are charged or credited 
based on the annual accounting result for each year of account protected by the reinsurance.
Claims incurred and reinsurers’ share
Claims incurred comprise claims and settlement expenses (both internal and external) occurring in the year and 
changes in the provisions for outstanding claims, including provisions for claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) 
and settlement expenses, together with any other adjustments to claims from previous years. Where applicable, 
deductions are made for salvage and other recoveries.
The provision for claims outstanding comprises amounts set aside for claims notified and IBNR. The amount included 
in respect of IBNR is based on statistical techniques of estimation applied by each syndicate’s in-house reserving 
team and reviewed, in certain cases, by external consulting actuaries. These techniques generally involve projecting 
from past experience the development of claims over time to form a view of the likely ultimate claims to be experienced 
for more recent underwriting, having regard to variations in the business accepted and the underlying terms and 
conditions. The provision for claims also includes amounts in respect of internal and external claims handling costs. 
For the most recent years, where a high degree of volatility arises from projections, estimates may be based in part 
on output from rating and other models of the business accepted and assessments of underwriting conditions.
The reinsurers’ share of provisions for claims is based on calculated amounts of outstanding claims and projections 
for IBNR, net of estimated irrecoverable amounts, having regard to each syndicate’s reinsurance programme in place 
for the class of business, the claims experience for the year and the current security rating of the reinsurance 
companies involved. Each syndicate uses a number of statistical techniques to assist in making these estimates. 28 | Helios Underwriting plc | Annual report and financial statements 2013

2. Accounting policies continued
Underwriting continued
Claims incurred and reinsurers’ share continued
Accordingly the two most critical assumptions made by each syndicate’s managing agent as regards claims provisions 
are that the past is a reasonable predictor of the likely level of claims development and that the rating and other models 
used, including pricing models for recent business, are reasonable indicators of the likely level of ultimate claims to 
be incurred.
The level of uncertainty with regard to the estimations within these provisions generally decreases with time since the 
underlying contracts were exposed to new risks. In addition the nature of short-tail claims such as property where claims 
are typically notified and settled within a short period of time will normally have less uncertainty after a few years than 
long-tail risks such as some liability business where it may be several years before claims are fully advised and settled. 
In addition to these factors if there are disputes regarding coverage under policies or changes in the relevant law 
regarding a claim this may increase the uncertainty in the estimation of the outcomes.
The assessment of these provisions is usually the most subjective aspect of an insurer’s accounts and may result 
in greater uncertainty within an insurer’s accounts than within those of many other businesses. The provisions for 
gross claims and related reinsurance recoveries have been assessed on the basis of the information currently available 
to the directors of each syndicate’s managing agent. However, ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent 
information and events and this may result in significant adjustments to the amounts provided. Adjustments to the 
amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the Financial Statements for the period in which 
the adjustments are made. The provisions are not discounted for the investment earnings that may be expected to 
arise in the future on the funds retained to meet the future liabilities. The methods used, and the estimates made, 
are reviewed regularly.
Quota share reinsurance
Under the Group’s quota share reinsurance agreement, 50% of the 2013 underwriting year of account insurance 
exposure is ceded to the reinsurer. Amounts payable to the reinsurer are included within ‘reinsurance premium ceded’ 
in the Consolidated Income Statement. Amounts receivable from the reinsurer and included within ‘reinsurers share 
of gross claims paid’ in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Unexpired risks provision
Provisions for unexpired risks are made where the costs of outstanding claims, related expenses and deferred acquisition 
costs are expected to exceed the unearned premium provision carried forward at the end of the reporting period. 
The provision for unexpired risks is calculated separately by reference to classes of business that are managed 
together, after taking into account relevant investment return. The provision is made on a syndicate-by-syndicate 
basis by the relevant managing agent.
Closed years of account
At the end of the third year, the underwriting account is normally closed by reinsurance into the following year of 
account. The amount of the reinsurance to close premium payable is determined by the managing agent, generally 
by estimating the cost of claims notified but not settled at 31 December, together with the estimated cost of claims 
incurred but not reported at that date and an estimate of future claims handling costs. Any subsequent variation 
in the ultimate liabilities of the closed year of account is borne by the underwriting year into which it is reinsured.
The payment of a reinsurance to close premium does not eliminate the liability of the closed year for outstanding 
claims. If the reinsuring syndicate were unable to meet any obligations, and the other elements of Lloyd’s chain 
of security were to fail, then the closed underwriting account would have to settle any outstanding claims.
The Directors consider that the likelihood of such a failure of the reinsurance to close is extremely remote and 
consequently the reinsurance to close has been deemed to settle the liabilities outstanding at the closure of an 
underwriting account. The Group will include its share of the reinsurance to close premiums payable as technical 
provisions at the end of the current period and no further provision is made for any potential variation in the ultimate 
liability of that year of account. Corporate governance Strategic report

2. Accounting policies continued
Underwriting continued
Run-off years of account
Where an underwriting year of account is not closed at the end of the third year (a “run-off” year of account) a provision 
is made for the estimated cost of all known and unknown outstanding liabilities of that year. The provision is determined 
initially by the managing agent on a similar basis to the reinsurance to close. However, any subsequent variation in the 
ultimate liabilities for that year remains with the corporate member participating therein. As a result any run-off year 
will continue to report movements in its results after the third year until such time as it secures a reinsurance to close.
Net operating expenses (including acquisition costs)
Net operating expenses include acquisition costs, profit and loss on exchange and other amounts incurred by the 
syndicates on which the Group participates.
Acquisition costs, comprising commission and other costs related to the acquisition of new insurance contracts, 
are deferred to the extent that they are attributable to premiums unearned at the end of the reporting period.
Foreign currency translation
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The Financial Statements 
are presented in thousands of pounds sterling, which is the Group’s functional and presentational currency.
Foreign currency transactions and non-monetary assets and liabilities, including deferred acquisition costs and 
unearned premiums, are translated into the functional currency using monthly average rates of exchange prevailing 
at the time of the transaction as a proxy for the transactional rates. The translation difference arising on non-monetary 
asset items is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Monetary items are translated at period-end rates; any exchange differences arising from the change in rates 
of exchange are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Investments
Investments in marketable securities are stated at their bid-market value at the end of the reporting period. 
The Group values its financial assets at fair value through the Consolidated Income Statement.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the date the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the assets.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets, which represents costs incurred in the Corporation of Lloyd’s auctions in order to acquire rights to 
participate on syndicates’ years of account, are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment, and amortised on 
a straight line basis over the useful economic life, which is estimated to be seven years. No amortisation is charged 
until the following year when underwriting commences in respect of the purchased syndicate participation.
Investment in subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally 
accompanying a shareholding or partnership participation of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence 
and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing 
whether the Group controls another entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
In the Company’s Financial Statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost and are reviewed 
for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value to be impaired.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed 
at the date of exchange. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is capitalised and recorded as goodwill. Following initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may be impaired and recognised directly in the consolidated income statement. If the cost of acquisition 
is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated 
income statement. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.  30 | Helios Underwriting plc | Annual report and financial statements 2013

2. Accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank.
Investment income
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable are accrued to the end of the period.
Syndicate investments and cash are held on a pooled basis, the return from which is allocated by the relevant 
managing agent to years of account proportionately to the funds contributed by the year of account.
Dividend distribution policy
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements 
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Other operating expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit and loss and other 
loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. The Group does not make 
use of the held to maturity and available for sale classifications.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss 
All financial assets are designated as fair value through profit and loss upon initial recognition because they are managed 
and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. Information about these financial assets is provided internally 
on a fair value basis to the Group’s key management. The Group’s investment strategy is to invest and evaluate their 
performance with reference to their fair values. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if expected to 
be settled with 12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current.
(b) Other loans and receivables
Other loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. Other loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost less any impairment losses.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the 
reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, 
dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regular occurring 
market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group 
is the current bid price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. 
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible 
on entity-specific estimates.
The fair values of short-term deposits are assumed to approximate to their book values. The fair values of the 
Group’s debt securities have been based on quoted market prices for these instruments. 
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Financial Statements. 
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of 
the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, has been identified as Nigel Hanbury. Corporate governance Strategic report

3. Risk management
The majority of the risks to the Group’s future cash flows arise from each subsidiary’s participation in the results of 
Lloyd’s syndicates. As detailed below, these risks are mostly managed by the managing agents of the syndicates. 
The Group’s role in managing this risk, in conjunction with its subsidiaries and members’ agent, is limited to selection 
of syndicate participations and monitoring performance of the syndicates and the purchase of appropriate member 
level reinsurance.
Syndicate risks
The syndicates’ activities expose them to a variety of financial and non-financial risks. The managing agent is responsible 
for managing the syndicate’s exposure to these risks and, where possible, introducing controls and procedures that 
mitigate the effects of the exposure to risk. For the purposes of setting capital requirements for the 2013 and subsequent 
years of account, Lloyd’ s introduced the Lloyd’ s Capital Return (“LCR”) which replaced the Individual Capital Assessment 
(“ICA”). Each managing agent will have prepared an LCR for the syndicate to agree capital requirements with Lloyd’s 
based on an agreed assessment of the risks impacting the syndicate’s business and the measures in place to manage 
and mitigate those risks from a quantitative and qualitative perspective. The risks described below are typically reflected in 
the LCR and typically the majority of the total assessed value of the risks concerned is attributable to insurance risk.
The insurance risks faced by a syndicate include the occurrence of catastrophic events, downward pressure on 
pricing of risks, reductions in business volumes and the risk of inadequate reserving. Reinsurance risks arise from 
the risk that a reinsurer fails to meet its share of a claim. The management of the syndicate’s funds is exposed 
to investment risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, currency risk and interest rate risk leading to financial loss. The syndicate 
is also exposed to regulatory and operational risks including its ability to continue to trade. However, supervision 
by Lloyd’s and the Prudential Regulation Authority provides additional controls over the syndicate’s management 
of risks.
The Group manages the risks faced by the syndicates on which its subsidiaries participate by monitoring the performance 
of the syndicates it supports. This commences in advance of committing to support a syndicate for the following year, 
with a review of the business plan prepared for each syndicate by its managing agent. In addition quarterly reports 
and annual accounts, together with any other information made available by the managing agent, are monitored and 
if necessary enquired into. If the Group considers that the risks being run by the syndicate are excessive it will seek 
confirmation from the managing agent that adequate management of the risk is in place and if considered appropriate 
will withdraw support from the next year of account. The Group also manages its exposure to insurance risk by 
purchasing appropriate member level reinsurance.
Reinsurance risk
Reinsurance risk to the Group arises where reinsurance contracts put in place to reduce gross insurance risk do not 
perform as anticipated, result in coverage disputes or prove inadequate in terms of the vertical or horizontal limits 
purchased. Failure of a reinsurer to pay a valid claim is considered a credit risk which is detailed separately below.
The Group currently only has one reinsurance programme of its own. With effect from the 2013 year of account, 
the Group benefits from a strategic collateralised quota share arrangement in respect of 50% of its business with 
Bermudan reinsurer, XL Re Ltd (“XL Re”, part of global NYSE quoted insurer XL Group plc) through Hampden 
Insurance PCC (Guernsey) Limited Cell 6 (“Cell 6”), a special purpose vehicle.
The board examines and approves all reinsurance contracts to ensure that they possess suitable security. Hampden 
Agencies Limited, the Group’s Lloyd’s Members’ Agency, and Miller Insurance Services LLP , as the Group’s reinsurance 
broker, ensure that market standard practice is followed, undertake the administration of reinsurance contracts and 
monitor and support the Group’s response to any erosion of its reinsurance programmes. 32 | Helios Underwriting plc | Annual report and financial statements 2013
Notes to the financial statements continued • Y ear ended 31 December 2013
3. Risk management continued 
Investment, credit, liquidity and currency risks
The other significant risks faced by the Group are with regard to the investment of funds within its own custody. 
The elements of these risks are investment risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. To mitigate 
this, the surplus Group funds are deposited with highly rated banks and fund managers. The main liquidity risk would 
arise if a syndicate had inadequate liquid resources for a large claim and sought funds from the Group to meet the claim. 
In order to minimise investment, credit and liquidity risk the Group’s funds are invested in readily realisable short-term 
deposits. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2013 is £6.8m (2012: £8.6m), being the 
aggregate of the Group’s insurance receivables, prepayments and accrued income, financial assets at fair value and 
cash and cash equivalents, excluding any amounts held in the syndicates. The syndicates can distribute their results 
in sterling, US dollars or a combination of the two. The Group is exposed to movements in the US dollar between 
the balance sheet date and the distribution of the underwriting profits and losses, which is usually in the May following 
the closure of a year of account. The Group does not use derivative instruments to manage risk and, as such, no 
hedge accounting is applied. As a result of the specific nature and structure of the Group’s collateralised quota share 
reinsurance arrangement with XL Re through Cell 6, the Group’ s Funds at Lloyd’ s calculation benefits from an aggregate 
£4.1m Letter of Credit (“LOC”) acceptable to Lloyd’s, on behalf of XL Re and from a global bank that is one of the 
primary providers of LOCs into the Lloyd’s market. This LOC is pledged in aggregate to the relevant syndicates 
through Lloyd’s and thus HUW is not specifically exposed to counter-party credit risk in this matter. Should the 
bank’s LOC become unacceptable to Lloyd’s for any reason, XL Re is responsible under the terms of the contract 
for making alternative arrangements. The contract is annually renewable and the Group has a contingency plan in 
place in the event of non-renewal under both normal and adverse market conditions.
Market risk
The Group is exposed to market and liquidity risk in respect of its holdings of syndicate participations. Lloyd’s syndicate 
participations are traded in the Lloyd’s auctions held in September and October each year. The Group is exposed to 
changes in market prices and a lack of liquidity in the trading of a particular syndicate’s capacity which could result 
in the Group making a loss compared to the carrying value when the Group disposes of particular syndicate participations.
Regulatory risks 
The Company’s subsidiaries are subject to continuing approval by Lloyd’s to be a member of a Lloyd’s syndicate. 
The risk of this approval being removed is mitigated by monitoring and fully complying with all requirements in 
relation to membership of Lloyd’s. The capital requirements to support the proposed amount of syndicate capacity 
for future years are subject to the requirements of Lloyd’s. A variety of factors are taken into account by Lloyd’s in 
setting these requirements including market conditions and syndicate performance and, although the process is 
intended to be fair and reasonable, the requirements can fluctuate from one year to the next, which may constrain 
the volume of underwriting a subsidiary of the Company is able to support. 
The Company is subject to the AIM Rules. Compliance with the AIM Rules is monitored by the Board.
Operational risks
As there are relatively few transactions actually undertaken by the Group there are only limited systems and operational 
requirements of the Group and therefore operational risks are not considered to be significant. Close involvement of 
all Directors in the Group’s key decision making and the fact that the majority of the Group’s operations are conducted 
by syndicates provide control over any remaining operational risks.
Capital management objectives, policies and approach
The Group has established the following capital management objectives, policies and approach to managing the 
risks that affect its capital position:
 » to maintain the required level of stability of the Group thereby providing a degree of security to shareholders;
 » to allocate capital efficiently and support the development of the business by ensuring that returns on capital 
employed meet the requirements of the shareholders; and
 » to maintain the financial strength to support increases in the Group’s underwriting through acquisition of capacity 
in the Lloyd’s auctions or through the acquisition of new subsidiaries.
The Group’s capital management policy is to hold a sufficient level of capital to allow the Group to take advantage of 
market conditions, particularly when insurance rates are improving and to meet the Funds at Lloyd’ s (“FAL”) requirements 
that support the corporate member subsidiaries current and future levels of underwriting. Corporate governance Strategic report

Approach to capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists entirely of equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising 
issued share capital, share premium and retained earnings as disclosed in the Statements of changes in shareholders’ 
equity on page 23.
At 31 December 2013 the corporate member subsidiaries had an agreed FAL requirement of £11,088,000 
(2012: £7,173,000) to support their underwriting on the 2014 year of account (2013 year of account). The funds 
to support this requirement are held in short-term investment funds and deposits or provided by the quota share 
reinsurance capital providers by way of a letter of credit. The FAL requirements are formally assessed and funded 
twice yearly and must be met by the corporate member subsidiaries to continue underwriting. At 31 December 2013 
the agreed FAL requirement for the Group was 61% (2012: 56%) of the capacity for the following year of account.

Assumptions, changes in assumptions and sensitivity
As described in Note 3 the majority of the risks to the Group’s future cash flows arise from its subsidiaries’ participation 
in the results of Lloyd’s syndicates and are mostly managed by the managing agents of the syndicates. The Group’s 
role in managing these risks, in conjunction with the Groups members’ agent, is limited to a selection of syndicate 
participations and monitoring the performance of the syndicates and their managing agents.
The amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are calculated by the managing agents of the 
syndicates and derived from accounting information provided by the managing agents and reported upon by the 
syndicate auditors. 
The key assumptions underlying the amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are:
 » the claims reserves calculated by the managing agents are accurate; and
 » the potential deterioration of run-off year results has been fully provided for by the managing agents.
There have been no changes in assumptions in 2013.
The amounts carried by the Group arising from insurance contracts are sensitive to various factors as follows:
 » a 10% increase/decrease in the managing agents’ calculation of gross claims reserves will decrease/increase 
the Group’s pre-tax profits by £2,160,000 (2012: £1,981,000);
 » a 10% increase/decrease in the managing agents’ calculation of net claims reserves will decrease/increase 
the Group’s pre-tax profits by £1,744,000 (2012: £1,549,000); and
 » a 10% increase/decrease in the run-off year net claims reserves will decrease/increase the Group’s pre-tax profits 
by £13,000 (2012: £12,000).
The 10% movement has been selected to give an indication of the possible variations in the assumptions used. 36 | Helios Underwriting plc | Annual report and financial statements 2013

As set out in Note 19 the Group acquired four new limited liability vehicles for cash in the year. When the Group 
acquires new limited liability vehicles for cash it looks to acquire the vehicle for adjusted net assets, accordingly, 
the Directors do not expect any material amounts of positive or negative goodwill to arise. In the circumstances 
where small amounts of positive goodwill arise they are immediately impaired and written off through the 
Consolidated Income Statement. 40 | Helios Underwriting plc | Annual report and financial statements 2013

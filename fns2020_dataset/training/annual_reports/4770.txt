generate a high level of referral and
organic revenue growth;
• continuing to control our 
operating costs;
• selective acquisition of additional
funeral locations;
• national marketing, principally through
affinity partners, of pre–arranged 
funeral plans; and
• developing, managing or acquiring
additional crematoria where possible.

Dignity at a glance
The Group’s operations are managed across three main areas, namely 
funeral services, crematoria and pre-arranged funeral plans. We aim to achieve
our business objectives in a caring and responsible manner, recognising the
economic, social and environmental impact of our activities.
Funeral services
Funeral services revenues relate to 
the provision of funerals and ancillary
items such as memorials and floral
tributes. We operate a network of 
546 funeral locations throughout 
the United Kingdom trading under
established local trading names.  
In 2009, the Group conducted 
65,000 funerals, which represents
approximately 12 per cent of
estimated total deaths in Britain. 
Business overview
Crematoria
Pre-arranged funeral plans
Business overview
Business overview
Crematoria revenues arise from
cremation services and the sale of
memorials and burial plots at the
Group’s crematoria and cemeteries.
We are the largest single operator of
crematoria in Britain. We operate 30
crematoria in England and Scotland
and carried out 42,700 cremations 
in 2009 representing 8 per cent of
estimated total deaths in Britain.
Pre-arranged funeral plans income
represents amounts covering the 
costs of marketing and administering
the sales of plans. Pre-arranged
funeral plans allow people to plan 
and pay for their funeral in advance.
The Group has a strong market
presence in the provision of pre-
arranged funeral plans with 216,000
unfulfilled funeral plans as at 25
December 2009. Dignity works with a
number of reputable affinity partners.

Despite the difficult times experienced by the UK
economy in 2009, Dignity has delivered its fifth
consecutive period of growth as a public company.
Underlying operating profits have increased 8 per cent to
£56.4 million (2008: £52.1 million). Underlying earnings
per share have increased 6 per cent to 40.5 pence per
share (2008: 38.2 pence per share). The rate of earnings
per share growth is lower than operating profit growth
because of the dilutive effect of the reduced bank interest
receivable in 2009.
This performance is attributable to progress in each 
aspect of the Group’s strategy, which is explained further
throughout this report. 
Dividends
The Board has proposed that a final dividend of 8.07
pence per Ordinary Share should be paid from profits
generated in 2009. This will be paid on 25 June 2010 to
members on the register at close of business on 28 May
2010 provided shareholder consent is obtained at the
Annual General Meeting on 4 June 2010.
This will result in a total dividend of 12.1 pence per
Ordinary Share (2008: 11.0 pence per Ordinary Share) in
respect of profits generated in 2009. This represents an
increase of 10 per cent and is consistent with the rate 
of increase made in each year since flotation.
The Board
I am delighted that James Newman and Bill Forrester have
agreed to remain as Non-Executive Directors for a further
two years following the expiration of their contracts on 
31 March 2010. Consequently, there are no changes to 
the Board and I thank each of my fellow Directors for their
commitment and support during the year.
Our people
This is a business dedicated to providing each family 
we serve with excellent client service. Whilst this requires
continued investment in our properties and our fleet, at 
its core is our staff. 
I would like to thank all members of staff for their individual
contributions during the year which help to make Dignity
such a successful Group.
Outlook for 2010
The current year has started well and the Group’s
performance is in line with the Board’s expectations. 
The first quarter of 2010 is expected to be more consistent
with the average of the last five years than was the case
last year when there was an unusually high number of
deaths in the first quarter.
The outlook for the full year remains positive.
Chairman’s statement
“Dignity has delivered its fifth 
consecutive period of growth 
as a public company.”
Peter Hindley, Chairman
04 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Delivering profitable growth and building value 
for shareholders
Our performance in 2009 has been strong with underlying
operating profits increasing 8 per cent. This reflects steady
growth in funeral operations and strong growth in
crematoria and pre-arranged funeral plans.
This growth can be directly linked to the continued success
of our long-standing strategy.
Continued commitment to client service excellence
Once again, our survey results indicate that 98 per cent 
of families we serve would either definitely or probably
recommend our services. This continues to be an excellent
result and is a clear indication of our commitment to client
service excellence. 
Continuing to control our operating costs
As a Group, whilst revenues have increased 5 per cent, cost
of sales and administrative expenses have increased by
less than 4 per cent.  
The Group’s continued focus on cost control is no better
demonstrated than in funeral operations this year. Whilst
revenues have only grown 1 per cent, operating expenses
have essentially remained flat year on year. This is an
excellent performance given the business has relatively 
high operational leverage.
Selective acquisitions of additional funeral locations
Seven funeral locations have been acquired during the
period. Whilst this is fewer than recent years, the locations
continue to add shareholder value from the time of
acquisition. 
National marketing, principally through affinity partners, 
of pre-arranged funeral plans
I am pleased that our focus on cost efficient marketing has
delivered such strong results, with the division adding a net
12,000 plans to the backlog of unfulfilled plans, which now
stands at 216,000. The majority of these plans continue to
represent incremental business to the Group.
Developing, managing or acquiring additional 
crematoria where possible
2009 has seen a number of developments in this area. 
At the beginning of the year, we acquired five new crematoria.
In addition, we have completed the refurbishment works at
Rotherham where we have taken over the operation of the
location from the council. We have also started building a
new crematorium in Cambridgeshire and since the end of
the year, started to build a new crematorium in Somerset.
Valuing our people
I am very appreciative of the staff that work at Dignity.
Each of them is involved in a different way, in serving
families at a time of great need with the utmost care,
dedication and professionalism.
I am delighted that as a result of our operating performance,
we have been able to recognise their personal contributions
again this year with discretionary payments totalling £1.5
million, an increase of 15 per cent over last year.
At the heart of our local communities
Each of our 546 funeral locations and 30 crematoria
provide a service that places them at the heart of their
local community. Our staff and our infrastructure allow
each business to help people through one of the most
difficult times in their lives, with compassion, respect,
openness and care. 
I am proud that Dignity is the company that so many
families know that they can trust at their time of need.
Chief Executive’s overview
“This growth can be directly linked 
to the continued success of our 
long-standing strategy.”
Mike McCollum, Chief Executive
05 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Introduction
The Group’s operations are managed across three main
areas; funeral services, crematoria and pre-arranged
funeral plans, which respectively represent 75 per cent,
19 per cent and 6 per cent of the Group’s revenues.
Funeral services revenues relate to the provision of
funerals and ancillary items, such as memorials and 
floral tributes. Crematoria revenues arise from cremation
services and the sale of memorials and burial plots at the
Group’s crematoria and cemeteries. Pre-arranged funeral
plan income represents amounts to cover the costs of
marketing and administering the sale of plans.
Office for National Statistics data
Some of the Group’s key performance indicators rely on
the total number of estimated deaths for each period.
This information is obtained from the Office for National
Statistics (ONS).
The initial publication of recorded total estimated 
deaths in Britain for 2009 was 545,000 (2008: 553,000).
Historically, the ONS has updated these estimates from
time to time. As in previous years, the Group does not
restate any of its key performance indicators when these
figures are restated in the following year.
Funeral services
Overview
The Group operates a network of 546 (2008: 544) funeral
locations throughout the United Kingdom, trading under
local established names. During the period, the Group
conducted 65,000 funerals (2008: 68,700). Approximately
1 per cent of these funerals were conducted in Northern
Ireland. Excluding Northern Ireland, these funerals represent
approximately 11.8 per cent (2008: 12.3 per cent) of
total estimated deaths in Britain.
Whilst funerals divided by estimated deaths is a reasonable
measure of our market share, the Group does not have a
complete national presence. Consequently, this calculation
can only ever be an estimate. However, the decline year
on year is not outside the range of historic variations.
Developments
2009 has been a steady year for funeral operations.
Underlying operating profits were £47.3 million (2008:
£46.3 million), an increase of 2 per cent. This increase 
is smaller than that seen historically and reflects the
combination of the reduced number of funerals performed,
which has been offset by good cost control. The contribution
from locations acquired in the period was not significant.
Discretionary spend on funerals has been very robust.
Reported operating profits were £48.4 million (2008:
£47.4 million), an increase of 2 per cent. The difference
between statutory amounts and underlying amounts is
represented by profit on sale of fixed assets of £1.1 million
(2008: £1.1 million).
This performance emphasises the importance of
our core portfolio, which has driven the majority of
operating growth in recent years. These locations have
benefited from continued investment, with a total of
approximately £6.3 million being invested in the period
on the refurbishment of our properties and the ongoing
renewal of 94 of our fleet of hearses, limousines and
other vehicles.
The operating results reflect the high level of client
service we try to provide to each family we serve. 
This service level continues to be high according to our
customer survey results and is a credit to the staff within
the business. Approximately 89 per cent of responding
families would definitely recommend our services and 
a further 9 per cent would probably do so.

Providing a vital role in the local

role in the communities we serve. Many families return to 
us in their time of grief because they know they can rely on 
Dignity to provide practical advice and take care of all the
arrangements.”

Helping our staff to provide the best possible service
The Group operates a network of over 540 funeral locations throughout the United
Kingdom. Many of these branches have been established in their local community for
many generations, such as Frederick W Paine in South West London, who marked 
their 125th anniversary in 2009. 
Approximately £6.3 million has been invested on the refurbishment of our properties 
and the ongoing renewal of our fleet of hearses, limousines and other vehicles. This
investment in our property portfolio and vehicles help our staff to provide the best
possible service to our clients.
Below: Tom Leather, Funeral Service Operative, Middleton & Wood, Wigan.
We continue to invest in our locations and ﬂeet  Six locations (2008: five locations) were closed in 
the period. This reflects the disposal of some valuable
freehold locations for cash that can be reinvested in 
the business and also some smaller locations at the end
of their leases where it was not profitable to continue
operation because of the low volumes being performed.
During the period, one location (2008: nil) was opened in
Norfolk, which trades using a highly regarded local name.
Acquisition spend has been lower than usual, with £4.5
million invested in acquiring seven funeral locations in the
United Kingdom. This follows two years of significantly
higher spend than average. The Board believes this to 
be a reflection of a lower number of businesses being
available for acquisition.
Each of these acquisitions met the Group’s criteria of
being larger than average, long-established businesses
that fit well within the Group’s existing network.
The Group continues to seek businesses that meet the
Group’s stringent acquisition criteria and has acquired
two funeral locations since the end of 2009. 
Crematoria
Overview
The Group is the largest single operator of crematoria in
Britain, operating 30 (2008: 25) crematoria. The Group
performed 42,700 cremations (2008: 39,600) in the
period, representing 7.8 per cent (2008: 7.2 per cent) 
of deaths in Britain.
Developments
Operating profits were £17.6 million (2008: £14.6
million), an increase of 21 per cent. This reflects a strong
performance from the 22 crematoria owned by the Group
for many years, together with the full year effect of the
recent acquisitions.
Work has started at four locations to install new mercury
abatement equipment required under new legislation. 
The Group has also taken the opportunity in these cases
to replace the existing cremators at the same time.
Planning was focused on minimising any inconvenience
for the families using our facilities. The first location is
expected to have completed works in the first quarter 
of 2010 and the Group expects to be fully compliant by
the end of 2012 as required by legislation. The Group
continues to improve the facilities at all of its locations
and including new cremators, has spent £1.7 million
(2008: £0.8 million) in the period. 
During the period, the Group has started to build a new
crematorium in Cambridgeshire and since the period 
end, has started to build a crematorium in Somerset.
These sites will reach maturity in approximately three 
to five years. 
The Group continues to identify further locations suitable
for a new crematorium and is also continuing to seek
partnerships with local authorities.

emissions from our crematoria by

08 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Minimising our environmental impact on local surroundings
Maintaining the quality of the environment in which we all live is an important concern to
Dignity and we recognise the impact of our operations on local surroundings. Our aim is
to reduce this impact and operate in an environmentally responsible manner. 
As part of this commitment, we are investing approximately £7 million in our crematoria
to conform with the Government directive to reduce mercury emissions from crematoria
by 50 per cent by the end of 2012. The installation of new equipment will be managed
so as to ensure there is minimal disruption to our usual services.

09 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Pre-arranged funeral plans
Overview
The Group continues to have a strong market presence 
in this area. These plans represent future incremental
business for the funeral division, as the Group expects 
to perform the majority of these funerals.
Developments
The division has performed strongly in the period.
Focused marketing activity with its partners has resulted
in the number of unfulfilled pre-arranged funeral plans
increasing to 216,000 (2008: 204,000) with profits in the
division increasing to £2.0 million excluding Recoveries
(2008: £1.0 million excluding Recoveries). 
From time to time, the Group receives monies from
certain of the Trusts, in line with the relevant Trust’s
deed, which have been assessed by the trustees as not
required to ensure the Trust has sufficient assets to 
meet its future liabilities in respect of current members
(‘Recoveries’). Recoveries were £1.5 million in each period.
The Group has continued to work hard at developing its
portfolio of affinity partners and has formed a number 
of new partnerships in the period with organisations in
the retail and financial services arena. 
During the period, one of the Group’s partners, Age
Concern England, merged with Help the Aged to form a
new charity, Age UK. Prior to the merger, the Group did
not have an operational relationship with Help the Aged.
However, following the merger, the Group has extended
the marketing arrangements in place prior to the merger
to cover Age UK as a whole until 2019. The Group is also
in discussion with a number of new potential partners
with marketing tests planned for 2010. 
Central overheads
Overview
Head office costs relate to central services that are not
specifically attributed to a particular operational division.
These include the provision of IT , finance, personnel and
Directors’ emoluments. In addition and consistent with
previous periods, the Group records the costs of incentive
bonus arrangements, such as Long Term Incentive Plans
(LTIPs) and annual performance bonuses, which are
provided to over 50 managers working across the business.
Developments 
Costs in the period were £12.0 million (2008: £11.3
million), an increase of 6 per cent. This year on year
increase principally reflects the additional cost of bonuses
paid to the operational managers of the business and
certain one off legal fees following the new Companies
Act and also the resetting of the Group’s LTIP scheme.

Services Director, is accountable for corporate and social
responsibility and under this remit, he identifies major
issues and reports these to his fellow Board members. 
This is done by either regular Board updates in the case 
of Health and Safety or ad hoc reports when required.
Supporting our staff
Our employees are critical to the continued success 
of Dignity and staff turnover remains low within the Group.
The average length of service for staff is seven years with
many staff having served for considerably longer. There is
an equal split of male and female staff and the average age
of our employees is 46 years. We are committed to high
standards of employment practice and aim to encourage,
retain and develop successful employees.
In early 2010, the Board of Directors adopted a Code of
Conduct which applies to all staff within the Group. This
defines and explains the standards of behaviour that the
staff of Dignity are expected to adhere to. The Code of
Conduct is also published on the Dignity plc investor
website – www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk.
The Group provides direct support to employees through
both in-house training and external training courses.
External training includes both relevant job training and
tutoring for professional qualifications. These professional
qualifications include the NAFD (National Association of
Funeral Directors) Diploma and Membership of the BIE
(British Institute of Embalmers). In addition, the Group has
five members of staff who are accredited NAFD tutors and
three BIE training specialists.
The Group provides additional support to staff development
through its Welfare Trust, which provides funds for
professional training and hardship grants. The Trust has
approximately £1.6 million available for future use.
Dignity publishes a quarterly in-house magazine, ‘Dignity
Express’, which is supplemented by monthly news bulletins
to keep all employees informed of what is happening within
the Group. ‘Dignity Express’ is also circulated to the Group’s
retired employees. News, useful information and background
on the Group is also available to staff via a dedicated
employee website.
Health and Safety
Effective heath and safety management is critical to 
the Group and a key priority of the Directors. Its operations 
are conducted at all times in such a way as to ensure, 
as far as is reasonably practical, the health, safety and
welfare of all our employees and all persons who may 
be attending our premises.
Dignity is committed to the prevention of accidents and
regularly reviews and updates procedures and training with
a view to ensuring that staff minimise any risks associated
with their role.
The Group has a full-time Health and Safety Manager 
who is dedicated to these issues and is supported by a
Health and Safety Consultant and Health & Safety Officer.
Regional Health & Safety Officers have been appointed 
in each of the geographical trading areas and the
manufacturing facility also has its own Health and Safety
Manager. All of these managers and officers are either

which we work has been one of our 
key priorities over the past year .”

We are supporting our staff through 
on-going training and development
“The Group have supported me with all my training and
development needs, enabling me to be successful in achieving
qualifications with the British Institute of Embalmers. I am 
now offering complimentary tuition to those Dignity employees
where it is appropriate to their role at the Leicester School 
of Embalming.”

NEBOSH (National Examination Board in Occupational
Safety and Health) qualified or are scheduled to take 
these examinations. There are also 90 Health and Safety 
Co-ordinators embedded into the business.
In 2009, Dignity continued to implement its Health 
and Safety training programme ranging from a one-day
introduction course to the four-day IOSH (Institution of
Occupational Safety and Health) course. During the year,
Richard Portman was trained to IOSH Managing Safely
Certificate standard in addition to 32 of the Group’s senior
and middle managers. 50 per cent of junior managers have
also been trained to Level 2 Health and Safety Certificate
standard. This programme will continue in 2010 to enable
all managers, where appropriate, to have an understanding 
of their health and safety responsibilities.
During 2009 Dignity published its Health and Safety manual
and distributed this to all locations.
Environment
Our business continues to have a low environmental
impact and its activities are not expected to give rise to any
significant environmental risk over the next twelve months.
Maintaining the quality of the environment in which we 
all live is an important concern for Dignity and all areas 
of the business operate in accordance with the Group’s
environmental policy. We recognise the impact of our
operations on local surroundings and our aim is to reduce
this and operate in an environmentally friendly manner.
Dignity will invest a total of approximately £7 million in 
its crematoria to conform to the government directive to
reduce mercury emissions from crematoria by 50 per cent
before the end of 2012. Specialist technology has been
installed to filter out the mercury gasses emitted during
cremation and collect it in dedicated drums, which are 
then transported to specialist disposal centres. The
installation of the new equipment has been managed 
so as to ensure there is minimal disruption to our usual
services at the crematoria.
As part of the investigation into the options for installing 
a new drainage system at Surrey & Sussex Crematorium, 
it was decided that the system could also be used for water
harvesting. Water is now extracted from the land drainage
network at times when the water table is high and stored 
for times of need, such as the summer. This enables the
crematorium to maintain a watering regime that keeps the
Gardens of Remembrance looking attractive throughout the
year. As with the mercury abatement project, the sensitivity
of the site required that all work was completed with
deference to existing interment plots and families using 
our facilities.
All raw materials used in the manufacture of our coffins 
are sourced from well-managed and sustainable sources.
In 2009, Dignity gained FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)
accreditation for our veneered coffins, which account for 
23 per cent of demand. Consequently, 91 per cent of the
coffins used by the Dignity business are now manufactured
from FSC accredited timber at the Group’s facility in East
Yorkshire which provides 46 jobs in an area of high
unemployment.
In 2009, Dignity submitted its data to the Carbon Disclosure
Project that measures disclosures from large UK companies
and Dignity aims to reduce its future carbon footprint.
Dignity has reduced its Pre-Need print wastage by 77 per
cent this year. This was achieved by more accurately
managing stock levels and reprint volumes.
The Group and its employees undertake to act whenever
necessary to meet or exceed the standards of current
We are minimising our impact 
on the local environment
“As part of our commitment to the environment, at Surrey 
& Sussex Crematorium we installed a new land drainage 
system which could also harvest water, enabling it to be
extracted at times when the water table is high and used to 
water the grounds during the summer. This initiative helps 
the crematorium to maintain a watering regime that keeps 
the Gardens of Remembrance looking attractive to visitors
throughout the year.”

training programme ranging from a one-day introduction course
to the four-day IOSH course. 32 of the Group’s senior and
middle managers have been trained to IOSH Managing Safely
Certificate standard over the past 12 months.”

policies, systems and services to this end. All waste
generated is properly disposed of in accordance with
current legislation and steps are taken to recycle waste
wherever this is practical.
In our communities
Everyone at Dignity is extremely committed not only to
making a real difference to our clients but also to improving
the welfare of all who live within the communities we serve.
To demonstrate our values and principles our staff support
hundreds of local initiatives, good causes, clubs and events
every year. By listening to and understanding the needs 
of local communities our staff are able to respond by
providing help where it is most needed.
For example, our funeral directors in Ebbw Vale helped 
to develop a memorial garden for the families of local
miners and F C Wood in Kent worked with the local Gurkha
community to establish the first burial ground in the UK for
Gurkha veterans. There are also many bowling and football
clubs that have benefited from sponsorship and financial
support during the last twelve months. Once again Dignity
staff from across the UK took part in the Easter Egg challenge
and collected 3,200 chocolate gifts to distribute to those
less fortunate. 
We believe in encouraging our staff to communicate
regularly with clubs, social groups and good causes by
providing advice and practical support for those who want 
to give something back to their local community.
Supporting charities
In 2009, Dignity employees continued to raise funds 
for the staff elected charity – Help the Hospices. This
worthy cause is the national membership charity for the
hospice movement, supporting over 240 local hospices in
their vital work caring for people with terminal illnesses. 
There were many fund raising initiatives held nationwide
during the year including memorial services, tea parties, car
washes and dinner dances whilst some athletic employees
raised money by taking part in sporting challenges such as
Race For Life, the Great North Run, Malvern By Moonlight
and Race the Sun.
Dignity staff have elected Children’s Hospices UK as our
corporate charity for 2010. Over 1,000 employees took part
in the decision making process to choose which charity to
support. Children’s Hospices UK is the national charity that
gives a voice to and support to all children’s hospice services
and their vision is for every child and young person who 
is not expected to reach adulthood to have access to the
highest standards of care and support close to home. 
There are 41 children’s hospices in the UK and they provide
care for approximately 20,000 children each year.
In September, Dignity employees raised over £4,400 for
Macmillan Cancer Care by being part of the ‘World’s 
biggest coffee morning’ event.
The heroes of our armed services were commemorated 
in November with window dressings and numerous poppy
appeals raising much-needed funds for the Royal British
Legion. Rotherham Crematorium held its first Armistice 
Day Service, which was attended by local dignitaries and
over 50 members of the local Royal British Legion and
Veteran’s Association.
Our four charity fairground organs continued to be a vital
aid in fund raising activities and in 2009 almost £68,000
was raised for a variety of national and local charities.

Financial highlights
The Group’s financial performance is summarised below: 
Increase
2009 2008 %
Revenue (£million) 184.7 175.8 5
Underlying operating profit* (£million) 56.4 52.1 8
Underlying profit before tax* (£million) 36.4 34.3 6
Underlying earnings per share* (pence) 40.5 38.2 6
Cash generated from operations (£million) 65.3 62.3 5
Operating profit (£million) 57.5 53.2 8
Profit before tax (£million) 37.5 35.4 6
Basic earnings per share (pence) 41.8 38.8 8
Dividends paid in the period:
Interim dividend (pence) 4.03 3.66 10
Final dividend (pence) 7.34 6.67 10
*Underlying amounts exclude profit on sale of fixed assets and 
exceptional tax items.
The Board has proposed a dividend of 8.07 pence per
Ordinary Share as a final distribution of profits relating to
2009 to be paid in 2010. This brings the total dividend in
respect of the profits generated in 2009 to 12.1 pence
per share, an increase of 10 per cent.
Capital structure and financing
The Group’s principal source of long term debt financing
is the Class A and B Secured Notes, rated A and BBB
respectively.
The Board considers that maintaining a leveraged balance
sheet is appropriate for the Group, given the highly stable
and predictable nature of its cash flows. This predictability
is matched in the Secured Notes. The principal and interest
on the Secured Notes amortise fully over their life and are
completely repaid by 2031. The interest rate is fixed for
the life of the Secured Notes and interest is calculated 
on the outstanding principal.
This has the benefit of maximising shareholder returns,
whilst leaving sufficient flexibility to invest in the growth 
of the business.
The Group is also fully drawn on a £10 million crematoria
acquisition facility, which was used to fund the acquisition
of five crematoria locations in the last quarter of 2008.
The principal on this facility is repayable in one amount in
November 2013 and interest is either fixed or capped at
approximately 5.6 per cent. All interest is payable in cash
on a quarterly basis.
As set out in note 24, the Group’s gross debt outstanding
was £283.2 million (2008: £286.3 million). Net debt was
£247.1 million (2008: £249.3 million). The reduction 
in net debt reflects the repayment of principal on the
Secured Notes, the drawing down of the remaining £2.6
million under the crematoria acquisition facility and the
Group’s continued strong cash generation.
The Group’s finance expense substantially consists of the
interest on the Class A and B Secured Notes and ancillary
instruments. The net finance cost in the period relating to
these instruments was £19.6 million (2008: £19.9 million).
Interest costs of £0.4 million (2008: £nil million) were
incurred in respect of the crematoria acquisition facility.
Other ongoing finance costs incurred in the period
amounted to £0.8 million (2008: £0.9 million), including
the unwinding of discounts on the Group’s provisions and
other financial liabilities. 
Interest receivable on bank deposits was £0.5 million
(2008: £2.3 million). These receipts are a direct reflection
of the Bank of England Base Rate, which was 0.5 per cent
for the majority of 2009 following the sharp reductions in
Base Rate at the end of 2008.
Net finance income of £0.3 million (2008: £0.7 million)
was recognised in respect of the Group’s pension scheme
in accordance with IAS 19.
16 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Underlying profit after tax 
The Board believes that, whilst statutory reporting
measures provide a useful indication of the financial
performance of the Group, additional insight is gained 
by excluding certain non-recurring or non-trading
transactions. Accordingly, the following information is
presented to aid understanding of the performance 
of the Group:
52 week period 52 week period

Shares in issue during the period (million) 63.7 63.4
Underlying EPS (pence) 40.5p 38.2p
Increase in underlying EPS (per cent) 6% 14%
Earnings per share 
The Group’s earnings were £26.6 million (2008: £24.6
million). Basic earnings per share were 41.8 pence per
share (2008: 38.8 pence per share).
The Group’s measures of underlying performance exclude
the effect (after tax) of the profit on disposal of fixed
assets and exceptional items. Consequently, underlying
profit after tax was £25.8 million (2008: £24.2 million),
giving underlying earnings per share of 40.5 pence per
share (2008: 38.2 pence per share), an increase of 
6 per cent.
The rate of earnings per share growth is lower than
operating profit growth because of the dilutive effect 
of the reduced bank interest receivable. 
The average number of shares increased year on year as 
a result of the 2006 LTIP scheme maturing in the period.
Cash flow and cash balances
Cash generated from operations was £65.3 million (2008:
£62.3 million), demonstrating that the Group continues 
to convert its profits into cash.
Overall, acquisition activity in the period was higher than
average, with £13.3 million (2008: £31.5 million) being
spent on funeral and crematoria acquisitions. 
Capital expenditure increased year on year, with £17.2
million (2008: £11.2 million) being spent on the purchase
of property, plant and equipment.
This is analysed as:

Partly funded by:

The amounts described above on the mercury abatement
project represent the initial capital expenditure incurred to
comply with new legislation. The total anticipated capital
expenditure is approximately £7 million. The project will
be completed by the end of 2012.
The Group also paid dividends totalling £7.2 million
(2008: £6.5 million) in the period.
Cash balances at the end of the period were £45.8 million
(2008: £46.7 million). £12.5 million represents amounts
legally set aside to fund the Group’s liabilities to Class A
and B Secured Noteholders. This payment was made on
31 December 2009, which falls in the Group’s 2010
financial year as it reports on a 52 week basis rather than
on a calendar year. These funds do not qualify as cash or

cash equivalents for the purposes of IAS 7, Cash Flow
Statements. Accordingly, £9.9 million has been reported
within the cash flow statement as ‘Payments to restricted
bank accounts for finance costs’ and £2.6 million has
been reported as ‘Payments to restricted bank accounts
for repayment of borrowings’.
£1.5 million (2008: £1.5 million) represents amounts
received as Recoveries from the pre-arranged funeral 
plan trusts. These amounts are legally required, under 
the terms of the Group’s securitisation, to be retained 
in a separate bank account for one year following receipt
and do not therefore meet the definition of cash for cash
flow reporting purposes.
Approximately £11 million of the remaining cash balance
is immediately available for acquisitions and developments.
Approximately £18 million has also been set aside for
future corporation tax and dividend payments. However,
these funds could be used for further acquisitions if
suitable opportunities arose, with statutory payments
being funded out of future operating cash flows.
Further details and analysis of the Group’s cash balances
are included in note 15 to the consolidated financial
statements.
Pensions
The balance sheet shows a surplus of £9.1 million before
deferred tax (2008: £13.2 million). This decrease year 
on year is principally a result of the reduction in the
discount rate, reflecting market conditions at the balance
sheet date.
The scheme remains open to both new and existing
members of staff.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate in the period was 29 per
cent (2008: 29.5 per cent). This rate is expected to remain
constant in the absence of any legislative changes.
Key performance indicators
The Group uses a number of performance indicators to

Forward-looking statements
Certain statements in this Annual Report are forward-
looking. Although the Board believes that the expectations
reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable,
it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove
to have been correct. Because these statements involve
risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially
from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements.
18 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Principal risks and uncertainties
Operational risk management
Significant reduction in the death rate
There is a risk that the number of deaths in any year
significantly reduces. This would have a direct result 
on the financial performance of both the funerals and
crematoria divisions.
However, the profile of deaths has historically followed 
a similar profile to that predicted by the ONS, giving the
Group the ability to plan its business accordingly.
Nationwide adverse publicity
Nationwide adverse publicity could result in a significant
reduction in the number of funerals or cremations performed
in any financial period. This would have a direct result on
the financial performance of that division.
However, this risk is addressed by ensuring appropriate
policies and procedures are in place, which are designed 
to ensure client service excellence. These policies and
procedures retain flexibility for the business to serve
families in accordance with local traditions.
Ability to increase average revenues per funeral 
or cremation
Operating profit growth is in part attributable to the
Group’s ability to increase the average revenue per funeral
or cremation. There can be no guarantee that future
average revenues per funeral or cremation will increase 
at rates similar to previous periods.
However, the Group believes that its focus on client service
excellence helps to mitigate this risk.
Significant reduction in market share
It is possible that other external factors, such as new
competitors, could result in a significant reduction in
market share within funeral or crematoria operations. 
This would have a direct result on the financial 
performance of that division.
However, the Group believes that this risk is mitigated 
for funeral operations by reputation and recommendation
being a key driver to the choice of funeral director being
used and for crematoria operations is mitigated by
difficulties associated with building new crematoria.
Financial risk management
An assessment of the Group’s exposure to financial risks
and a description of how these risks are managed are
included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Group manages the operational and financial risks
described through a combination of regular Board reports
and also monthly and weekly management information 
that is reviewed by the Executive Directors.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual

and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the
Directors have prepared the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, 
and have elected to prepare the parent company financial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the
Directors must not approve the financial statements
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent; and
• State whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union
and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the Group and parent Company
financial statements respectively.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the Group’s websites. Legislation in the United
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are
listed on page 20 of the Annual Report, confirm that, 
to the best of each person’s knowledge and belief:
• The Group and parent Company financial statements,
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU and UK GAAP respectively, give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of
the Group; and
• The Directors’ report contained in the Annual Report
includes a fair review of the development and performance
of the business and the position of the Group, together
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties
it faces.
Principal activities and business review 
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of
funeral services including funeral directing, crematoria
operation and the marketing and administration of 
pre-arranged funeral plans. The principal activity of 
the Company is that of a holding company. 
The principal activities and key performance indicators 
of the Group are also described on pages 16 to 18 of 
the Financial Review. A review of the development of the
business in 2009, events affecting the Group since the
end of the financial year and likely future developments
are referred to in the Business Review, which is incorporated
into this Directors’ Report by reference. 
The review of business activities in the Business Review,
Financial Review and the Directors’ Statement of Corporate
Governance are in line with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006.
Principal risks and uncertainties 
Operational risks are considered on page 19.
An assessment of the Group’s exposure to financial risks
and a description of how these risks are managed are
included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
Share capital
The issued share capital of Dignity plc at 25 December
2009 consisted of 63,737,653 Ordinary Shares of 
9 pence each. All the Ordinary Shares carry the same
rights and obligations. There are no other class or type 
of share in issue.
During the period, the Group issued 253,518 Ordinary
Shares of 9 pence each. 253,482 Shares of 9 pence each
were issued to satisfy Long Term Incentive Plan share
awards vesting in the period and 36 shares were issued 
to satisfy options exercised under the Save As You Earn
Scheme. The Long Term Incentive Plan awards were made
in 2006 and the SAYE options were granted in 2007. 22 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Directors’ report continued
A special resolution passed at the last Annual General
Meeting on 5 June 2009 gives Dignity plc the authority 
to purchase up to 3,186,881 Ordinary Shares of 9 pence
each at not less than nominal value and not more than 
5 per cent above the average middle market quotation for
the preceding 5 business days. At the same meeting the
Company was also given authority to allot Ordinary Shares
up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,912,129 of which
up to £286,819 may be for cash. These authorities will
expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting
on 4 June 2010. It is the intention of the Directors to seek
renewal of these authorities at that Annual General Meeting.
Results
The results for the period are set out in the Consolidated
Income Statement on page 37. Group profit before tax
amounted to £37.5 million (2008: £35.4 million).
Dividends
An interim dividend of 4.03 pence per share was paid 
on 30 October 2009. The Board has proposed a final
dividend of 8.07 pence per share, which, subject to
approval at the Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 
25 June 2010 to shareholders on the register at close 
of business on 28 May 2010. This makes a total of 
12.1 pence per share for the period.
Payments policy
The Group has no formal code or standard that deals
specifically with the payment of suppliers. However, the
Group’s policy on the payment of all creditors is to ensure
that the terms of payment as specified by, and agreed
with, the supplier are not exceeded, provided all trading
terms and conditions have been complied with. The
average creditor payment period for the Group was 
25 days (2008: 31 days). The Company has no 
trade creditors. 
Key contractual arrangements
The Directors consider there to be one key contractual
arrangement in relation to the supply and maintenance 
of cremators. This company is responsible for supplying
and installing the cremator abatement equipment. If this
company ceased to trade, the Group may have difficulties
in installing the necessary equipment by the end of 2012.
Employment policies
During the period the Group has maintained its
obligations to develop and improve arrangements 
aimed at involving employees in its affairs. Methods of
communication used include an in-house newsletter, an
employee website, bulletins and management briefings.
This is discussed in more detail in the Corporate and
Social Responsibility Report on pages 12 to 15. 
Employment policies are designed to provide equal
opportunities irrespective of age, sexuality, colour, ethnic
or national origin, religion, nationality, sex or marital
status. Full consideration is given to the employment,
training and career development of disabled persons,
subject only to their aptitudes and abilities. The Group
endeavours to treat disabled persons equally with others.
Directors and their interests
Details of the Directors of the Company who served
during the period are shown in the Report on Directors’
Remuneration on page 27. In accordance with the Articles
of Association, at the Annual General Meeting, Richard
Portman, Bill Forrester and Mike McCollum retire as
Directors of the Company and, being eligible, offer
themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting
on 4 June 2010.
During the period, the Company maintained liability
insurance for its Directors and Officers. The Directors 
of each of the Company’s subsidiaries, have the benefit 
of an indemnity provision in the Company’s Articles of
Association. The indemnity provision, which is a qualifying
third-party indemnity provision as defined by section 234
of the Companies Act 2006, was in force throughout the
period and is currently in force.

General Meeting within the limits set out in the notice 
of that meeting. There are no significant agreements 
to which the Group is party which take effect, alter or
terminate in the event of change of control of the Group.
Health and safety policy
The Group’s operations are designed at all times in such 
a way as to ensure, so far as reasonably practical, the
health, safety and welfare of all of our employees and all
other persons who may be attending our premises. This 
is discussed in the Corporate and Social Responsibility
Report on pages 12 to 15. 23 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Corporate Social Responsibility
Maintaining the quality of the environment in which 
we all live is an important concern for the Group. This

Report on pages 12 to 15 alongside other social and
ethical considerations. 
Donations
The Group made charitable donations amounting to 
£0.1 million (2008: £0.1 million) during the period. 
There were no political donations. Further information 
can be found on page 14.
Going concern
The Directors receive and review regularly management
accounts, cash balances, forecasts and the annual budget
together with covenant reporting. After careful consideration,
and mindful of the current market conditions, the Directors
confirm they are satisfied that the Group has adequate
resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future.
The Directors formally considered this matter at the Board
meeting held on 4 March 2010. For this reason, they
continue to adopt the going concern basis for preparing
the financial statements.

Report on Directors’ remuneration
for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009
This report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the Group in respect of the Executive Directors, together with
disclosures on all Directors’ remuneration. The auditors are required to report on the ‘auditable’ part of this report and
to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006.
The Board has reviewed the Group’s compliance with the 2008 Combined Code (‘the Code’) on remuneration related
matters and has followed the Code in the preparation of the report of the Remuneration Committee. It is the opinion
of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the period.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior
management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
Bill Forrester chairs the Remuneration Committee and its other members are the independent Non–Executive Directors
James Newman, Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter. The Code requires that a Group of the size of Dignity plc has
a Remuneration Committee comprising a minimum of three non–executives. The Remuneration Committee members
have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of
interests arising from cross directorships and no day–to–day involvement in running the business.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive attend the Remuneration Committee by invitation or when required and the
Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director, attended meetings when required as Secretary to
the Remuneration Committee. No Executive Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and
benefits.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference. A copy of the terms of reference
is available for inspection on the Group’s investor website www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk. The Committee met four times
during 2009. At those meetings basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers were reviewed, the targets
and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for Directors were also agreed, as were options granted under
the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The meetings also approved the payment of the 2008 performance
related bonus and the vesting of the shares awarded under the LTIP scheme in 2006. A further meeting was also held
in March 2010 to approve the payment of the performance related bonus for 2009, LTIP awards and bonus targets
for 2010.
In 2008, the Committee retained the external benefit consultants, Hewitt New Bridge Street, to complete a review of
the Executive Directors’ remuneration. In discussions with the Committee, and in consultation with Hewitt New Bridge
Street, it was decided that a ‘Comparator Group’ would be defined consisting of all companies in the Consumer Goods
and Consumer Services Sector of the FTSE 250 filtered to exclude companies deriving more than 50 per cent of their
turnover from overseas or having a market capitalisation in excess of £1.4 billion at that time. This gave a group of
32 companies with an average market capitalisation of £628 million at November 2008 as the Comparator Group.
At that date Dignity had a market capitalisation of £473 million and an enterprise value (including net debt) of
£710 million. The bottom half of the FTSE 250 was also used as a reference point for the benchmarking process.
The Committee continue to believe that the use of this Comparator Group is the most appropriate way of reviewing
and setting Executive Directors’ salaries.
Remuneration policy
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will:
• Align rewards with the interests of shareholders;
• Motivate and encourage superior performance;
• Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy; and
• Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this policy will retain and develop further the Group’s entrepreneurial culture,
whilst also focusing executive remuneration on performance which the Committee believes will best serve shareholders’
interests. It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by
Executive Directors with that performance being based on strong financial performance and returns to shareholders. This
is achieved by weighting the overall remuneration package towards achievement of that performance. Only 31 per cent of
each Executive Directors’ total potential remuneration package (ignoring benefits and pension contributions) is accounted
for by basic salary, assuming a full annual bonus is achieved and a maximum conditional award under the LTIP is made.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review all aspects of the policy on an annual basis to ensure that
rewards continue to be in line with the Group’s objectives and shareholders’ interests. 25 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Basic salary
When determining the basic salary of the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration:
• The levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of
broadly similar size and complexity;
• The performance of the individual Executive Director;
• The individual Executive Director’s experience and responsibilities; and
• Payand conditions throughout the Group.
No changes were made to their basic salaries during the period. It was also requested by the Executive Directors and
agreed by the Remuneration Committee that basic salaries for 2010 will remain unchanged. Salaries effective from
1 January 2010 are:
2009 2010
Name £’000 £’000
Mike McCollum 440 440
Andrew Davies 250 250
Richard Portman 200 200
Steve Whittern 150 150
Total 1,040 1,040
Annual performance related bonus
The targets for the year, which are based on the achievement of set earnings per share targets, are reviewed and set
annually by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and remain challenging.
They are ratified by the full Board. The targets are designed to enhance shareholder value.
The maximum bonus attainable for 2009 by Executive Directors was 100 per cent of basic salary. A bonus of 70 per cent
isattainable for meeting the first earnings per share target set by the Committee and a further bonus of 30 per cent
may be earned by achieving a second and more demanding earnings per share target. The increase in underlying
earnings per share during the period was 6 per cent and the bonus percentage earned by the Executive Directors in
the period was 85 per cent.
No other bonuses of any description were paid in the period to Executive Directors.
No changes have been proposed to the Annual Performance Related Bonus for 2010 and there were no departures
from this policy in the current period. This will continue to be based on demanding earnings per share targets with
a maximum bonus equal to 100 per cent of base salary. The scheme is in line with the market median for the bottom
half of the FTSE 250 and the lower quartile of the Comparator Group.
Share incentives
Shareholders approved the current discretionary share incentive plan, the LTIP , on 5 June 2009. If existing LTIPs were
to be amended or if there was a new LTIP Scheme, approval would be sought from the shareholders. No changes are
presently planned for the existing scheme.
All Executive Directors and other employees are entitled to be considered for the grant of conditional share awards
under the LTIP . Under the rules, the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 125 per cent of
salary. All four Executive Directors serving at the start of the year, were granted conditional share awards during 2009
equivalent to the maximum award. The Committee deemed this award appropriate, as in previous years, mindful of the
need to encourage superior performance from the Executive Directors and ensure that a significant proportion of their
total remuneration is linked to the performance of the Group. This award is in addition to those granted in all years
from 2004 to 2009. Richard Portman, prior to his appointment to the Board, received a conditional share award in 2006
equal to 100 per cent of his salary. Steve Whittern received an award equal to 100 per cent of his salary in 2006 and
awards of 4,000 shares in each of the years 2007 and 2008, prior to his appointment to the Board on 29 December
2008. Total awards made to the Executive Directors under the scheme are shown on page 29.
Eligible Executives are awarded rights, in the form of nil cost conditional share awards, to acquire a maximum number
of shares at thebeginning of a three year period, the proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of
that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the
time the allocation is made, are satisfied.
The Remuneration Committee selected comparative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) as the performance condition for
LTIP awards as it ensures that the Group outperforms the FTSE 350 Index over the measurement period indelivering
shareholder value, before the Eligible Executives are entitled to receive any of their awards. The constituent companies
of the FTSE 350 Index, at the time the awards are made, were selected as a benchmark as there are no directly 26 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Report on Directors’ remuneration continued
for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009
comparable quoted companies in the United Kingdom and as Dignity is now a constituent of the FTSE 350 this is still
a valid benchmark. The Remuneration Committee will calculate the TSR in accordance with the rules of the scheme
and ratify the calculation prior to the release of any award. Performance conditions under the LTIP are not subject to
re–testing.
The percentage of the conditional share awards made up to and including the awards in 2009 are exercisable on
vesting as follows:
• Ranked in the top quintile: 100 per cent of the total award;
• Ranked at median: 40 per cent of the total award;
• Ranked below median: zero; and
• Ranked between median and top quintile: straight–line apportionment.
The percentage of the conditional share awards exercisable on vesting from the 2010 awards and onwards is calculated
as follows:
• Ranked in the top quartile: 100 per cent of the total award;
• Ranked at median: 25 per cent of the total award;
• Ranked below median: zero; and
• Ranked between median and top quintile: straight–line apportionment.
In addition and irrespective of the TSR performance target, no award will vest unless, in the opinion of the
Remuneration Committee, the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory over the
measurement period.
The graph showsthe Group’s TSR compared to the FTSE 350. This gives a broad indication of the likelihood of any
conditional award vesting.
On 24 March 2009 the conditional share awards made in 2006 under the LTIP became capable of vesting. The TSR of
the Group over the measurement period was compared to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 350 at the
time the awards were made. The performance of the Group was found to be in the top quintile. On that basis the
Remuneration Committee, mindful also of the continued strong performance of the Group, recommended that the
entire 2006 share award vest. Shares were issued to Peter Hindley, Mike McCollum and Andrew Davies on 1 April 2009
and sold in their entirety the following day by the Group’s brokers. On the same day 20,366 shares were issued to
Richard Portman who sold 11,000 shares the following day and Steve Whittern was issued with 12,434 shares and sold
6,800 shares on the following day. Both sales were completed by the Group’s brokers.
The total conditional awards held by each Director are shown on page 29 in the section of the Remuneration Committee’s
Report that is subject to audit.
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Group can issue a maximum of 10 per cent of its issued share capital in a
rolling ten year period to employees under all share plans. In addition, of this 10 per cent, the Company can only issue
5 per cent to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans. At the period end, conditional awards under the
LTIP Scheme to Executive Directors and senior managers amount to 1.14 per cent of the current issued share capital.
If the awards in 2004, 2005 and 2006, that have vested, are included, that percentage is 2.49 per cent. The total,
including SAYE options granted in both the 2004 and 2007 Schemes, is 3.82 per cent.

Pensions
Mike McCollum and Richard Portman are members of the Group’s pension scheme into which the Group contributed
10.5 per cent of salary (details are set out within the audited section of this report on page 28). The Group makes no
pension contributions for Andrew Davies or Steve Whittern. No Non–Executive Directors receive any pension
contributions.
Benefits in kind

Executive Director’s home residence; and a mobile telephone; together with a pre–arranged funeral plan in accordance
with any scheme established by the Group in respect of the funeral of the Executive Director or his wife. All Executive
Directors received all of their benefits in kind.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The Board determines the fees of the Non–Executive Directors. It is based upon recommendations from the Chairman and
Chief Executive (or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Remuneration Committee and the
Chief Executive). The level of fees of the Non–Executive Directors reflects the time commitment and responsibility of
their respective roles. Their fees are set by reference to the constituent companies of the bottom half of the FTSE 250.
Service contracts
Details of the service contracts with all Executive Directors and letters of appointment with Non–Executive Directors are
as follows:
Unexpired term of contract
Name Contract date Notice period or letter of approval
Mike McCollum 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract
Andrew Davies 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract

Alan McWalter 12 January 2009 3 months 11 months
There are no special provisions in service contracts of employees or Directors relating to cessation of employment
or change of control. The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual
obligations, which do not include any payment from the takeover or liquidation of the Group. In addition, the
Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, one third of the Directors are required to submit themselves for
re–election every year. At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting Richard Portman, Bill Forrester and Mike McCollum
will submit themselves for re–election.
No Executive Directors hold a Non–Executive position with any other company. However, the Group allows one such
appointment per Executive Director, for which they can retain the fees.

On behalf of the Board
Bill Forrester
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
11 March 2010 31 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Introduction
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance in order to achieve its objectives and meet the
necessary standards of accountability and integrity. In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority Dignity plc is required to state whether it has complied with the relevant provisions set out in Section 1 of
the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) and, where the provisions have not been complied with,
to provide an explanation. Dignity plc is also required to explain how it has applied the principles set out in the Code.
The following paragraphs, together with the Audit Committee Report on pages 33 and 34 and the Report on Directors’
Remuneration on pages 24 to 30 provide a description of how the main and supporting principles of the Code have
been applied within Dignity plc during 2009. The Group has complied with all provisions ofthe Code during 2009
with the exception of:
On 29 December 2008 Peter Hindley was appointed Chairman upon relinquishing his responsibilities as Chief Executive
and the retirement of the then Chairman Richard Connell. This is contrary to provision A.2.2. of the Code. However,
as suggested by the Code, this appointment was only made after consultation with major shareholders of the Group.
The Board felt it was important to retain the skills and knowledge of Peter Hindley, given he is both a prominent
and influential figure in the funeral industry. Peter Hindley is not regarded as independent under provision A.3.1.
of the Code.
Narrative statement
The Code establishes nine principles of good governance, which are split into four areas as outlined below:
1. The Board
The Group is controlled through the Board of Directors that meets regularly throughout the year. Informal meetings are
held between individual Directors as required. The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters reserved to it.
The Board is responsible for:
• Overall management of the Group;
• Setting and reviewing the strategy of the Group;
• Approval of major capital expenditure and acquisition projects, and consideration of significant financial matters;
• Monitoring the exposure to key business risks;
• Setting annual budgets and reviewing progress towards achievement of these budgets; and
• Proposing and making dividend payments to shareholders.
All Directors are provided with the necessary papers in advance of the meetings to permit them to make informed
decisions at those meetings. The Board also considers employee issues and key appointments, including the role of
Company Secretary.
The Board comprises four Non–Executive Directors and the Non–Executive Chairman. There are now the same number
of independent Non–Executive Directors and Executive Directors. The Board considers that four Executive Directors are
sufficient to manage a Company of this size and organisational structure.
There is a clear division of responsibility between the Non–Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive so as to give no
individual, unfettered powers of decision making.
The Chairman is responsible for:
• Ensuring the Board functions in all aspects of its role;
• Facilitating the effective contribution of the Non–Executive Directors and ensuring constructive relations between
Executive and Non–Executive Directors;
• Setting the agenda so all relevant issues are discussed; and
• Ensuring effective communication with stakeholders and acting as the public face of the Group.
The Chief Executive is responsible for:
• Operational management and control of the Group on a day–to–day basis;
• Formulating and proposing strategy to the Board; and
• Implementing the strategy and policies adopted by the Board.
The four independent Non–Executive Directors are Bill Forrester, Ishbel Macpherson, Alan McWalter, and James Newman.
James Newman is the appointed Senior Independent Director of the Group. Biographical details, including committee
membership, appear on page 20. The Chairman and the Non–Executive Directors have formally confirmed to the Board,
mindful of their other commitments they have, that they will have sufficient time to devote to their responsibilities as
Directors of the Group.
Directors’ statement on corporate governance 32 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued
Bill Forrester, Ishbel Macpherson, Alan McWalter, and James Newman are independent of management, as defined by
the Code.
All Directors are able to take independent professional advice on the furtherance of their duties if necessary. They also
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director and,
where it is considered appropriate and necessary, training is made available to Directors. All Directors receive annual
training and updates on the duties and responsibilities of being a Director of a listed company. This covers legal,
accounting and tax matters as required. The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of any legal
action against its Directors. The level of cover is currently £50 million.
The Directors have, during the period, formally reminded themselves of their duties as Directors under the Companies
Act 2006 (Section 171–177). These duties include the need to avoid conflicts of interest (Section 175). No such
conflicts of interests exist.
All Directors, in accordance with the Code, submit themselves for re–election at least once every three years. In addition,
any Director appointed in the year must submit himself or herself for election at the next Annual General Meeting. Bill
Forrester, Mike McCollum and Richard Portman will be submitted for re–election at the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting. Mindful of the skills, knowledge and experience of these Directors the Board recommends them for re–election.
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee, an Audit Committee and a Nomination Committee, all of which
operate within defined terms of reference. The specific terms of reference for all the Committees may be obtained
from the Company Secretary at the RegisteredOffice and they are also available for inspection on the Group’s investor
website www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk. All Committees are provided with sufficient resources to undertake their duties.
Those attending and the frequency of Board and Committee meetings held during the year was as follows:
Audit Remuneration Nomination
Main Board(i) Committee Committee Committee
Number of meetings 635 2
Andrew Davies 600 0
Bill Forrester 625 2
Peter Hindley 62 (ii) 4 (ii) 2
Mike McCollum 63 (ii) 2 (ii) 0
Alan McWalter 635 2
Ishbel Macpherson 624 2
James Newman 635 2
Richard Portman 63 (iii) 4 (iii) 2 (iii)
Steve Whittern 63 (ii) 00
(i) Only full Board meetings have been included in the attendance analysis. Seven further meetings were held with a quorum of Directors to approve
announcements, documents or the issue of shares under the LTIP and SAYE.
(ii) In attendance by invitation of the respective Committee.
(iii) Richard Portman attended Committee meetings in his capacity as Company Secretary.
When Directors are unable to attend a meeting, they are advised of the matters to be discussed and given an
opportunity to make their views known to the Chairman prior to the meeting. A process exists whereby such views will
be included in the minutes of the meeting if necessary.
A process exists whereby the Non–Executive Directors can meet without the Executive Directors being present. Three
such meetings were held during 2009.
During the year, the Board again undertook a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its
Committees by way of the issue of a detailed questionnaire to all Directors. This was then followed by a detailed review
of the responses, by the Directors, and identification of any actions arising. The Non–Executive Directors, led by the
Senior Independent Director, are responsible for the performance evaluation of the Chairman. The Board was satisfied
that its performance and that of its individual Directors and Committees was of the appropriate standard. Full
evaluations will be completed again during 2010 and the Board will consider using external facilitation in line with the
recommendations of the Walker Report.
The Company Secretary, Richard Portman, is responsible for the preparation and distribution of all agendas, minutes
and related Board and Committee papers. As Corporate Services Director, he attends the Board meetings in his capacity
as a Director of the Company but also acts as Secretary to those meetings. He attends the Committee meetings in his
capacity as Company Secretary and also as Secretary of those Committees when requested to do so by the Chairman
of that Committee. He is also responsible for ensuring all Board procedures are followed and for advising the Board on
corporate governance matters. 33 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
2. Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Bill Forrester, determines and agrees with the Board, within formal terms
of reference, the framework and policy of Directors’ and senior management’s remuneration and its cost to the Group.
The Committee met five times during 2009. The Committee measures the performance of the Executive Directors as a
prelude to recommending and approving their annual remuneration, bonus awards and awards of share options to the
Board for final determination.
The Committee members during 2009 were the independent Non–Executive Directors, Bill Forrester, James Newman,
Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter. The Code requires a Committee of at least two members. The Chief Executive
and the Chairman can also attend the meetings by invitation of the Committee. No Director or senior manager is
involved in any decisions with regard to their own remuneration. The Chairman of the Board is not a member of the
Remuneration Committee.
The Executive Directors recommend the remuneration of Non–Executive Directors and recommendations take into
account role, responsibilities and time commitment in the fulfilment of those duties. The Non–Executive Directors are
not eligible for pensions and do not participate in the Group’s bonus or share schemes. The Committee has considered
the remuneration of senior management immediately below Board level during the year. It concluded that their
remuneration was commensurate with their various duties and in line with market rates.
3. Accountability and audit
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee in 2009 comprised the four independent Non–Executive Directors. James Newman, who is a Fellow
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, is considered to have recent and relevant financial
experience to chair this Committee. Its membership is restricted to Non–Executive Directors. The Committee has specific
written terms of reference that explain its authority and duties. The Committee has met three times during 2009. The
external auditors, the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director have attended all the meetings by
invitation. The external auditors and the internal audit function also have the right to private audiences with the Audit
Committee or its Chairman if either party requires or requests them. One meeting was held during 2009 between the
Chairman and the external auditors. The Chairman of the Board is not a member of the Audit Committee.
The Committee reviews the Group’s Annual Report and Interim Report before submission to the Board. It keeps under
review the Group’s accounting policies, financial controls and internal control and risk management systems. It also
evaluates, on a regular basis, the work of the internal audit function and reviews its effectiveness. The Committee also
reviews matters brought to its attention both internally and by the external auditors. The Committee reports all
findings to the Board.
A formal process, established via the Audit Committee, exists by which employees of the Group may, in confidence,
raise concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. This ensures arrangements are
in place for the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow–up action.
The Committee also keeps under review the relationship with the external auditors, including their terms of
engagement, independence, objectivity and effectiveness. The Committee reviews the remuneration received by the
external auditors for non–audit work, which ongoing principally relates to taxation advice. Where considered necessary
the Committee approves such work. The external auditors have confirmed their audit independence in writing to the
Committee. The Committee also retains responsibility for the appointment and removal of the external auditors.
PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP have beenthe Group’sauditorssince the management buyout from SCIin2002.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, were auditorsof SCIat thistime. The Audit Committee considersthat the relationship
with the auditors is working well and remains satisfied with their effectiveness. Accordingly, it has not considered
it necessary to date to require the firm to tender for the audit work. The external auditors are required to rotate the
Group audit partner every five years and this is the first year for the current lead audit partner Matthew Mullins.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s choice of external auditor.
Reporting responsibilities
The Board is required to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects,
not only in the Directors’ Report and Accounts but also in the Chairman’s Statement (page 4), the Chief Executive’s
Overview (page 5), the Business Review (pages 6 to 11), the Financial Review (pages 16 to 18), Interim Reports,
Interim Management Statements and in price sensitive announcements. The Group will release its Annual Information
Update by 1 April 2010. A summary of the Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements is set out on page 21.
Going concern
The Directors receive and review regularly management accounts, cash balances, forecasts and the annual budget
together with covenant compliance. After careful consideration, and mindful of the current market conditions, the
Directors confirm they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable
future. The Directors formally considered this matter at the Board meeting held on 4 March 2010. For this reason, they
continue to adopt the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements. 34 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued
Internal control
The Board recognises it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss. A formal process of identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the Group exists. This process was in place at the date of approval of the Annual Report
and is, in accordance with Turnbull guidance (as revised in 2005), within the Code.
Internal controls are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis. Internal Audit completes a programme of work each year
that provides assurance that the internal controls they have tested are working effectively and also propose improvements
where appropriate and necessary. Coupled with this, the bi–annual review of the Risk Register provides a further formal
review mechanism for considering and reviewing internal controls. All such work is reported to and monitored by the
Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board, as part of an ongoing process, has formally reviewed and continues to
keep under review the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal controls, including financial, operational and
compliance controls and risk management systems. The Audit Committee reviews risk management annually and
receives reports from executive management regarding weaknesses in internal control, any losses arising out of
weaknesses in internal control and progress in implementing revised procedures to improve and enhance internal
control. There have been no reports of system weaknesses that have resulted or would have resulted in a material
misstatement or loss.
The key procedures, which operated throughout the period, are as follows:
• Financial reporting – The Group has a comprehensive system of internal budgeting and forecasting. Monthly actual
results analysed by operating division are reported to the Board and significant variances to budget are investigated
with revised forecasts prepared as necessary. Operational management receives comprehensive management
accounts covering their areas of responsibility;
• Financial controls – The Executive Directors have defined appropriate and necessary financial controls and
procedures to be employed by operational management. Key controls over major business risks include reviews
against budgets and forecasts, review against key performance indicators and exception reporting;
• Quality and integrity of personnel – One of the Group’s core values is integrity. This is regarded as vital to the
maintenance of the Group’s system of internal financial control. The Directors have put in place an organisation
structure appropriate to the size and complexity of the Group with defined lines of responsibility and delegation
of authority where the Board considers it necessary and appropriate;
• Internal audit – The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit team, which reports to the Chief Executive. It coordinates
the completion of self–assessment reports by operational management that assists in highlighting areas of control
weakness or exposure. Internal audit reviews are completed on such areas together with selected areas of the head
office function and any area where an Executive Director requests a review. During 2009 (as in 2008), there were
quarterly meetings between the Head of Internal Audit and the Executive Directors to formally review and discuss
Internal Audit’s work programme and findings. In addition, regular meetings between Internal Audit and the external
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , were held during the year to discuss and plan audit work and to ensure a
complementary approach. The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee at every meeting of that
Committee;
• Procedures – The Group has established and documented processes and procedures covering most parts of its
operations, both client facing and in support departments. These provide clear guidance on the correct or most
appropriate course of action in various circumstances. Procedures are supplemented by training where needs have
been identified. Both Internal Audit and a comprehensive management structure monitor the adherence to such
processes and procedures. A comprehensive review of procedures and training commenced during 2008 and is
ongoing; and
• Risk assessment – Management has responsibility for the identification and evaluation of significant risks that might
arise in their area of responsibility together with the design of suitable internal controls. The Executive Directors and
the wider management team continually assess the risks. A Risk Register is maintained, which is formally presented
to and reviewed by the Audit Committee twice a year.
Nomination Committee
Peter Hindley, the Chairman, chaired the Nomination Committee during 2009, which met on two occasions during the
year. The other members of the Committee during the year were James Newman, Bill Forrester, Ishbel Macpherson and
Alan McWalter.
The Committee regularly reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and composition of
the Board and the senior management team. It is also responsible for identifying and nominating for the approval of
the Board, replacement or additional Directors and members of the senior management team. The Committee
formally considers succession planning annually under the written terms of reference. 35 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
4. Relations with shareholders
The Group encourages two–way communication with both its institutional and private shareholders and responds
promptly to any queries received either verbally or in writing.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director have regular meetings with institutional investors, fund managers and
analysts to discuss information made public by the Group. Where appropriate or if requested, such meetings could
include either or both of the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director or be without any Executive Directors
present. The Chairman is available to discuss governance and strategy matters with the major shareholders.
The Group has and will arrange visits to its facilities, if requested by a shareholder, where it will not disrupt normal
operational activity.
Each year every shareholder receives a full Annual Report and Accounts and an Interim Report at the half year. The Group
has a separate investor relations website, www.dignityfuneralsplc.co.uk, upon which users can access the latest financial
and corporate news and information. The Company Secretary is also available to answer general investor queries.
The Board regards the Annual General Meeting as an opportunity to communicate directly with all shareholders. At least
20 working days notice will be given of the Annual General Meeting at which all Directors and Committee Chairmen
plan to be present and available to answer questions. 36 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Independent Auditors’ report to the members of Dignity plc
for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows, and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, set out on page 21, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
made by the directors; and, the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements

for the 52 week period then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS
Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in theDirectors’ Report for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009 for
which the consolidated financial statements are prepared is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the Directors’ statement set out on page 23, in relation to going concern; and

provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code specified in our review.

We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended

been audited.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009
1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
European law requires that the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the 52 week period ended 25 December
2009 are prepared in accordance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’), as adopted
by the European Union. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations (as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention, as modified by the
revaluation of pensions, and financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the income statement.
Preparation of financial statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. This will
also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statementsand the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements are presented in the form of Group financial statements. The Group financial statements
consolidate the accounts of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company (including all of its subsidiary
entities) after eliminating internal transactions. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items, by their nature, are not indicative of the underlying operating performance of the Group.
Exceptional items are of a non–recurring nature to the results for the period and are therefore presented separately.
Pre-arranged funeral plan trusts
The three pre–arranged funeral plan trusts were not consolidated during the period as they were not controlled by the
Group. Specifically, Article 60 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001
requires a majority of the managing trustees to be independent of the Group. Furthermore, the Group did not direct
their financial and operating policies, nor did it have substantially all of the risks and rewards of their ownership.
Acquisition or disposal of subsidiary undertakings
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included from the effective date of control using the
acquisition method of accounting. The separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of newly acquired subsidiary
undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the fair value to the Group as at the
effective date of control.
Revenue
Revenue from funeral operations comprises the amount recoverable from customers for the provision of funerals, income
from crematoria and other services, to the extent that those services have been performed or the goods supplied.
Income from memorial sales is recognised at the point of sale, to the extent that the goods have been supplied. Costs
of maintaining memorials are recognised as incurred.
The accounting policies for recognising turnover for pre–arranged funeral plans are stated below.
The Group pays certain disbursements such as crematoria fees, burial plots, ministers’ fees and doctors’ fees on
behalf of its clients. These amounts are recovered as part of the invoicing process. However, these amounts are not
included within net revenues as they are simply passed on to the customer at cost.
The Group views the United Kingdom as one geographical segment, given each local business exhibits similar long
term characteristics.
All amounts are exclusive of VAT . 42 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009
Pre-arranged funeral plans
Trust plans
The Group markets and sells pre–arranged funeral plans, monies received from selling funeral plans being held and
controlled by independent pre–arranged funeral plan trusts (‘the Trusts’). The responsibility for the ultimate
performance of funerals is allocated to funeral directors, who are selected by the beneficiary of the plan and some of
whom are not owned by the Group.
The Group receives monies from the Trusts in respect of the following transactions:
• A marketing and administration fee in respect of each plan sold. The marketing element is only refundable in the
event that the plan is subsequently cancelled. A provision is made for cancellations based on historical experiences,
where material, to cover the estimated marketing element refundable to the Trusts. Marketing and administration
fees are included in Group revenue when the related plan is sold less the provision for refunds arising on
cancellations; and
• Further contributions are also received from the Trusts in return for the provision of general ongoing administrative
services supplied to the Trusts. These contributions are included in Group revenue for the period to which they relate.
All costs in respect of the marketing and administration of the pre–arranged funeral plans are expensed in the Group
income statement as incurred.
From time to time, the Group receives monies from certain of the Trusts, in line with the relevant Trust’s deed, which
have been assessed by the trustees as not required to ensure the Trust has sufficient assets to meet its future liabilities
in respect of current members (‘Recoveries’). All Recoveries are recognised as other operating income in the period in
which the trustees approve their payment.
The Group makes payments on behalf of the Trusts relating to the ongoing overheads of the Trusts, refunds to
members of the Trusts in event of cancellation, and the payments made to funeral directors when the funeral is
ultimately performed. All such payments are reimbursed in full by the Trusts on demand, in accordance with the terms
of the relevant Trust’s deed.
Neither the sales value of plans nor the costs of providing funerals are recognised in the financial statements of the
Group when a pre–arranged funeral plan is sold.
Each Dignity marketing company contractually guarantees with the customer of a pre–arranged funeral plan that
(i) if the customer chooses to cancel their selected funeral plan, a full refund will be made to the customer of all
monies paid in respect thereof (less in certain cases an administration fee payable to the relevant Dignity marketing
company); (ii) the funeral director’s services (as selected by the customer) will be provided regardless of price rises in
the future; and (iii) for certain plans sold, specific disbursements will be provided regardless of price rises in the future.
Insurance plans
Previously marketed propositions
The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by an insurance company in
consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral (including some disbursements) of the
plan holder at no further charge. Marketing of these policies has now ceased.
In the event of death of the policyholder, the Group makes an agreed payment to the nominatedfuneral director and a
debtor is recognised. At this time a commission fee is recognised as turnover. All monies are reclaimed in full from the
life insurance company.
Actively marketed propositions
The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies,
in consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral (including some disbursements) of the
plan holder at no further charge.
A commission is paid when the policy is charged to the Group. As this commission is fully refundable if the Group does
not perform the funeral for any reason, it is carried as a debtor and expensed when the funeral is performed.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share–based payments to certain employees. A fair value for the equity settled share
awards is measured at the date of grant. Management measures the fair value using the valuation technique that
they considerto be the most appropriate to value each class of award, which include Black–Scholes calculations and
Monte Carlo simulations. The valuations take into account factors such as non–transferability, exercise restrictions and
behavioural considerations.
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Group Accounts 43 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight–line basis, after
allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will eventually vest. The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed at
least annually, with any impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately.
Earnings per Ordinary Share
Basic Earnings per Ordinary Share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the profit on ordinary activities after taxation by the
weighted average number of shares in issue during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing profit on ordinary
activities after taxation by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period increased by the effects of
all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares (primarily share options). Underlying Earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by
dividing the underlying profit after tax by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration for subsidiaries and other businesses over
the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is capitalised and stated at historical cost less
provisions for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The business and subsidiaries
acquired are generally combined with existing operations in the year of acquisition, or the year thereafter and are
therefore only considered to be separate cash–generating units during this time.
Intangible assets – trade names
Intangible trade names are recognised as assets at the fair value of the consideration paid to acquire them and are
carried at historical cost less provisions for amortisation and impairment. When acquired as part of a business
combination the fair value is calculated by reference to the estimated incremental cash flows expected to arise by
virtue of the trade name being well–established.
Amortisation is provided from the date of acquisition so as to write–off the asset on a straight–line basis over the term
of its useful life. Where there are indicators that a trade name has an indefinite life then these assets are not amortised
but are subject to annual impairment reviews. The factors that indicate an indefinite life of trade names acquired
include the fact that the Group is a significant operator in a well–established market with inelastic demand, the
conservative nature of the UK funeral industry that acts as a barrier to entry for new trade names, and the Group’s
track record for actively monitoring and relocating trade names to combat shifting demographics. In addition, when
allocating a useful life to acquired trade names, the following matters are considered:
• The strength of the trade name in its local environment which is assessed by reference to relative market share and
anticipated profitability;
• The likelihood that market based factors could truncate a trade name’s life such as competition and shifting
demographics and the Group’s ability to combat these;
• The length of time, prior to acquisition, for which trade has been conducted under the name acquired; and
• The likely support the Group will give to the name in its local environment through marketing and promotion,
maintaining community awareness etc.
The useful lives of all capitalised trade names are considered to be indefinite and are reviewed on an annual basis.
Intangible assets – non-compete contracts
Non–compete contracts arising from business combinations are capitalised at the fair value, which is calculated as the
present value of any consideration paid discounted at the Group’s cost of capital.
All costs are amortised over the term of the relevant agreement on a straight–line basis.
Intangible assets – software
Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is treated as an
intangible asset. Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and
bring into use the specific software.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development of computer systems (including
websites) is recognised if and only if the costs are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique
software products, controlled by the Group and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
All other costs incurred in research or development are expensed as incurred. Capitalised costs will include, where
appropriate, directly attributable payroll costs and a portion of direct overheads. Costs recognised as assets are
amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to eight years).
Group Accounts 44 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009
Intangible assets – use of third party brand
On 8 January 2007, the Group acquired the remaining 25 per cent voting share capital of Advance Planning Limited
for consideration of £2.0 million. As part of this arrangement, the Group obtained a 10–year marketing commitment
from Age Concern Enterprises Limited, the previous minority shareholder, giving rights to market Funeral Plans under
the Age Concern brand for the next ten years. During the period, Age Concern England merged with Help the Aged to
form a new charity, Age UK. Following the merger, the Group has extended the marketing arrangements to cover Age
UK as a whole until 2019. The value of this right has been recognised as a separate intangible asset.
This asset is being amortised over twenty years on a straight–line basis, recognising that each year’s additional
marketing activity generates incremental revenues and profits to the Group for at least the following twenty years.
Investment property
Assets are recorded in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Costs include, where appropriate, cost of acquiring the property and costs incurred in bringing each asset to its
present condition. Depreciation is charged over the expected useful lives using the straight–line method. Valuations are
performed internally on an annual basis. An independent external valuation will be obtained every five years.
Property, plant and equipment
Assets are recorded in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes, where appropriate, directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each asset to its present location
and condition.
Depreciation is charged (excluding freehold land and assets in the course of construction) so as to write off the cost of
assets to their residual value, over their expected useful livesusing the straight–line method. The bases and annual
depreciation rates in use for the various classes of assets are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2% – 10%
Short leasehold buildings Over term of lease
Motor vehicles 11% – 20%
Computers 20%
Other plant and equipment 5% – 33%
Fixtures and fittings 15%
Freehold land is not depreciated on the basis that land has an unlimited life. Where the historical cost of land and
buildings cannot be split, the Directors have estimated that the historical cost attributable to land is one third of the
original cost of acquiring the land and buildings. This estimate is regularly reviewed.
Major renovations of the Group’s trading premises and crematory re–linings are depreciated over the remaining life of
the related asset or to the estimated date of the next major renovation or cremator re–lining, whichever is sooner. Asset
lives and residual values for each class of asset are reviewed annually.
Repairs and renewals
All repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement unless they represent an enhancement to the original asset.
Property, plant and equipment held under leases
When assets are financed by leasing agreements, where the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the
Group, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright and the corresponding liability to the lessor is
included as an obligation under finance leases. Depreciation on leased assets is charged to the income statement on
the same basis as owned assets. Leasing payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the
interest is charged to the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate on the outstanding lease obligation.
All other leases are ‘operating leases’ and the relevant annual rentals are charged to the income statement.
Impairment of assets
The carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in periods
where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets that have an
indefinite useful life (e.g. goodwill) are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Group Accounts 1 Accounting policies (continued)
45 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash–generating unit to which the asset belongs. For goodwill this is considered at a
business segment level as that is the level at which the return on assets acquired is monitored. For other intangibles
(principally trade names) this is considered at a regional level for each business segment as this is the level where cash
inflows are largely independent. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In
assessing value in use, the estimated future discounted cash flows of the cash–generating unit are estimated, based on
latest management expectations for the following year and an annual growth rate in subsequent years. These cash
flows are discounted at rates that management estimate to be the risk affected average cost of capital for the
particular segment and compared to the carrying value of the relevant asset. Any impairment in the value of an asset
below its carrying value is charged to the income statement within operating profit. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised in the income statement to the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Inventories
Inventories, which comprise funeral supplies and monumental masonry, are stated at the lower of cost and fair value
less costs to sell. Cost includes all directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location
and condition. Fair value less costs to sell is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be
incurred in completion and sale.
Taxation
The tax charge for the period includes the charge for tax currently payable and deferred tax. The current tax charge
represents the estimated amount due that arises from the operations of the Group in the period and after making
adjustments to estimates in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, except where the
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised where the carrying value of an asset is greater than its associated tax basis or
where the carrying value of a liability is less than its associated tax basis. Deferred tax is provided for any differences
that exist between the tax base and accounting base of intangibles arising from a business combination that does not
involve the acquisition of a subsidiary.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future
reversal of the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet
date. Deferred tax is measured on a non–discounted basis.
Pensions
The cost of defined contribution retirement schemes is charged as an expense as the costs become payable. Any
difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short term asset or liability.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing the benefits is determined using the projected unit credit
method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent the benefits are vested, and otherwise are amortised on a
straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. The current service cost and the
recognised element of any past service cost are presented within operating profit. The expected return on plan assets
less the interest arising on the pension liabilities is presented within net finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the income statement and presented in the consolidated
statement of recognised income and expense.
The expected return on plan assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long term yields that will arise
from the specific assets held within the pension plan. The retirement benefit net asset recognised in the balance sheet
represents the fair value of any relevant scheme assets net of the present value ofthe defined benefit obligation as
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost. The discount rate applied in arriving at the present value represents yields
on high quality corporate bonds in a similar economic environment with lives similar to the maturity of the pension
liabilities.
The rate of return is determined by identifying an appropriate rate of return for each class of asset held in conjunction
with the Group’s professional advisor.
Group Accounts 46 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company or the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result
of a past event, where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and
where a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions (other than deferred tax) are discounted where the present value of the provision is materially different to
the undiscounted value. The unwinding of discounts is included within net interest payable and similar charges.
Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the
period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the financial
statements when paid.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions recognised in the income statement are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate on
the date the transaction took place.
Financial instruments
Borrowings
All borrowings are stated at the fair value of consideration received after deduction of transaction costs. The transaction
costs and interest payable on debt finance are charged to the income statement, as finance costs, on a constant–yield
basis over the term of the borrowings, or over a shorter period where it is more likely than not that the lender will
require earlier repayment using the effective interest method.
Early termination costs on borrowings
Premiums and discounts arising on the early repayment of borrowings are written–off to the income statement as incurred.
Interest rate swaps
The Group currently uses several types of financial instruments as part of an overall interest rate risk management
strategy. It does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest rate risk associated with net debt is
managed by using a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings and financial liabilities. The cash flows from,
and losses arising on terminations of, these contracts are recognised as cash flows from operating activities. See note
16(d) for further information.
Trade receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. A
provision for impairment is established based on historical experience. When a trade receivable is not collectable it
is written off against the allowance account.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all
of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct
transaction costs.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and
assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The most sensitive estimates affecting the
financial statements are in the areas of assessing the recoverability of receivables, post–retirement benefits, the
recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets.
Provision for doubtful trade receivables
Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of management may be impaired. Within each division,
assessment is made of the recoverability of trade receivables based on a range of factors including the age of the
receivable and the type of services provided. The provision is assessed monthly against actual experience of
irrecoverable accounts and adjusted if appropriate.
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Group Accounts Pensions
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme that is accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial
assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements. These actuarial assumptions
include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used
would affect the balance sheetand income statement. The Group considers that the most significant assumptions are
the discount rate and the inflation rate. See note 28 for further details.
Goodwill
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy
stated in note 1 “Intangible assets – goodwill”. The recoverable amounts of cash–generating units have been
determined based on value–in–use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows
and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows. Actual outcomes
could vary from those calculated. See note 9 for further details.
Other intangible assets
The decision process to ascertain whether trade names will have an indefinite life are detailed in note 1 “Intangible
assets – trade names”. These assets with an indefinite life are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. When a
review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on value–in–use calculations prepared
on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. See note 9 for further details.
Employee share trust
The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the directors consider that
Dignity plc has de facto control. In accordance with IFRS 2, Share–based payment, the trust’s assets and liabilities are
recognised in the Group’s balance sheet within share capital and reserves.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2009
IFRS 2 (amendment), Share–based payment. It deals with vesting conditions and cancellations. It clarifies that vesting
conditions are service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features of a share–based payment are not
vesting conditions. These features need to be included in the grant date fair value for transactions with employees and
others providing similar services; they would not impact the number of awards expected to vest or valuation there of
subsequent to grant date. All cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting
treatment. This has been implemented in the period and has had no material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 7 (amendment), Financial instruments – disclosures. The amendment requires enhanced disclosures about fair
value measurement and liquidity risk. In particular, the amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements by
level of a fair value measurement hierarchy. This has been implemented in the period. See note 21 for further details.
IFRS 8, Operating segments. This standard introduced new rules on the disclosure of operating results by business
segment. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker. This has not led to a change in reporting segments from prior year. See note 3 for further details.
IAS 1 (revised), Presentation of financial statements. The revised standard will prohibit the presentation of items of
income and expenses (that is, non–owner changes in equity) in the statement of changes in equity, requiring non–owner
changes in equity to be presented separately from owner changes in equity. The Group has elected to present two
statements, an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income. The consolidated financial statements
has been prepared under these revised disclosure requirements.
IAS 23 (amendment), Borrowing costs. The amendment to this standard requires an entity to capitalise borrowing
costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a
substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of that asset. The option of immediately
expensing those borrowing costs will be removed. This has had no material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IAS 39 (amendment), Financial instruments: recognition and measurement and IFRS 7, Financial instruments:
disclosures on the reclassification of financial assets. This amendment allows the reclassification of certain financial
assets previously classified as held for trading or available for sale to another category under limited circumstances.
Various disclosures are required where a reclassification has been made. This has not had an impact on the Group.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been
early adopted
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for accounting periods
beginning on or after 25 December 2009 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted:
IFRS 2 (amendments), Group cash–settled share–based payment transaction (effective from 1 January 2010). In addition
to incorporating IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2, and IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions, the amendments
expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of group arrangements that were not covered by that
interpretation. The new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 3 (revised), Business combinations. The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business
combinations, with some significant changes. For example, all payments to purchase a business are to be recorded at
fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classified as debt subsequently re–measured through the
income statement. There is a choice on an acquisition–by–acquisition basis to measure the non–controlling interest in
the acquiree either at fair value or at the non–controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.
All acquisition–related costs should be expensed. The Group will apply IFRS 3 (revised) prospectively to all business
combinations from 1 January 2010.
IFRS 5 (amendment), Non–current assets held–for–sale and discontinued operations. The amendment clarifies that all
of a subsidiary’s assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if a partial disposal sale plan results in loss of
control. The Group will apply the IFRS 5 (amendment) prospectively to all partial disposals of subsidiaries from
1 January 2010. It is not expected to have an impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IAS 1 (amendment), Presentation of financial statements. The amendment is part of the IASB’s annual improvements
project published in April 2009. The amendment provides clarification that the potential settlement of a liability by the
issue of equity is not relevant to its classification as current or non–current. By amending the definition of current liability,
the amendment permits a liability to be classified as non–current (provided that the entity has an unconditional right to
defer settlement by transfer of cash or other assets for at least 12 months after the accounting period) notwithstanding
the fact that the entity could be required by the counterparty to settle in shares at any time. It is not expected to have an
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IAS 27 (revised), Consolidated and separate financial statements’, (effective from 1 July 2009). The revised standard
requires the effects of all transactions with non–controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in
control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses. The standard also specifies the
accounting when control is lost. Any remaining interest in the entity is re–measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is
recognised in profit or loss. The group will apply IAS 27 (revised) prospectively to transactions with non–controlling
interests from 1 January 2010.
IAS 38 (amendment), Intangible assets. The amendment is part of the IASB’s annual improvements project published
in April 2009 and the Group and Company will apply IAS 38 (amendment) from the date IFRS 3 (revised) is adopted.
The amendment clarifies guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business
combination and it permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has similar useful
economic lives. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRIC 17, Distribution of non–cash assets to owners (effective on or after 1 July 2009). The interpretation was published
in November 2008. This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes
non–cash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends. IFRS 5 has also been amended to
require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they are available for distribution in their present
condition and the distribution is highly probable. The Group will apply IFRIC 17 from 1 January 2010. It is not expected
to have a material impact on the Group or Company’s financial statements.
2Financial risk management
The Group finances its operations by a mixture of shareholders’ funds and Secured Notes, with other bank borrowings
available if required. This approach seeks to minimise financing costs and generate optimum shareholder value
through efficient leveraging of the Group’s balance sheet, which is made possible by the stable and predictable cash
generative nature of the business.
It is not the Group’s policy to actively trade in derivatives.
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Group Accounts 49 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
Market risk
Currency risk
All the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling. The Group purchases minimal amounts
from overseas. Accordingly, exposure to currency fluctuations are not significant and therefore not actively managed.
Interest rate risk and other price risk
The Group’s main borrowings consist of Class A and B Secured Notes, which are at fixed interest rates, resulting in a
predetermined repayment profile. The fair value of these financial instruments is based on underlying gilt prices and
yield spreads based on the market’s current view of the risk profile of the Secured Notes. Consequently, the fair value
of these instruments will fluctuate. Fair values are not relevant to the Group unless it was to change its funding
strategy and repay the Secured Notes early.
The Group also has a £10 million crematoria acquisition facility (‘the Crematoria Acquisition Facility’). £7.4 million
carries interest at 5.59 per cent per annum. The remaining £2.6 million carries interest at a rate relative to three
month LIBOR, with such rate being capped at 5.59 per cent. Consequently, the Group carries limited risk to increases
in LIBOR on this facility. The Crematoria Acquisition Facility is fully drawn and will be repayable in one payment in
November 2013.
The Group has significant cash balances that are held by institutions rated at least A–1 by Standard and Poors. These
balancesearn interest by reference to the Bank of England base rate. If base rates reduced by one per cent at the
beginning of 2009 then the Group would receive £0.1 million less interest income on an annualised basis for each
£10 million held.
None of the Group’s other financial liabilities or financial assets carry any significant interest rate risk.
Credit risk
Trade receivables are the main source of credit risk to the Group. However, this risk is minimised as much as possible
through well–established credit control procedures. Quantitative disclosures regarding the aging of these receivables
are included in note 21(c).
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash reserves, committed undrawn borrowing facilities
and regular monitoring and forecasting of cash balances. In addition, the Group is required under the terms of its
secured borrowings to maintain a precisely defined EBITDA to total debt service ratio of at least 1.5 times. This ratio
was determined when raising the debt as being sufficient to ensure all borrowings could be repaid. This covenant test
has been satisfied on each quarterly testing date in the period. At 25 December 2009 the actual ratio was 2.60 times
(2008: 2.55 times).
Capital risk management
The Group’s objective under managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order
to provide returns for shareholders, repay holders of Class A and B Secured Notes and benefit other shareholders. It
also aims to reduce its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital
to shareholders, issue new shares or issue further Class A and B Secured Notes.
During the period, the Group achieved its covenants under the terms of the Group’s secured borrowings (see ‘Liquidity
risk’ above).
Group Accounts
2 Financial risk management (continued) The Group has adopted IFRS 8, Operating segments from 1 January 2009. The chief operating decision maker has
been identified as the four Executive Directors. These Directors review the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess
performance and allocate resources. No changes to the reporting segments previously disclosed have been
implemented as the Group previously reported based on how it manages the business. The Group has three reporting
segments, funeral services, crematoria and pre–arranged funeral plans. The Group also reports central overheads,
which comprise unallocated central expenses.
Funeral services represent the sale of funerals and memorials at the time of need.
Crematoria represent the performance of cremations at the time of need, together with the sale of memorials at the
time of need and in advance.
Pre–arranged funeral plans represent the revenue from the sale of funerals in advance to customers wishing to make
their own funeral arrangements, and the marketing and administration costs associated with making such sales.
Substantially all Group revenue is derived from, and substantially all of the Group’s net assets are located in, the
United Kingdom and Channel Islands. Overseas transactions are not material.
Underlying profit comprises profit before profit on sale of fixed assets and any exceptional items. Underlying operating
profit is included as it is felt that adjusting operating profit for profit on sale of fixed assets provides a better indication
of the Group’s performance.
The revenue and operating profit (which includes Recoveries within pre–arranged funeral plans of £1.5 million in both
periods), by segment, was as follows:

Under IFRS the tax rate is higher (2008: higher) than the standard UK tax rate of 28 per cent due to combination of
the impact of disallowable trading expenses and expenditure on the Group’s premises that does not attract any
deductions for tax purposes.
The Group’s effective tax rate in the period is 29 per cent (2008: 29.5 per cent (excluding the non–recurring
adjustment)).
The Group anticipates its effective tax rate will remain at 29 per cent in the 2010 financial period andbeyond,
assuming no change in legislation.

Interim dividend represents the interim dividend that was approved and paid in the period out of earnings generated in

A final dividend of 8.07 pence per share, in respect of 2009, has been proposed by the Board. This will be paid on
25 June 2010 provided approval is gained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 4 June 2010 and will
be paid to shareholders on the register at close of business on 28 May 2010.
8 Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per Ordinary Share has been based on the profit for the relevant period.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to
assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares being those share options granted to employees
under the Group’s SAYE Scheme and the contingently issueable shares under the Group’s LTIP Schemes. At the
balance sheet date, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the LTIP Schemes had not been met
and these contingently issueable shares have been excluded from the diluted EPS calculations.
The Board believes that profit on ordinary activities before exceptional items, profit on sale of fixed assets and after
taxation is a useful indication of the Group’s performance, as it excludes significant non–recurring items. This reporting
measure is defined as ‘Underlying profit after taxation’.
Accordingly, the Board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation is
also a useful indicator of financial performance.

Impairment tests for goodwill and other intangible assets
As described in note 1, goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life are subject to annual impairment
tests in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.
For the purpose of impairment testing:
(i) Goodwill is tested at a business segment level.
(ii) Other intangible assets are allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (‘CGUs’) on a regional basis.
The segmental allocation is shown below:
Amortisation of £0.2 million (2008: £0.2 million) is included within administrative expenses in the income statement.

33.3 129.8 163.1
The recoverable amount of a CGU is based on a value–in–use calculation. However, the assets allocated to head office
are tested for impairment by reference to the Group as a whole.
The value–in–use calculations use cash flow projections based on the latest management expectations. Key assumptions
used to produce the annual budget are the estimated UK death rates (based on historical death rates supplied by
ONS), anticipated market share (based on actual experience) and anticipated price increases. Cash flows beyond the
initial 12 month period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.25 per cent (2008: 2.25 per cent). The cash flows are
discounted at a pre–tax rate of 9.2 per cent (2008: 9.2 per cent). This rate is used to analyse each CGU because they
all have similar risk profiles. Given the stability and predictability of the industry, cash flows for the following 20 years
have been taken into account. Based on these calculations, the discount rate would have to increase to at least 22 per
cent, or the growth rate would have to reduce to at least minus 11 per cent to result in any impairment of goodwill or
intangible assets.
On the basis of the above, the review indicated that no impairment arose in any segment (2008: £nil).

(a) Prepayments
This balance represents the amounts paid to acquire the long leasehold interest in land at certain of the Group’s
properties. Management consider that leases greater than fifty years at inception are long leases. The balance is
expensed on a straight–line basis over the term of the relevant lease. The leases expire at various times over the next
thirty to nine hundred years.
(b) Deferred commissions
The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies.
A commission is paid when the policy is charged to the Group. As this commission is fully refundable if the Group does
not perform the funeral for any reason, it is carried as a debtor and expensed when the funeral is performed.

(a) Class A and B Secured Notes – issued April 2003
On 11 April 2003, Dignity Finance PLC issued £110,000,000 Class A Secured Notes (the ‘A notes’) and £100,000,000
Class B Secured Notes (the ‘B notes’).
The A notes carry interest at 6.31 per cent, payable half yearly in arrears. The A notes are repayable in instalments
ending in December 2023. The transaction costs incurred on issue of the A notes totalled £9.8 million. The B notes
carry interest at 8.151 per cent, payable half yearly in arrears. The B notes are repayable in instalments ending in
December 2030. The transaction costs incurred on issue of the B notes totalled £8.9 million.
The principal outstanding on the Secured Notes and related issue costs have been presented on a net basis in the table
above. Both the A notes and the B notes are secured by first ranking security in respect of the undertakings and assets
of Dignity (2002) Limited and its subsidiaries.
At 25 December 2009, £91.6 million(2008: £95.1 million) of the principal of the A notes and £100.0 million
(2008: £100.0 million) of the principal of the B notes was outstanding.
At 25 December 2009, £5.6 million (2008: £6.2 million) and £6.3 million (2008: £6.7 million) of the transaction costs
in respect of the A notes and the B notes respectively remain unamortised.
(b) Class A and B Secured Notes – issued February 2006
On 21 February 2006, Dignity Finance PLC issued £45,550,000 Class A Secured Notes (the ‘Further A notes’) and
£32,500,000 Class B Secured Notes (the ‘Further B notes’).
The Further A notes carry interest at 6.31 per cent, payable half yearly in arrears. The Further A notes are repayable in
instalments ending in December 2023. The transaction costs incurred on issue of the Further A notes totalled
£1.9 million. The Further B notes carry interest at 8.151 per cent, payable half yearly in arrears. The Further B notes
are repayable in instalments ending in December 2030. The transaction costs incurred on issue of the Further B notes
totalled £1.8 million. The principal outstanding on the Secured Notes and related issue costs have been presented on a
net basis in the table on page 59. Both the Further A notes and the Further B notes are secured by first ranking
security in respect of the undertakings and assets of Dignity (2002) Limited and its subsidiaries.
At 25 December 2009, £38.0 million (2008: £39.4 million) of the principal of the Further A notes and £32.5 million
(2008: £32.5 million) of the principal of the Further B notes was outstanding.
At 25 December 2009, £1.2 million (2008: £1.5 million) and £1.5 million (2008: £1.5 million) of the transaction costs
in respect of the Further A notes and the Further B notes respectively remain unamortised.
The Further A notes and Further B notes were issued at a premium of £3.6 million and £10.8 million respectively, which
is being released in proportion to the interest cost in the notes. At the balance sheet date £2.4 million (2008: £2.7 million)
and £8.7 million (2008: £9.2 million) respectively remained unamortised.

(d) Other financial liabilities
On 20 December 2002, Dignity (2002) Limited entered into contracts to swap the floating rate interest on a bank loan
into fixed rate. Contractually, these swaps were not effective until 30 April 2003.
On 11 April 2003, as described in note 16(a), the Group issued Secured Notes at a fixed rate of interest. These notes
replaced the bank loan. Consequently, the swaps were no longer required as the Group had no interest rate risk on the
Secured Notes. As a result, the Group entered into further contracts on 11 April 2003 to swap fixed rate interest into
floating in order to offset the original swaps and eliminate any interest rate risk in this regard.
16 Financial liabilities (continued)
Group Accounts 61 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
16 Financial liabilities (continued)
Group Accounts
16 Financial liabilities (continued)
As a result of interest rate movements between these two dates, the combined effect of all the contracts was that the
Group makes fixed and determinable bi–annual payments on a notional principal amount.
These swap agreements were entered into under one ISDA master agreement. This master agreement forces the swaps
to be viewed and settled on a net basis only; a position that cannot be altered without the written consent of
both parties.
Accordingly, the overall transaction represents a financial liability. The fair value represents the discounted net present
value of future cash flows. Further, as these contracts related to the raising of the Secured Notes, the liability has been
accounted for as a transaction cost of the Class A and B Secured Notes and is being amortised in accordance with
IAS 39.
(e) Crematoria acquisition facility
The Group also has a £10 million crematoria acquisition facility (‘the Crematoria Acquisition Facility’). £7.4 million
carries interest at 5.59 per cent per annum. The remaining £2.6 million carries interest at a rate relative to three
month LIBOR, with such rate being capped at 5.59 per cent. Consequently, the Group carries limited risk to increases
in LIBOR on this facility. The Crematoria Acquisition Facility is fully drawn and will be repayable in one payment in
November 2013.
The transaction costs incurred on the Crematoria Acquisition Facility were £0.2 million (2008: £0.2 million). The
principal outstanding on the Crematoria Acquisition Facility and related issue costs have been presented on a net basis
in the table above.
At 25 December 2009, £10.0 million (2008: £7.4 million) of the principal was outstanding. At 25 December 2009,
£0.2million (2008: £0.2 million) of the transaction costs remained unamortised.
For further details of security over the Crematoria Acquisition Facility see note 30(b).

The non–cancellable operating leases principally relate to leasehold land and buildings.
Of the total operating lease payments charged to trading expenses, £0.1 million (2008: £0.1 million) are in respect of
contingent rentals. The contingent rentals are based on the revenues generated at the specific locations.
Sublease payments received in the year amount to £0.4 million (2008: £0.6 million). Total future sublease payments
receivable relating to operating leases amount to £0.5 million (2008: £0.6 million).
In addition, the Group has operating lease commitments with rentals determined in relation to sales. It is not possible
to quantify future rentals payable under such leases.

(a) Dilapidations
The provision for dilapidations covers the costs of repair to leased premises occupied by the Group in respect of which
a dilapidations notification has been received, and properties where a dilapidation obligation exists but for which no
notification has been received.
It is anticipated that the element of provision relating to dilapidation notices served, £0.7 million (2008: £0.6 million),
will be incurred in the following financial year, and the element relating to dilapidation obligations where no notice has
been served will be utilised over the terms of the relevant property leases, the majority of which is expected to be by
31 December 2018.
(b) Asbestos rectification
In May 2004, the Control of Asbestos at Work regulations came into effect. This introduces an explicit duty to manage
asbestos in all non–domestic properties. Those who have responsibility for the maintenance and/or repair of the
premises are similarly responsible for the control of asbestos. Therefore, where the Group has entered into leases with
a ‘tenant–repairing’ clause, it is also responsible for the control of asbestos.
The provision includes the expected rectification costs of properties not yet surveyed for asbestos plus the estimated
costs of surveying these properties. It is anticipated that the provision will be utilised by the end of 2010.
(c) Onerous contracts
The Group has provided for the discounted future costs of certain contracts to which the Group is legally bound. These
contracts relate to vacant leasehold properties and other contracts from which no economic benefit is derived. The
provision will be utilised over the term of the contracts and it is anticipated that it will be fully utilised after seven years.
Included within the provision is an amount of £0.1 million (2008: £0.2 million) relating to the expected costs of
ongoing rent reviews, the outcomesof which have been based on recent experience of similar reviews on other
properties.

(d) Cancellation provision
As described in note 1, the Group receives monies from certain pre–arranged funeral plan Trusts in respect of the
marketing of pre–arranged funeral plans, which are refundable to the Trust in the event of cancellation.
The provision covers the expected cost of such cancellations anticipated to occur in future years relating to plans
sold before the balance sheet date and is anticipated to be utilised over the next three years.
20 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 28 per cent
(2008: 28 per cent).

All of the deferred tax assets were available for offset against deferred tax liabilities and hence the net deferred tax
provision at 25 December 2009 was £26.0 million (2008: £24.4 million).
No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of losses within the Group amounting to £4.3 million net at 28 per cent
(2008: £4.1 million net at 28 per cent). Based on the current debt structure of the Group and the nature of these
losses, the Directors do not consider that taxable profitswill arise in the relevant company from which the future
reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Elements of these deferred tax balances may be payable/recoverable within one year. However, the Directors consider
that it is not possible to quantify the amount because the level of uncertainty in the timing of events and have
therefore classified the whole balance as due after more than one year.

21 Financial instruments
Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by
discounting expected future cash flows at relevant interest rates. The carrying values of short term borrowings
approximate to book value.
Trade receivables are held net of impairment.
Fair value estimation
On 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the
balance sheet at fair value, this requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value
measurement hierarchy:
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1).
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).
All assets and liabilities are held at book value other than interest rate swaps which are held at fair value. These swaps
are level 2 with all other assets and liabilities level 1.

As at 25 December 2009, £7.2 million of the gross trade receivables (2008: £6.9 million) were past due and partially
impaired. A provision for impairment is established based on historical experience. The amount of the provision, as at
25 December 2009, was £3.6 million (2008: £3.3 million). The individually impaired receivables principally relate to
monies owing for funerals performed by the funeral services division. The aging of these receivables is as follows:

£40.0 million of the amount above is a liquidity facility relating to the Class A and B Secured Notes. This facility may
only be used to repay interest and principal on the Secured Notes in the event of insufficient cash to service these
instruments. The facility is subject to annual renewal. However, if the bank providing the facility does not renew it, then
the provider is required to place £40.0 million in a bank account, which the Group may access as if it represented a
borrowing facility on the same terms.
The remaining £5.0 million facility expires in April 2013. Both these facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.

Potential issues of Ordinary Shares
Certain employees hold options to subscribe for shares in the Company under an approved Save As You Earn (SAYE)
Scheme started in 2007. In addition, Executive Directors and senior management hold options to subscribe for shares
in the Company under Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) awarded in 2007, 2008 and 2009.

LTIP Schemes
The LTIP Scheme was introduced after the flotation of the Group in 2004. Under the LTIP Scheme, the remuneration
committee can grant options over shares in the Company to employees of the Group. Awards under the LTIP Scheme
are generally reserved for Executive Directors and senior management. The Company has made annual grants since
April 2004. Options granted under the LTIP Scheme will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of
grant, subject to the conditions described on pages 25 and 26. Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment
unless an individual ceases to be an employee by reason of death, illness, redundancy or other similar circumstances.
Options were valued using the Monte Carlo option pricing model. Performance conditions were included in the fair
value calculations. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
20 March 18 March 27 March
Grant date 2009 2008 2007
Share price at grant date £5.66 £7.62 £6.68

Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 2.1% 1.6% 1.6%
Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 0% 0% 0%
Fair value per option £3.11 £4.13 £3.62
The expected volatility is calculated by reference to historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the
average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero–coupon UK government bonds of a
term consistent with the assumed option life.
During the period, nil options (2008: nil) under the 2006 LTIP Scheme, 206 options (2008: 2,522) under the 2007
LTIP Scheme, 874 (2008: 1,770) under the 2008 LTIP scheme and 1,527 under the 2009 LTIP scheme were forfeited.
253,482 options were exercised under the 2006 LTIP Scheme during the period. The share price of the options
exercised during the period was £5.48.
The charge to the income statement in the period in respect of the LTIP Schemes was £0.8 million (2008: £0.7 million).
All of which are equity based settled.
SAYE Scheme
One Inland Revenue approved SAYE Scheme was in place during the period and was valued using the Black–Scholes
option pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. The fair value per option
granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:

During the period 38,922 (2008: 40,821) under the 2007 SAYE Scheme were forfeited and 36 options (2008: 528)
were exercised. The weighted average share price of the options exercised during the period was £5.20.
The charge to the income statement in the period in respect of the SAYE Schemes was £0.2 million (2008: £0.1 million).

In addition to the above, the consolidated balance sheet also includes finance lease obligations and other financial
liabilities which totalled £6.7 million (2008: £7.0 million). These amounts do not represent sources of funding for the
Group and are therefore excluded from the calculation of net debt.
The Group’s primary financial covenant in respect of the Secured Notes requires EBITDA to total debt service to be at
least 1.5 times. At 25 December 2009, the actual ratio was 2.60 times (2008: 2.55 times).
These ratios are calculated for EBITDA and total debt service on a 12 month rolling basis and reported quarterly. In
addition, both terms are specifically defined in the legal agreement relating to the Secured Notes. As such, they can
not be accurately calculated from the contents of this report.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009
During 2009, the Group acquired the operational interest of seven funeral locations and five crematoria. These transactions
were either acquisitions of trade and assets or acquisitions of the entire issued share capital of a limited company.
All these acquisitions have been accounted for under the acquisition method. None were individually material and
consequently have been aggregated.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess over the net assets acquired is
recognised as goodwill. This represents the value to the Group of the funeral or crematoria locations.
The fair value adjustments contain some provisional amounts, which will be finalised in 2010. These adjustments
reflect the recognition of trade names and associated deferred taxation and adjustments to reflect the fair value of
other working capital movements such as debtors, stock and accruals.
The businesses acquired have their assets and liabilities amalgamated within the existing business structure and as
such, it is impractical to determine, without undue expense and delay due to the immaterial size of each, the post
acquisition results.
It is also not possible to quantify the results of these businesses prior to acquisition as it represents confidential
information relating to the vendors, which the Directors do not have authority to disclose.

Defined contribution schemes 0.1 0.1
Defined benefit plans
In 2005, the Group operated two defined benefit plans in the UK. On 6 April 2006 the Dignity 1972 Pension Scheme
was merged into the Dignity Pension and Assurance Scheme. A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April
2008. The valuation results of the merged scheme were updated to 24 December 2009 (being the last business day
before the balance sheet date) by a qualified independent Actuary.
For 2009, the employer’s contribution rate payable was 9.2 per cent of Pensionable Salaries (2008: 5.5 per cent of
Pensionable Salaries plus £39,750 per month). The total monetary contribution paid by the employer for 2009 was
£1.3 million (2008: £1.2 million).
The principal assumptions used by the actuary were:
Assumptions 2009 2008
Discount rate 5.7% 6.25%
Expected long–term rate of return on assets 5.5% 5.4%
Rate of increase in salaries 3.75% 3.15%

29 Other commitments
Dignity Pre–arrangement Limited, Dignity Securities Limited and Advance Planning Limited are fellow members of the
Dignity Group in the United Kingdom. These companies have sold pre–arranged funeral plans to their clients in the past.
All monies from these sales are held and controlled by three independent Trusts, being the National Funeral Trust, the
Dignity Limited Trust Fund and the Trust for Age Concern Funeral Plans respectively. Full details of the transactions can
be found in the financial statements of these companies, which are available from Plantsbrook House, 94 The Parade,
Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, B72 1PH.
The Group has given commitments to certain of these clients to perform their funeral. The cost of the performance
of these funerals will be paid out of the funds held in the Trusts.
During the period, the Group has committed to develop a new crematorium in Cambridgeshire.
It is the view of the Directors that none of these commitments are onerous to the Group. 74 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009

30 Contingent liabilities
(a) Securitisation
On 11 April 2003, the Group refinanced its debt by way of a whole business securitisation. Furthermore, on 21 February
2006 further Secured Notes were issued on identical terms. As a result, the following guarantees and charges were
granted to BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited in its capacity as Security Trustee in the securitisation:
• The Dignity (2002) Group have granted the Security Trustee fixed and floating charges over the assets and
undertakings of the Dignity (2002) Group;
• Dignity plc has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares (and any
monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity (2004) Limited;
• Dignity (2004) Limited has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares
(and any monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity Holdings No.2 Limited and Dignity
(2002) Limited;
• Dignity Holdings No. 2 Limited has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the
shares (and any monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity Holdings Limited;
• Dignity Holdings Limited has granted the Security Trustee, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares
(and any monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity Mezzco Limited;
• Dignity Holdings Limited has also assigned to the Security Trustee by way of security with full title guarantee, its
right title and interest in the loans (both interest and non interest bearing) to Dignity Mezzco Limited;
• Dignity Mezzco Limited has also assigned to the Security Trustee by way of security with full title guarantee, its right
title and interest in the loan to Dignity (2002) Limited.
At 25 December 2009, the amount outstanding in relation to these borrowings was £273.2 million (2008:
£278.8 million).
(b) Crematoria acquisition facility
On 24 November 2008, the Group obtained a £10 million loan facility from the National Westminster Bank plc (‘Nat
West’), which is fully drawn. As a consequence of the legal structure of this facility:
• Dignity plc has granted Nat West, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares (and any monies
receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity (2008) Limited;
• Dignity (2008) Limited has granted Nat West, with full title guarantee a first fixed charge over the shares (and any
monies receivable in respect of the shares) which it holds in Dignity Crematoria Limited;
• Dignity (2008) Limited and Dignity Crematoria Limited have granted Nat West fixed and floating charges over the
assets and undertakings of each of Dignity (2008) Limited and Dignity Crematoria Limited; and
• Dignity plc have acted as guarantor in the event that Dignity (2008) Limited fails to pay interest due on the facility.
In the opinion of the Directors no liability is likely to crystallise in respect of these guarantees.
At 25 December 2009, the amount outstanding in relation to these borrowings was £10 million (2008: £7.4 million). 75 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009

Company Accounts
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended 25 December
2009 which comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 21, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and InternationalStandardsonAuditing(UKandIreland).ThosestandardsrequireustocomplywiththeAuditing
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 25 December 2009;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009 for which the parent
company financial statements are prepared is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the consolidated financial statements of Dignity plc for the 52 week period ended
25 December 2009.

C1 Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by
the revaluation of share–based payments and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable United
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). A summary of the principal
accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
In accordance with the concession granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account
of the Company has not been separately presented in the financial statements.
In the current period, the Company’s financial statements have been prepared for the 52 week period ended 25 December
2009. For the comparative period, the Company’s financial statements have been prepared for the 52 week period
ended 26 December 2008.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided within FRS 8, Related Party Disclosures, not to disclose
transactions with subsidiary undertakings, whose voting rights are controlled within the Group.
Furthermore, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided within FRS 29, Financial Instruments and
Disclosures, not to disclose details of any financial instruments held.
Fixed assets investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at historical cost, less any provision for impairment.
Impairment of fixed assets
The carrying values of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or at the end of the first full financial year following the
recognition. Any impairment in the value of fixed assets below depreciated historical cost is charged to the profit and
loss account within operating profit. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account to
the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Employee share schemes
The Company operates two employee share schemes: The Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’) and Long Term Incentive
Plan Scheme (‘LTIP’). See note 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company applies UITF 44 in respect of share option schemes resulting in the charge for such schemes being
recognised in a subsidiary of the Company. The Company’s financial statements reflect the cost of the scheme as an
increase in the cost of investment in the subsidiary.
The expected fair value of the share options awarded under the LTIP scheme are charged to the profit and loss account
over the period in which the right to the options is earned. The fair value is calculated by reference to the market value
of the shares at the date on which the options are awarded reduced by any consideration payable by the relevant
employee.
Details of Directors’ remuneration can be found in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 24 to 30.
Taxation including deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are regarded as more likely than
not to be recoverable. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Employee share trust
The assetsof the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the directors consider that
Dignity plc has de facto control. In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts and the substance of the
transaction, the trust’s assets and liabilities are recognised in the Company’s balance sheet within share capital
and reserves.

Notes
1. The right to vote at the meeting is determined by reference to the register of members. Only those shareholders registered in the register of members 
of the Company as at 6.00pm on 2 June 2010 (or, if the meeting is adjourned 6.00pm on the date which is two working days before the date of the
adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time.
Changes to entries in the register of members after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote (and the
number of votes they may cast) at the meeting.
2.   A member of the Company entitled to attend and to vote may appoint, one or more proxies to attend and vote instead. A proxy need not be a member
of the Company. A proxy form is enclosed. Completed proxy forms must be received by the Company’s Registrar, Equiniti, Aspect House, Spencer Road,
Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6ZX, no later than 48 hours before the time of the Annual General Meeting or in the event the meeting is adjourned, no
later than 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that
each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. Failure to specify the number of shares
each proxy appointment relates to or specifying a number which when taken together with the numbers of shares set out in the other proxy appointments
is in excess of the number of shares held by the shareholder may result in the proxy appointment being invalid. Additional proxy forms may be obtained
by contacting the Company's registrar on 0871 384 2674 or you may photocopy the proxy form. You will need to state clearly on each proxy form the
number of shares in relation to which the proxy is appointed. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes 
to the proxy form. The right of a member under section 324 of the Companies Act 2006 ("2006 Act") to appoint a proxy does not apply to a person
nominated to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the 2006 Act.
3.   The appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member of the Company from attending, speaking and voting in person at the meeting if he or she 
so wishes.
4.   In the case of shares held in uncertificated form, the Company pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, specifies
that only members registered on the register of members of the Company at 6.00pm on 2 June 2010 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the
meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries on the register of members after 6.00pm on 2
June 2010 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend, speak or vote at the meeting.
5.   The following are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours on any weekday (excluding public holidays)
and will be available for at least 15 minutes prior to, and during, the Annual General Meeting:
• the register of Directors’ interests and those of their immediate families in the share capital of the Company;
• copies of the Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment;
• a copy of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association.
6.   Biographical details of those Directors who are offering themselves for re-election at the meeting are set out on page 20.
7.   Total Voting Rights: As at 16 April 2010  (being the last practicable date before the publication of this notice), the Company's issued share capital
consists of 63,881,366 Ordinary Shares of 9 pence each, (carrying one vote each) and 1 deferred share of 4 pence (carrying no voting rights). 
The Company does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 16 April 2010 are 63,881,366. 8 5 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009
8.   Shareholders have the right to ask questions at the meeting relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting in accordance with section 319A 
of the Act. The Company must answer any such question unless:
(a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or would involve the disclosure of confidential information;
(b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or
(c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
9.   The information required by section 311A of the Act to be published in advance of the meeting, which includes the matters set out in this notice and
information relating to the voting rights of shareholders, is available at www.dignityfunerals.co.uk/corporate.
10. Members can appoint proxies electronically by logging on to the website www.sharevote.co.uk. You will need your voting reference numbers (the voting
ID, Task ID and shareholder reference number shown on your form of proxy). Alternatively, if you have registered for a Shareview portfolio, please access
the Equiniti shareview website at www.shareview.co.uk, by entering your portfolio identification particulars and click on the link ‘vote’ under your Dignity plc
holding details. For an electronic proxy appointment to be valid, the appointment must be received by no later than 11.00am on 2 June 2010.
11. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the procedures
described in the CREST Manual (available at www.euroclear.com/CREST). CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members and those
CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to
take the appropriate action on their behalf. 
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (formerly CRESTCo's) specifications and must contain
the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of
a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the
issuer's agent (ID RA 19) by no later than 11.00 am on 2 June 2010. No such message received through the CREST network after this time will be
accepted. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST
Applications Host) from which the registrars are able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST . After this time,
any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the
input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal
member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s))
such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection,
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations 2001.
12. Where a copy of this notice is being received by a person who has been nominated to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the 2006 
Act ("nominee"):
(a) the nominee may have a right under an agreement between the nominee and the member by whom he was nominated, to be appointed, or to have
someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting; or
(b) if the nominee does not have any such right or does not wish to exercise such right, the nominee may have a right under any such agreement to 
give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights.
The statement of the rights of the shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in notes 2, 3, 10 and 11 does not apply to a nominee. 
The rights in such notes can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
13. A shareholder which is a corporation may authorise one or more persons to act as its representative(s) at the meeting. Each such representative may
exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder, provided that (where
there is more than one representative and the vote is otherwise than on a show of hands) they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
14. A shareholder or shareholders meeting the qualification criteria set out in note 17 below may require the Company to give shareholders notice of 
a resolution which may properly be proposed and is intended to be proposed at the meeting in accordance with section 338 of the 2006 Act.
A resolution may properly be proposed unless (i) it would, if passed, be ineffective (whether by reason of inconsistency with any enactment or the
Company's constitution or otherwise), (ii) it is defamatory of any person, or (iii) it is frivolous or vexatious.
The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes a resolution circulated pursuant to this right.

(c) be received by the Company no later than six weeks before the meeting.
15. A shareholder or shareholders meeting the qualification criteria set out in note 17 below may require the Company to include in the business to be dealt
with at the meeting any matter (other than a proposed resolution) which may properly be included in the business in accordance with section 338A of
the 2006 Act.
A matter may properly be included unless (i) it is defamatory of any person, or (ii) it is frivolous or vexatious.

statement setting out any matter that such shareholders propose to raise at the meeting relating to either the audit of the Company's accounts
(including the auditors' report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the meeting or any circumstances connected with an auditor 
of the Company ceasing to hold office since the last annual general meeting of the Company in accordance with section 527 of the 2006 Act.

to be dealt with at the meeting as set out in note 15, or (iii) to publish audit concerns as set out in note 16, the relevant request must be made by:

2 Chairman’s statement
for the year ended 31 May 2008
In the year ended 31 May 2011 the Company achieved a 7.3% increase in revenues to £863,439 (2010:
£804,800). These revenue levels although higher than last year were lower than expected or budgeted. Losses
before taxation for the period were higher at £973,888 (2010: £747,091). Losses after taxation for the period
were also higher at £870,961 (2010: £536,019).
Highlights for the 12 month period were:
● During October 2010, the Company signed a Development Agreement with a major US manufacturer of
wheels and brake systems for the aircraft industry. Over the past 24 months, the Company has undertaken a
series of brake disc trials with this client and this agreement formalises the business relationship between the
two companies. This is initially a development agreement and due to the nature of projects of this type, it is
difficult to predict timetables and success thresholds. Nevertheless, both parties are focused on completing
the development test programmes and, should the Company’s carbon ceramic product pass all test criteria,
the business will move to commercial supply.
● During March 2011 the Company entered into a new supply agreement with one of its main clients, Mov’IT
International. This contract expires on 31 December 2014 and provides for the sale of ceramic brake discs
with a minimum value of approximately £2.7 million (€3.1 million) over the contract term.
● Development costs were substantially higher than the previous year due to increased costs associated with
new testing work which was not funded by the customer, but which was necessary for automotive and
aircraft brake evaluation programmes. The Board anticipates that such costs will be considerably reduced in
the coming financial year.
● In March 2011 we commenced a new level of commercial partnership with Alcon Components Ltd, an
existing client, for the supply of carbon ceramic brake discs for selected ranges of high performance cars for
both road and track use. The first application is the supply of ceramic brake discs for the Nissan GTR for their
Asian markets and distributors. Alcon is one of the premier UK based brake systems suppliers to both the
automotive OEM and aftermarket.
● During November 2010, the Company raised £1.19 million, net of expenses, by way of a Placing and Open
Offer to shareholders. The new ordinary shares were issued at 17 pence per share. The additional funds have
and will be used to increase production capacity and tooling and reduce the direct cost of manufacturing
carbon ceramic discs as well as to support ongoing working capital.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
In the year ended 31 May 2011 revenues were £863,439 (2010: £804,800). This 7.3% increase in revenues,
although lower than expected, was achieved with no sales of discs to the US brake system supplier for the
development of a next generation military vehicle. Such sales, at approximately £250,000, were significant
during the financial year ended 31 May 2010. These revenues have been replaced by sales to commercial
automotive clients. The Board does not anticipate selling any further discs to the US military development project
until late 2012, by which time we hope that the brake trials will have been completed satisfactorily. It is our
understanding that our ceramic discs have performed well to date during testing; there have been no breakages
or failures, which is very encouraging but consequently there have been no replacement disc sales.
The order book and contracted sales for the year ending 31 May 2012 amounts to £568,000 (31 May 2010:
£521,996). The contracted sales, expected to be in excess of £280,000, relate to a three year, forward
contractual supply agreement the Company entered into in March 2011 with one of its main clients, Mov’IT
International.

3 Chairman’s statement
continued
Losses after taxation were £870,961 (2010: £536,019). There are two main reasons for the increased losses: 
(i) an increase in research and development costs which was not funded by clients. These were incurred to
evaluate brake discs for a number of new car platforms and for an aircraft brake and (ii) an unexpected reduction
in R&D tax credits of £108,000. Hitherto, annual tax credits of approximately £200,000 have been received by
the Company to cover R&D activity. 
Looking ahead our R&D tax credit advisers, Baker Tilly, expect tax credits to continue to be received by the
Company and within a range of £150,000 to £170,000. Research costs, not funded by customers, are expected
to fall back sharply to more historic levels in the financial year ending 31 May 2012. 
The Company has taken additional steps to reduce its cost base and savings of approximately £170,000 p.a for
the year commencing 1 June 2011 should be achieved.
Loss per share was 3.09 pence (2010: loss 2.33 pence).
The Company had a cash balance of £615,145 at 31 May 2011 (31 May 2010: £414,513).
Shareholders funds were £1,489,607 (31 May 2010: £1,079,133).
DIRECTORS AND STAFF
Professor David Clark, one of the four founders of the Company in 1992, will not be seeking re election as a non
executive director at the AGM in October this year. David is one of the UK’s leading and most respected scientists
in carbon fibre and carbon ceramic technology and he is an adviser to a number of institutions on this subject
including the Ministry of Defence. He co-founded the Company as a spin out from ICI where he had been a
director in charge of Development and New Technologies. We shall miss his regular counsel at the Board but
we shall continue to have access to his advice.
Dr. Geoff Gould has reached retirement age and has recently reduced his executive status from full time to part
time and he intends to retire fully this year. Geoff is responsible for sales to the aircraft brake and rocket motor
markets and joined in 2001 from Honeywell where he was a senior executive in the carbon fibre business. I am
pleased, however, that we shall continue to have access to his experience and counsel on a consultancy basis
whenever required going forward.
With the retirement of David and Geoff during 2011, the Company is very fortunate that David Bundred has
today agreed to join the Board as a Non Executive director. David is a chartered engineer and has had a senior
and very successful career at some of the UK’s leading industrial businesses. His commercial experience is highly
relevant to the aircraft and automotive brake markets that the Company addresses. During a 24 year career at
Lucas his appointments included General Manager of the Brake Controls and the Truck Brakes Divisions and
between 1993-1999 he was a Divisional Managing Director and latterly Chief Operating Officer of Lucas
Aerospace. Until he retired in 2005, he was CEO of TMD Friction Group GmbH in Germany, a large, global
supplier of brake pads to the automobile industry.
I would like to thank all my colleagues, management and staff alike, for their hard work and dedication over the
past year. It is a credit to all staff that the Company has again maintained its ISO 9001 accreditation.

OUTLOOK
The 2011 financial year was disappointing for management as we had expected revenues to be much higher
together with lower development costs. Nevertheless, the sales achievement should not be underestimated given
difficult market conditions generally, but also as the growth was achieved in spite of there being no sales to the
next generation military project in the USA. Surface Transforms is one of only two worldwide suppliers of
ceramic brake discs and, in light of broader demand for such brake systems, we expect further expansion of our
business despite the difficulties in forecasting.
We have consistently strived to reduce our sales break even levels with lower overheads, increased productivity
and programmes to reduce unit product costs. Current estimates indicate that cash breakeven occurs at
approximately £1.5 million of revenues given the current product mix.
I said last year that the challenges facing management had moved from technology based issues to operating
matters relating to the management of working capital, production and the investment in additional process
capacity to accommodate the expected growth in revenues. These challenges continue and we have
commenced on process capacity expansion as a priority with detailed discussions currently ongoing with
selected suppliers. 
Looking ahead to May 2012, although the euro-zone economy appears fraught with challenges we do not expect
that the banking and sovereign debt problems will materially affect our automotive clients in Sweden, Germany
and the European racing industry. The deficit reduction programmes of the main European economies have
slowed defence spending and so our rocket motor development revenues are expected to remain subdued.
We anticipate lower losses for both the first half and also for the full year compared to 2010/11. We are focussed
on the business achieving cash breakeven as soon as possible and believe that increasing revenues from our
existing customer base will take us to that target. The high performance and race automotive sector in Europe is
expected to dominate our revenue profile in 2012 and there is the possibility that the supply of ceramic brake
components to the aircraft sector in the USA may commence in late calendar year 2012.

5 Chief executive’s report
for the year ended 31 May 2008
The Company expected higher revenues from the automotive market in terms of development programmes and
increased market demand, and to maintain development sales revenue from its aerospace and defence
components clients. It is always difficult predicting the adoption curve of new technologies and the anticipated
demand from the automotive market, although growing, was slower than expected and the revenues from the
aerospace and defence markets below expectations.
AUTOMOTIVE – HIGH PERFORMANCE AND RACE CAR BRAKE SYSTEMS
The revenues from our automotive clients increased significantly in the year, more than enough to compensate
for the previous year’s sales of carbon ceramic product to the US brake system supplier for the development of
the next generation military vehicle (sales in excess of £250,000 which was non-recurring), and for the fall in
aerospace and defence component development revenues. Whilst total sales grew by 7.3%, this was below the
Board’s expectations.
Feedback from the US brake system supplier for the development of the next generation military vehicle has been
very positive with the Company’s products performing well. There have been no issues to date, which is very
encouraging.
Revenues with Koenigsegg and the North American aftermarket have continued and the Company’s revenue
growth has been strong, especially in sales to the European aftermarket with our European distribution partner
Mov’IT. The Company was pleased to sign a new supply agreement with Mov’IT in March 2011. The new
agreement covers the period to 31 December 2014 and provides for minimum sales to Mov’IT of approximately
£2.7 million (€3.1 million) over the term.
Secondly, revenues in the racing market also grew with the Company’s products being recognised as world class
by our customer, a leading global brake system supplier. 
The Company is focused on winning new business and in early 2011 began a commercial partnership with
Alcon Components Ltd, a leading UK based performance brake system supplier to both automotive OEM’s and
the aftermarket. The first commercial application to come out of the partnership is a new ceramic brake upgrade
kit for the Nissan GTR for Alcon’s Asian market. The Company believes as the partnership develops, further
systems will be produced and commercialised.
Alcon Components Ltd is also a member of the Company’s collaborative R&D project, funded by the Technology
Strategy Board. The project continues to progress on track with promising results which are of interest to both
the automotive partners Alcon and Bentley Motor Cars and rail partner Faiveley Transport.
AEROSPACE AND DEFENCE BRAKE DISCS AND COMPONENTS
The Company has worked on a number of development programs in these markets. The development with a US
brake system supplier for a carbon ceramic brake disc continues with the signing of a development agreement
in October 2010. Our client’s initial focus had been on the delivery of a new technology solution for one
particular application, although they believe the technology can be applied to other applications which they
currently supply and have therefore broadened the scope of the development. To support the development the
customer has agreed to fund the future development activities and the first of such orders has now been received.
Both companies are committed to completing the technical development and achieving a commercial solution
as quickly as possible.
Surface Transforms carbon ceramic technology is uniquely positioned to deliver affordable, high performance (in
terms of extended life and reduced mass) rocket components.

6 Chief executive’s report
continued
We have successfully completed the final year of a three year development programme with MBDA, a world
leading missile manufacturer jointly owned by BAE Systems, EADS and Finmecanica and sponsored by the UK
and French Ministries of Defence. The objective of the programme was to evaluate our proprietary carbon
ceramic technology for its use in rocket component applications. The development work delivered very
promising results in terms of material characteristic and cost to manufacture, confirming its potential use as
affordable, high performance rocket components. MBDA have also identified a number of potential rocket
components the technology could be applied too. Similarly the development program with Microturbo, one of
the world leaders in gas turbine applications for missile propulsion has delivered encouraging results during its
first year of a planned two year programme. 
In the current environment of government deficit reduction programmes, the effect on the MoD and its suppliers
is to add a high degree of uncertainty to development funds, making the future of both of these promising
programmes unclear. Consequently revenues were lower than expected this year and we anticipate this situation
will remain uncertain until at least the early part of next year.
OPERATIONS
Affordability and supply capability are the key requirements for our customers. The current economic backdrop
has seen significant price increases from some of the Company’s suppliers. The Company is working to minimise
these cost pressures both through the supply chain and within the Company’s process technology, with some
success. These activities, coupled with a significant increase in automotive development testing necessary for our
automotive customers this year, led to much higher development costs than the Company had anticipated. Now
complete, the Board is confident these costs will be greatly reduced in this new financial year. 
With the growth in the automotive market expected to continue, the company has established a capacity
expansion plan which will address the key bottlenecks through process improvement and additional process
plant.
PEOPLE
The Company continues to have a strong and focused senior management team who have supported the business
constantly during the year, showing tremendous commitment to driving the Company forward to achieving it
goals.
I would like to thank all my colleagues for their dedication and hard work during the year.

7 Directors report
for the year ended 31 May 2008
The Directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2011.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
The principal activity of the Company during the year was the development and manufacture of carbon fibre
reinforced ceramic product (CFRC) for automotive disc brake and aircraft and rocket component applications.
BUSINESS REVIEW
A review of the Company’s activities during the year is provided within the financial review section of the
Chairman’s statement on page 3.
KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
As in previous years the principal risk faced by the Company is considered to be the speed at which our
customers and potential customers adopt the new ceramic disc technology. Indications in the automotive market
are that the technology continues to be well received and is being adopted over an increasing number of
vehicles. This risk is constantly assessed by monitoring the level of enquiries and orders for both the Company
and industry wide. In addition the Company faces the continuing uncertainty created by the current economic
climate, particularly within the automotive sector.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Directors continue to monitor the business internally with a number of performance indicators: order intake,
sales output, profitability and manufacturing cost of automotive discs. The Company has met its revised
performance targets in each of these areas – please see Chairman’s statement for more details:
● Turnover £863,439 (2010: £804,800)
● Losses after taxation £870,961 (2010: £536,019) 
● Order book of £568,000 as at 31 May 2011 (2010: £521,996)
The Company produces an annual business plan and full monthly forecasts detailing sales, profitability and cash
flow to help monitor business performance going forward.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
In the short term, the Company aims to continue with its corporate strategy which is to exploit its technologies
in carbon fibre reinforced ceramics by:
● establishing contract development opportunities and collaborations with national and multi-national
customers in the aerospace and automotive industries; and 
● expanding commercial sales of CFRC products.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The majority of the Company’s staff are employed in research activities which are concentrated on the ongoing
identification of new products and applications for carbon fibre reinforced ceramic friction and non-friction
materials.
PROPOSED DIVIDEND AND TRANSFER TO RESERVES
The loss for the year after taxation amounted to £870,961 (2010: £536,019). The Directors do not recommend
the payment of a dividend.
POLICY AND PRACTICE ON PAYMENT OF PAYABLES 
It is the Company’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with the terms and conditions
agreed between the Company and its suppliers, providing that all trading terms and conditions have been
complied with. The Company does not follow any code or standard on payment practice.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Surface Transforms plc is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance. The Company
complies with the Combined Code as modified by the recommendations of the Quoted Companies Alliance to
the extent the Directors consider appropriate, given the size of the Company, its current stage of development
and the constitution of the Board. 
The Board has appointed an Audit Committee whose primary role is to review the Company’s interim and annual
financial statements before submission to the Board for approval. The Board has also appointed a Remuneration
Committee, which is responsible for reviewing executive remuneration and performance. The Remuneration
Committee is made up of four non-executive Directors, Professor David Clark, Kevin D’Silva, Ken Baker OBE
and Richard Gledhill. The Audit Committee is made up of three non-executive Directors, Professor David Clark,
Kevin D’Silva and Ken Baker OBE. Details of the Remuneration Committee are disclosed in the report on
Directors’ remuneration on pages 11 and 12.
GOING CONCERN
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors believe to be
appropriate. The Company incurred a net loss of £870,961 during the year however the Directors are satisfied,
based on detailed cash flow projections, that sufficient cash is available to meet the Company’s needs as they
fall due for at least 12 months from the date of signing the accounts. Revenues are expected to continue to
increase in the coming years resulting in the Company becoming profitable in due course. 
The Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the
current uncertain economic outlook. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that
the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, and each Director
has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
AUDITORS
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG 
Audit Plc as auditors of the Company is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
FUND RAISING
The Company secured a fundraising of £1,188,150, net of expenses, during November 2010 by the issue of new
ordinary shares at 17 pence per share to assist with working capital needs and enable investment in additional
plant and equipment necessary to significantly increase in house production capacity and reduce the direct cost
of manufacturing carbon ceramic discs.

12 Statement of directors responsibilities
in respect of the annual report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable
law.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that

18 Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 May 2011
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Surface Transforms plc (“the Company”) is a Company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements were approved by the Board on 4 August 2011.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and
under the historical cost convention. 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these financial statements.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the Directors believe to be
appropriate. The Company incurred a net loss of £870,961 during the year however the Directors are
satisfied, based on detailed cash flow projections, that sufficient cash is available to meet the Company’s
needs as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of signing the accounts. Revenues are expected
to continue to increase in the coming years resulting in the Company becoming profitable in due course. 
Further information regarding the Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect
future development, performance and position are set out in the Chairman’s statement on pages 3 to 5 and
the Director’s report on pages 8 to 10. In addition, note 19 to the financial statements includes the
Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management
objectives; details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the
current uncertain economic outlook. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Share based payments
The share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value is
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model,
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is
only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for
as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Leases in which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount
equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of
the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses. Lease payments are
accounted for as described below.

19 Notes to the financial statements
continued
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives
are as follows:
Plant and machinery – 12.5%-20% per annum
Fixtures and fittings – 15% per annum
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum
Leasehold improvements – Over life of lease
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the
functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on
translation are included in the income statement.
Leases
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part
of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding
liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Government grants
Revenue grants are credited to the statement of total comprehensive income, and included within other
operating income, so as to match them with expenditure to which they relate.
Post retirement benefits
The Company does not operate a pension scheme, but does contribute to specific employees’ personal
pension schemes. The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable
to employees personal pension schemes during the accounting year.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible and the Company intends and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Company can measure reliably
the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. No development costs met the
criteria for capitalisation in the current or preceding years.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In determining the cost of raw materials
and consumables the purchase price is used. For work in progress, cost is taken as production cost, which
includes an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred or
accelerated arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of certain items for taxation
and for accounting purposes. 
Deferred taxation is provided for in full at the tax rate which is expected to apply to the period when the
deferred taxation is expected to be realised, including on tax losses carried forward. 
Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Research and development tax credits are recognised on a cash received basis as a reduction in the current
tax payable as this is when the tax credit is considered recoverable as the associated uncertainties have
been eliminated.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits
repayable on demand.
Revenue
Revenue comprises income derived from the supply of carbon fibre materials. Revenue is recognised on
transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards of ownership, generally this will be when goods are
despatched to the customer. Turnover excludes value added taxes.
Contractual arrangements exist with specific customers which set selling prices and target volumes for
future periods. The revenue derived from specific purchase orders raised against these contracts is
recognised in a consistent manner to that described above.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and
trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Capital management
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern and satisfy
its debt as it falls due whilst also maximising opportunities to progress the development of the business. The
capital structure of the Company consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to share
holders comprising issued capital.
The key indicator of capital management performance used by management is the level of cash and cash
equivalents available to the Company. Cash balances are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the
actual position is in line with cash flow forecasts.
During the year additional cash of £1,188,150 was raised via the issue of share capital.
Interest rate risk
The Company finances its operations through cash. Cash resources are invested to attract the highest rates
for periods that do not limit access to these resources.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Liquidity risk
With regard to liquidity, the Company’s policy has throughout the year been to ensure that the Company is
able at all times to meet its financial liabilities as and when they fall due.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not already apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The
estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable.
Provision to write inventories down to net realisable value
The Company makes provisions for obsolescence based on historical experiences and management
estimates of future events. Actual outcome could vary significantly from these estimates.
Research and development expenditure
The Board considers the definitions of research and development costs as outlined in IAS 38: Intangible
assets when determining the correct treatment of costs incurred. Where such expenditure is technically and
commercially feasible, the Company intends and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Company can measure reliably
the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset it is treated as development expenditure and capitalised
on the balance sheet.
In considering whether an item of expenditure meets these criteria, the Board applies judgement. During
the year all such expenditure has been expensed to the income statement on the grounds that it relates to
feasibility studies to identify new applications for the technology or methods of improving the production
process. As the technical feasibility of this work is unknown at the time the costs are incurred, none meet
the criteria for capitalisation during the current or previous year.
Segmental reporting
The Board has reviewed the requirements of IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”, including consideration of what
results and information the Chief Executive reviews regularly to assess performance and allocate resources,
and concluded that, as under IAS 14, all revenue falls under a single business segment.
The Directors consider the business does not have separate divisional segments as defined under IFRS 8.
The Chief Executive assesses the commercial performance of the business based upon a single set of
revenues, margins, operating costs and assets.
New standards and interpretations that have been endorsed, but which are not yet effective and not 
early adopted
There are no new endorsed standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which are not yet
effective for the year ended 31 May 2011 and which will have a significant impact on the information
reported by the company in future periods.

2 SEGMENT REPORTING
Due to the start up nature of the business the Company is currently focussed on building revenue streams
from a variety of different markets. As there is only one manufacturing facility and this has capacity above
and beyond the current levels of trade there is no requirement to allocate resources to or discriminate
between specific markets or products. As a result the Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief
Executive, reviews performance information for the Company as a whole and does not allocate resources
based on products or markets. In addition, all products manufactured by the Company are produced using
similar processes.
Having considered this information in conjunction with the requirements of IFRS 8, as at the reporting date
the Board of Directors have concluded that the Company has only one reportable segment, that being the
manufacture and sale of carbon fibre materials.

can be deducted.

17 RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES
The Company purchased goods and services to the value of £5,000 from Design Q Limited. 
Kenneth Baker OBE, a non-executive director of Design Q Limited, is a non-executive Director of the
Company. 
All transactions with related parties are carried out at arms length. As at 31 May 2011, there were no
amounts outstanding with Design Q Limited (2010: £nil).
18 LOSS PER ORDINARY SHARE
The calculation of basic loss per ordinary share is based on the loss for the financial year divided by the
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Losses and number of shares used in the calculations of loss per ordinary share are set out below:
Basic
2011 2010
££
Loss after tax (870,961) (536,019)
Weighted average number of shares 28,229,963 23,012,231
Loss per share (3.09p) (2.33p)
The calculation of diluted loss per ordinary share is identical to that used for the basic loss per ordinary
share. This is because the exercise of options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share
from continuing operations and is therefore not dilutive under the terms of IAS33.

Assumptions used in the valuation of share based options
In calculating the fair value of the share based payment arrangements the Company has used the Black
Scholes method. There were no share options granted in 2011. The assumptions used to calculate the fair
value of options issued in the previous financial year on the date of grant were as follows:
Weighted average assumptions 2011 2010
Fair value per share option n/a 6.63p
Share price on date of grant n/a 8.5p
Exercise price n/a 9p
Share options granted in the year – EMI scheme n/a 340,000
Share options granted in the year – Unapproved scheme n/a 345,000
Expected volatility n/a 90%
Exercise pattern (years) n/a 3-10 years uniformly
Expected dividend yields n/a 0%
Risk free rate of return n/a 2%
The fair value of the share options is applied to the number of options that are expected to vest which takes
into account the expected and actual forfeitures over the vesting period as a result of cessation of
employment.
Expected volatility was determined by assessing the Company’s historic data and the market in which the
Company operates.
22 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market
confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return
on capital, defined as net operating income divided by total shareholders’ equity.
At present employees and Directors would hold 37% of the share capital, following the exercise of all
outstanding share options.

4. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so in
relation to the meeting, and any adjournment(s) thereof, by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual. In order for a
proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message must be transmitted so as to be received by
the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars (whose CREST ID is RA10) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified
in note 2 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the
message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the
manner prescribed. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a)
of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
5. Any corporation which is a member of the Company may authorise a person (who need not be a member of the Company) to attend,
speak and vote at the meeting as the representative of that corporation. A certified copy of the Board resolution of the corporation
appointing the relevant person as the representative of that corporation in connection with the meeting must be deposited at the office
of the Company’s Registrars prior to the commencement of the meeting.
6. Only those persons whose names are entered on the register of members of the Company at 6 p.m. on 12 October 2011 shall be
entitled to attend and vote in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that time. Changes to entries on the register
of members after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and/or vote at the meeting. 
7. The return of a completed proxy form, other such instrument or any CREST proxy instruction (see note 4) does not preclude you from
attending the meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointment
will automatically be terminated.

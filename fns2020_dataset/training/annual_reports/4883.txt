Learning Division Key Business Developments & Achievements 
Focused around the strong brand 
reputation of Epic as the UK market

methods which have enhanced Epic’s

customers a wider choice of solutions 
which best suit their changing needs

unique and tailored learning 
programmes.

The House Magazine, 
30
th 
anniversary This 
ﬂagship publication for 
Parliament celebrated its 
30
th 
anniversary in 2006 
with a commemorative 
edition and a reception 
held at 10 Downing Street. 
Contributors to this highly 
successful special edition 
included the Prime Minister, 
Tony Blair, and the former 
US President, Bill Clinton. 
The House Magazine 
continues to be the 
impartial forum for 
discussing issues of 
importance in policy 
and delivery. 
The Whitehall & 
Westminster World 
Awards Our leading 
newspaper for the senior 
civil service, Whitehall 
& Westminster World, 
launched its ﬁrst Awards 
event to identify and 
recognise best practice 
within the civil service. 
Working with the Cabinet 
Ofﬁce, and supported by 
Ernst & Young, the hugely 
successful Awards were 
introduced by the Cabinet 
Secretary, Sir Gus O’Donnell. 
Plans are already underway 
for our 2007 event. 
Online monitoring 
Dods has a formidable 
reputation for delivering a 
high quality, online political 
monitoring service that 
ensures people who work 
within the world of politics 
are kept informed of all 
that’s relevant. The 
acquisition and integration 
of Political Wizard has 
brought further beneﬁts 
to our customers with a 
new desktop intelligence 
service that tracks legislative 
progress and delivers 
bespoke information 
and brieﬁngs. 
The Regional Review 
During 2006, The 
Parliament Magazine 
strengthened its position 
as the primary publication 
and website for Brussels 
with the launch of The 
Regional Review. This 
new title provides an 
authoritative forum to 
examine the impact of EU 
investment in the Regions, 
enabling EU institutions 
and decision makers to 
read about regional policy 
developments and share 
best practice. 
Certifica te
 in Campaigning 
Certiﬁcate in 
Campaigning In line with 
the Government’s stated 
objective to empower and 
further train the voluntary 
sector, the Learning 
Division launched the 
Certiﬁcate in Campaigning 
for charities in partnership 
with the NCVO. This 
course was designed to 
improve the quality of 
lobbying and inﬂuencing 
in the non-proﬁt sector 
and has already received 
wide acclaim for the 
quality of its content 
and style of approach. 
Trainer Active online 
Building upon the 
extensive catalogue of 
training and development 
resources already available, 
we successfully launched 
TrainerActive.com in 2006. 
All the activities have been 
designed by professional 
trainers and are fully tried 
and tested, saving valuable 
preparation time for the 
signiﬁcant number of 
professional coaches and 
trainers that use our 
products. 
Quicker solutions 
During 2006, Epic 
designed and developed 
new software delivery 
tools in-house. These 
offer greater speed and 
efﬁciency and enable the 
Learning Division to 
respond more effectively 
to our customers’ changing 
needs and requirements. 
Amongst the many 
advantages is the capability 
to develop learning courses 
much quicker using 
predeﬁned navigation, 
screen frameworks and 
functionality. 
The Reform, Efﬁciency 
and Delivery Conference 
Following the Government’s 
announcement of several 
new initiatives to help 
drive forward reform, 
efﬁciency and delivery in 
the public sector, the 
Learning Division hosted 
a successful conference on 
the subject for senior civil 
servants and interested 
organisations. Supported 
by PWC, the conference 
offered an opportunity 
to examine how current 
reforms are working and 
discuss how improvements 
can be made going forward. 
Restructuring our business 
After three acquisitions 
in as many years (Le 
Trombinoscope, ATP-Egora 
and Les Editions Jean-
Baptiste Baillière Santé), 
we completed the merger 
and relocation of all the 
business units (originally 
more that ten) into one 
single entity, Huveaux 
France. We have delivered 
signiﬁcant synergies and 
cost savings along the way. 
Together with its 110 + 
employees, Huveaux 
France now operates out 
of one building in Paris. 
Successful magazine 
relaunches Our two 
leading titles, Panorama du 
Médecin and Le Concours 
Médical, were relaunched 
during 2006 as part of 
a promotion initiative to 
medical practitioners in 
France. Despite challenging 
conditions in the medical 
advertising market, these 
successful relaunches 
allowed us to maximise 
our revenue, increase 
market share and, most 
importantly, develop brand 
extensions that will enable 
further growth. 
Managing the evaluation 
of medical practice 
In 2006, Huveaux France 
won a contract from La 
Haute Autorité de Santé to 
develop a programme for 
managing the performance 
evaluation of medical 
practice. As a result, we 
became the ﬁrst publisher 
offering doctors the ability 
to analyse their medical 
practice in fulﬁlment of the 
new compulsory CME 
requirements. A ﬁrst such 
programme has just been 
launched with sponsorship 
from the French National 
Cancer Institute. 
www.Egora fr 
Egora.fr is the most 
important medical website 
dedicated to general 
practitioners and healthcare 
professionals in France. 
This all-in-one site provides 
online news, data, 
interactive case studies and 
a soon to be introduced 
extensive searchable 
archive. Further extensions 
into e-learning programs 
focused on the delivery 
and management of CME 
activities are also planned 
for 2007.  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   03

in excess of 5 million books a year.”
04  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006
2006 Overview
For the ﬁfth consecutive year since
Huveaux’s foundation, we have achieved
signiﬁcant strategic and ﬁnancial progress.
In 2006, sales grew 62% from £27.7
million to £45.0 million, while proﬁt
before tax, amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items grew 43% from £4.2
million to £6.0 million. Proﬁts were driven
by the full year impact of acquisitions
made in 2005, the addition of the new
education businesses acquired during the
year and an impressive underlying margin
growth in the divisions. Normalised
earnings per share grew 17% to 
3.1 pence. 
In line with our progressive dividend 
policy, your Board is recommending a ﬁnal
dividend of 1.21 pence per share (2005:
1.1 pence), an increase of 10% on the
previous year.
“Acquire, improve, build and add”
With the emergence of internet
technologies, the media landscape 
has been transformed during the period
since Huveaux’s foundation. Nevertheless,
the Company has been able to deliver
consistent and improving ﬁnancial
performance over that period while
keeping pace with the fundamental
changes in its markets and investing 
for the future. 
Our four-part strategy has been clear 
from the outset: 
• Acquire a market position
• Improve the existing business
• Build innovative new revenue
opportunities in line with market changes,
principally in digital and events
• Add acquisitions to secure our 
market position
By pursuing and successfully executing on
this strategy, we have created a modern
B2B media group from scratch over the
past ﬁve years. Considerable progress has
again been made in 2006 in advancing
this strategy and further progress is planned
in 2007 (see opposite page). 
Huveaux has developed strong brands 
in market-leading positions, typically 
the number one or number two in 
our selected markets. Our customers
experience these brands across print and
digital media as well as events. Our major
brands have been strengthened with
acquisitions and new launches,
consolidating our market leadership 
in the Political, Education, Healthcare 
and Learning ﬁelds and producing new
revenue sources for the future.
Digital revenues grew 75% in 2006 and
now account for 26% of Group sales,
reﬂecting the importance we place on
delivering information and services online.
Our events business, largely developed
organically, is also expanding fast and 
now comprises 12% of Group sales. 
Our Vision
Huveaux is now a sizeable business,
delivering over 25% of its sales through
digital media, running some 500 training
courses and conferences, publishing
16 magazines and newsletters and selling
in excess of 5 million books a year. 
We have delivered consistent and
improving ﬁnancial results from our
market-leading brands. We have developed
those brands to produce new revenue
sources for the future in line with customer
demand for new digitally delivered
services. Our strategy remains the same;
our ambition strengthened. We are in
a strong position going forward.
The Board, Management and People
Timothy Benn and Christina Benn stepped
down from the Board in April 2006. 
I would like to thank them for their
invaluable contribution to the ﬁrst four
years of Huveaux’s development. 
Richard Flaye was appointed a non-
executive director in September and his
considerable experience in B2B publishing
is already proving to be a valuable asset 
to the Board.
We continue to build our senior
management teams in each of the
operating divisions and have recently
recruited an experienced Managing
Director to lead our newly formed 
Education Division. 
The Board would like to thank the
management and staff of Huveaux 
for their hard work and dedication in
achieving a series of challenging targets.  
Outlook
In 2006, we made great progress towards
our strategic objective of creating a
substantial B2B media group, while
continuing to deliver double-digit proﬁt
and EPS growth.
We have achieved this while also 
improving our products and services 
across the Group, by pursuing the
opportunities offered by digital
technologies and by continuing to
broaden our revenue streams.
Although it is still early in the year, we 
have made an encouraging start to 2007.
Our four divisions all have good market
positions, leaving us well placed to exploit
market opportunities, supplemented by
targeted acquisitions. The Board looks
forward to another year of strong
ﬁnancial performance and further
strategic progress.
John P de Blocq van Kuffeler 
Executive Chairman
5 March 2007 -
Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   05 
Driving Our Business 

Our Strategy 
Huveaux’s strategic objective is to build a substantial B2B media group delivering essential and 
intelligent information, learning and training, across all media platforms, to our selected growth 
markets. We are pursuing this strategy through a combination of organic and acquisition-led 
growth. Progress to date, including the creation of four market-facing divisions, and the strong 
performance in 2006, demonstrates we are on course to achieve our stated objective. 
Our Strategic Progress in 2006 
> 
Political Division 
The acquisition of Political Wizard in July 2006 for 
£4.9 million helped strengthen our political monitoring 
business, which is the fastest growing business in our Political 
Division. The performance of Political Wizard post-acquisition 
has been in line with our positive expectations. New product 
launches, such as Dods Polling and The Civil Service Network 
portal, have expanded our product range to both government 
and the public affairs industry. 
> 
Learning Division 
The Learning Division has achieved higher margin sales 
and higher quality of earnings through Epic, the leading 
UK bespoke e-learning company. Particularly signiﬁcant 
were new private sector customers and contracts won 
in conjunction with other parts of the Huveaux Group. 
The Political Knowledge seminar and events business 
had a further year of excellent growth and our new 
TJ Best Practice Awards were a considerable success. 
Our Key Priorities in 2007 
> 
Healthcare Division 
Our Healthcare Division achieved all its principal objectives 
in 2006. Our three leading magazines achieved the highest 
accreditation for providing Continuing Medical Education 
(CME) to doctors in France and the introduction of two CME 
programmes ensured we are the market-leading CME 
publisher by revenue in that country. 
> 
Education Division 
Another major step during the year was the acquisition in 
September 2006 of Letts and Leckie & Leckie for £12.0 million. 
These have been successfully integrated with our existing 
Lonsdale revision guide business to form a new Education 
Division from the beginning of 2007. This is a key strategic 
move for Huveaux. We are fully aware of the changing 
landscape in educational publishing and that some of today’s 
suppliers do not relish the digital challenge it brings. We do 
not share this view and are conﬁdent that our current position 
in revision and testing, together with the expertise we already 
have at Epic, provide us with an excellent platform for digital 
expansion in this sector.

Continue to drive organic growth and identify 
additional revenue sources through new

Chief Executive’s Review 
“In 2006 we made great strides in our 
mission to create a truly 21st century 
B2B group with a highly diversiﬁed range 
of revenue sources. We have achieved this 
while continuing to deliver double digit 
proﬁt growth. ” 
Gerry Murray, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer

aids and revision guides 
• Successful integration of two 
strategic acquisitions 
Introduction 
At a time when all media groups face 
fundamental challenges to their business 
models, we have once again delivered 
substantial double-digit growth in both 
proﬁts and earnings per share. We have 
achieved this while also improving our 
products and services across the board, 
pursuing the opportunities offered by 
digital technologies and continuing to 
broaden our revenue streams. Our ability 
to deliver results today, while laying the 
foundations for sustainable revenue and 
proﬁt growth in the future, means we are 
well placed to take advantage of the 
communications revolution taking place 
across our industry. 
Huveaux’s core objective is to help its 
customers drive and improve their own 
individual and organisational performance. 
We do this by amplifying and expanding 
the traditional B2B model to include 
e-learning, numerous web-based 
information and communication services 
and a substantial events business. We 
believe ﬁrmly that the expansion of digital 
services and events in our markets 
represents a signiﬁcant opportunity. 
Diversifying Revenue 
In 2006, we made further good progress 
towards our strategic objective of 
becoming a substantial B2B media group, 
with diversiﬁed revenue streams around 
each of our main brands and existing 
content. We have expanded our digital 
portfolio through acquisition and new 
product launches. In July 2006, we added 
a web-based service to our political 
monitoring business with the acquisition 
of Political Wizard. This has now been 
fully integrated into the Dods business, 
enabling us to offer a much wider range 
of services and price points to customers 
as part of a recently restructured 
monitoring operation. 
Elsewhere, we have developed a web 
portal for the civil service, The Civil Service 
Network, and are developing an online 
assessment tool for secondary schools. 
In France, we have signiﬁcantly enhanced 
our Egora.fr website and are incorporating 
an extensive searchable medical archive. 
We will shortly be enhancing it still further 
with the introduction of a management 
system that will enable GPs to source, 
monitor and control their Continuing 
Medical Education (CME) activities. Our 
ability to innovate, by applying a healthy 
mix of proven and cutting-edge digital 
technologies, is greatly assisted by 
our e-learning and web development 
capabilities at Epic. 
The expansion of our events business 
has also helped us to diversify our revenue 
streams away from print subscriptions 
and advertising in 2006. We now run 
a number of prestigious awards events, 
particularly in the political and government 
sector, and we were delighted to launch 
the inaugural Civil Service Awards for 
Excellence during the year. Elsewhere, 
we ran over 500 training courses and 
conferences in the year (compared to 330 
in 2005) and our government training 
unit, Political Knowledge, was again one 
of our best-performing businesses in 
2006. Learning events also form a crucial 
part of our development as a provider 
of CME in France. We are the ﬁrst CME 
supplier to have been approved by the 
French government and we are determined 
to leverage this position and reinforce 
our lead in this ﬁeld. 
These diversiﬁcation and brand extension 
initiatives are underpinned by the 
continued dominance of our traditional 
print products in their respective markets. 
Our two major UK publications, The 
House Magazine and Parliamentary 
Monitor, both showed healthy organic 
growth in 2006. In France, we relaunched 
our weekly publication for GPs, Panorama 
du Médecin, which ended the year with 
an increased market share in the highly 
competitive pharmaceutical advertising 
market. Our newspaper for UK government, 
Whitehall and Westminster World, 
continued to grow and is now established 
reading amongst UK civil servants.  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   07

One of the highlights of last year was the 
acquisition of Letts and Leckie & Leckie, 
two companies with substantial positions 
in revision guide publishing for schools. 
Combined with our existing Lonsdale 
business, this acquisition makes us the 
clear market leader in the UK. In 2007, 
we will distribute over ﬁve million study 
aids and revision guide products. Huveaux 
has substantial ambitions in UK education. 
To this end, we have recently formed a 
dedicated Education Division to help focus 
and realise these ambitions. Our revision 
guides business will form the nucleus of 
this new division. 
Business Overview 
2006 has been a full and eventful 
year. At Group level, we have achieved 
substantial EPS and organic proﬁt growth, 
despite challenging market conditions. 
With the exception of our schools 
education business, we have improved 
margins across the Group and are well 
placed to expand in 2007 and beyond.

Our political business enjoyed a strong 
12 months performance with underlying 
organic sales growth for the year of 10% 
and, inﬂuenced particularly by a record 
number of new product launches, 18% in 
the second half. 2006 also saw the 30th 
anniversary of our ﬂagship publication, 
The House Magazine, and we are grateful 
to the Prime Minister for agreeing to 
host its birthday celebrations at 10 
Downing Street. 
In 2006, the strength and resilience of 
our political publishing business enabled 
us to grow our revenue across the board 
despite trading for the ﬁrst time in a post­
election environment in the UK. We also 
managed to produce a marked 
improvement in proﬁt and margin as 
digital and events-related revenue became 
a more signiﬁcant proportion of our 
overall income. 
Political advertising rose by 3% due to 
better than expected sales during the 
party conference season and a generally 
strong performance in the ﬁnal quarter 
of 2006. During the year, we launched 
several new awards events, including the 
highly successful Civil Service Awards 
for Excellence, alongside which we also 
launched The Civil Service Network, 
a portal for civil servants. 
Our Political Monitoring business was 
boosted by the acquisition of Political 
Wizard in July but also saw substantial 
organic growth from its existing 
operations. There is no doubt that the 
combination of the automated Wizard 
business with our existing bespoke 
offering has substantially improved our 
monitoring proposition and market 
position, leading to several signiﬁcant 
new client wins. In addition, we launched 
an EU version of Political Wizard, making 
us the only supplier of such a political 
monitoring service. 
In Europe, we forged a strong relationship 
with the Committee of the Regions and 
launched The Regional Review, a 
publication dealing exclusively with the 
funding of regional projects within the 
EU. Our French political business had a 
quiet year but showed improved proﬁts 
and margins year-on-year. 2007 is a 
double election year in France and we 
look forward to increased activity in this 
business in the next 12 months. 
Our Political Division, both in the UK and 
Europe, continues to grow from strength 
to strength.  Chief Executive’s

The number of training courses
and conferences we organised
in 2006
The Learning Division included the best
performing unit in the Group with our
Political Knowledge business showing
organic sales growth in excess of 20%
year on year. This was largely driven by
expansion in our brieﬁngs and conference
business, a highly competitive area in
which we have built substantial expertise.
In 2007 we will be producing a number 
of new blended learning programmes 
for the Civil Service combining our 
e-learning expertise with established
classroom courses.
At Epic, and as expected, sales were
marginally lower than in 2005 as we
concentrated on margin improvement and
transition to higher quality earnings (as
well as supporting many digital initiatives
elsewhere in the Group). This planned
focus has largely been achieved by using
new software tools developed in-house
and concentrating on higher value
contracts. We have won several new
clients in retail and ﬁnancial services as
well as in the public sector. Epic maintains
its position as the foremost bespoke 
e-learning supplier in the UK and a vital
ingredient in Huveaux’s digital future.
Our established Fenman business, now
known as Epic Professional, responded
well to last year’s restructuring and
showed a substantial increase in proﬁts
driven by further cost reductions and
margin improvements. The future of this
business will be based on a number of
online and e-learning offerings; although
we no longer produce training videos,
previous content is being converted for
use through digital delivery.
Included within our Learning Division for
2006 was our education business, which
at the beginning of the year consisted
solely of Lonsdale. However, with the
complementary acquisition of Letts and
Leckie & Leckie in early September, we
ﬁnished the year as the leading supplier 
of study aids and revision guides in the
UK, with full product coverage across 
all subjects and stages of the school
curriculum. The acquired businesses have
now been successfully integrated with our
existing Lonsdale product range. Together,
they will form the nucleus of our newly
created Education Division, enabling us 
to focus on our planned expansion in this
sector. The Division will be led by Andy
Ware, who joins us in March 2007. 
Andy is an extremely experienced
educational publisher having held senior
positions at Pearson, the learning arm 
of the BBC and McGraw Hill.
Compared to the record performance 
in 2005, sales at Lonsdale fell by 8% in
2006. This disruption, which was caused
by curriculum changes in Key Stage 4
Science, had an adverse proﬁt impact 
on the business. While we successfully
produced all planned books to schedule,
they did not sell in the numbers expected.
We believe that this is mainly due to a
delayed decision-making issue within
school departments as they absorb the
extent of the new curriculum changes.
The Letts and Leckie & Leckie businesses
were not affected in the same way as
they are not so dependent on Key Stage 4
Science or on direct sales to schools. Both
Letts and Leckie & Leckie delivered good
performances ahead of our expectations
during our period of ownership in 2006.
UK schools education is now a very
important sector for Huveaux and we 
will make it a targeted area for expansion
in the future. We believe the sector is
evolving rapidly and that the balance of
power amongst suppliers will be subject
to fundamental change in the near future;
several of the major players are already
planning to exit the market to avoid the
challenges posed by digital content and
delivery. However, we believe that the
move to digital will work in our favour
due to the strength of our digital training
capabilities at Epic and because our
valuable revision and testing content is
easily converted into digital delivery. Our
ambition is to become a major player in
education and we believe the quality of
our existing revision guides business
provides an excellent platform for 
that expansion.

We are the leading provider of
Continuing Medical Education
to the French healthcare
community
In France, our Healthcare publishing
business faced challenging market
conditions in 2006. The market for
pharmaceutical advertising to GPs was
down 6% year on year but our income
from advertising held steady due to
increased market share at our leading
title, Panorama du Médecin, which was
relaunched early in the year. We also
managed to substantially increase our
proﬁts from this business in 2006 by
delivering signiﬁcant improvements in 
our margin, largely as a result of the
successful restructuring programme
undertaken in the second half of 2005. 
The growth opportunity in healthcare 
in France is based upon our becoming a
successful supplier of Continuing Medical
Education (CME). We achieved this goal
during 2006 when we became the ﬁrst
government-approved CME supplier
shortly after legislation was introduced.
We have already launched our ﬁrst
sponsored CME programme and we
expect to produce two further substantial
programmes in 2007.
Our digital healthcare operations
produced an excellent performance in 
the year and we will be expanding these
signiﬁcantly in 2007. Egora.fr is the most
visited medical website in France. It will be
relaunched this year with the addition of
a large, searchable medical archive which
will operate on a pay-per-view pricing
model and contain every article published
by us in our CME publications in the past
ﬁve years. Egora.fr will also have a
substantial part to play in our CME
strategy. Using technology developed by
our e-learning company Epic, we will be
launching a digital platform where GPs
can select, monitor and record their now
compulsory CME learning activities. This
will enhance the opportunity for Egora.fr
to increase sponsorship revenue going
forward. We are conﬁdent of our strong
position in the French Healthcare market
and believe that in the longer term we
will remain the leading CME supplier to
the French healthcare community.
Our People, Our Future
The passion of our people, together 
with their knowledge, motivation and
collaboration, is what gives them an
insight into our customers’ behaviour 
and changing needs. It is also what
inspires them to develop, innovate 
and deliver new and better solutions,
something we have seen in abundance
this year.  
Through the acquisitions we have made 
in 2006, we have welcomed many new
colleagues into the Group and we are
delighted by the positive energy, ideas
and performance they have generated. 
To them, and to all my colleagues in the
Group, I extend my thanks for their
contribution throughout the year. 
I believe we are very well placed now in
four major markets. We have a depth of
management talent and strong market
positions. Our ambition for expansion
remains undimmed.

Financial Review 
“The Group’s results for the year to 
31 December 2006 have demonstrated 
continued growth and achievement 
of our strategic objectives. Our balance 
sheet remains strong, providing a sound 
ﬁnancial platform for further growth.” 
Dan O’Brien, Group Finance Director 
Summary 
The Group’s results for the year to 
31 December 2006 have demonstrated 
continued growth and achievement of 
our strategic objectives. Turnover for the 
year rose 62% to £45.0 million (2005: 
£27.7 million) and pre-tax proﬁts 
before exceptional items and goodwill 
amortisation were up 43% to £6.0 million 
(2005: £4.2 million). The Group’s balance 
sheet remains strong with net debt of 
£18.7 million at the year-end representing 
gearing of 31% (2005:19%), providing 
a sound ﬁnancial platform for 
further growth. 
Turnover and Operating Results 
Turnover for the year increased by 62% to 
£45.0 million, of which acquisitions made 
during the year contributed £3.9 million. 
The turnover growth was principally the 
result of acquisitions made in the current 
and prior year. 
Organic revenue growth for the Group 
as a whole was constrained in 2006. 
Good growth performances in several 
areas of the business were largely offset 
by reductions arising in three key areas: 
in Healthcare, where the overall market 
decreased marginally as anticipated; in 
Lonsdale, due to the market turbulence 
caused by the introduction of a new Key 
Stage 4 Science syllabus; and in Epic, 
where the planned focus during the year 
had been on the transition to higher 
proﬁt, higher margin business and intra-
Group projects. 
Proﬁt before tax was £4.8 million (2005: 
£2.0 million) and EBITDA was £7.2 million 
(2005: £4.5 million). This represents a 
2.2% improvement on proﬁt margins 
on a like-for-like annualised basis. 
Exceptional Items 
Exceptional items for the year totalled 
£0.6 million, of which £0.4 million related 
primarily to the planned restructuring of 
operations immediately following the 
acquisitions of Political Wizard in July 
and Letts and Leckie & Leckie in 
September 2006. The remaining 
exceptional items related to residual 
restructuring costs incurred in France 
on the post-acquisition integration 
programme at JBB Santé acquired in 
October 2005. 
Taxation 
The increase in the proportion of the 
Group’s proﬁts generated in France, 
together with the lower utilisation of tax 
losses, has led to an increase in the overall 
rate of effective tax to 28.1% (2005: 
21.8%). Whilst the Group continues to 
seek to optimise its tax position going 
forward, it is expected that the blended 
tax rate will increase further. 
Earnings per Share (EPS) 
Normalised EPS (pre-exceptional items 
and goodwill amortisation) was 3.1 pence 
(2005: 2.6 pence), representing a 17% 
increase. Basic EPS was 2.4 pence (2005: 
1.3 pence). 
Dividends 
Based on the Group’s continuing strong 
ﬁnancial performance and in line with the 
Company’s stated progressive dividend 
policy, the Board is proposing a ﬁnal 
dividend for the year of 1.21 pence per 
share, up 10% on last year’s ﬁnal dividend. 
Subject to shareholders’ approval at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, this 
dividend will be paid on 31 May 2007 to 
shareholders registered on 27 April 2007. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
During the year, Huveaux entered into a 
£5.4 million six-year secured term loan and 
an £8.0 million seven-year secured term 
loan with Bank of Scotland. Huveaux also 
raised £5.5 million through the placement 
of shares in the Company with institutional 
investors. These total funds of £18.9 
million were used to ﬁnance the acquisitions 
of Political Wizard, Letts and Leckie 
& Leckie together with the associated 
integration costs, initial working capital 
requirements and transaction fees. 
Interest payable during the year amounted 
to £0.9 million (2005: £0.1 million). This 
increase reﬂects the ﬁrst full year of 
interest charges on the €15.0 million 
seven-year term loan entered into in 2005 
together with pro-rata interest paid on 
the £13.4 million aggregated term loans 
entered into during 2006. Interest 
receivable was £0.2 million (2005: 
£0.1 million). 
During the year, underlying cash 
conversion was again strong with the 
Group generating £4.6 million (2005: 
£1.2 million) of cash from its operating 
activities. At the year-end, the Group had 
cash balances of £4.3 million (2005: 
£2.7 million) and net debt of £18.7 
million, representing a net debt to EBITDA 
ratio of 2.6 times (2005: 1.7 times).  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   11

Derivatives and Other Instruments
In 2006, Huveaux’s ﬁnancial instruments
comprised bank loans, cash deposits and
other items such as normal trade debtors
and creditors. The main purpose of these
ﬁnancial instruments is to ﬁnance the
Group’s day-to-day business operations. 
During 2006, the Company entered into
certain derivative transactions in order to
manage the ﬁnancial risk exposures arising
from the Group’s activities such as interest
rate, liquidity and foreign currency risks.
The Group’s policy is that no speculative
trading in derivatives is permitted. The
Board regularly reviews and agrees policies
for managing these risks and the current
situation is as follows:
Liquidity Risk
The Group has in place a £2.0 million
working capital facility with Bank of
Scotland for the purpose of providing
contingency funds in the event of any
signiﬁcant delay in converting working
capital into cash.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group now derives a signiﬁcant
proportion of revenue from its operations
in France. The investment in these
operations is naturally hedged by the
€15.0 million seven-year term loan taken
out in 2005, of which €14.3 million
remained outstanding as at the 31
December 2006. In February 2007, the
Group entered into a forward exchange
contract to partially hedge the exposure
on translating the resulting proﬁts and
cash ﬂows from its French operations 
into sterling. 
Interest Rate Risk
The outstanding €14.3 million term 
loan attracts interest payable in Euros,
calculated with reference to prevailing
EURIBOR. In order to limit our forward
exposure to changes in EURIBOR, the
Group has entered into an interest rate
cap for the term of the loan.
The aforementioned £5.4 million and 
£8.0 million term loans attract interest
payable in sterling, calculated with
reference to prevailing LIBOR. In order to
limit our forward exposure to changes in
LIBOR, the Group has entered into an
interest rate cap for the term of the loan.
Changes to the Financial 
Reporting Framework
The Group is reporting for the ﬁrst time
under FRS 20: “Share-based Payment” ,
which requires the fair value of share
options to be calculated and charged
against proﬁts. The charge for 2006 was
£153,000 (2005: £173,000 as restated).
While the variables affecting this calculation
cannot be accurately forecast, the annual
impact of this charge is expected 
to increase.
In line with AIM market guidelines,
Huveaux is intending to comply with
International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) for the current ﬁnancial year
ending 31 December 2007. We are
presently undertaking a review programme
in relation to the requirements of IFRS and
its likely impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial
position. It is expected that this review will
be completed during the ﬁrst half of 2007
and we therefore plan to provide a further
update to shareholders ahead of the
Company’s 2007 interim results
announcement.

Introduction
2006 was the year after a General 
Election – traditionally the low point in 
our business cycle. Despite this, Dods
continued to achieve sustained growth 
in revenue and proﬁt. With Tony Blair
standing down and a new Prime Minister
expected to be in place by September,
2007 promises to be an extremely busy
year for Dods and the political market 
in general.
Our online political monitoring business
grew 77% in 2006 and became the
fastest-growing business within Dods.
The portfolio offering was also strengthened
by the acquisition and integration of
Political Wizard, a desktop intelligence
service which tracks legislation in progress
and delivers bespoke brieﬁngs to clients.
With further UK and EU expansion
planned, monitoring, intelligence and
communication services represent a key
growth area for Dods in 2007.
Impressive performances were also
delivered last year by our two ﬂagship
titles, Dods Parliamentary Companion
and The House Magazine, the latter of
which celebrated its 30th anniversary 
in November. The quality of our editorial
continues to improve and our publications
are increasingly quoted in the national
media. With the same objective in mind,
we established Editorial Advisory Boards 
to both The Parliamentary Monitor and
ePolitix.com, comprising of senior
politicians, and to Whitehall & Westminster
World, comprising of senior civil servants.
Contributions from these Boards will
ensure that our publications retain 
their ‘must-read’ status and reﬂect the 
key issues facing people working in 
politics and government.
Whitehall & Westminster World continued
to show excellent growth in 2006 with
revenue rising 36%. The publication was
enhanced by the launch of the related
website, civilservicenetwork.com, and the
brand extended through the introduction
of the ﬁrst, and highly successful, related
Awards event.
Elsewhere, we introduced a new Dods
Polling service comprising a parliamentary
panel of over 200 MPs and on the back 
of our market leading Dods Parliamentary
Companion, we launched a new book,
Who’s Who in Public Affairs, which has
proved a great success. These, together
with our most impressive Public Affairs
News Awards ever, has seen Dods further
cement its lead role as the primary source
of information, news and communication
for the political and public affairs
communities.
In Europe, we relaunched our ﬂagship
publication, The Parliament Magazine,
for Brussels and our online offering,
TheParliament.com. We also launched a
new European title, The Regional Review,
during 2006. Written by and for decision
makers in the EU institutions, the
magazine offers regional policy
stakeholders and project managers a
platform from which to examine the
impact of EU investment in the Regions,
read about regional policy developments
and share best practice.
In France, our market-leading publication,
Le Trombinoscope, again performed
strongly last year and we were able to
successfully introduce Le Trombinoscope
de la Santé, a ‘Who’s Who’ in French
politics. Further brand extensions are
planned for 2007 as we seek to take
advantage of the country’s two major
elections this year.
2006 has been a year of innovation 
and development at Dods, with a record
number of successful new product
launches and brand extensions, including
books, intelligence services, magazines,
websites and events. These were all
created by our staff and were the main
driver behind the Political Division's 18%
organic revenue growth in the last six
months of 2006. We expect further
growth across the board during 2007, in
both Brussels and Europe, and particularly
through the planned expansion of our 
UK and EU monitoring services.
Priorities in 2007
• Exploit fully the double election year
in France and the dynamic political
environment in the UK
• Deliver continued organic growth 
and improved margins
• Develop further our UK and EU
political monitoring opportunities and
The Civil Service Network portal
• Expand our events and EU regional

Providing essential and intelligent information to civil servants 
In 2006, Dods launched the new civilservicenetwork.com, a unique website 
developed as a brand extension to the highly respected Whitehall & Westminster 
World newspaper. Featuring information, news, archives, discussion forums and 
job opportunities, the site is designed to provide support for senior civil servants 
in their working environments. 
A key feature of the site is the best practice archive (produced through the 
successful Whitehall & Westminster World Civil Service Awards) which comprises 
more than 650 entries and provides an invaluable resource for civil servants 
facing the continuing challenge of improving their day-to-day services and 
delivery. The site was created and designed by Dods staff whose knowledge 
and insight of their customers’ needs enabled them to successfully introduce 
a new digital offering that aids their day-to-day performance.  Business Review > Learning Division
“From initial consultation through to the
delivery and assessment outcomes, Epic
and the Learning Division are able to provide
the comprehensive and bespoke blended
learning solutions that many of our clients 
are now looking for.”
Matt Gokhool, Managing Director, Learning Division
16  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006
Introduction
The Learning Division has beneﬁted 
from developments at our market-leading 
e-learning company, Epic, during the year. 
By understanding and reﬂecting our
customers’ needs through the production
and design process, we have been able 
to produce highly competitive e-learning
solutions that reinforce Epic’s reputation
for high quality service and products.
This more dynamic approach has enabled
us to secure a wider range of clients from
across the public and private sector,
particularly in the ﬁnancial and ﬁnancial
services markets. It has also enabled us 
to improve margins and grow proﬁtability,
putting the Learning Division in a strong
position for growth in 2007.
During 2006, we reorganised our separate
businesses around the highly regarded Epic
‘learning’ brand. This involved bringing
together our face-to-face training and
seminar business and our learning and
training IP and products. Consequently,
from initial consultation through to the
delivery and assessment outcomes, Epic
and the Learning Division are able to
provide the comprehensive and bespoke
blended learning solutions that many 
of our clients are now looking for. It has 
also allowed us to win larger learning
programme contracts within the civil
service and we expect to see sustained
growth in this market in 2007.
Our Political Knowledge brieﬁngs 
and conference business had a record
performance and proﬁt year in 2006,
organising over 500 events. The reputation
we have created through these seminars,
workshops and training has enabled us 
to broaden the areas of focus and develop
new courses and content. Coupled with
our e-learning solutions, our classroom-
based activity is now better placed to
satisfy the customer’s desire for blended
and bespoke learning solutions.
Fenman, the established training resources
business, has been integrated into Epic
and now operates as Epic Professional.
This new structure allows the Division 
to take advantage of Epic’s IP and access 
to market, moving from the traditional 
paper-based approach into the digital 
and e-learning market. Incorporating 
this knowledge into the new structure 
will enable us to better use this 
resource to suit modern learning 
and training methods.
In developing our multimedia approach 
to the market, we have enhanced our
digital offering with the launch of
TrainerActive.com, an online resource
which has attracted more than 9,000
subscribers in the ﬁrst three months since 
its introduction. In 2007, we will further
develop our digital presence with the
launch of TJ-Training Journal online 
which will create new audiences and
develop new revenue streams that are 
not available to us though the traditional
publishing model.
2006 also saw the launch of our ﬁrst 
TJ-Training Journal Awards programme to
identify and recognise best practice within
the learning and training industry. This
successful event has provided a valuable
source of practical new ideas and is the
inspiration behind the planned development
of further seminars and training courses 
in 2007.
Epic’s innovation and approach to the
digital challenge which many organisations
face has provided Huveaux with an
important digital resource and capability.
This is demonstrated in a series of joint
initiatives with each of the Group Divisions
which have been carried out not only 
cost-effectively, but with learning and 
IP remaining in the Group. This in-house
expertise has also served as a stimulus to
innovation and development across all the
Divisions, ensuring that we constantly
review our products and services through
the eyes of our customers and remain
focused on our ability to respond quickly
to their changing needs.
Priorities in 2007
• Continue to grow our fast moving
Political Knowledge brieﬁngs and
conference business
• Extend Public Sector training
programmes through Epic Professional
• Develop our new business area 
of online learning resources
• Continue transition at Epic to higher
margin, higher quality earnings and
support digital initiatives across 
the Group

Enhancing personal and professional development and improving performance 
Westminster Explained has continued to mature as a business and innovate in 
the training arena through expanding its range of seminars. Having previously 
provided solely Parliamentary focused events, its portfolio now covers the full 
range of skills training required by a modern public sector worker, including such 
diverse areas as project management, policy development, communications and 
strategic thinking. 
A recent addition to the portfolio has been the launch of a new workshop, 
“Essential Writing Skills for Civil Servants.” This was created through our research 
team identifying the speciﬁc training need to communicate more effectively, thus 
helping civil servants to further their personal and professional development and 
improve their performance. Its success has already led to the provision of an 
advanced writing skills workshop.  Business Review > Healthcare Division
“We have refocused our services to 
ensure that we can offer GPs and other
healthcare professionals the full suite 
of training and education they need 
to meet their new and compulsory 
CME requirements.”
Alain Trebucq, Managing Director, Healthcare Division
18  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006
Introduction
For many companies operating within 
the French medical publishing sector, 
the downturn in pharmaceutical
advertising has created a challenging
market environment and a major strain 
on the traditional business model. The
situation has arisen due to a combination
of an increase in the level of generic
medicines and a decrease in the number
of new ‘blockbuster’ treatments being
introduced each year. Together, these
factors have adversely affected
pharmaceutical companies and their
advertising spends.
We identiﬁed these changing market
dynamics early and were able to shape our
services to reﬂect the new multi-platform
needs of our clients and customers. This
wider approach resulted in the creation of
new opportunities, products and services,
the broadening of our market-leading
portfolio, and the contribution to a
substantial improvement in proﬁts 
and margins during 2006.
We also identiﬁed at an early stage the
critical importance of Continuing Medical
Education (CME) in France in anticipation
of legislation being introduced. Indeed,
our growth opportunity is based upon 
our becoming a lead player in the CME
arena and we were boosted in that goal
when we were appointed the ﬁrst
government-approved supplier of CME
during the year. We have refocused our
services to ensure that we can offer GPs
and other healthcare professionals the 
full suite of training and education they
need to meet their new and compulsory
CME requirements.
In 2006, we successfully relaunched 
two of our leading titles, Le Concours
Médical and Panorama du Médecin,
achieving increased market share and
leadership in doing so. The value and
proﬁle of all our leading magazines 
has been enhanced through their CME
accreditation, making them a vital
component of any ongoing education
programme linked to CME.
A further strengthening of our position 
in this unique CME space was the
appointment of Huveaux France as the
ﬁrst publisher to receive an agreement for
managing the performance evaluation of
medical practice from La Haute Autorité
de Santé. This important development will
enable us to offer doctors a compliance
framework for this key aspect of CME.
As in other areas of the Group, the
development of brand extensions to 
help satisfy the changing needs of 
clients and customers has been explored.
Consequently, the Healthcare Division will
be improving and expanding its seminars
and events programme in 2007 to reﬂect
the identiﬁed need for face-to-face
information, training and networking
opportunities as the medical profession
comes to terms with the new CME
environment and the impact it brings.
Huveaux France is the proud owner of 
the leading medical website in France,
www.Egora.fr. During 2007, we intend 
to further develop and relaunch this 
all-in-one site by offering online some of
the most famous and important medical
archives available. The Healthcare Division
will also be developing new CME
programmes online in 2007, hence
growing and strengthening Egora’s position
at the heart of GPs digital resources. The
opportunity to create these effectively and
efﬁciently is provided by the expertise
already available within the Group at Epic,
the UK’s leader in bespoke e-learning.
The successful development of our
broader product and service approach,
incorporating publishing, events, online
resources and learning, is targeted at
reducing our reliability on direct advertising.
It will also enable us to align our offerings
closer to the more predictable and reliable
needs of the French medical profession.
Priorities in 2007
• Relaunch Egora.fr with the addition 
of a large, searchable archive and
enhanced digital platform for
Continuing Medical Education 
(CME) management by doctors
• Produce two further substantial CME
sponsored programmes and develop
associated new revenue streams
• Continue to increase our market 
share of leading medical publications
• Extend our market leadership in CME

Helping to keep the busy lives of doctors and healthcare professionals simple 
Egora.fr is the most visited website in France, providing online news, data, 
interactive case studies and a soon to be introduced extensive searchable 
archive. It is supplemented by industry speciﬁc e-bulletins as well as 
market-leading publications. 
In 2006, Huveaux France became the ﬁrst government-approved supplier 
of Continuing Medical Education (CME) shortly after legislation was introduced. 
Since then, it has been extremely active extending its existing and creating new 
digital services for its all-in-one website that will help doctors and healthcare 
professionals deal with the compulsory education and training requirements 
which CME brings. One innovative new service being developed using technology 
available from our e-learning company, Epic, will see the introduction in 2007 
of an online management system that enables doctors to source, monitor 
and control their CME activities in an effective and efﬁcient manner.  20 Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006

Introduction 
The changing landscape of the UK schools 
education sector is expected to continue, 
driven mainly by supplier inﬂuence, the 
greater emphasis being placed on personal 
learning and the modern day expectation 
that digital content and delivery will play 
an increasingly important role. 
For Huveaux, we have interpreted 
these changes positively. Firstly, as an 
opportunity to build upon the experience 
and knowledge of our existing Lonsdale 
school revision guide business. And 
secondly, to utilise the digital training 
capabilities already available to us at Epic, 
in seeking to convert and extend existing 
content into digital alternatives. 
As a result, we more than tripled the 
size of our education business with the 
acquisition in September 2006 of the 
highly respected and market-leading 
Letts and Leckie & Leckie businesses. 
The remainder of last year was spent 
integrating these with Lonsdale which 
was successfully completed on time and 
with targeted cost savings and greater 
efﬁciencies achieved. Consequently, we 
began 2007 as the leading supplier 
of study aids and revision guides in the 
UK, with full product coverage across all 
subjects and stages of the school curriculum. 
There were fundamental changes 
introduced to the new Key Stage 4 
Science curriculum in 2006 which led 
to purchasing decisions in schools being 
delayed and a consequential shortfall in 
sales at Lonsdale. Nevertheless, our 
combined education revenue in 2006 
grew by 207% to £6.8 million and 
operating proﬁt by 140% to £2.0 million. 
From the 1 January 2007, we have 
grouped together our educational 
businesses to form a substantial new 
division, Huveaux Education, and I am 
pleased to have been appointed its ﬁrst 
Managing Director to help drive and 
realise Huveaux’s ambitions in this 
important growth area. 
The acquisition of Letts has given us a 
retail presence that we intend to exploit 
by moving a new range of Lonsdale school 
titles into the retail channel during 2007. 
While the Letts brand is one of the best 
known in UK education, with a long 
established presence in retail, its awareness 
in schools is less prevalent. At the time of 
acquisition, we declared our intention to 
reverse this position and this has already 
started with the launch of our curriculum 
speciﬁc Success Guides which are performing 
ahead of expectations. In 2007, we will 
develop a wider publishing strategy which 
will see Letts and Lonsdale products 
complementing each other. This strategy 
will see considerable improvements in 
our market share across the retail study 
guide and direct to schools revision 
guide markets. 
Letts also has a strong presence in 
primary school education,where we will be 
launching in 2007 our Aliens series, a follow-
up to the very successful Magical series. 
The acquisition of Leckie & Leckie has 
given us a major presence in Scotland 
as the market leader in educational 
publishing and the sole supplier of past 
practice papers for the SQA. While the 
market is comparatively smaller than 
elsewhere in the UK, the level of 
educational and learning activity in 
Scotland is high making the market 
opportunities there very exciting. 
The greatest challenge facing educational 
publishers today is the transitional 
programme that will undoubtedly see 
print content delivered though digital 
alternatives. Huveaux is embracing this 
opportunity and we have already 
developed a number of digital learning 
projects which we are conﬁdent will give 
us a competitive advantage moving 
forward. We have a substantial and 
valuable educational content that can 
easily be converted to digital delivery. 
We intend to build on our digital expertise 
at Epic and the strength of our existing 
business to ensure that Huveaux becomes 
a major player in selected areas of the 
education market.  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   21 
Improving educational attainment through digital engagement 
Our new Education Division focuses on supporting improvement and attainment 
for school children of all ages. To this end, and with a view to extending further 
our market-leading brands to teachers, pupils and parents, we are developing 
a personalised digital revision and self-assessment testing programme for GCSE. 
Using the digital capabilities and expertise already available within Huveaux, 
at Epic, this innovative new product will enable students to practice their skills 
and knowledge in selected areas of the curriculum, receive instant feedback on 
individual answers submitted, take advantage of “Question Help” revision tips 
and even take a timed test. It will also allow both students and teachers to chart 
and record their progress and identify areas where extra work may be needed. 
This exciting development has been created by Huveaux staff utilising existing 
IP and in-house expertise to deliver a digital offering that engages with young 
people in their ambition to know more and perform better.  22 Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006

Directors’ Report

The directors present their annual report together with 
the audited ﬁnancial statements of Huveaux PLC (the 
“Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) 
for the year ended 31 December 2006. 
Principal Activities and Business Review 
The Group’s principal activity is the creation, development and 
distribution of information to business and professional markets 
through a combination of publications, conferences and events, 
online information and digital services, training courses and 
other media. The Group operates primarily in the UK and France 
and has market-leading positions in its Healthcare, Learning, 
Political and newly established Education divisions. 
A review of the Group’s performance during the year and its 
position at the year end, including commentary on its ﬁnancial 
performance, likely future developments and prospects, is set 
out on pages 4 to 11 and pages 14 to 21 and should be read in 
conjunction with this Report. A description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties facing the Group can be found later in this 
Report on page 26. 
The purpose of the Annual Report is to provide information 
to the members of the Company. The Annual Report contains 
certain forward-looking statements with respect to the 
operations, performance and ﬁnancial condition of the Group. 
By their nature, these statements involve risk and uncertainty, 
since future events and circumstances can cause results and 
developments to differ from those anticipated. Nothing in this 
Annual Report should be construed as a proﬁt forecast. 
Results and Dividends 
The Group’s ﬁnancial results for the year are shown in the 
Consolidated Proﬁt and Loss Account on page 31.The directors 
recommend a ﬁnal dividend for the year of 1.21 pence per 
Ordinary share (2005: 1.1 pence) which, if approved by 
shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
(see below), will be paid on 31 May 2007 to shareholders 
registered at the close of business on 27 April 2007. 
Major Transactions 
On 26 July 2006, the Company announced the acquisition 
of the entire issued share capital of Parliamentary Monitoring 
Services Limited (“PMSL”) which included the whole of its joint 
venture undertaking, Political Wizard Limited, a leading online 
political monitoring business in the UK and European markets. 
All PMSL products and services have been fully integrated into 
the Political Division’s ﬂagship company, Dods Parliamentary 
Communications Limited. 
The total cash consideration agreed for PMSL was £4.88 million 
of which £4.3 million was paid on completion. Of the £0.58 
million deferred consideration, the payment of £0.5 million 
is subject to the prior satisfaction of certain operational 
performance targets while the payment of £80,000 is subject 
only to certain time constraints through to 30 June 2008. 
The total consideration, including transaction fees and 
restructuring costs, was ﬁnanced through a £5.4 million 
six-year secured term loan from the Bank of Scotland. 
On 4 September 2006, the Company announced the acquisition 
of the entire issued share capital of Letts Educational Limited 
(“Letts”) and Leckie & Leckie Limited (“Leckie & Leckie”), the 
leading providers of study aids and revision guides in England 
and Scotland respectively. The businesses of Letts and Leckie 
have been fully integrated with the Group’s existing revision 
guide business, Lonsdale, and together (effective from 
1 January 2007) they operate as the Group’s newly formed 
Education Division. 
The total consideration payable at completion was £12.4 million 
and was settled by means of a £12.2 million cash payment and 
the satisfaction of £0.2 million debt. The cash consideration 
included a £0.4 million escrow retention against the achievement 
of certain operational and ﬁnancial performance targets of 
Letts relating to the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2006. 
These targets were not met and the escrow monies are due 
to be repaid to the Company. 
The total consideration, together with transaction fees and 
restructuring costs, was ﬁnanced through an £8.0 million 
seven-year secured term loan from the Bank of Scotland and 
a £5.5 million placing with institutional investors (the ”Placing”). 
The Placing was completed on 4 September 2006 and 
resulted in the allotment of 11,827,957 new Ordinary shares 
(representing approximately 8% of the Company’s then issued 
share capital) at a price of 46.5 pence per share. The new 
Ordinary shares were issued fully paid, ranking pari passu in 
all respects with the existing Ordinary shares then in issue, and 
were admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London 
Stock Exchange on 7 September 2006. 
Further details of these acquisitions, and various Group re­ organisations undertaken during the year for efﬁciency and 
integration purposes, are shown in note 13 to the accounts. 
Financial Instruments 
Details of ﬁnancial instruments can be found in note 25 
to the accounts. 
Directors 
The names and brief biographical details of the current directors 
are given on page 22. All held ofﬁce throughout the year and 
up to the date of this Report with the exception of Richard 
Flaye, who was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2006; 
Jean-Marie Simon, who resigned on 3 March 2006; and 
Christina Benn and Timothy Benn, who both resigned 
on 7 April 2006. 
Retirement and Rotation of Directors 
Pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Association, John Clarke 
and Kevin Hand will retire by rotation at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) and, being eligible, offer themselves 
for re-election. The Board has considered the requirements of 
the Combined Code in respect of these matters and believes 
that these members continue to be effective and to demonstrate 
their commitment to their roles, the Board and the Group. The 
Board therefore has no hesitation in recommending the above 
directors for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. Richard Flaye 
will retire at this year’s AGM (having been appointed since the 
last AGM) and, being eligible, offers himself for election. 
None of the above directors have service agreements with 
the Company. 
The service contracts of the executive directors and the letters 
of appointment of the non-executive directors, together with 
the statutory Register of Directors’ Interests, are available for 
inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered ofﬁce 
during normal business hours. 
Directors’ Interests 
Details of the directors’ interests (including those of their 
immediate families and any connected persons) in the share 
capital of the Company at the beginning and end of the year 
are set out below. Save as disclosed, no contracts or arrangements

Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ Indemnity Insurance 
The Group has taken out an insurance policy to indemnify the 
directors and ofﬁcers of the Company and its subsidiaries in 
respect of certain liabilities which may attach to them in their 
capacity as directors or ofﬁcers of the Group, as far as permitted 
by law. This indemnity policy subsisted throughout the year and 
remains in place at the date of this Report.

Share Capital 
At the AGM held on 27 April 2006, shareholders granted the 
Company limited authority to purchase its own shares, subject 
to certain speciﬁed conditions. No such purchase was made 
during the year and a resolution seeking to renew this authority 
is proposed at this years’ AGM. 
Pursuant to the existing shareholder authority available to 
the Company under s89 of the Company’s Act 1985, and as 
referred to above in relation to the acquisition of Letts and 
Leckie, the Company completed the Placing of 11.8 million 
new Ordinary shares with institutional investors on 4 September 
2006. Details of the increase in the issued share capital of the 
Company during the year are given in note 22 to the accounts. 
Share Listing 
The Company’s Ordinary shares are listed on the Alternative 
Investment Market (AIM), which is regulated by the London 
Stock Exchange. 
Employee Involvement 
Huveaux aims to attract, retain and motivate the highest calibre 
of employee by encouraging and rewarding high performance, 
both on an individual and team contribution basis, through 
competitive remuneration and incentive arrangements. 
Considerable efforts are made to provide employees with 
continuing opportunities to develop their full potential and 
advance to positions of greater responsibility by gaining the 
relevant skills and experience required to deliver upon both 
the Group’s business objectives and the individual’s own 
personal objectives. 
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity 
to all existing and prospective employees without unlawful 
or unfair discrimination. In addition, it is supportive of the 
employment and advancement of disabled persons. 
All operations within the Group actively encourage employee 
involvement and communication, both through regular 
employee brieﬁngs and by direct access to managers and 
directors at all levels. 
Employee Share Schemes 
The Company has established a discretionary share incentive 
scheme for executive directors, senior management and key 
employees from those principal countries in which the Group 
operates. It has also established an All-Employee Savings-Related 
Share Option Scheme, which operates in both the UK and 
France, and which encourages share ownership by providing 
employees with the opportunity to acquire shares in the 
Company at a discount to the market price at the date of grant 
through regular savings over a three to ﬁve year time-frame. 
Further details of these two share option schemes are set out 
in note 29 to the accounts. 
Political and Charitable Donations 
No charitable or political donations were made in the year 
(2005: nil). 
Creditor Payment Policy 
The Group’s practice is to settle the terms of payment and credit 
with suppliers as part of the agreed terms and conditions of 
contract governing each business transaction. Payment is then 
made pursuant to these terms provided that the goods and 
services have been delivered in accordance with the agreed 
contract terms and conditions. 
The average creditor payment period for the Company during 
the year was 39 days (2005: 53).  Health, Safety and Environmental 
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is responsible to the Board for the
health, safety and environmental performance of the Group.
Local management has been delegated responsibility for
practical day-to-day compliance with relevant legislation at
operating unit level. This includes the requirement for a local
policy statement, the provision of appropriate related training 
as well as the communication to all employees of the need to
create and maintain a safe and healthy working environment.
In appreciating the importance of good environmental practice,
Huveaux seeks to ensure that its operations and products cause
minimum detrimental impact to the environment. The Group’s
objective is to comply with environmental legislation in all
countries in which it operates and to promote effective
environmental management throughout its businesses. 
Business Risks 
The key business risks and uncertainties facing the Company 
are considered by the Board as part of its annual strategy review,
with the resulting potential impacts and mitigating actions
reported back to the Board at subsequent meetings throughout
the year. Details of the day-to-day identiﬁcation, monitoring and
managing of our business risks by the Executive Management
team, and an explanation of the process involved (including the
regular review by the Board and Audit Committee), are set out
in the section entitled “Internal Controls” in the Corporate
Governance Statement on page 28. 
The alternative sources of Huveaux’s revenue streams do serve to
spread our general exposure to business risks and uncertainties.
However, Huveaux is exposed to certain speciﬁc risks as follows:
• the reliance on advertising revenue, circulation and
subscription across our Political and Healthcare Divisions;
• the strength of the UK and French economic and political
environments, where the vast majority of the Group’s
operations are based;
• our ability to attract and retain the right people;
• ﬁnancial risks (see Financial Review on page 11);
• our increasing dependence on information technology systems
and technological change; and
• the fact that all our businesses operate in highly competitive
and constantly changing markets.
Going Concern 
The directors believe, having reviewed the Group’s budget for
the year to 31 December 2007 and its existing banking and loan
facilities, that the Group has adequate resources available to
continue its operations for the foreseeable future. Consequently,
the going concern basis has been applied in preparing the
ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006. 
Directors’ Statement on Disclosure of Information 
to Auditors
The directors who held ofﬁce at the date of approval of this
Report conﬁrm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no
relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are
unaware and each director has taken all the steps that he ought
to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s
auditors are aware of such information. 
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in
accordance with the provisions of s234Z of the Companies 
Act 1985. 
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors and to
authorise the directors to determine their remuneration will 
be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held 
at 11.00 am on Thursday, 26 April 2007 at the ofﬁces of
Dresdner Kleinwort, 30 Gresham Street, London EC2P 2XY. 
A separate circular, comprising a Letter from the Chairman,
Notice of Meeting, Explanation of Special Business and 
a reply-paid Form of Proxy, accompanies this document.

Corporate Governance Statement

The Board is committed to establishing and maintaining: 
• integrity and high ethical standards in all of its business 
activities; and 
• high standards of corporate governance – the process by 
which the Group is directed and managed, risks are identiﬁed 
and controlled, and effective accountability through to 
shareholders is assured. 
Although the Company has its listing on the Alternative 
Investment Market (AIM), it seeks to embrace, voluntarily, the 
full spirit of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the 
“Combined Code”), but as a minimum, adhere to the Corporate 
Governance Guidelines for AIM Companies issued by the 
Quoted Companies Alliance. 
The Board: Chairman, John van Kuffeler 
The Board presently comprises three executive directors, 
including the Chairman, and three non-executive directors. 
(During part of 2006, both these director categories had 
comprised four in number). The roles of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive, Gerry Murray, are held separately and clearly 
deﬁned in relation to their responsibility for managing the Board 
and managing the Group’s operations respectively. Kevin Hand 
was appointed Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director on 8 April 2006. Summary biographical details and 
standing committee memberships of all the directors are 
shown on page 22. 
The Board of directors are collectively responsible for the 
strategic direction, investment decisions and effective leadership 
and control of the Group. To this end, there exists: 
• a schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved to the Board for its 
decisions, including approval of the Group’s strategy, annual 
budget, major capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals, 
risk management policies and ﬁnancial statements; and 
• in relation to non-reserved matters, the terms of reference 
under which the Board has delegated certain responsibilities 
to its three standing committees. 
Each of the non-executive directors is considered to be 
independent, as determined by the Board, and together bring 
a wide range of relevant skills and experience to bear on issues 
under consideration. This helps ensure that independent 
judgement is exercised and that a proper balance of power 
is maintained for full and effective control. 
All directors are required to stand for election at the ﬁrst 
Annual General Meeting following their appointment and seek 
re-election at least every three years. They have direct access 
to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is 
responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are adhered to 
and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. 
The Senior Independent Director has authority to ensure that 
directors may, if necessary, take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. Appropriate training for 
new and existing directors is kept under review and provided 
where necessary. 
The Board generally meets on a monthly basis and met on 
13 occasions during 2006. The aggregate attendance for all 
Board and Committee meetings was 95%. Directors receive 
in advance of each meeting an agenda and set of supporting 
papers with detailed commentary. The non-executive directors 
are encouraged to voice any concerns they may have at the 
monthly Board meetings and to ask for further information if 
required. Minutes of each Board meeting are circulated for 
comment before being formally approved at the next meeting. 
The performance of the directors and the effectiveness of the 
Board as a whole has been reviewed and monitored as part of 
an on-going assessment under the stewardship of the Chairman. 
A formal evaluation is proposed to be undertaken during the 
second half of 2007. The informal basis on which the non-
executives meet as a group at least once a year without the 
executive directors in attendance will also be formalised 
going forward. 
Audit Committee: Chairman, John Clarke 
The Audit Committee comprises all the non-executive directors 
and meets no less than four times a year with the external 
auditors together with various representatives of the executive 
and ﬁnance functions. It also meets privately with the external 
auditors on a regular basis. The Committee, inter alia: 
• is responsible for the appointment, review and remuneration 
of the external auditors and has authority to pre-approve their 
engagement for both audit and permitted non-audit services 
within an agreed framework; 
• annually assesses the independence and objectivity of 
the auditors; 
• reviews the annual and interim ﬁnancial statements, the 
Group’s accounting policies and procedures and its ﬁnancial 
control environment; and 
• reviews the Group’s system of internal controls, including risk 
management procedures. 
Remuneration Committee: Chairman, Kevin Hand 
The Remuneration Committee comprises all the non-executive 
directors and meets at least twice a year and otherwise as 
necessary. It advises the Board on the Company’s remuneration 
strategy and determines, on behalf of the Board and within its 
remuneration framework, the individual remuneration package 
of each of the executive directors and certain members of the 
senior management team. 
No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration, 
whether determined by the Committee, or in the case of 
non-executives, by the Board. 
Nomination Committee: Chairman, John van Kuffeler 
The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman and all 
the non-executive directors and meets at least once a year. It is 
responsible for reviewing the composition and structure of the 
Board and for making recommendations to the Board for its 
consideration and approval. 
Relations with Shareholders 
The Board attaches considerable importance to its relationship 
and communication with shareholders. The Chairman in 
particular, and other representatives of the Board, meet regularly 
with institutional investors, fund managers, ﬁnancial analysts 
and brokers with feedback reports provided to and discussed 
with the Board. 
Communication with shareholders is facilitated by the issue 
of full-year and interim reports which, together with other 
corporate information and press releases, are available on the 
Company’s website: www.huveauxplc.com 
The Annual General Meeting provides a forum for private 
shareholders to raise issues with directors. The Notice convening 
the Meeting is normally issued at least 20 working days in advance 
and separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially 
separate issue. The results of the Meeting’s proceedings will in 
future be made available on the Company’s website.  28 Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006 
Corporate Governance Statement continued

Internal Controls 
The Board is ultimately responsible for the good standing of the 
Company, the management of assets for optimum performance 
and for the operation of an effective system of internal control 
appropriate to the business. However, it must be recognised that 
any control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Internal Control Environment 
Day-to-day operating and ﬁnancial responsibility rests with 
senior management at divisional head and operating unit 
level, although performance is closely monitored through the 
Executive Management team (members of which are shown on 
page 23) which meets on a monthly basis throughout the year, 
chaired by the Chief Executive. 
The following key elements comprise the present internal 
control environment which has been designed to identify, 
evaluate and manage, rather than eliminate, the risks faced 
by the Group in seeking to achieve its business objectives. 
The process is communicated through various operating, 
risk management and accounting policies and procedures: 
• an organisation structure with clear lines of responsibility 
and delegated levels of authority; 
• a comprehensive ﬁnancial planning, control, budgeting and 
rolling forecast system, which includes monthly risk and 
opportunity assessment reviews at Group level; and 
• a ﬂat management structure which facilitates open and 
timely communication. 
The Board has considered the need for a separate internal audit 
function but has decided that because of the present size of the 
Group, this function will continue to be carried out by existing 
ﬁnance staff. This position will to be subject to annual review. 
The internal control process described above, which is reviewed 
annually by the Board, has been in place throughout the year 
under review and up-to-date of the 2006 Annual Report 
and Accounts. 
Improvements Made During the Year 
The following signiﬁcant improvements were made to the 
internal control framework during the year: 
• the review and formulation of a ﬁnancial approvals and 
procedures matrix to enhance and strengthen the existing 
system of internal ﬁnancial control across the Group; and 
• the adoption of a standard accounting and ﬁnancial reporting 
process throughout the Group to help ensure the timely and 
consistent delivery of quality ﬁnancial information to 
management. 
Internal Control Process 
The CEO-led “Operational Excellence” programme, which 
includes the requirement for all operating units to conduct an 
annual self-assessment risk workshop, was launched early in 
2007. It has already proved very successful in helping to focus 
management on the ownership and responsibility of business 
risk management at local and divisional operating level. The 
Executive Management team will monitor and regularly review 
material upwardly-reported business risks as well as those 
potentially signiﬁcant corporate risks identiﬁed from a top-down 
approach. A central two-tier corporate risk register, including 
mitigated action plans and senior management responsibilities, 
will be presented to the Board and to the Audit Committee on 
a regular basis. 
Review of Effectiveness 
The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, has reviewed 
the effectiveness of the system of internal controls in place 
for the year ended 31 December 2006, taking account of any 
material developments since that date, using the process set 
out above. The Board conﬁrms that the review revealed nothing, 
which, in its opinion, indicated that the system was ineffective 
or unsatisfactory.  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   29 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities

Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial period which give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group at 
the end of the period and of the proﬁt or loss for that period. 
In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the directors are 
required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are both reasonable 
and prudent; 
• state whether applicable accounting standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures being 
disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and 
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for: 
• keeping proper accounting records which disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of 
the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 1985; and 
• taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website 
in accordance with UK legislation governing the preparation 
and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements, which may vary from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. The directors are responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. 
The directors’ responsibility therefore also extends to the 
ongoing integrity of the ﬁnancial statements contained therein.  30 Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006 
Report of the Independent Auditors 

to the Members of Huveaux PLC

We have audited the Group and parent company ﬁnancial 
statements (the ''ﬁnancial statements'') of Huveaux PLC for the 
year ended 31 December 2006 which comprise the Group Proﬁt 
and Loss Account, the Group and Company Balance Sheets, the 
Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Total 
Recognised Gains and Losses and the related notes. These 
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a 
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company's members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
Report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors' 
Responsibilities on page 29. 
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial 
statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report 
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors' Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. 
The information given in the Directors' Report covers the 
requirements of the Enhanced Business Review and includes 
reference to speciﬁc information presented in the Chairman’s 
Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Financial Review. In 
addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information speciﬁed by law regarding directors' remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of Audit Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment of the 
signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the directors in 
the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's and 
Company's circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity 
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial 
statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, 
of the state of the Group's and the parent company's affairs 
as at 31 December 2006 and of the Group's proﬁt for the year 
then ended; 
• the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
• the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent 
with the ﬁnancial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements

31 December 2006 
1 Accounting policies 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation 
to the Group’s financial statements, with the exception of Financial Reporting Standard 20: “Share-based Payment”, the effect of 
adopting which is set out in note 30. 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and under the historical cost 
accounting rules, except in respect of intangible assets. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 
31 December 2006. Profits arising on trading between Group undertakings are excluded. The acquisition method of accounting has 
been adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired in the year are included in the consolidated profit 
and loss account from the date of acquisition. 
As permitted by section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented as part 
of these accounts. The loss after taxation attributable to Huveaux PLC for the year and dealt with in the financial statements of the 
Company was £870,000 (2005: profit of £8,338,000 as restated). 
Turnover and revenue recognition 
Turnover represents the amounts derived from the provision of goods and services to third party customers, net of trade discounts and 
VAT. Turnover in respect of advertising services is recognised upon publication. Turnover in respect of conferences and seminars is 
recognised when the event is held. Where publications are printed and distributed in more than one volume, revenue is deferred until 
the complete publication has been delivered. Turnover relating to contracts for e-learning is recognised on the basis of the accounting 
policy on long term contracts. Turnover in all other respects is recognised when the goods or services are delivered to the customer. 
Turnover in respect of subscription-based services, including online services, is recognised on a straight line basis over the period 
of subscription. The unrecognised element is carried within creditors as deferred revenue. Where marketing expenditure has been 
incurred that is directly attributable to that deferred revenue, it is carried within other debtors as deferred marketing and is 
recognised on the same basis as the deferred revenue. 
Leases 
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. 
Post retirement benefits 
The Group contributes to independent defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from 
those of the Group in independently administered funds. The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the 
contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period. 
The Group also operates a pension scheme in France providing benefits on final pensionable pay. The assets of the scheme are held 
separately from those of the Group. Pension scheme assets are measured using market values. Pension scheme liabilities are 
measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent 
term and currency to the liability. The pension scheme deficit is recognised in full. The movement in the scheme deficit is split 
between operating charges, finance items and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses. 
Taxation 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year. Deferred tax is recognised with discounting in respect of all timing 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by 
the balance sheet date, as allowed by Financial Reporting Standard 19: “Deferred tax”. 
Intangible assets: Group 
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10: “Goodwill and intangible assets”, intangible assets arising on consolidation 
are capitalised. Intangible assets are amortised to nil by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives unless they are 
considered to have an indefinite useful economic life, in which case they are not amortised but are subject to an annual review for 
impairment. Each acquisition is assessed with reference to its durability, ability to sustain long-term profitability and proven ability 
to maintain market leadership. Based on their assessment, the directors are of the opinion that the publishing rights of the Group 
have indefinite useful economic lives. 
Where intangible assets are treated as having an indefinite economic life, the financial statements depart from the requirement 
of Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985 to amortise intangible assets over a finite period, in order to give a true and fair view 
for the reasons outlined above. Capitalised publishing rights regarded as having an indefinite useful economic life amounted to 
£47,919,000 as at 31 December 2006 (2005: £47,772,000). If these intangible assets were to be amortised over a period of 20 
years, the maximum period recommended under FRS 10, operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2006 would have 
decreased by £2,396,000 (2005: £2,025,000). 
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standards 10 and 11: “Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill”, the carrying values of 
publishing rights are reviewed annually for impairment on the basis stipulated in FRS 11 and adjusted to the recoverable amount 
if required. No such adjustment was considered necessary as at 31 December 2006 or 2005.  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   37 
1 Accounting policies (continued) 
Purchased goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the separable net 
assets acquired) arising on consolidation in respect of non-publishing acquisitions is capitalised. Positive goodwill is amortised to 
nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life of between 15 and 20 years. 
Intangible assets: Company 
In 2002, the trade and net assets of a subsidiary undertaking were transferred to the Company at their net book value which was 
less than their fair value. The cost of the Company’s investment in that subsidiary undertaking reflected the underlying fair value of 
its net assets, including intangible assets, at the time of acquisition. As a result of this transfer, the value of the Company’s investment 
in that subsidiary undertaking fell below the amount at which it was stated in the Company’s accounting records. Schedule 4 to the 
Companies Act 1985 required that the investment be written down accordingly and that the amount be charged as a loss in the 
Company’s profit and loss account. However, the directors considered that, as there had been no overall loss to the Company, 
it would have failed to give a true and fair view to charge that diminution to the Company’s profit and loss account for the year 
ended 31 December 2002 and the amount was re-allocated to the identifiable net assets transferred, so as to recognise in the 
Company’s individual balance sheet the effective cost to the Company of those net assets, including publishing rights. The Group 
accounts were not affected by this transfer. 
During the current year the Company transferred the trade and net assets of this entity to a different subsidiary undertaking at their 
book value excluding any amount for the current carrying value of publishing rights. As the business no longer exists in the Company, 
Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 requires that these publishing rights be written down accordingly and that the amount be 
charged as a loss in the Company’s profit and loss account. As there has been no overall loss to the Company, the directors 
consider that it would fail to give a true and fair view to charge the amount to the Company’s profit and loss account and have 
instead reallocated this amount to the Company’s investment in its subsidiaries. The effect of this departure was to increase the 
Company’s fixed asset investments by £4,421,000 and to decrease publishing rights by a corresponding amount. 
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation 
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by equal instalments over their 
estimated useful economic lives as follows: 
Freehold buildings 50 years 
Leasehold improvements Over the remaining life of the lease 
Equipment, fixtures and fittings 5 years 
Database development costs 5 years 
Motor vehicles 4 years 
IT systems 3 years 
Current asset investments 
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and market value. 
Stocks, work in progress and long term contracts 
Finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Work in progress consists of internal and third party editorial 
and production costs prior to print, which are capitalised for new publications and substantial updates of continuing publications. 
Work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value being the recoverable amount based on anticipated forward 
sales from the first print run. 
For new publications and other new products, development costs are deferred and amortised over periods of between one and five 
years following the first release of the new product for sale. 
The costs of the design and development of CD ROM titles (“plate costs”) are capitalised on individual projects where the future 
recoverability of the costs can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Plate costs are stated at their direct cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Full provision is made for any plate costs where the CD ROM titles are excess to requirements or where they will no 
longer be used in the business. Amortisation is provided to write off the plate costs over one to three years at varying rates to 
match the anticipated future income streams. 
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long term contract is recognised when the outcome of the contract 
can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Turnover for such contracts is stated at cost appropriate to their stage of completion plus 
attributable profits, less amounts recognised in previous years. Provision is made for any losses as soon as they are foreseen. Contract 
work in progress is stated at costs incurred, less those transferred to the profit and loss account, after deducting foreseeable losses 
and payments on account not matched with turnover. Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in debtors and represent 
turnover recognised in excess of payments on account. 
Cash and liquid resources 
Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash at bank and in hand, deposits repayable on demand, less 
overdrafts payable on demand. 
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either 
readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market. Liquid resources in 
the prior year comprised an investment in a listed company, which was sold during the current year.  38	 Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006 
Notes to the Financial Statements continued

1 Accounting policies (continued) 
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group 
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that 
they meet the following two conditions: 
a)	 they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver cash or other financial 
assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable 
to the Company (or Group); and 
b)	 where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non–derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments. 
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so 
classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up 
share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of interest payable and similar charges. Finance 
payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as part of shareholders’ funds, are dealt with as appropriations in 
the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or 
losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account. The results of overseas operations are translated at the average 
rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the opening net assets and the results of overseas operations are reported in 
the statement of total recognised gains and losses. All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   39

Head office costs include amortisation of goodwill totalling £485,000 (2005: £56,000). In the prior year, Head office costs were 
allocated across the operating divisions on a pro rata basis. The directors believe that the disclosure of the Head office costs as a 
separate division presents a fairer disclosure of the Group’s operations. 
Exceptional items of £640,000 (2005: £2,134,000) were incurred in respect of the United Kingdom (£399,000) and Continental 
Europe & rest of the world (£241,000). Exceptional items have been incurred in the Political Division (£102,000 of which £62,000

The effect of exceptional items charged during the year is to increase the tax charge by £192,000 (2005: £640,000). 
The charge to the profit and loss account in respect of deferred tax of £452,000 (2005: £247,000) is stated after recording 
a deferred tax asset of £93,000 (before discounting) (2005: £150,000) in respect of tax losses, the recovery of which has been 
enabled by the merger of our French operations in 2006. There are other potential deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses 
totalling £200,000 (2005: £293,000) that have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. 
The tax charge for the period differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% (2005: 30%).

Provisions were made against debtors for the return of stock issued prior to acquisition in order to align accounting policies. 
The fair value adjustments to stock were made to write down items including plate costs which were considered to have no net 
realisable value at the date of acquisition. The adjustment to deferred tax was made to account for losses brought forward at 
the date of acquisition.

year term loan to finance the acquisition of Political Wizard Limited and Political Monitoring Services Limited together with transaction 
fees and restructuring costs. Both loans were taken out with Bank of Scotland and bear interest at a rate linked to LIBOR. 
€14,250,000 (£9,595,000) represents the outstanding element of a €15,000,000 seven year term loan with Bank of Scotland

In connection with the Group’s banking and borrowing facilities with the Bank of Scotland, the Company and its UK subsidiary 
undertakings have entered into a cross guarantee, which gives a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the UK trading 
companies of the Group. 
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, 
the Company considers these to be equivalent to insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect the 
Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be 
required to make a payment under the guarantee. 
Total creditors for the Group and Company are £40,343,000 and £25,017,000, respectively (2005: Group £23,984,000 and 
Company £14,693,000).

25 Financial instruments 
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash at bank and in hand, consideration for acquisitions and various items such as trade 
debtors and creditors that arise as a result of normal operations. The Group did not enter into complex derivative transactions and 
did not trade in financial instruments during the year. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is the same as the carrying 
amount as at 31 December 2006. 
The Group’s financial assets at 31 December 2006 comprise sterling and Euro deposits, current accounts and marketable securities. 
£1,062,000 (2005: £1,933,000) of the Group’s cash was denominated in Euros at 31 December 2006. The balance of cash is held in 
sterling accounts. A £700,000 term deposit which was held at the end of 2004 was redeemed during 2005 and interest earned was at 
a weighted average interest rate of 5%. Term deposits of £580,000 in sterling and £682,000 in euros were taken out and redeemed in 
2006 and earned interest at 5% and 3% respectively. Forward contracts to sell €2,000,000 into sterling and to buy €1,000,000 were 
taken out and redeemed in 2006. The sterling : euro rates on these transactions were 1.4368 and 1.4913 respectively. 
Cash at hand and in bank comprises £4,307,000 (2005: £2,678,000) at a weighted average interest of 1.3% (2005: 1.6%). The 
marketable securities held in 2005 were listed investments with a cost of £47,000 and a market value of £48,000. These were sold 
during 2006. 
During the year the Group entered into interest rate cap transactions in order to cap interest on the loan denominated in Euros at 
4% and on the loans denominated in sterling at 6%. The fair value of these interest rate caps at 31 December 2006 was £92,000 
and £51,000 respectively. The loans attract a floating rate of interest which is linked to EURIBOR and LIBOR as explained in note 20. 
As at 31 December 2006 £2,000,000 remained undrawn under the Group’s working capital facility.

All share schemes detailed below are operated by the Company. However, in the tables below, ‘Group’ indicates total options 
granted to all Group employees and ‘Company’ indicates those options granted to employees of the Company only. 
Executive Share Option Scheme 
The Company operates an Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme under which share options are granted to selected Group 
employees. All options are settled by physical delivery of shares in exchange for payment of the aggregated option price. The contractual 
life of each grant is 10 years.

All options granted are discretionary (as determined by the Remuneration Committee) and carry a pre–exercise performance 
condition, requiring the Company’s Earnings Per Share achievement during any rolling three year financial performance period to 
exceed the retail/consumer price index by at least 3%, in aggregate, during the same period. No consideration is received for an 
award and no grants can be made at an option exercise price per share which is less than the market price at the time of grant.  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   53

The expected volatility is based on the previous 12 months’ share price history. 
30 Adoption of FRS 20: “Share–based Payment” 
FRS 20: “Share–based Payment” requires that the fair value of share awards granted to employees is assessed at grant date and is 
charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period based on the number of shares which the directors consider likely to 
vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
Deferred tax is recognised where it is likely that share relief will be available on the difference between exercise price and market 
price at the balance sheet date. 
Where share options are granted to employees of a subsidiary company by the Group’s parent company, the charge in respect of 
subsidiary employees is capitalised into the cost of investment of that subsidiary, with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The effect of the adoption of FRS 20 on equity shareholders’ funds and profit after tax for the prior year is shown below:

31 Pension provision 
The directors received additional information about a pension scheme acquired as part of COPEF SA last year and consider it more 
appropriate to account for it as a defined benefit scheme. The scheme is open to employees of the Group’s French subsidiaries, 
who are entitled to a lump sum on retirement, calculated based on the period of service and the salary at the date of retirement. 
A full actuarial valuation was carried out during the year by a qualified independent actuary to determine the net defined benefit 
obligations as at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005. The directors believe that the valuation of the net defined benefit 
obligations as at 31 December 2005 of £172,000 is not materially different from the obligations booked at the date of acquisition 
of £137,000. Therefore the directors have not restated the prior year for any movement.  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   55 
31 Pension provision (continued) 
The major assumptions used in this valuation were: 
2006 2005 
Rate of increase in salaries 2.5% 2.5% 
Expected return on assets 4.0% 4.0% 
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 4.5% 3.8% 
Inflation assumption 2.1% 2.1% 
The assumptions used by the actuary are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale 
covered, may not actually be borne out in practice. 
The fair value of the scheme’s assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant 
change before they are realised, and the present value of the defined benefit obligations, which are derived from cash flow 
projections and thus inherently uncertain, were:

Severfield–Rowen’s new joint venture and operations 
in India are of significant importance in achieving our 
strategic growth ambitions.
In November 2010 JSW Severfield Structures Limited formally 
opened its new plant in Vidyanagar, Bellary, Karnataka. This was a 
milestone in the Company’s history, being the first manufacturing unit 
outside of the UK.
JSSL (JSW/SFR) provides a new service in India, incorporating the 
benefits and efficiencies of the Group’s experience, in terms of design, 
manufacture and erection.
The plant’s location is shown below and it currently utilises 26,000 m² 
of workspace and 52,000 m² of logistics and storage area.
The Indian market is growing at some 8-10% per annum and is 
enjoying considerable infrastructure/construction spends. Steel is 
already used significantly in the power and infrastructure sectors.
The use of steel in construction is anticipated to become more 
widespread in the coming years as its overall value benefits are realised.

cHairman’s STATEMENT
t OBy Hay WarD, C HAIRMAN
In 2010 the Company 
produced lower but 
creditable profits in an 
extremely harsh business 
environment for the 
structural steel sector in 
the UK. The Company 
continues to extend its 
leading position in the 
market, reflected by its 
financial performance and 
market share gains.
OvervieW
In 2010 the Company produced lower but 
creditable profits in an extremely harsh 
business environment for the structural steel 
sector in the UK. The Company continues 
to extend its leading position in the market, 
reflected by its financial performance and 
market share gains.
The Company anticipates that trading 
conditions will only improve marginally 
towards the end of 2011, before a richer 
vein of project opportunities materialises in 
2012.
r esul ts
The Group made an underlying operating 
profit of £16.2 million (2009: £51.8 million) 
on revenue of £266.7 million (2009: 
£349.4 million). Group profit after tax is 
£7.6 million (2009: £31.3 million), with 
basic earnings per share of 8.58p (2009: 
35.34p), both reflecting the impact of 
non-underlying items.
Divi Den D
The Company, while optimistic for 2012 
and beyond, feels that trading in the UK 
market in 2011 will remain very tough. In 
remaining prudent against this outlook, it 
will recommend a final dividend payment  
of 2.50p, giving 7.50p for the full year 
(2009: 15.00p).
BOarD cHan Ges
The Board is pleased to announce that 
Derek Randall, currently Executive 
Director with responsibility for Business 
Development and International, including 
JSW Severfield Structures Ltd in India, 
joined the Company’s main Board in 
February 2011.
The Company is also pleased to welcome 
John Dodds to its Plc Board as a non-
executive director in October 2010. John 
retired from Kier Group last year, after 
working for the company for 40 years. 
John became CEO of Kier Group in 2003 
and, with his wealth of experience in the 
construction industry, will be a valuable 
asset to our Board.
peOple
Our employees continue to be our 
key competitive advantage, with their 
experience and commitment contributing to 
our relative success and development.
Outl OOk
2011 will be a tough trading year. The 
macro-economic situation in the UK has 
been and remains difficult to interpret and 
predict. Clearer consensus is emerging that 
recovery will be apparent in GDP growth in 
2012. Privately led investment in a few key 
sectors will provide improved prospects for 
us in 2012. The Company expects that the 
remainder of 2011 will be notable for the 
absence of large, major project starts with 
an improvement being seen in our pipeline 
for 2012.
In our overseas target markets, we are 
demonstrating that our experience, 
methods and capability can be transferred 
successfully as we attempt to offset the 
impact of tough trading conditions in the 
UK. Progress in India is extremely good 
where exciting prospects are in the pipeline 
and growth potential is strong. 15 OUR BUSINESS 15

t Om Hau GHey, CHIEF ExECUTIVE OFFICER
In 2010 Severfield–
Rowen traded through 
some of the most difficult 
conditions seen by the 
UK industry in the 
last few decades.
In 2010 Severfield–Rowen traded through 
some of the most difficult conditions seen by 
the UK industry in the last few decades.
It faces the challenges of 2011 in a 
determined but pragmatic manner and is 
now more optimistic of a partial recovery in 
demand during 2012.
Business
The companies within the Group have 
displayed their individual strengths which 
have collectively enabled the Group to 
trade profitably and competitively in the 
last 12 months. Features such as close 
commercial interaction, design capability, 
cost base, volume outputs, experience and 
co-ordinated steel erection, together with

The order book for the UK based operations 
(as at 22 March 2011) stood at a healthy 
£226m, as it continues to secure business 
from all of the sectors making up UK 
demand.
The pipeline of enquiries is more

The Company specifically targeted cost 
reductions across all businesses at the end of 
2009. These improvements have provided 
for our resultant competitiveness throughout 
2010. Further cost reduction initiatives 
remain under review and development, 
including a procurement related initiative.

Market prices bottomed in the first half of 
2010 and, while remaining relatively low, 
have moved in line with the steel material

Margins have remained subdued with little 
improvement in the supply/demand balance

In November 2010, the joint venture 
(JSSL) manufacturing facilities at Bellary 
were officially opened and attended by 
approximately 200 guests from the Indian 
construction industry.
The business is now designing, drawing, 
fabricating and erecting quality structural 
steelwork for the growing Indian market.
Four months after the opening, the order 
book (as at 22 March 2011) stands at 
£33m, demonstrating the value of the new 
service on offer to clients in India.
These developments underpin the 
Company’s confidence that it can realise its 
financial and growth ambitions in India.

The Company has a proactive and formal 
approach to Risk Management. During 
the year, another comprehensive review 
of its risk profile and risk management 
process was undertaken in conjunction 
with Willis. The emphasis changed from 
previous reviews to reflect the more 
challenging environment within which it is 
now operating and the greater international 
dimension to its business. A more complete 
review of the principal risks which the 
business faces is set out on pages 34 to 35.

good order book, but recognise that UK 
demand in 2011 remains weak.
In India, we now have a very strong order 
book and will continue our drive for growth 
in those markets.
We see a partial improvement in UK 
demand and mix emerging in 2012, 
which, while not a comprehensive recovery, 
will present the Company with good 
opportunities. 19 OUR BUSINESS 19

Financial REVIEW
alan D unsm Ore, FINANCE DIRECTOR
The Group’s results for 
2010 reflect the impact 
of the continuing difficult 
trading conditions in the 
UK market. Capacity was 
reduced by 20% at the 
end of 2009 and the 
Group was able to operate 
at this new capacity 
throughout the year, 
increase its market share 
and maintain a relatively 
strong order book in these 
difficult conditions.
OvervieW
The Group’s results for 2010 reflect the 
impact of the continuing difficult trading 
conditions in the UK market. Capacity 
was reduced by 20% at the end of 2009 
and the Group was able to operate at 
this new capacity throughout the year, 
increase its market share and maintain a 
relatively strong order book in these difficult 
conditions.
During the year, the Company’s Indian joint 
venture business commenced trading on 
schedule and good progress is being made 
as this business moves towards its initial full 
operating capacity.
revenue an D Operatin G pr OFit
Revenue fell by 24% to £266.7m (2009: 
£349.4m). This reflects the reduction in 
production capacity and lower contract 
pricing compared with the previous year. 
Pricing reached its nadir in the first half of 
the year but a combination of increasing 
steel prices and continuing capacity 
reductions by our competitors led to 
more stable pricing towards the year end, 
although still at very tight margins.
The operating profit before non-underlying 
items of £16.2m was 69% down on the 
previous year (2009: £51.8m). Operating 
profit margins reduced from 14.8% to 6.1% 
in the year, reflecting the reduced capacity 
and lower margins highlighted above, 
although the worst pricing impacts were, to 
some extent, compensated by the successful 
conclusion of more profitable contracts 
which commenced in the previous years.
sHare OF lO sses OF ass Ociate 
cO mpanies
Operating profit includes the Group’s 
50% share of the results of its Indian joint 
venture. There is both an underlying and 
a non-underlying element to these results. 
The underlying loss of £0.4m (2009: 
nil) represents the initial losses after the 
commencement of commercial production 
towards the end of 2010. The non-
underlying loss of £1.4m (2009: £1.0m) 
represents the Group’s share of the joint 
venture’s pre-operating costs throughout the 
year. The Group’s share of losses from the 
joint venture for 2009, which also related to 
pre-operating costs, have been re-classified 
as non-underlying for consistency.
Finance cO sts
Net finance costs for the Group amounted 
to £0.9m (2009: £1.0m). The reduction 
reflects a lower level of average net debt 
levels throughout the year, compared with 
the previous year.

nO n-un Derl yin G items
Non-underlying items reduced the profit 
before tax for the year by £4.2m (2009: 
£6.7m) and include the following: 
● ● Amortisation of acquired intangibles — 
£2.7m (2009: £4.4m). 
● ● Share of pre-operating losses of Indian 
joint venture — £1.4m (2009: £1.0m). 
● ● Impairment in valuation of Investment 
Property — £2.1m (2009: nil). The 
Group has an investment property, 
purchased in 2007, which was 
previously held at its fair value of 
£6.1m. The Directors have reviewed 
both the resale and rental prospects for 
this property in light of the continuing 
market weakness for commercial 
property and have concluded that its 
fair value is £4.0m. Consequently, an 
impairment charge of £2.1m has been 
taken in the year. 
● ● Movements in the valuation of 
derivative financial instruments — nil 
(2009: gain £3.4m). 
● ● Release of provisions no longer required 
— £2.0m gain (2009: nil). During 
the year, good progress was made 
in reducing the Group’s exposure to 
potential liabilities under legal claims. 
Consequently, the Directors’ best 
estimate of known legal claims in 
process has reduced from £2.6m 
to £0.6m. 22 severfield—r owen plc Annual Report 2010
20155-04  27/04/2011 Proof 10
taxatiOn
The underlying tax charge of £4.2m 
represents an effective rate of 26.6% (on 
applicable profit which excludes results 
of associates) compared with 28.3% in 
the previous year. This was aided by the 
satisfactory conclusion of some outstanding 
matters relating to previous years. 
The total tax charge for the year was £3.5m 
which represents an effective tax rate of 
27.0%. The impairment of the investment 
property does not attract tax relief and the 
negative impact of this is partially offset by 
the deferred tax benefit from the reduction 
of the UK corporation tax rate to 27.0%. As 
the impact of both of these points is non-
underlying, it is reflected in Other Items.
earnin Gs per sHare
Underlying basic earnings per share was 
at 12.50p, a decrease of 70% over the 
previous year. This calculation is based on 
the underlying profit after tax of £11.1m 
and 88,973,821 shares, being the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during 
the year.
Basic earnings per share, based on profit 
after tax after non-underlying items is 8.58p 
(2009: 35.34p).
For 2010, there is no difference between 
basic and diluted earnings per share (2009: 
underlying 40.91p, total 35.16p).
Divi Den D
The Board recommends a final dividend 
of 2.50p payable on 16 June 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 20 May 2011. This will give a 
total dividend for the year of 7.50p. 
Balance sH eet
Shareholders’ funds decreased slightly during 
the year from £132.5m to £130.9m.  This 
equates to a total equity value per share at 
31 December 2010 of 146.7p, compared 
with 149.5p at the end of 2009. This 
decrease reflects the dividend paid during the 
year being higher than the profit after tax.
Goodwill on the Balance Sheet is valued 
at £54.7m (2009: £54.7m) and is subject 
to an annual impairment review under 
IFRS 3. No impairment existed at either 
31 December 2010 or 2009.
Other intangible assets on the Balance Sheet 
are valued at £20.5m (2009: £23.2m) 
and represent the net book value of the 
intangible assets identified on the acquisition 
of Fisher Engineering in 2007. Each class 
of asset identified is being amortised on a 
straight line basis over varying periods. The 
amortisation charged in the year was £2.7m 
(2009: £4.4m), giving a total amortised at 
the year-end of £18.5m (2009: £15.8m).
The Group now has property, plant and 
equipment and investment property totalling 
£86.9m (2009: £91.0m). Depreciation 
charged in the year amounted to £4.5m 
(2009: £5.2m) and the investment property 
was impaired by £2.1m (2009: nil). Capital 
expenditure in the year was £3.0m (2009: 
£4.8m). This included some replacement of 
older equipment across the Group and also 
some safety equipment for protection of site 
workers on high-rise buildings.
During the year the Group invested £2.9m 
(2009: £2.4m) as equity into the joint 
venture company in India.
The Group’s capital expenditure in 2011 in 
the UK is not expected to be more than £3m.
Unlike the rest of the Group, Atlas Ward has 
a defined benefit pension scheme which, 
although closed to new members, had an 
IAS 19 deficit of £8.4m as at 31 December 
2009. At 31 December 2010, the deficit 
increased to £8.5m and is shown as a 
liability in the Group Balance Sheet. The 
increase in the deficit is as a result of the 
changes in the assumptions made, including 
a reduction in corporate bond yields and an 
increase in mortality rates, offset by slightly 
lower inflation expectations.
c as H Fl OW 
There was an expected outflow of cash 
during the year to leave year end net debt 
at £15.0m (2009: net cash £11.5m).  This 
movement reflects an outflow from operating 
activities of £11.2m, and also includes 
dividends of £8.9m and investment in capital 
expenditure and the Indian joint venture of 
£3.0m and £2.9m, respectively.  The outflow 
from operating activities reflects the reversal 
of the particularly favourable contract working 
capital position at 31 December 2009, but 
also reflects the impact of higher steel prices 
on working capital and an overall extension 
of customer payment cycles as weak market 
conditions persist.  Management continues 
to monitor customer credit risk very closely 
and credit insurance remains a key factor in 
mitigating this risk.  The outflow also includes 
corporation tax payments of £5.4m. 
The Group continues to operate within the 
parameters of its £40m revolving credit 
facility, renewed during the year, with RBS 
and Yorkshire Bank, a member of National 
Australia Bank Group. 
treasury
Group treasury activities are managed 
and controlled centrally. Risks to assets 
and potential liabilities to customers, 
employees and the public continue to be 
insured. The Group maintains its low risk 
financial management policy by insuring all 
significant trade debtors.
The treasury function seeks to reduce 
the Group’s exposure to any interest rate, 
foreign exchange and other financial 
risks, to ensure that adequate, secure and 
cost effective funding arrangements are 
maintained to finance current and planned 
future activities and to invest cash assets 
safely and profitably.
The Group continues to have some 
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, 
currently between Sterling, the Euro and the 
US Dollar. In order to maintain the projected 
level of profit budgeted on contracts foreign 
exchange contracts are taken out to convert 
into Sterling at the expected date of receipt. 
GOinG cOncern
In determining whether the Group’s annual 
consolidated financial statements can be 
prepared on a going concern basis, the 
Directors considered all factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance 
and its financial position, including cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities and the risks and uncertainties 
relating to its business activities. The key 
areas of uncertainty considered by the 
Directors were as follows:
● ● The UK order book, which currently 
stands at £226m, the pipeline of 
potential orders, including the relative 
attractiveness of the market sectors 
which are feeding that pipeline, and the 
anticipated conversion of this pipeline.
Financial REVIEW continued  23 OUR BUSINESS 23
20155-04  27/04/2011 Proof 10
● ● The implications of the continuing 
challenging economic environment 
on the Group’s revenues and profits. 
The Group undertakes forecasts and 
projections of trading and cash flows on 
a regular basis. Whilst this is essential for 
targeting performance and identifying 
areas of focus for management to 
improve performance and mitigate 
the possible adverse impact of a 
deteriorating economic outlook, they 
also provide projections of working 
capital requirements. 
● ● The impact of the very competitive 
environment within which the Group 
operates, including pressures on 
margins and counterparty risks. This 
included an assessment of the current 
stage of the economic cycle of the 
construction industry, the prospects for 
any recovery in the short to medium 
term, and the potential development of 
the competitive environment. 
● ● The impact on our business of key 
suppliers being unable to meet their 
obligations to the Group including the 
ability of the Group to find alternative 
suppliers who could also enable 
the business to continue trading 
satisfactorily. 
● ● The potential mitigating actions that 
could be taken in the event that 
revenues are worse than expected, to 
ensure that operating profit and cash 
flows are protected. 
● ● The committed finance facilities to the 
Group, including both the level of the 
facilities and the banking covenants 
attached to them. The Group has 
access to a £40m revolving credit 
facility to meet day to day working 
capital requirements, which is 
available until March 2013. This facility 
provides the Group with sufficient 
headroom both on the facility itself and 
on the bank covenants in place. This 
position is forecast to continue for the 
foreseeable future.

Having considered all the factors impacting 
the Group’s business, including downside 
sensitivities, the Directors are satisfied that 
the Group will be able to operate within the 
terms and conditions of the Group financing 
facilities for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
2010 Annual Report.
s ummary
The Group continues to perform profitably 
and in line with expectations despite the 
existing poor market conditions. In 2010, 
overall margins were under sustained 
pressure but remained positive. While 
overall net debt has increased during 
the year, it remains at levels with which 
management is comfortable. All aspects of 
the business will continue to be managed 
tightly in order that it emerges stronger 
and fitter when growth in its key sectors is 
anticipated to return in 2012.

They contain certain forward-looking 
statements which are made by the Directors 
in good faith based on the information 
available to them up to the time of their

UNDERLYING* PROFIT  
BEFORE TAx MARGIN
The margin is the principal measure used by 
the Group to assess the success of its strategy. 
It is the profit before non-underlying items such 
as the amortisation of intangible fixed assets, 
expressed as a percentage of revenue.
A reduction in 2010 to 6.1% (2009: 14.8%). 
The reduction has been the result of reduced 
Group production capacity and lower contract 
pricing as a result of overcapacity in the market. 
Capacity reductions across the industry led 
to a more stable pricing environment in the 
latter part of the year, albeit still at very tight 
margins. 
UNDERLYING* BASIC 
EARNINGS  
PER SHARE
Underlying basic earnings per share is taken as 
an overall indicator of performance. It is basic 
EPS before non-underlying items.
Underlying basic earnings per share decreased 
by 28.61p to 12.50p (2009: 41.11p). In 
the challenging market conditions a resilient 
performance.
NET DEBT
Cash is critical for providing the financial 
resources to develop the Group’s business and 
to provide adequate working capital to operate 
smoothly. The Group has a robust and detailed 
cash forecasting procedure that considers the 
Group’s position on a contract by contract basis.
Net debt as at 31 December 2010 was £15.0 
million (2009: £11.5 million net cash). The 
movement primarily reflects an outflow of 
cash from operating activities which has been 
driven by higher working capital levels due to 
the impact of higher steel prices and an overall 
extension in customer payment cycles as weak 
market conditions persist. 
ORDER BOOK
The order book provides visibility on future 
activity and allows the Group to plan production 
and adapt accordingly. It only includes future 
revenue from legally committed contracts 
comprising both ongoing and newly won work.
Whilst only the revenue within the order book 
is reported externally, a key forward indicator of 
future profitability that is tracked internally is the 
margin inherent within the forward order book.
The order book (as at 22 March 2011) for the 
Group (excluding the India Joint Venture) is £226 
million. Although this is lower than the levels attained 
in 2008-2009, it nonetheless represents a strong 
position at a time of weak market conditions. It also 
provides a good loading for the majority of the 
Group’ s production facilities for the remainder  
of 2011.
ACCIDENT FREQUENCY 
RATIO (AFR)
The AFR is a key measure of the safe operation 
of our business and is one of a number of health 
and safety measures the Group uses to monitor 
its activities. The AFR is the number of RIDDOR 
accidents to man-hours worked, multiplied by 
100,000.
The AFR rate for 2010 reduced significantly to 
0.43 (2009: 0.85) reflecting another substantial 
improvement in the Group’s safety record.

These process improvements will be applied 
at our production facilities and construction 
sites at home and overseas. We will continue 
to seek out international opportunities which 
enhance growth and value for the Group.

in partnership with premier local companies 
who can provide value enhancement and

princip al RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
 
The Group’s ongoing operations and growth plans are subject to a number of different risks and uncertainties. Risk management processes 
are put in place to assess, manage and control these on an ongoing basis. The principal ones facing the business are set out below, and are 
listed in no particular order.
Risk
people/skills
Steel price 
movements
The Group has established a 
market leading position over 
many years due in large part 
to the experience and skills of 
its key people.
Steel is the key material 
used within the business 
and the largest single cost 
within a contract. Steel prices 
have varied by >50% both 
positively and negatively over 
the past two years.
commercial 
and market 
environment
The UK construction market, 
within which the Group 
operates, is currently at the 
bottom of the economic cycle, 
placing significant pressure on 
all parts of the supply chain, 
from end customers through 
to material and subcontract 
suppliers.
Weak demand is resulting in 
increased competition, tighter 
margins and the transfer 
of commercial, technical 
and financial risk down the 
supply chain, through more 
demanding contract terms 
and longer payment cycles.
Loss of key people could 
adversely impact the Group’s 
existing market position. 
Insufficient growth and 
development of its people 
and skillsets could restrict its 
growth ambitions both in the 
UK and overseas.
Such movements have 
the potential to impact 
the profitability of both 
individual contracts and the 
whole business significantly, 
particularly given the long 
duration of many of its 
contracts. 
● ● Increased senior management review of 
technical and commercial risks within each 
contract before acceptance.
● ● Strengthening of commercial functions to 
manage contract progress and variations.
● ● Close engagement with both customers 
and suppliers and monitoring of payment 
cycles.
● ● Continuing use of credit insurance to 
minimise impact of customer failure.
● ● Talent reviews undertaken regularly.
● ● Development opportunities identified for 
staff to broaden their range of skills and 
experience.
● ● A staff appraisal process continues to align 
the short and long term needs and goals of 
the business with those of key staff.
● ● Remuneration policy is regularly reviewed 
to ensure that it is competitive and strikes 
the appropriate balance between short and 
long term rewards and incentives.
● ● Skills gaps are continually identified and 
actions put in place to bridge these by 
either training, development or external 
recruitment.
● ● Supply and pricing agreements with steel 
suppliers are negotiated to minimise 
individual contract risk.
● ● Customer bids are structured to reflect the 
prevailing conditions within the market for 
raw steel.

Risk
health & 
Safety
Indian joint 
venture
The Construction Industry sets 
very high standards of Health 
and Safety which the Group 
aims to exceed to maintain 
the health and wellbeing of its 
employees.
The Group has invested in a 
joint venture in India, where 
the growth prospects are 
believed to be substantial.
Interruption 
to fabrication 
facilities
The Group’s production 
facilities are at the core of 
its business and the Group 
relies on smooth continued 
operation of them. 
Interruption could impact 
both the Group’s performance 
on existing contracts and 
its ability to bid for future 
contracts, thereby impacting 
its financial performance.
Construction activities can 
result in injury or death to 
employees, with subsequent 
financial loss to the business, 
potential loss of reputation, 
where at fault, and ultimately 
exclusion from future 
business.
The growth, management and 
performance of this business 
will be a key element of the 
Group’s development for the 
foreseeable future. Effective 
management of the joint 
venture is therefore key to the 
Group’s continuing success. 
● ● Drive market leading standards for all 
employees at all times.
● ● Director led safety leadership teams 
established to bring innovative solutions 
and to engage with all stakeholders 
to deliver continuous improvement in 
standards across the business and wider 
industry.
● ● Regular Board review of performance.
● ● Achievement of challenging Health and 
Safety performance targets is a key element 
of management remuneration.
● ● Robust joint venture agreement.
● ● Two members of Group Board of Directors 
are members of joint venture Board.
● ● Strong governance in place at joint venture.
● ● Regular formal and informal meetings held 
with both joint venture management and 
joint venture partners.
● ● Key positions within joint venture 
management structure are occupied with 
Group employees seconded to the joint 
venture.
Explanation Impact Mitigation/comment
● ● The Group has four main production 
facilities so interruption at one facility could 
to some extent be absorbed by increasing 
capacity at a sister facility.
● ● A wide network of sub-contract fabricators 
is used on a recurring basis, both for short 
term peak capacity requirements and for 
more specialised fabrication. This network 
could also be used to mitigate disruption to 
the Group’s own fabrication facilities.
● ● Appropriate levels of Business Interruption 
insurance cover are maintained and 
reviewed regularly with the assistance of 
independent advisors and brokers.

sHare i ncentive plan (sip)
Following approval at the 2010 Annual 
General Meeting of the new HMRC 
approved Share Incentive Plan the Company 
issued 202,384 new ordinary shares of 
2.5p during the year to 973 qualifying 
employees.
sHare c apital
The Company has a single class of share 
capital which is divided into ordinary shares 
of 2.5p each.
Three resolutions are to be proposed at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
relating to or concerning Share Capital.
(i)  The directors are requesting that their 
authority to allot shares be renewed. 
The maximum amount of relevant 
securities that may be allotted pursuant 
to the authority is £743,015 in nominal 
value (29,720,608 shares) representing 
approximately 33.3% of the Company’s 
total share capital in issue as at  
18 April 2011, being the latest practical 
date prior to the date of the Notice of 
Meeting. The Board has no present 
intention of exercising this authority, 
which will expire at the end of the 2012 
Annual General Meeting, or on 30 June 
2012, whichever is the earlier.
(ii)  The directors’ power to allot equity 
securities conferred by the Special 
Resolution of the Company passed on 
3 June 2010 will expire at the 
conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 8 June 2011, 
unless otherwise varied, revoked or 
renewed. Your directors consider it 
desirable that this power, being a limited 
disapplication of pre-emption rights, 
should be renewed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting, such authority 
to expire at the end of the 2012 Annual 
General Meeting, or on 30 June 2012, 
whichever is the earlier. Apart from 
rights issues, open offers and other pre-
emptive issues, the aggregate nominal 
value of new shares for which power is 
being sought is not to exceed £111,564 
(4,462,554 shares) representing 5% 
of the Company’s issued share capital. 
Other than the shares which may be 
issued under the SIP, described above, 
the directors have no present intention 
of exercising this power but should 
any further exercise be contemplated 
in the future they will have regard to 
the Investor Protection Committee 
guidelines.
(iii)  The directors are requesting that at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
they are given the authority to buy, by 
way of market purchases, up to 10% of 
the issued share capital of the Company 
representing a maximum of 8,925,108 
shares. The price to be paid will be 
no lower than 2.5p per share and no 
more than 5% above the average of the 
middle market quotations (as derived 
from the London Stock Exchange Daily 
Official List) for the five business days 
preceding the day on which the shares 
are purchased. Purchases would not 
be made in the close period preceding 
the announcement of the Company’s 
interim or final results. This proposal 
does not indicate that the Company will 
purchase shares at any particular time or 
price, or imply any opinion on the part 
of the directors as to the market or other 
value of the Company’s shares. This 
authority will expire at the end of the 
2012 Annual General Meeting, or on 
30 June 2012, whichever is the earlier. 
It is the present intention of the directors 
to seek a similar authority annually. The 
directors have no present intention of 
exercising this authority and will only do 
so at price levels which they consider to 
be in the interests of shareholders after 
taking account of the Group’s overall 
financial position, and which would lead 
to a beneficial impact on the earnings 
per share of the Company.
ri GHts a ttac Hin G t O sHares
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares 
are defined in the Company’s Articles of 
Association. The Articles of Association 
may be changed with the agreement of 
shareholders. A shareholder whose name 
appears on the Company’s Register of 
members can choose whether his shares 
are evidenced by share certificates (i.e. in 
certificated form) or held in electronic (i.e. 
uncertificated) form in CREST (the electronic 
settlement system in the UK).
Subject to any restrictions below, 
shareholders may attend any general 
meeting of the Company and, on a 
show of hands, every shareholder (or his 
representative) who is present at a general 
meeting has one vote on each resolution 
and, on a poll, every shareholder (or his 
representative) who is present has one vote 
on each resolution for every ordinary
share of which they are the registered 
shareholder. A resolution put to the vote of 
a general meeting is decided on a show of 
hands unless before, or on the declaration 
of the result of, a vote on a show of hands, 
a poll is demanded by the chairman of the 
meeting, or by at least two shareholders 
(or their representatives) present in person 
and having the right to vote, or by any 
shareholders (or their representatives) 
present in person having at least 10% of the 
total voting rights of all shareholders, or by 
any shareholders (or their representatives) 
present in person holding ordinary shares in 
which an aggregate sum has been paid up 
of at least one-tenth of the total sum paid up 
on all ordinary shares.
Shareholders can declare final dividends 
by passing an ordinary resolution but the 
amount of the dividends cannot exceed the 
amount recommended by the Board. The 
Board can pay interim dividends on any 
class of shares of the amounts and on the 
dates and for the periods they decide the 
distributable profits of the Company justify 
such payment. 38 severfield—r owen plc Annual Report 2010
20155-04  27/04/2011 Proof 10
Any dividend which has not been claimed 
for twelve years after it became due for 
payment will be forfeited and will then 
belong to the Company, unless the 
directors decide otherwise.
If the Company is wound up, the liquidator 
can, with the sanction of an extraordinary 
resolution passed by the shareholders, 
divide among the shareholders all or any 
part of the assets of the Company and 
he can value any assets and determine 
how the division shall be carried out as 
between the members or different classes 
of members. The liquidator can also 
transfer the whole or any part of the assets 
to trustees upon any trusts for the benefit 
of the members. No shareholders can be 
compelled to accept any asset which would 
give them a liability.
Details of share-based payment schemes 
are set out in note 22.
vO tinG at General m eetinGs
Any form of proxy sent by the Company 
to shareholders in relation to any general 
meeting must be delivered to the 
Company, whether in written form or in 
electronic form, not less than 48 hours 
before the time appointed for holding the 
meeting or adjourned meeting at which the 
person named in the appointment proposes 
to vote.
No shareholder is, unless the Board decides 
otherwise, entitled to attend or vote either 
personally or by proxy at a general meeting 
or to exercise any other right conferred by 
being a shareholder if he or any person 
with an interest in shares has been sent a 
notice under section 793 of the Companies 
Act 2006 (which confers upon public 
companies the power to require information 
with respect to interests in their voting 
shares) and he or any interested person 
failed to supply the Company with the 
information requested within 14 days after

delivery of that notice. The Board may also 
decide that no dividend is payable in respect 
of those default shares and that no transfer 
of any default shares shall be registered.
These restrictions end seven days after 
receipt by the Company of a notice of an 
approved transfer of the shares or all the 
information required by the relevant section 
793 notice, whichever is the earlier.
t ransFer OF sHares
The Board may refuse to register a transfer 
of a certificated share which is not fully 
paid, provided that the refusal does not 
prevent dealings in shares in the Company 
from taking place on an open and proper 
basis. The Board may also refuse to register 
a transfer of a certificated share unless: (i) 
the instrument of transfer is lodged, duly 
stamped (if stampable), at the registered 
office of the Company or any other place 
decided by the Board, accompanied by 
a certificate for the share which it relates 
and such other evidence as the Board may 
reasonably require to show the right of 
the transferor to make the transfer; (ii) is in 
respect of only one class of shares; and (iii) is 
in favour of not more than four transferees.
Transfer of uncertificated shares must be 
carried out using CREST and the Board 
can refuse to register a transfer of an 
uncertificated share in accordance with 
the regulations governing the operation of 
CREST. The Board may decide to suspend 
the registration of transfers, for up to 30 
days a year, by closing the Register of 
shareholders. The Board cannot
suspend the registration of transfers of 
any uncertificated shares without gaining

If at any time the capital of the Company is 
divided into different classes of shares, the 
special rights attaching to any class may be 
varied or revoked either:
(i)  with the written consent of the holders

The Group’s current policy concerning the 
payment of its trade creditors is to agree 
terms and conditions for its transactions 
with suppliers and to abide by those terms, 
subject to those terms and conditions being 
met by the supplier. At 31 December 2010 
trade creditors of the Group represented 43

After making enquiries, the directors 
have formed a judgement at the time of 
approving the financial statements that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the

to adopt a going concern basis in preparing

Each director, at the date of approval of this 
Annual Report, confirms that:
● ● so far as the director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
● ● the director has taken all the steps that 
he ought to have taken as a director 
in order to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given, and should 
be interpreted, in accordance with the

Heal tH an D saF ety
The Group is committed to high standards 
of Health and Safety for all employees and 
is promoting safety excellence through all 
its operations. The Group has developed a 
continuous improvement strategy to drive 
and challenge current practices, with the 
intention of placing the business as a market 
leader in the implementation of Health and 
Safety.
At the start of 2011, the Group established 
a network of Safety Leadership Teams at 
each of its operating companies. Each team 
is headed by the Managing Director and 
consists of senior directors, managers, 
shopfloor and union representation. The 
SLTs will support the excellent work carried 
out by the Group’s in-house safety teams 
and worker safety committees and, by 
working with key clients, will assist in setting 
strategies and the introduction of new 
technologies to improve health and safety 
standards across the industry.
The Group’s fully functional Health and 
Safety department supports the operational 
directors in developing and maintaining 
a positive health and safety culture for all 
aspects of our operations. Each operating 
subsidiary has a worker health and safety 
committee with direct access to the main 
Board via monthly Health and Safety 
meetings.
The Group operates in some challenging 
working environments and the Board is 
proud of its good safety record. Despite this, 
the Board will continue to improve both 
health and safety awareness and the safety 
record throughout the Group.
The Group has successfully maintained 
accreditation for its Safety, Health and 
Environmental System and has achieved 
certification to OHSAS 18001 and BS EN 
ISO 14001.
In 2011 the focus is on the the 
development of leadership skills and the 
provision of behavioural safety training of 
employees and our subcontractors to help 
achieve our improvement strategy.
empl Oyees
Severfield–Rowen recently launched an 
employee Share Incentive Scheme offering 
shares in the business to reward employees 
for their hard work in positioning the 
business as market leader.
Employees are regularly informed of matters 
concerning the performance and future 
developments of the Group.
The Group’s policy is to provide equal 
opportunities to all existing and prospective 
employees. The Group’s reputation is 
dependent on the quality, effectiveness and 
skill base of its employees and is committed 
to the fair and equitable treatment of all 
its employees and specifically to prohibit 
discrimination on the grounds of race,

nationality or ethnic origin.
The Group has also continued with its 
established policy of employing disabled 
persons where practicable and endeavours 
to ensure that they benefit from training 
and career opportunities in common with 
all employees. In the event that employees 
become disabled every effort is made to 
ensure that their employment within the 
Group continues, with appropriate training 
and support.

on the natural environment and the 
community at large by going beyond basic 
compliance with applicable laws, directives 
and regulations pertaining to its field of 
operations.
The businesses work with local authorities 
to ensure they comply with all permits 
and authorisations required to carry out 
operations.
All operational companies within the Group 
have now been awarded Gold Standard in

The Group is proud to be recognised as 
the first Steel Fabrication Contractor in the 
Industry to achieve the global standard of 
BES 6001 to demonstrate the responsible 
sourcing of materials for products fabricated 
for clients. 
This accreditation gives the Group a

The in-house training company, ECTL, 
is manned by experienced training 
professionals whose primary purpose is to 
provide training to all employees and to 
update them with the necessary skills and 
professional development. The business 
recognises that as an organisation its 
employees must achieve the necessary 
competences and Health and Safety 
understanding to successfully manage any 
risks associated with the work undertaken by 
the business.
The team within ECTL provides approved 
training and accreditation to industry 
recognised standards across a significant 
range of management, supervisory, office 
and frontline roles. They are supplemented 
by external resource from many awarding 
bodies such as IPAF, City & Guilds and 
Learning Skills Council, to ensure that the 
Group’s workforce is effectively trained, 
qualified and experienced to perform their 
roles safely and in compliance with statutory 
and recommended practices.
During 2010 the Group committed 
significant financial and time resource to 
delivering training programmes for its direct 
employees and sub-contractors. Training 
was delivered from senior executive level to 
shop floor and on-site employees.
The Executive Committee recently 
undertook the Institute of Occupational 
Safety and Health, Directing Safely 
training course as part of the leadership 
development programme rollout across the 
business.

The Group is continuing to pursue a carbon 
agenda which will help to provide a clear 
business differentiator in the market place.
In 2010 the business took the decision 
to actively reduce the transport carbon 
footprint for the business. Company cars 
were 
a first step and by investing in a significant 
number of hybrid vehicles, a total of 17 
Toyota Prius Hybrid cars were added to 
the Group fleet.
A corporate strategy of progressively 
moving towards low carbon vehicles with 
CO2 emissions of below 140kgs has been 
proactively implemented. The Company is 
benefiting in terms of cost reduction and its 
overall carbon footprint.
 
2008 =  24% of company cars under 
140kgs/CO2.     
2008 = 0 Hybrid vehicles
 
2009 =  28% of company cars under

20155-04  27/04/2011 Proof 10
The business also invests in 9 minibuses at 
the Dalton works to reduce the number of 
vehicles on the road and limit the number 
of cars impacting the local community each 
day with less journeys by employees.

The Group has worked hard to promote 
an inclusive culture with effective two 
way communications with employees and 
union representatives to support the overall 
performance of the business. 
Regular scheduled meetings help to create 
a meaningful and robust method of dealing 
with concerns and management issues 
across all aspects of the business. 
cOmmunity enG a Gement
Severfield–Rowen Plc recognises the 
importance of community involvement and 
proactively engages with organisations both 
locally and nationally. Group companies 
also recognise their duty as successful local 
employers and are involved directly with 
the local communities and residents, many 
of which are directly employed by the 
businesses.
Direct time and resource are involved to 
ensure the Group is properly engaged in 
these activities. During 2010 Severfield–
Rowen Plc actively supported and donated 
to the following local organisations: 
Butterwick Hospice, Saint Michael’s Hospice, 
Bolton Hospice and Saint Catherine’s 
Hospice.
The Group companies also support and

The Board is committed to high standards 
of corporate governance. It is accountable 
to the Company’s shareholders for good 
corporate governance.
This statement together with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 
58 describe how the principles of good 
governance, as set out in Section 1 of the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
published in June 2008 by the Financial 
Reporting Council (“the Code”), are applied 
to the Company and the Company’s 
compliance with the Code provisions. The 
principles of good governance are split into 
the following areas: directors, directors’ 
remuneration, accountability and audit, and 
relations with shareholders.
Direct Ors
tH e BOarD
The Company is controlled through 
the Board of Directors which currently 
comprises four executive and five non-
executive directors, all of which are 
considered as independent.
P J Davison resigned on 3 June 2010.
J Dodds was appointed as an additional non-
executive director from 1 October 2010.
D Randall was appointed as a Main Board 
director with effect from 28 February 2011, 
increasing the number of executive directors 
to four.
T J L Hayward is the non-executive 
Chairman and was appointed on  
1 June 2008.
The Board has a separate Chairman and 
Chief Executive in line with the Code. 
The Chairman is mainly responsible for 
the running of the Board, evaluating its 
performance and ensuring that all directors 
receive sufficient relevant information on 
financial, business and corporate issues 
prior to meetings. The Chief Executive’s 
responsibilities focus on co-ordinating the 
Company’s business and assessing and 
implementing Group strategy.
J K Elliott is the senior independent non-
executive director and leads the performance 
review of the Chairman, taking into account 
the views of the executive directors.
All directors are able to take independent 
professional advice in furtherance of their 
duties if necessary.
The Board considers that the balance of 
relevant experience amongst the various 
Board members enables the Board to 
exercise effective leadership and control of 
the Group. It also ensures that the decision 
making process cannot be dominated by 
any individual or small group of individuals.
An Executive Committee consisting of 
the members indicated on page 31 was 
established in 2008. This Committee assists 
the main Board by focusing on strategic and 
operational performance matters relating 
to the business and meets formally on a 
monthly basis. 
BOar D eFFectiveness
The Board has a formal schedule of 
matters reserved for it. It is responsible 
for overall Group strategy, acquisition and 
divestment policy, approval of major capital 
expenditure projects and consideration of 
significant financing matters. It monitors the 
exposure to key business risks including 
environmental and health and safety 
issues. It reviews the strategic direction 
of individual trading subsidiaries, codes 
of conduct, annual budgets, progress 
towards achievement of those budgets and 
significant capital expenditure programmes.
The Board also considers employee issues 
and key appointments. It also ensures that 
all directors receive appropriate training 
on appointment and then subsequently as 
appropriate. Other specific responsibilities 
are delegated to the Board committees 
described below. All directors, in accordance 
with the Code, will submit themselves for 
re-election at least once every three years. 
The performance of individual directors is 
evaluated annually in conjunction with the 
remuneration review.
The Board generally meets monthly and 
during the year met ten times. A formal 
agenda for each meeting is agreed 
with the Chairman and is circulated in 
advance of the meeting to allow time 
for proper consideration, together with 
relevant papers including key strategic, 
operational and financial information. 
Attendance of individual directors during 
2010 at scheduled Board meetings and at 
meetings of the Remuneration, Audit and 
Nominations Committees is set out below.

Non-attendance by directors at meetings 
was due to either conflicting commitments 
previously agreed or illness. The majority 
of the Board meetings are held at the 
Group’s Head Office in Dalton, North 
Yorkshire. However, during the year three 
of the meetings were held at the offices of 
the Group’s other operating subsidiaries 
providing non-executive directors the 
opportunity to increase their knowledge and 
understanding of the Group’s operations.
This included one meeting held in India.
BOarD cO mmittees
The Board has established four standing 
committees, all of which operate within 
defined terms of reference.
The committees established are the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee, 
the Nomination Committee and the Health 
and Safety Committee. Trading companies 
are managed by separate boards of directors. 
Any matters of a material nature concerning 
the trading companies are reported to the 
Group Board of directors on a monthly basis.
With the change in the executive 
management and chairmanship in 2008 
plus the attendant Board restructuring, 
the new Board considered it important to 
retain a level of continuity in the Boardroom 
and asked J K Elliott to continue in his 
role as Senior Non-Executive Director for 
the immediate future notwithstanding 
that 2008 was his 10th year as a serving 
director; he therefore continues with his 
chairmanship of the Audit Committee and 
the Remuneration Committee. The Board 
acknowledges that he could be considered 
non independent due to tenure but believes 
that he continues to act independently and 
recognises his high level of commitment 
and effective contribution to the Board’s 
decision making process.
a u Dit cO mmittee
The Audit Committee comprises the 
non-executive directors and is chaired by 
J K Elliott. T J L Hayward is a Chartered 
Accountant and is considered by the Board 
to have the relevant financial experience 
to serve on the Audit Committee. The 
Committee has written terms of reference 
which will be available for inspection at the 
Annual General Meeting. Meetings are 
held at least twice a year and additional 
meetings may be requested by the auditors.
The responsibility of the Audit Committee 
principally falls into the following areas:
● ● To monitor the integrity of the financial 
statements, formal announcements and 
to review significant financial reporting 
judgements.

● ● To review the Company’s internal 
financial controls.
● ● To make recommendations to the Board 
in relation to the appointment and 
removal of the external auditor and to 
approve their remuneration and their 
terms of engagement. 
● ● To review the nature of non-audit 
services supplied and non-audit fees 
relative to the audit fee.
● ● To provide independent oversight over 
the external audit process through 
agreeing the suitability of the scope 
and approach of the external auditor’s 
work, assessing their objectivity in 
undertaking their work and monitoring 
their independence taking into account 
relevant UK professional regulatory 
requirements and the auditor’s period in 
office and compensation
● ● To oversee the effectiveness of the 
external audit process particularly 
with regard to the quality and cost-
effectiveness of the auditor’s work.
● ● To consider the need for an internal 
audit function. The Committee agrees 
with the directors’ opinion that the 
Group is not of sufficient size and 
complexity to require the need for an 
internal audit function. 
Consistent with exercising these responsibilities 
the Committee has considered in detail 
both the final and interim results for 2010 
specifically reviewing the appropriateness 
of significant accounting policies, financial 
reporting issues and judgements and relevant 
reports from both management and the 
external auditor. Throughout the year the 
Committee has continued to assist the 
Board in achieving its obligations under the 
Combined Code in areas of risk management 
and internal control, focussing particularly on 
areas of compliance with legal requirements, 
accounting standards and the Listing Rules, 
and ensuring that an effective system of 
internal financial and non-financial controls is 
maintained.
The Committee recognises that, given their 
knowledge of the business, there are often 
advantages in using the auditor to provide 
certain non-audit services. The Committee 
is satisfied that the independence of the 
auditor has not been impaired by providing 
these services. Non-audit services provided 
by the auditor during the year ended  
31 December 2010 included corporation 
tax compliance advice and advice in 
connection with the establishment of 
JSW Severfield Structures Limited. The 
Committee has a policy of limiting fees to 
the auditor for non-audit services to 100% 
of the audit fee and requiring competitive 
tender for all work with a fee over £30,000. 
There are no specific types of non-audit 
work from which the auditor is specifically 
excluded but the Committee may reserve 
the right to insist that the auditor be 
excluded from tendering for work that 
may present a potential conflict of interest. 
The auditor complies with the Accounting 
Practices Board (APB) Ethical Standards 
applying to non-audit services.
Details of the auditor’s fees are shown in 
note 4 on page 75.
On invitation, the Finance Director, other 
executive directors, Executive Committee 
members and the auditor attend meetings 
to assist the Committee to fulfil its duties. 
The Committee can access independent 
professional advice if it considers it 
necessary.
The Committee met on two occasions in 
2010 with full attendance.
r emuneratiOn cOmmittee
The Remuneration Committee operates 
under written terms of reference. These terms 
of reference are available for inspection at the 
Annual General Meeting and are published 
on the Company’s website. The Committee 
comprises the non-executive directors, and is 
chaired by J K Elliott. The Committee’s report 
is set out on pages 50 to 58.
nOminatiOns cOmmittee
The Nomination Committee comprises the 
non-executive directors and is chaired by G H 
Wright. The principal task of the Committee 
is to deal with key appointments to the Board, 
and related employment matters.
The Committee is responsible for proposing 
candidates for appointment to the Board, 
having regard to the balance and structure 
of the Board, and will meet as and when 
required.
The Committee met on three occasions 
during 2010 with full attendance to 
discuss Finance Director succession and 
the appointment of a new non-executive 
director. The terms of reference for the 
Nomination Committee will be available for 
inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
All directors are required to seek re-election 
by the members at the Annual General 
Meeting following their appointment. Non-
executive directors are not appointed for a 
fixed term.
The terms and conditions of appointment of 
non-executive directors will be available for 
inspection at the Annual General Meeting.

The directors’ responsibilities for the financial

internal cO ntr Ol
An ongoing process has been established 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group, which 
involves working closely with independent 
risk management consultants. This process 
has been in place for the full financial 
year and up to the date of the approval of 
these financial statements and is regularly 
reviewed by the Board. This process is in 
accordance with the guidance provided by 
the Turnbull Report.
The Board has formally acknowledged 
its overall responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control. It believes 
that senior management within the Group’s 
operating businesses should also contribute

There are inherent limitations in any system 
of internal control and, accordingly, even 
the most effective system can provide only 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
with respect to the preparation of financial 
information and the safeguarding of assets. 
The system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives.
In carrying out its review of the effectiveness 
of internal control in the Group the Board 
has taken into consideration the following 
key features of the risk management 
process and system of internal control:
● ● Senior management from all key 
disciplines and subsidiary companies 
within the Group are involved in the 
process of risk assessment in order to 
identify and assess Group objectives, 
key issues and controls. A further 
review has been performed to identify 
those risks relevant to the Group as a 
whole. This assessment encompassed 
all aspects of risk including operational, 
compliance, financial and strategic. A 
risk register is in place and is updated 
on an ongoing basis and a control 
strategy has been determined for each 
of the significant risks.
● ● The risk management committee, 
chaired by T G Haughey, has the 
primary responsibility to identify, 
monitor and control the significant 
risks to an acceptable level throughout 
the Group. The committee receives 
information on relevant risk matters 
from line management and other 
sources on a regular basis.
● ● The Group operates a comprehensive 
budgeting and financial reporting 
system which, as a matter of routine, 
compares actual results with budgets. 
Management accounts are prepared 
for each subsidiary company and the 
Group on a monthly basis. Material 
variances from budget are thoroughly 
investigated. In addition, a more detailed 
profitability forecast based on actual 
contracts secured is regularly prepared 
to monitor the performance of the main 
operating company of the Group as 
the year progresses. Risks are identified 
and appraised throughout the annual 
process of preparing budgets. The Board 
approves the Group’s annual budget.
● ● A credit insurance committee comprising 
T G Haughey, P A Emerson and A D 
Dunsmore has been established to 
review matters when adequate credit 
insurance on the Group’s customers 
cannot be purchased in the present 
economic climate.

Cash flow forecasts are regularly prepared 
to ensure that the Group has adequate 
funds and resources for the foreseeable 
future.
Standard financial control procedures 
operate throughout the Group to ensure the 
integrity of the Group’s financial statements.
The Group operates a comprehensive 
“whistleblowing” policy, which is available 
on the Group’s website. Accordingly, staff 
may, in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting or other matters. The Audit 
Committee reviews adherence with this 
policy on an ongoing basis.
Subsidiary company meetings consider and 
report on risk on a monthly basis as part 
of the monthly business review process. 
This process is followed to ensure that, as 
far as possible, the controls and safeguards 
are being operated in line with established 
procedures and standards. 
Safety, Health and Environmental risks are 
continually monitored at all sites and are 
reviewed on a monthly basis by senior 
management and on a quarterly basis by 
the Health and Safety Committee.
Steps have been taken to embed internal 
control and risk management into the 
operations of the business and to deal 
with areas of improvement which come to 
management’s and the Board’s attention. 
This process is continuing to increase risk 
awareness throughout the Group.

Direct Ors’ REMUNERATION REPORT
 
intr ODuctiOn
My tenure as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee during the 
second part of the last decade saw 
significant fluctuations in the company’s 
results in line with changing market 
dynamics while at the same time investors 
realised generally steady increases in 
shareholder value. Attendant changes in the 
executive management of the business were 
implemented seamlessly and progressively 
during this time.
At the end of 2008 the UK construction 
industry experienced the commencement 
of the biggest and deepest retrenchment in 
modern history. You have heard from our 
CEO that expectations for market recovery 
in 2011 are now anticipated in 2012. This 
severe curtailment of the markets has seen 
an attendant rationalisation and shrinkage 
in the UK’s steel fabrication and erection 
industry. Across the industry management 
have been downsizing operations, losses 
have been widely acknowledged and some 
notable closures reported.
And yet Severfield–Rowen enters 2011 
with a strong order book and a successful 
diversification strategy in hand. Revenue and 
profits have followed the downward spiral of 
the market but the company has increased 
market share, successfully diversified 
internationally and is well positioned for the 
recovery. It has retained and enhanced its 
UK market leader position.
The Remuneration Committee met many 
times throughout the past year, both 
formally and informally, seeking to develop 
remuneration policy consistent with 
management performance, company results 
and market conditions and outlook.
The report presents both our conclusions 
and our forward planning.
r epOrtinG r eGulatiOns  
This report, approved by the Board, has 
been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 (Schedule 8) and the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority. It also 
describes how the Board has applied the 
Principles of Good Governance relating 
to directors’ remuneration under the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
Remuneration Committee has also taken 
into consideration guidelines published by 
institutional investor advisory bodies such 
as the ABI and RREV. As required by the 
legal regulations, a resolution to approve 
this report will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company at 
which time the financial statements will be 
approved. 
The regulations require the auditor to 
report to the Company’s members on 
the “auditable part” of the Directors 
Remuneration Report and to state whether 
in their opinion that part of the report has 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. The report 
has therefore been divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited 
information.

The Company has an established 
Remuneration Committee which is 
constituted in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Combined Code. 
The Committee comprises five non-
executive directors, J K Elliott, T Hayward, 
G H Wright, D P Ridley and J Dodds, and 
is chaired by J K Elliott. The Committee 
met on seven occasions during the year 
with full attendance. John Dodds joined the 
Board on 1 October 2010 and attended all 
meetings subsequent to his appointment. 
The Company considers all members of the 
Committee to be independent. No executive 
directors attended Remuneration Committee 
meetings or otherwise play a part in any 
discussion about their own remuneration.
The statements made herein regarding 
remuneration policy apply equally to the 
five divisional directors who served on the 
Executive Committee and to the three 
executive directors who sat on the Board of 
Severfield–Rowen Plc during 2010. In 2011 
there will be four Main Board directors and 
four divisional directors below Main Board 
on the Executive Committee.
Throughout 2010 Hewitt New Bridge Street 
(a trading name of AON Corporation) 
served as an independent adviser to the 
Remuneration Committee. Neither Hewitt 
New Bridge Street nor any other part of 
AON Corporation proved other services to 
the Company during the year.

r emuneratiOn pOlicy
In previous years in this report we have 
reiterated our policy of designing executive 
remuneration to attract executive directors 
of the highest calibre. This cornerstone of 
our policy remains unchanged. But there are 
today other parameters of equal bearing. 
Reward for performance, motivation and 
retention are major drivers. Moreover, 
alignment with corporate strategy and goals 
and alignment with compensation in the 
broader workforce are both fundamental 
drivers and underlying constraints. 
Delivering the policy fundamentals requires 
careful consideration to achieve the correct 
balance between the various facets of our 
policy.
r ecent Hist Ory
Prior to 2004 executive pay was decided 
by the Remuneration Committee on a 
subjective basis taking into account the 
Company’s results and our assessment 
of individual contribution. A number of 
share option schemes had been adopted. 
Progressively a more structured cash bonus 
scheme tied to financial performance 
was introduced and share options were 
superseded by a share matching plan tied 
to longer term performance, which was later 
replaced by the current Performance Share 
Plan (PSP), also tied to three-year targets. 
Base salaries were set and reset, year on 
year, using traditional market benchmarking 
methods and taking account of individual 
experience and performance.
In 2007 executive salaries were reset mid-
year when our current CEO assumed the 
role in July. These base salaries remained 
essentially unchanged (other than for a 3% 
inflationary adjustment on 1 January 2008) 
until the start of 2010. 
In August 2009 the Company made a 
statement accompanying the interim results 
warning of extremely challenging market 
conditions and advising that a consultation 
process was in hand with management 
and the workforce to implement salary 
reductions and other cost savings. In the 
same announcement we advised that the 
Board and the Executive Committee had 
agreed to a reduction of 20% in base 
salaries effective 1 January 2010. 
Consequently, current executive base 
salaries are significantly below 2007 levels.
In addition, we announced in 2009 our 
intention to replace the current single-tier 
approach to annual cash bonuses tied 
to financial performance to a broader 
based two-tier approach incorporating 
the measurement of success against 
non financial criteria, as well as financial 
metrics, thereby providing a more rounded 
assessment of management and company 
performance. 
tH e status Qu O
Recent benchmarking confirms that current 
base salaries of the executive directors are 
now significantly below market levels. This 
is entirely predictable as the salaries have 
been significantly reduced over a period of 
four years.
The benchmarking also indicated that 
the upper thresholds or caps of variable 
performance related pay, both short and 
long term were competitive or in some 
cases above market. However, earnings or 
vesting under these schemes will be limited 
by the market driven downturn for at least 
three years. 
The benchmarking has been used for 
information and has not formed the basis 
for specific adjustments.
tO tal Direct Ors’ remunerati On
It is important to view overall directors’ 
remuneration against the backdrop of 
market movement and results. Looking 
at the group of eight directors within the 
purview of the Remuneration Committee, 
the payroll cost from 2009 to 2010 reduced 
by 25%. Bonus payments declined by 61%. 
Total remuneration is down by 42% in 
aggregate, a reduction of £1.5 million.
tH e Future
Future executive remuneration policy will 
incorporate our established principles and 
strive for consistency with best practice 
guidelines whilst creating a platform for 
a broader based policy incorporating the 
following precepts:
1) Alignment of total executive 
remuneration with shareholder return.
2) Fair reward for past achievement
3) Motivation for future achievement
4) Ensuring the package is sufficiently 
retentive, mitigating the replacement 
risk.
5) Realisation of non financial performance 
targets aligned with corporate strategy.
6) Establishment of an appropriate balance 
between fixed and performance related 
remuneration.
7) Avoidance of policies that incentivise 
executives to assume undue risk for the 
business.
The Remuneration Committee will seek to 
balance these objectives in all aspects of 
future remuneration.  52 severfield—r owen plc Annual Report 2010

2010 remunerati On
The major elements of the remuneration 
package for the executive directors are:
● ● Basic annual salary and benefits
● ● Annual bonus payments
● ● Performance Share Plan (PSP)
● ● Pension
Base salaries
The Remuneration Committee supported the 
Board’s decision to reduce all base salaries 
by 20% at the start of 2010 in response to 
the retrenchment in our markets and severe 
pressure on margins. The decision has also 
been taken to make no change again in 
2011, leaving them significantly below 2007 
levels. There are two components of our 
stated policy driving this decision: alignment 
with shareholder returns and alignment with 
our corporate strategy of controlling direct 
payroll cost in the business.
The Remuneration Committee will revisit 
base salary levels again at the start of 2012.
a nnual BOnuses 
Our two-tier approach (adopted for 2010) 
for bonus assessment carried forward the 
established PBT versus budget criteria used 
in previous years for 60% of the bonus and 
created a group of qualitative performance 
criteria against specific corporate objectives 
for the remaining 40%.
The PBT (60%) part was based on a simple 
formulaic approach used in previous years 
as shown below.
With changes in the composition of the 
Board in 2011 we plan to revisit the 
percentages in this table during the coming 
year. It is anticipated that we will implement 
four separate upper thresholds incorporating 
the existing CEO numbers unchanged, 
setting a COO upper threshold of 125%, 
an upper threshold of 100% for other PLC 
Board directors and 75% for divisional 
directors. Bonus award thresholds are 
interpolated linearly between the thresholds.
The maximum bonus thresholds in the 
table above were applied consistently in 
calculating awards for both the financial and 
non-financial targets, albeit no awards were 
earned in 2010 for the PBT performance 
against budget. One exception was made 
in that the threshold change for the COO 
position planned in 2011 was applied 
in calculating 2010 bonus entitlement 
on the grounds that the realignment of 
directors’ responsibilities occurred early 
in 2010 with the appointment of a new 
Finance Director on 1 March 2010. This 
entailed a substantial increase to the 
scope and complexity of the role of COO, 
incorporating a focus on the Company’s 
overseas operations.
Setting of bonuses within the allowable 
ranges is at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee taking into 
account our assessment of contribution to 
financial results, prevailing market conditions, 
budget performance in difficult market 
conditions being better rewarded than in 
a seller’s market, and both individual and 
collective contribution to the implementation 
of strategic initiatives which we anticipate will 
deliver profits in future years.  
PBT targets were not achieved in 2010 in 
the context of the shrinking market and 
tightening margins. Hence bonus awards 
were evaluated using the non-financial 
performance objectives applied to 40% of 
the maximum allowable bonus.
For the qualitative part (40%) assessment of 
performance against non financial corporate 
objectives, the Committee selected three 
subsets:
A. Health and Safety statistics improvement 
goals – 10%
B. Customer Performance Feedback – 
15%
C. Indian subsidiary goals – 15%
The Remuneration Committee’s evaluation 
against the H&S objective (we used AFR 
improvement 2010 vs 2009) and the Indian 
venture milestones, which were specific 
targets such as completion on schedule and 
completion on budget, were mostly non-
judgemental in the sense that the target was 
either achieved or not. AFR improvement 
target was achieved. Four out of five of the 
Indian sub-targets were met. The fifth was 
narrowly missed and we awarded a 75% 
score against that sub-target.

The customer feedback required judgement 
on behalf of both the customer and the 
Remuneration Committee. Five major 
customers were selected all of whom had 
active projects performed by Severfield–
Rowen in 2010. The clients were given 
six categories of performance assessment 
including H&S, quality, cost, schedule and 
responsiveness. Each client designated a 
senior executive who was interviewed by 
a Remuneration Committee member after 
year-end and asked for assessments. The 
scores were consolidated and evaluated by 
the Remuneration Committee. Overall, the 
assessment was excellent with high scores 
from all clients in all categories and only 
very isolated negative comments. All five 
customers strongly affirmed their intention 
to work with Severfield–Rowen again in the 
future. The net result was an A+ scorecard 
evaluation by the Remuneration Committee.
In setting final bonuses the Remuneration 
Committee used the 2009 salaries as the 
reference point, having taken the view that 
it not been foreseen or planned to apply the 
percentages against reduced salaries. 
Details of the bonuses paid for 2010 are set 
out in the table of directors’ emoluments 
on page 57. The bonus payments are not 
pensionable.
nO n-e xecutive Direct Ors
The remuneration of non-executive directors 
is considered by the executive directors and 
reflects the time that they commit to the 
Company. Non-executive directors cannot 
participate in any of the annual bonus, long 
term incentive or the Company’s pension 
scheme.
The Executive Board has elected to reinstate 
the non-executives’ fees to pre-cut (2009) 
levels on 1 January 2011, recognising the 
generally held view that such fees are not 
intrinsically performance related, realising 
no benefit from profit improvement or 
shareholder returns.
perFO rmance sHare plan
Under the PSP rules shares are awarded at 
the start of a three-year period which can 
vest in whole or in part at the end of the 
three year term subject to the achievement 
of a performance goal, the Performance 
Condition (PC). Participation is limited to the 
eight executive directors, comprising four 
Main Board directors and four divisional 
directors. The normal maximum limit for 
the value of shares comprising an award is 
150% of salary in any year.  
tH e perFO rmance cO n Diti Ons 
The PC is based on earnings per share 
(“EPS”) assessed at the end of a three-year 
performance period. The EPS targets range 
for each award is set by the Remuneration 
Committee, prior to grant, with a three-year 
look ahead. 
vestin G recO rD & Outl OOk
2007–2009
The first awards under the PSP were 
made in 2007 to vest at the end of 2009 
subject to achievement of the Performance 
Condition.
The Performance Condition target (EPS) 
at the end of 2009 fractionally exceeded 
that required to allow full vesting of the 
2007 awards. These awards vested in 
2010. The value of awards vesting in 2010 
was relatively low at today’s share price as 
the number of shares awarded is factored 
against base salary at the time of the award 
and the prevailing share price at the time of 
award. The 2007 awards were made at a 
share price slightly above £5.
2008–2010
The 2008 awards will not vest in 2011 by 
reference to performance at the end of 
2010. The PC was set at the start of 2008 
when confidence was still good and a record 
year was ahead of us. The market, turnover 
and profit have all since declined in line with 
the market. 
2009–2011
Based on the performance in 2010 the 
2009 awards would not vest by reference 
to performance at the end of 2011.  At 
the time of setting the PC a 2011 recovery 
was expected and a target range was set 
requiring 2011 EPS of between 25p and 
40p. The CEO has announced previously 
that this recovery has now slipped into 
2012, meaning that the EPS range is 
currently well ahead of current analysts’ 
forecasts for 2011. 
2010–2012
At the start of 2010 the lower threshold 
PC for the three-year period was carried 
forward unchanged from the last one 
at an EPS of 25p. The upper threshold 
was reduced from 40 to 35p. An EPS of 
25p represents a PBT of approximately 
£30m, currently well ahead of analysts’ 
expectations for 2012.
2011–2013
Following three years of no vesting or 
at best low vesting we have elected this 
three-year cycle (2011–2013) to set a 
lower bottom threshold but an unchanged 
upper threshold; an EPS range 12.5p (PBT 
of approximately £15m) to 25.0p (PBT of 
approximately £30m). The Remuneration 
Committee is aiming to provide a 
meaningful incentive for the executives. 
Accordingly, the lower threshold is set 
taking into account Company and analysts’ 
forecasts and the upper thresholds at 
significantly more challenging levels.
psp aW arD levels
Attendant with setting the three year PC, 
as discussed in the previous paragraph, 
PSP awards will be granted at the start 
of 2011. The Remuneration Committee 
has elected to make awards in the range 
of 100% to 145% of base salary versus 
150% maximum allowable in the PSP 
rules. Two Main Board directors will be 
granted 145% of base salary, two 125% 
and the four divisional directors will each 
receive 100% awards. Each award will only 
vest on achievement of the three year PC. 
The grant levels take account of the fact 
that these will be referenced off depressed 
base salary levels and are consistent with 
the philosophy expressed in the previous 
paragraph regarding incentives and director 
shareholdings.

A policy was introduced in 2004 whereby 
executive directors will be required to retain 
shares acquired under long term incentive 
schemes until such time they have built up 
a holding equivalent in market value (at 
the date of vesting) to the executive’s base 
salary. Thereafter, the executive directors will 
be under a continuing obligation to maintain 
at least such a holding. The requirement 
underscores the Committee’s policy to 
align executive director remuneration and 
shareholder interests.
pensiOns
The Group contributes to each executive 
director’s money purchase pension fund. 
Contribution rates for each director are 
£50,000 pa plus 7% of base salary 
resulting in contribution levels in the range 
of 15–36% of base salary. Due to the 
widely publicised pension law changes the 
7% contribution in future years will be 
expressed as base salary in lieu of pension 
contribution. 
s ervice cO ntracts
The service contracts of executive directors 
run on a rolling basis and are no longer 
than 12 months duration. Notice periods of 
12 months are required to be given by all 
parties.
Full details of the contracts of each director 
including the date, unexpired term and any 
payment obligations on early termination are 
available from the Company Secretary and 
will be available for inspection at the Annual 
General Meeting.  
The 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 
confirmed the appointment of Alan 
Dunsmore as Finance Director on 1 March 
2010 succeeding Peter Davison. Peter 
Davison stepped down as a director and 
employee at the annual general meeting on 
3 June 2010 following 22 years of service.
The discussions on finance director 
succession planning had begun in mid 
2009. The Board believed that the growth 
and diversification of the business warranted 
replacement planning with particular regard 
to international experience. Hence, the 
Board encouraged Peter Davison’s decision 
to accept early retirement. In this context the 
Remuneration Committee agreed to award 
Peter Davison an amount equivalent to  
12 months’ salary and pension contributions 
in lieu of contractual notice on his departure.
In July 2010 Peter Davison was re-employed 
as Company Secretary on a part-time 
basis as an interim measure until such time 
as a new Company Secretary could be 
appointed. That appointment will be the 
subject of a separate announcement.  56 severfield—r owen plc Annual Report 2010

Direct Ors’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
 
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law the directors must not approve 
the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
● ● select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
● ● make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
● ● state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; 
and
● ● prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that directors:
● ● properly select and apply accounting 
policies;
● ● present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; 
● ● provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
● ● make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
r esp Onsi Bility statement
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
● ● the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
● ● the management report, which is 
incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of 
the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and 
the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements. If we

misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.

1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS adopted for use 
in the European Union and therefore 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation.
 
The financial statements have been 
prepared on the historical cost basis, 
except for the revaluation of financial 
instruments. The principal accounting 
policies adopted are set out below.
The Group has applied IFRS 3 ‟Business 
Combinations” — revision effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 July 2009, in the year. IFRS 3 
will impact upon the treatment of any 
acquisition-related costs (for instance 
finder’s fees, advisory, legal, accounting, 
valuation and other professional 
or consulting fees incurred on the 
acquisition of new businesses), with such 
costs being expensed in the period. 
IFRS 3 also impacts upon the treatment 
of contingent consideration associated 
with acquisitions. There has been no 
impact of the application of this standard 
in the current year. The impact on the 
Group’s Accounts in future periods 
will depend upon the number and 
significance of any acquisitions arising.
In addition to the standard detailed 
above, the following standards have 
been adopted in the current period, 
which have had no material impact on 
the Accounts:
● ● IAS 24 (revised) “Related Party 
Disclosures”;
● ● IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements — Cost of an 
Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly 
Controlled Entity or Associate” — 
(revised), effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 
2009; and
● ● IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement 
— Eligible Hedged Items” 
revision applies retrospectively for 
accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 July 2009.
 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors 
have formed a judgement at the time 
of approving the financial statements 
that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason 
the directors continue to adopt a going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The key factors considered 
by the directors in making the statement 
are set out within the Financial Review 
on pages 22 to 24.
basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements 
incorporate the financial statements of 
the Company and all subsidiaries for 
the financial year ended 31 December 
2010.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included 
in the Consolidated Income Statement 
from the effective date of acquisition or 
up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made 
to the financial statements of subsidiaries 
to bring the accounting policies used 
into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation.
Consolidated income statement 
disclosure
In order to give an indication of the 
underlying earnings of the Group, 
certain items are presented in the 
middle column of the Consolidated 
Income Statement entitled “Other 
Items”. In 2010 these comprise:
● ● pre-operating losses of the Group’s 
Indian Joint Venture; 
● ● amortisation of acquired intangibles;
● ● movements in the valuation of 
derivative financial instruments;
● ● impairment of investment property; 
● ● partial release of a legal provision; 
and
● ● the associated tax impact of the 
above items together with the 
impact of future reductions in 
corporation tax rates on the Group’s 
deferred tax liability.
business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is 
accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of the acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of the 
fair values, at the date of exchange, 
of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree, plus any costs 
directly attributable to the business 
combination. The acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair 
value at the acquisition date.

investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which 
the Group is in a position to exercise 
significant influence, but not control 
through participation in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the 
investee. Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the 
investee but is not control over those 
policies.
The results and assets and liabilities 
of associates are incorporated in 
these financial statements using the 
equity method of accounting unless 
it meets the exceptions described in 
IAS 28. Investments in associates are 
carried in the balance sheet at cost as 
adjusted by post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of the net assets 
of the associate, less any impairment 
in the value of individual investments. 
Losses of the associates in excess of 
the Group’s interest in those associates 
are not recognised unless, and only to 
the extent that, the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations on 
behalf of the associates.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the Group’s share of the fair values 
of the identifiable net assets of the 
associate at the date of acquisition is 
recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency 
of the cost of acquisition below the 
Group’s share of the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets of the associate 
at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount 
on acquisition) is credited in the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the 
period of acquisition.
The Consolidated Income Statement 
includes the Group’s share of associates’ 
profit less losses while the Group’s 
share of the net assets of the associates 
is shown in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet.
Goodwill
Goodwill which is recognised as an 
asset is reviewed for impairment at least 
annually. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately as a loss and is not 
subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill is allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination. Cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated are 
tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication 
that the unit may be impaired. If 
the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss 
is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the 
unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. An 
impairment loss recognised for goodwill 
is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or 
jointly controlled entity, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 
the date of transition to IFRS has been 
retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts subject to being tested for 
impairment at that date. Goodwill arising 
prior to 1 January 1998 of £1,122,000 
was taken directly to reserves in the year 
in which it arose. Such goodwill has not 
been reinstated on the balance sheet.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition 
is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from construction contracts 
is recognised in accordance with 
the Group’s accounting policy on 
construction contracts (see below).
Interest income is accrued on a time 
basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest 
rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments 
is recognised when the shareholders’ 
rights to receive payment have been 
established.
Construction contracts
Profit is recognised on contracts, if the 
final outcome can be assessed reliably, 
by including in the income statement 
revenue and related cost as contract 
activity progresses. Revenue is calculated 
as the proportion of total contract value 
which corresponds to the proportion of 
costs incurred to date to total expected 
costs for that contract. Variations in 
contract work, claims and incentive 
payments are included in Revenue to 
the extent that there is appropriate 
certainty that they will be accepted by 
the customer and can be measured 
reliably.
Where the outcome of a construction 
contract cannot be estimated reliably, 
contract revenue is recognised to 
the extent contract costs have been 
incurred and it is probable they will 
be recoverable. Contract costs are 
recognised as expenses in the period in 
which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract 
costs will exceed total contract revenue, 
the expected loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately. 20155-04  27/04/2011 Proof 11

leases
Leases are classified as finance leases 
whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases.
Amounts payable under operating 
leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
Property, plant and equipment acquired 
under finance leases are capitalised 
in the balance sheet at fair value and 
depreciated in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policy. The capital 
element of the leasing commitment 
is included as obligations under 
finance leases. The rentals payable are 
apportioned between interest, which is 
charged to the income statement, and 
capital, which reduces the outstanding 
obligation.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging 
any restructuring costs, impairment and 
amortisation charges, gains or losses 
arising on the fair value of foreign 
exchange derivative contracts and 
after the share of results of associates 
and the impact of any movements in 
legal provisions but before investment 
income and finance costs.
Additionally, in 2010 we present an 
additional, non-statutory, heading, 
“Operating Profit before results of 
Associates” to assist in isolating the 
impact of the Group’s Indian Joint 
Venture. This also excludes the results of 
two other non-material Associates.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates two defined 
contribution pension schemes and costs 
of these schemes are charged to the 
income statement in the period in which 
they are incurred.
In addition, Atlas Ward, acquired on 
31 March 2005, has a defined benefit 
scheme which is now closed. The liability 
in respect of this scheme is the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation 
at the balance sheet date, less the fair 
value of the plan assets, together with 
adjustments for actuarial gains/losses.
The finance cost of liabilities and 
expected return of assets are included 
within administrative expenses in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
The actuarial gain/loss is charged 
through the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and is made up 
of the difference between the expected 
return on assets and those actually 
achieved, the difference between the 
actuarial assumptions for liabilities and 
actual experience in the period and any 
changes in the assumptions used in the 
valuations.
The pension scheme deficit is 
recognised in full and presented on the 
face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The associated deferred tax asset is 
recognised within the net deferred tax 
liability within non-current liabilities in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum 
of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on 
taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s 
liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be 
payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable profit, 
and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each balance sheet 
date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow 
all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. These are determined 
based on future changes in tax rates 
that have been enacted rather than 
simply future changes that have been 
proposed but not enacted. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to 
items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset when there is a legally enforceable 
right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority and the Group 
intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
dividends
Dividends are recorded in the Group’s 
financial statements in the period in 
which they are declared, appropriately 
authorised and no longer at the 
discretion of the Company.

Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings held for use in 
the production or supply of goods or 
services, or for administrative purposes, 
and plant and machinery are currently 
stated at cost in the balance sheet. 
Depreciation on buildings is charged to 
income.
Depreciation is provided on other 
property, plant and equipment to 
write off the cost of each asset over its 
estimated useful life at the following 
rates:
Freehold buildings/ 1% straight-line 
Investment properties
Plant and machinery 10% straight-line
Fixtures, fittings  10% written down
and office  value
equipment
Computer  20% straight-line
equipment 
Motor vehicles 25% written 
down  value
Site safety  20% straight-line
equipment
Assets held under finance leases are 
depreciated over their expected useful 
lives on the same basis as owned assets 
or, where shorter, over the term of the 
relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and is recognised in income.
investment property
Investment property, which is property 
held to earn rentals and/or for capital 
appreciation, is stated at the lower of 
cost or directors’ valuation. Depreciation 
will be charged annually based on 
the Group’s stated depreciation policy 
together with an annual impairment 
review. Where properties have been 
impaired below cost and are being held 
at directors’ valuation the directors have 
taken appropriate external guidance on 
the likely current value of properties. No 
investment properties have been subject 
to formal external valuation.
intangibles
The Group recognises intangible assets 
at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. Acquired 
intangible assets arise as a result of 
applying IFRS 3 which requires the 
separate recognition of intangible 
assets from goodwill on all business 
combinations from 1 January 2004.
Intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line over their useful economic 
lives as follows:
Amortisation 
period
Customer relationships 10 years
Brands 25 years
Know-how 10 years
Order book  18 months
(now fully amortised)
impairment of tangible  
and intangible assets  
excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the 
Group reviews the carrying amounts 
of its tangible and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, 
the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. An intangible 
asset with an indefinite useful life is 
tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for 
which the estimates of future cash flows 
have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset 
(or cash-generating unit) is estimated 
to be less than its carrying amount, 
the carrying amount of the asset (or 
cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which 
case the impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently 
reverses, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that 
the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment loss 
is recognised as income immediately, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at 
a revalued amount, in which case the 
reversal of the impairment loss is treated 
as a revaluation increase.
inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value. Cost 
comprises direct materials and, where 
applicable, direct labour costs and those 
overheads that have been incurred 
in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Net 
realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution. 20155-04  27/04/2011 Proof 11
72 Severfield—Rowen Plc Annual Report 2010
financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are recognised on the Group’s Balance 
Sheet when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are classified as loans 
and receivables, and therefore measured 
at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise 
cash in hand and demand deposits, 
and other short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible 
to a known amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and 
overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. 
Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption 
and direct issue costs, are accounted 
for in the income statement using 
the effective interest method and are 
added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are 
not settled in the period in which they 
arise. The effective interest method is a 
method of calculating the amortised cost 
of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest over the relevant period.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured 
at fair value, and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the 
Company are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group issues equity-settled share-
based payments. These share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually 
vest. The fair value determined is then 
expensed in the Consolidated Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. Details regarding the 
determination of the fair value of equity-
settled share-based transactions are set 
out in note 22.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the 
Group has a present obligation as a 
result of a past event, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle 
that obligation. Provisions are measured 
at the directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date, and 
are discounted to present value where 
the effect is material.
derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into certain foreign 
exchange forward contracts to manage 
its exposure to currency movements. 
Further details of derivative financial 
instruments are disclosed in note 21 to 
the financial statements.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair 
value at the date a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each 
balance sheet date. The resulting gain or 
loss is recognised in profit or loss.
2. Critical accounting judgements 
and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty
Key sources of estimation 
uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning 
the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance 
sheet date, that have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year, are also 
discussed below.
Revenue and margin recognition
The Group’s revenue recognition and 
margin recognition are central to the 
way the Group values the work it has 
carried out in each financial year. These 
policies require forecasts to be made of 
the outcomes of long-term construction 
contracts, which require assessments 
and judgements to be made on 
recovery of pre-contract costs, changes 
in work scopes, contract programmes 
and maintenance liabilities.
The Group applies rigorous internal 
control procedures over the 
determination of each of the above 
variables to ensure that profit take as at 
the balance sheet date and the extent of 
future costs to contract completion are 
reasonably and consistently determined.

Retirement benefit obligations
Details of the Group’s defined pension 
scheme are set out in note 30. The 
scheme has been valued in accordance 
with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. At 
31 December 2010 the defined benefit 
obligation recognised on the Group’s 
balance sheet was £8,532,000. The 
benefit obligation is calculated using 
a number of assumptions including 
increases in pension benefits, mortality 
rates and inflation and the future 
investment returns from the scheme’s 
assets. The present value of the benefit 
obligations is calculated by discounting 
the benefit obligation using market rates 
on relevant AA corporate bonds at the 
balance sheet date.
The scheme’s assets are valued at 
market rates at the balance sheet date. 
Effects of changes in the actuarial 
assumptions underlying the benefit 
obligation, discount rates and the 
difference between expected and actual 
returns on the scheme’s assets are 
classified as actuarial gains and losses.
Critical judgements in applying the 
Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies, which are described 
in note 1, management has made the 
following judgements that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements. 
Those judgements involving estimations 
are dealt with below.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible 
assets arising from acquisitions
Determining whether goodwill or 
associated intangible assets are impaired 
requires an estimation of the value in 
use of the cash-generating units to 
which these assets have been allocated. 
The value in use calculation requires 
the entity to estimate the future cash 
flows expected to arise from the cash-
generating unit and a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate present value. 
The carrying amount of goodwill at the 
balance sheet date was £54,712,000 
and of intangible assets arising from 
acquisitions was £20,495,000. No 
impairment adjustment has been made 
for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Impairment of investment property
In the absence of formal valuation, 
determining the carrying value of the 
Group’s investment property requires 
an assessment of fair value. The key 
factors considered by the directors in 
determining fair value are the possible 
open market valuation and rental yields 
on the property. The written down value 
of the Group’s investment property as at 
the balance sheet date was £4,000,000 
following an impairment charge of 
£2,073,000 made in the year. 20155-04  27/04/2011 Proof 11

Following adoption of IFRS 8, the Group has identified its operating segments as those upon which the Executive Committee regularly 
assesses performance.
The Group has deemed it appropriate to aggregate its operating segments into one reported segment. The constituent operating 
segments have been aggregated as they have businesses that have similar products and services, production processes, types of 
customer, methods of distribution, regulatory environments, and economic characteristics.
Revenue, which relates wholly to construction contracts and related activities in both years, originated from the United Kingdom.

On the Atlas Ward acquisition in 2005 6,571
On the Watson Steel Structures acquisition in 2001 161

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of goodwill are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use  
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the 
period. The directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the CGUs. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations on future changes 
in the market. It is anticipated that sales volumes in the UK will not increase materially over the next three years.
The Group prepares forecast cash flows based on the following years operating budget, approved by the directors, together with cash 
flows based on budgets for the following two years which are derived from the directors’ views on revenue prospects to the end of 2013 
(this equates to a compound annual growth rate from 2010 levels of 4%).  After this period, the growth rate applied to the cash flow 
forecasts is the projected economic growth rate for the industry. The cash flow forecasts have been discounted using a pre-tax discount 
rate of 9% (2009: 11%).
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test for the Fisher Engineering goodwill. A reduction in growth rates 
to 1% in 2012–13 and flat thereafter would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill being reduced to its carrying value of 
£48.0 million.  20155-04  27/04/2011 Proof 11

12. Property, plant and equipment, investment property continued
The Group operates a system of regular valuations of freehold and long leasehold land and buildings across its portfolio which have 
included using FPD Savills and Rushton International Chartered Surveyors who are independent valuers not connected to the Group. 
This operates on a rotational basis, with one of the four main properties reviewed each year. The four properties are the Severfield–
Reeve Structures Ltd site at Dalton Airfield Industrial Estate, the Watson Steel Structures Ltd site at Lostock Lane, Bolton, the Atlas Ward 
Structures Ltd site at Sherburn and the Fisher Engineering Ltd steel storage site at Enniskillen in Northern Ireland.
To date, no material surplus or deficit over net book value has been identified, and accordingly no adjustment to revalue freehold and 
long leasehold land and buildings has been considered necessary.
The net book value of the Group’s plant and machinery includes £Nil (2009: £Nil) in respect of assets held under finance leases.
The investment property represents land and buildings held in Leeds. The Group is receiving rental income on this property until the 
end of 2012 at a current rate of £378,000 per annum. This has been subject to an annual depreciation charge at 1% as required under 
the Group’s depreciation policy. As at 1 January 2010 the fair value of the property was £6,135,000. The directors have reviewed this 
carrying value as at 31 December 2010 and in view of the continued poor state of the property market and approaching end of the 
current lease consider an impairment charge to be appropriate. Following soundings over future divestment and leasehold potential a 
revised valuation of £4,000,000 is now considered appropriate. No independent valuation by an appropriately qualified surveyor has 
been obtained.

During the year ended 31 December 2005 the Board reviewed the investment of long-term loans outstanding from Fabsec Ltd of 
£614,000 and concluded that there was an element of doubt over the collection of this loan in the short to medium term. Consequently, 
after considering the net liabilities of Fabsec Ltd, a provision of £543,000 was made against the debt. This provision remains in place at 
31 December 2010.
Additionally, on 3 February 2006 Severfield–Reeve Structures Ltd entered into a 50/50 joint venture agreement with Murray Metals 
Group Ltd to form Steel UK Ltd, a company involved in steel buying activities. To date, both parties have continued to purchase steel 
through the individual companies and no trade has passed through Steel UK Ltd. The share capital invested by the Group is a nominal 
sum of £50. Steel UK Ltd is registered in England.

The average credit period taken on revenue, calculated on a count-back basis to make appropriate allowance for monthly revenue 
phasing, is 70 days (2009 (as reanalysed): 61 days). No interest is charged on receivables.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit rating to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines 
credit limits by customer. It is Group policy that adequate credit insurance is taken out on all customers to manage the exposure that 
may arise as the contractual work proceeds. Accordingly, no bad debt provisions are held or expenses incurred. However, a credit 
insurance committee has now been established to review situations where adequate credit insurance on the Group’s customers cannot 
be purchased in the present economic climate.
Due to the nature of the business involving applications for payment, contractually overdue amounts within trade and other receivables 
are limited to retentions. The Group has rigorous procedures in place for monitoring and obtaining settlement of retentions in a prompt 
manner. Amounts overdue at 31 December 2010 in respect of retentions were £227,000 (2009: £148,000). 85

At 31 December (13,199) (14,516)
The deferred tax assets reducing the deferred tax liability relate to 27% (2009: 28%) of the Group’s deficit on its defined benefit 
retirement scheme of £8,532,000, the valuation of financial instruments and other timing differences.
Unprovided deferred tax amounted to £71,000 (2009: Nil).
The Government announced in June 2010 that it intended to reduce the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 24% over four years, and 
the Finance Act 2010, which was substantively enacted in July 2010, includes provisions to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 27% 
with effect from 1 April 2011. Accordingly, deferred tax balances have been revalued to the lower rate of 27% in these accounts, which 
has resulted in a credit to the Consolidated Income Statement of £488,000.
On 23 March 2011 the Government announced that it intends to further reduce the rate of corporation tax to 26% with effect from 
1 April 2011 and then by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014. As this legislation was not substantively enacted by 31 December 
2010, the impact of the anticipated rate change is not reflected in the tax provisions reported in these accounts. If the deferred tax assets 
and liabilities of the Group were all to reverse after 1 April 2014, the effect of the changes from 27% to 23% would be to reduce the net 
deferred tax liability by approximately £1,900,000. To the extent that the deferred tax reverses more quickly than this the impact on the 
net deferred tax liability will be reduced.
21. financial instruments
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to stakeholders. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to 
equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Gearing ratio
The Board of Directors reviews the capital structure of the Group on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, it considers the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows:
 2010 2009
 £000 £000
Borrowings (18,629) —
Cash and cash equivalents 3,589 11,548
Net (debt)/funds (15,040) 11,548
Equity 130,943 132,475
Net debt to equity ratio 11.5% Nil%
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the parent. There are no externally imposed capital 
requirements.

Derivative financial instruments (108) (147)
The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into 
Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
● ● Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
● ● Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
● ● Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Derivative financial instruments are the only instruments valued at fair value through profit or loss, and are valued as such on initial 
recognition. These relate to foreign currency forward contracts measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves 
matching the maturities of the contracts. These derivative financial instruments are categorised as level 2 financial instruments. Except 
for derivative financial instruments, the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost in the 
financial statements and are considered to approximate their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents
This comprises cash held by the Group and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of 
these assets approximates their fair value.
General risk management principles
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. A formal risk 
assessment and management framework for assessing, monitoring and managing the strategic operational and financial risks of the 
Group is in place to ensure appropriate risk management of its operations. Internal control and risk management systems are embedded 
in the operations of the divisions. 20155-04  27/04/2011 Proof 11

21. financial instruments continued
financial risks and management
The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. Risk management is governed by the 
Group’s operational policies, which are subject to periodic review by the Board of directors.
Credit risk
The Group’s primary exposure to credit risk arises from the potential for non-payment or default from construction contract debtors. 
The degree to which the Group is exposed to this credit risk depends on the individual characteristics of the contract counterparty 
and the nature of the project. The Group’s credit risk is also influenced by the general macroeconomic conditions. The Group does 
not have significant concentration of risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract customers at the reporting date with 
them being spread across a wide range of customers. Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, it is normal practice for customers 
to hold retentions in respect of contracts completed. Retentions held by customers at 31 December 2010 were £12,966,000 (2009: 
£14,789,000).
The Group manages its exposure to credit risk through the application of its credit risk management policies which specify the minimum 
requirements in respect of the credit worthiness of potential customers, assessed through reports from credit agencies, and the timing 
and extent of progress payments in respect of contracts. In addition, before accepting any new customer adequate credit insurance 
is taken out as reported in Note 17. Where credit insurance is difficult to acquire, the credit insurance committee (comprising T G 
Haughey, P A Emerson and A D Dunsmore) convenes to determine the appropriate exposure for the Group to take with a customer.
The Group manages the collection of retentions through its post-completion project monitoring procedures and ongoing contact with 
customers so as to ensure that potential issues that could lead to the non-payment of retentions are addressed as soon as they are 
identified.
Amounts outstanding from construction contract customers are due with reference to the payment terms for each particular contract but 
the majority would be receivable within four months from the end of the reporting period. Amounts due for settlement after 12 months 
are disclosed in Note 16.
liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. The ultimate 
responsibility for liquidity risk rests with the Board.
The Group generates cash through its operations and aims to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stress conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the 
Group’s reputation. Forecast and actual cash flow is continuously monitored.
Borrowings represent the Group’s revolving credit facility from the Royal Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale Bank Plc, a member of 
National Australia Bank Group jointly which provides credit support of up to £40 million at an interest rate of 2.25% or 2.75% above 
LIBOR subject to the ratio of Group net debt to EBITDA. This facility was renewed in March 2010 and is available for three years

market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in credit risks described above, in foreign currency exchange rates 
and interest rates. The Group has entered into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk.
Market risk exposures are monitored and are supplemented by sensitivity analysis. There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to 
market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
f oreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of currency risks by using derivative financial instruments when appropriate to hedge these 
risk exposures against contracted sales. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board 
of Directors. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments including derivative financial instruments, for speculative 
purposes.
The carrying value of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:
 Liabilities Assets
 2010 2009 2010 2009
 £000 £000 £000 £000
Euro 97 (356) 2,065 3,575
US dollar — — 1,348 11
 97 (356) 3,413 3,586
f oreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is only significantly exposed to the euro and US dollar.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against the relevant foreign currencies. 
10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding 
foreign currency denominated monetary items and derivative financial instruments, and adjusts their translation at the period end for 
a 10% change in foreign currency rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the sterling 
strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% weakening of the sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an 
equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.
 US dollar currency impact Euro currency impact
 2010 2009 2010 2009
 £000 £000 £000 £000
Profit or loss and equity 414 293 91 399
The Group’s sensitivity to euros has decreased in 2010 due to the reduced amount of work in the Republic of Ireland.
At present the Group’s translation exposure to the Indian Rupee via its Indian Joint Venture is not significant. Going forward, as the 
business grows, this exposure is expected to become more significant.
f orward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover future euro and US dollar currency receipts on 
relevant contracts.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had forward exchange contracts held for the sale of 1.20 million euros (2009: 6.78 million euros)
and 8.49 million US dollars (2009: 6.40 million US dollars) at an average exchange rate of 1.1657 euros (2009: 1.1504 euros) and
1.5720 US dollars (2009: 1.6045 US dollars) to the pound and maturing within 12 months of the year end. 91

interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as described under the borrowings paragraph earlier in this note. The Group does not 
currently hedge any of its interest rate exposure.
interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date. For floating rate 
liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the gross amount of liability outstanding at balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole 
year. A 0.5% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31 December 
2010 and the Group’s equity at that date would decrease by £150,000 (2009: £25,000). This is attributable to the Group’s exposure to 
interest rates on its variable rate borrowings. If the £40 million facility is fully utilised the exposure increases to £200,000.
The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period due to the increase in the level of borrowings in the year. 
Current indications are that the level of Group borrowings will increase further during 2011 but remain within current facility limits.
22. Share-based payments
The Group operates a share-based incentive scheme open to all employees of the Group although the current intention is that 
only the Company’s executive directors (being both Main Board directors and certain members of the Executive Committee) and 
selected senior employees will participate in the scheme. Further details are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 
58. The Group recognised a total charge of £nil in the year (2009: charge of £626,000) with a corresponding entry to reserves.
Performance Share Plan
The vesting of awards is subject to performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee. Four awards had been granted to 
31 December 2010:
● ● During 2007 the Remuneration Committee granted 65,827 ordinary shares of 10p each at nil value to the executive directors. 
Following the 4:1 share split in October 2007 these converted to 263,308 ordinary shares of 2.5p each. These shares vested 
during 2010.
● ● During 2008 the Remuneration Committee granted a further 34,112 ordinary shares of 2.5p each at Nil value to the executive 
directors. These awards will not vest in 2011 by reference to the EPS performance over the performance period.
Company’s EPS performance over the performance period % of award vesting
Equal to less than RPI + 18% 0%
Equal to RPI + 18% 25%
Equal to RPI + 50% or better 100%
Between RPI + 18% and RPI +50% Pro rata between 25% and 100%
The Black–Scholes pricing model has been used to measure the fair value of the shares granted. The assumptions used in the model are as follows:
Share price on date of grant £3.1675*
Exercise price Nil
Expected volatility (using historic performance) 50%
Risk-free rate 5%
Dividend 20.0p
Expected percentage options exercised versus granted Nil
Actual life three years
* Granted on 30 April 2008.
The Black–Scholes model produced, using the above assumptions, an annual charge of £Nil. 20155-04  27/04/2011 Proof 11

22. Share-based payments continued
● ● During 2009 the Remuneration Committee granted a further 599,151 ordinary shares of 2.5p each at Nil value to the executive 
directors. The vesting of these awards will be dependent on the Company’s earnings per share performance over the three year 
period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011, with the following vesting schedule to apply:
Company’s EPS performance for year ending 31 December 2011 % of award vesting
Equal to less than 25.0p 0%
Equal to 30.0p 25%
Equal to 40.0p or better 100%
Between 25.0p and 30.0p Pro rata between 0% and 25%
Between 30.0p and 40.0p Pro rata between 25% and 100%
The Black–Scholes pricing model has been used to measure the fair value of the shares granted. The assumptions used in the model are 
as follows:
Share price on date of grant £1.53*
Exercise price Nil
Expected volatility (using historic performance) 50%
Risk-free rate 5%
Dividend 15.0p
Expected percentage options exercised versus granted Nil
Actual life three years
* Granted on 4 February 2009.
The Black–Scholes model produced, using the above assumptions, an annual charge of £Nil.
● ● During 2010 the Remuneration Committee granted a further 793,072 ordinary shares of 2.5p each at Nil value to the executive 
directors. The vesting of these awards will be dependent on the Company’s earnings per share performance over the three year 
period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012, with the following vesting vesting schedule to apply:
Company’s EPS performance for year ending 31 December 2012 % of award vesting
Equal to less than 25.0p 0%
Equal to 35.0p or better 100%
Between 25.0p and 35.0p Pro rata between 0% and 100%
The Black–Scholes pricing model has been used to measure the fair value of the shares granted. The assumptions used in the model are 
as follows:
Share price on date of grant £2.04*
Exercise price Nil
Expected volatility (using historic performance) 50%
Risk-free rate 5%
Dividend 10.0p
Expected percentage options exercised versus granted Nil
Actual life three years
* Granted on 5 March 2010.
The Black–Scholes model produced, using the above assumptions, an annual charge of £Nil.
 Share incentive Plan
During 2010 the Group implemented a Share Incentive Plan for Group employees. As part of the scheme 202,384 new ordinary shares 
of 2.5p were issued which are being held in trust for a three year period on behalf of 973 Group employees. The vesting of these 
awards will be subject to continued employment for each of the relevant employees. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the 
Group before the options vest. The share price on the date of issue of the shares (29 October 2010) was £2.41 and the fair value was 
measured based on the market price of the shares at the date of grant. The aggregate of the estimated values of the awards granted in 
2010 is £488,000. A charge of £35,000 was recognised in the current year in relation to the Share Incentive Plan.

the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The total cost charged to income of £1,458,000 (2009: £2,124,000) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group 
at rates specified in the rules of the plans. As at 31 December 2010, contributions of £118,000 (2009: £294,000) due in respect of the 
current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
defined benefit schemes
Atlas Ward has a defined benefit scheme which is now closed to new members. 
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 5 April 
2008 by Mr Christopher Hunter, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related 
current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.

When investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long-term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on 
such assets at the balance sheet date. A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments, which is based more on realistic future 
expectations than on the returns that have been available historically. The overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is then the 
average of these rates taking into account the underlying asset portfolio of the pension plan.

Severfield—Rowen Plc Annual Report 2010 102
We have audited the parent company 
financial statements of Severfield–Rowen 
Plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 
which comprise the Company Balance Sheet 
and the related notes 1 to 15. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company financial 
statements:
● ● give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2010;
● ● have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; 
and
● ● have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the parent company 
financial statements.
matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters where the Companies Act 
2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
● ● adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
● ● the Parent Company financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
● ● certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
● ● we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group 
financial statements of Severfield–Rowen 
Plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 
and on the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.

Severfield—Rowen Plc Annual Report 2010 104
1. Significant accounting policies
basis of accounting
The separate financial statements 
of the Company are presented as 
required by the Companies Act 2006. 
They have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, as modified 
by the revaluation of freehold and long 
leasehold properties, and in accordance 
with applicable UK accounting standards 
(UK GAAP).
 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors 
have formed a judgement at the time 
of approving the financial statements 
that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason 
the directors continue to adopt a going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The key factors considered 
by the directors in making the statement 
are set out within the Financial Review 
on pages 22 to 24.
Profit and loss account
In accordance with the exemption 
allowed by section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company has 
not presented its own profit and loss 
account.
Cash flow
The Company is exempt from the 
requirements of Financial Reporting 
Standard No. 1 (Revised) “Cash Flow 
Statements”.
Tangible fixed assets
Freehold and long leasehold land is held 
at cost and not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided on other fixed 
assets to write off the cost of each asset 
over its estimated useful life at the 
following rates: 
Freehold buildings 1% straight-line
investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at 
cost less provision for impairment.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation 
tax and foreign tax, is provided 
at amounts expected to be paid (or 
recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on 
timing differences which result in an 
obligation at the balance sheet date 
to pay more tax, or a right to pay less 
tax, at a future date, at rates expected 
to apply when they crystallise based 
on current tax rates and law. Timing 
differences arise from the inclusion 
of items of income and expenditure 
in taxation computations in periods 
different from those which they are 
included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing 
differences arising from the revaluation 
of fixed assets where there is no 
commitment to sell the asset, or on 
unremitted earnings of subsidiaries 
and associates where there is no 
commitment to remit these earnings. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is regarded as 
more likely than not that they will be 
recovered. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based payments
Share-based payments are accounted 
for as described in the Group 
accounting policies on page 72.
Related Party Transactions
The Company has taken advantage of 
the exemption granted by paragraph 
3(b) of FRS 8 (Related Party Disclosures) 
not to disclose transactions with other 
Group companies.

The Company’s freehold and long leasehold land and buildings includes those which are occupied and used by some of the Company’s 
subsidiary undertakings.
The Company operates a system of regular valuations of freehold and long leasehold land and buildings across its portfolio which have 
included using FPD Savills and Rushton International Chartered Surveyors. This operates on a rotational basis, with one of the three main 
properties reviewed each year. The three properties are the Severfield–Reeve Structures Ltd site at Dalton Airfield Industrial Estate, the 
Watson Steel Structures Ltd site at Lostock Lane, Bolton and the Atlas Ward Structures Ltd site at Sherburn. 
To date, no material surplus or deficit over net book value has been identified, and accordingly no adjustment to revalue freehold and 
long leasehold land and buildings has been considered necessary.

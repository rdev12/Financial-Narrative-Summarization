“The Group performed well in 2014, delivering in line with expectations  
against a backdrop of a steep decline in oil price towards the end of the year.  
We will continue to help customers increase productivity in their new projects  
and existing operations. In line with our focus on customer efficiency, we are  
also implementing internal cost and efficiency measures to ensure we remain  
competitive. We will remain a reimbursable, asset light business with a balance of 
opex and capex activities, a broad range of longer term contracts and significant 
customer and geographic diversification. As we look to 2015, we expect financial 
performance to demonstrate the relative resilience of our business in a challenging 
market and we will see the full year benefit from completed acquisitions.”

Introduction
In May, following the retirement of Allister Langlands, I was delighted 
to be appointed non-executive Chairman of Wood Group; a business 
with tremendous people, a comprehensive range of value adding 
services, and operating in a market with strong long-term fundamentals, 
notwithstanding the current lower oil price environment.
Markets
In 2014, we saw the anticipated reduction in capex by many operators as 
they looked to increase efficiency on capital projects although some areas, 
such as independents in North America and NOCs, generally continued 
to increase expenditure. Towards the end of 2014 we witnessed a decline 
in the oil price. The impact of this and actions we are taking as a result are 
addressed in this report.
Dividend
The Group performed well in 2014, delivering in line with expectations. 
In February 2014, we outlined our expectation of an increase in the 
2014 dividend by around 25%. The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 18.6 cents per share, which makes a total distribution for 
the year of 27.5 cents, an increase of 25%. Reflecting our confidence 
in longer term growth, our intention remains to increase the US dollar 
dividend per share for 2015 onwards by a double digit percentage.
Board changes
Allister Langlands retired as Chairman in May having held the role since 
2012, being CEO prior to that from 2007 and deputy CEO from 1999.
He was an excellent leader of Wood Group and the Board, and we are 
grateful for his extraordinary contribution. 
In November, we announced that Alan Semple, our long serving  
Chief Financial Officer (CFO), will retire from the Board in May 2015. 
David Kemp will succeed Alan in the role of Group CFO. David joined  
the Group in 2013 as Wood Group PSN CFO and has demonstrated 
sound judgement, financial acumen and knowledge in his role.  
Also in November, we announced a new role of Chief Operating Officer 
(COO) in recognition of the increasing breadth of the Group’s operations 
and longer term growth potential. Robin Watson, currently CEO of  
Wood Group PSN, will take on this role during the first half of 2015. 
Mike Straughen, Group Director of Health, Safety, Security and 
Environment (HSSE), retired from the Board in June 2014. Mike served 
on the Board since 2007, initially as Chief Executive of Wood Group 
Engineering. He oversaw impressive growth in the Group’s Engineering 
business globally and made a significant contribution in leading the Group 
HSSE function. At the AGM in May, Michel Contie will also step down from 
the Board, having served for 5 years as a non-executive director.
Outlook
We will continue to be directed by our Core Values. We will focus on 
helping customers increase productivity and efficiency in new projects 
and existing operations and extend asset lives, while recognising safety 
as the number one priority. In conjunction with our focus on customer 
efficiency, we are also implementing internal cost and efficiency 
measures to ensure we remain competitive. 
We will remain a reimbursable, asset light business with a balance 
of opex and capex activities, a broad range of longer term contracts 
and significant customer and geographic diversification. As we look 
to 2015, we expect financial performance to demonstrate the relative 
resilience of our underlying business in a challenging market and we 
will see the full year benefit from completed acquisitions.

"In May, following the retirement of Allister

non-executive Chairman of Wood Group; 
a business with tremendous people, a

Financial 
The Group performed well in 2014, delivering EBITA of $549.6m up 
3.1% and AEPS of 99.6c up 1.0% in line with expectations, against a 
backdrop of increased focus on efficiency by operators and a decline in 
oil price in the 4th quarter. The Group’s financial performance reflected 
the impact of completed strategic acquisitions and our diversified 
portfolio of geographic markets, customers and services which 
positioned the Group well to benefit from areas of growth such as the 
US onshore market. Overall, the results reflect strong growth in Wood 
Group PSN Production Services more than offsetting the anticipated 
reduction in Wood Group Engineering and weaker performance in 
Turbine Activities. 
Our strong balance sheet provides us with both security and flexibility.  
In early 2015 we extended our $950m bilateral borrowing facilities to 
2020 and achieved a material improvement in pricing. Also in 2014, we 
issued $375m of unsecured notes in the US private placement market, 
which further diversified our funding and extended the maturity profile. 
Average net debt during the year was $416.4m including JVs, and net 
debt at the year-end on a similar basis was $295.7m, around the lower 
end of our stated preferred range of 0.5x-1.5x net debt to EBITDA.
Operational
In 2014, we continued to deliver our strategy underpinned by our focus on 
safety, organic growth, collaboration, acquisitions and risk management.
The safety of our people and those affected by what we do is our top 
priority. In 2014, across our workforce we had no fatalities and our  
total recordable case frequency (TRCF) and our lost work case frequency 
(LWCF) measures both showed improvement in the year. 
In August, we appointed a new Group Head of HSSE, Nina Schofield, 
to continue our focus on improvement and further developing assurance 
across the Group.
Organic growth has accounted for close to 70% of the Group’s growth 
since IPO and remains a primary objective. As such we continued to 
enhance our approach and processes in 2014, identifying and securing 
opportunities across our business through over 2,000 individual 
contract awards. Our order book relative to future sales is at the lower 
end of 6-9 months in our Engineering business and over 12 months in 
Wood Group PSN Production Services. 
Collaboration has been an important focus area in the year. Working 
together as a Group developing the strong relationships we have with 
our customers has increased our pipeline of opportunities and we have 
secured several contracts including ExxonMobil in Malaysia, Tatweer in 
Saudi Arabia and Cabinda in Angola, which we do not believe would 
otherwise have been possible.
In 2014, we have seen the full year benefit of the successful acquisitions 
of Elkhorn in the US and Pyeroy in the UK, both of which have delivered 
notable growth since acquisition in 2013. We invested a further $217.3m 
on M&A in the year. We acquired Sunstone, a Calgary based pipeline 
consultancy; Cape Software, a Texas based training and process 
simulation company; Meesters, a specialist fabrication business in the 
Bakken shale region; Agility Projects AS, an offshore greenfield and 
brownfield company in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea; and in 
December we acquired Swaggart, a provider of civil construction and 
fabrication services in in the US. We also entered into a joint venture 
with Siemens, called EthosEnergy, in May, to improve the longer term 
positioning of our less differentiated Turbine Activities. 
CEO’s review
“The Group performed well in 2014 
reflecting the impact of completed 
strategic acquisitions and our  
diversified portfolio of geographic 
markets, customers and services.” Financial statements Governance Strategic report
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 7 6
Our risk profile remains key to how we manage the business and 
establish an appropriate balance of through-cycle resilience with  
upside potential. We strive to maintain a diversified portfolio of 
geographic markets, customers and services. We are an asset light 
people business with significant flexibility, and around 60% of our 
revenues are customer opex driven relating to existing production.  
We are also a primarily reimbursable business with around 95% of 
Group revenue on this basis.
Reaction to a lower oil price environment
We are taking a number of actions in the lower price environment. 
Firstly, we are increasing our business development focus, highlighting 
how we can help our customers achieve their objective of reduced 
cost and increased efficiency. The lower oil price brings challenges 
for our customers, and we are in active discussions with them to 
assess how we can work together to improve performance from new 
and existing assets and reduce costs without affecting the safety or 
the integrity of the assets they operate. We are implementing plans 
to maintain and increase our own efficiency to ensure our ongoing 
competitiveness. This will continue to emphasise the importance 
of collaboration across Wood Group; management of our people 
utilisation levels; a range of short-term and longer-term actions 
designed to manage and reduce cost; and increased focus on 
credit risks. Our internal focus on efficiency is anticipated to lead 
to cost reductions and deferrals of over $30m in comparison to 
2014. Alongside this, we will continue to look to make value adding 
acquisitions that are consistent with our strategy but will apply tougher 
filters on these acquisitions reflecting the macro environment.

Wood Group Engineering
In Wood Group Engineering, revenue increased by 7.3%, EBITA 
decreased by 5.7% and EBITA margin fell by 1.5pts to 10.9%, reflecting 
lower margins in Upstream. Subsea & Pipelines and Downstream continued 
to perform well, however performance overall was impacted by the 
anticipated lower contribution from Upstream, which saw growth in 
onshore activity but was impacted by a reduction in US offshore and in 
Canadian oil sands.
Our Upstream business accounted for around 40% of Engineering 
revenue. Following the substantial completion of our scope on Mafumeira 
Sul and Ichthys in 2013 and the deferral of a number of projects as clients 
reassessed larger developments, we saw a slower pace in the award of 
significant replacement detailed offshore engineering contracts in 2014. 
Notwithstanding this, we remained active on detailed engineering for 
offshore work including Det Norske’s Ivar Aasen, Anadarko Heidelberg 
and Hess Stampede which was awarded towards the end of the year; 
benefitted from onshore work in the US; and saw a greater volume of early 
stage project work than in previous years. We believe our involvement in 
early stage project work can significantly improve overall costs and is an 
encouraging indicator of customers turning to engineering to improve 
capital efficiency.
The acquisition of Agility Projects AS, with whom we had worked 
previously on the Ivar Aasen contract, completed in September 2014. 
The acquisition of Agility strengthens our offshore greenfield offering and 
adds a brownfield platform engineering capability in the Norwegian sector 
of the North Sea.

Wood Group Engineering
Subsea & pipelines represented around 40% of Engineering revenue.
Performance in our subsea business has been led by good activity from 
our UK business, supporting projects in Africa, the Middle East and the 
Caspian. This included activity with BP on Shah Deniz and Tullow on the 
TEN project in Ghana where we have been providing services including 
engineering and project management support. In Australia, we are seeing 
the anticipated move to a higher proportion of brownfield activity as 
current greenfield projects, such as Gorgon, are completed. Our onshore 
pipelines business benefitted from US shale related pipeline work.
Downstream, process & industrial activities accounted for around 20%  
of revenue. We have seen some benefit of brownfield and greenfield work 
in refining and chemicals markets, in part due to the continued benefit of 
lower gas prices in the US.
Outlook
We remain well positioned to unlock value for clients and influence 
overall project costs through the delivery of high quality engineering.
While the current oil price poses challenges for customers, we are 
confident that the Engineering market will strengthen in the longer term, 
with the greater volume of early stage projects in Upstream providing an 
encouraging indicator of future activity.

Production Services
Wood Group PSN’s Production Services activities delivered strong growth, 
with revenue up 16.0% and EBITA up 30.4%. This increase is primarily 
attributable to performance in the Americas, led by higher margin US shale 
related activity, including the benefit of Elkhorn acquired in December 
2013, and growth in the North Sea business.
In 2014, the Americas accounted for around 40% of Production 
Services revenue. Our US onshore activities, which are predominantly 
shale related, grew significantly, contributing over $1bn in revenue and 
were the largest contributor to Production Services EBITA. Our shale 
activities include well site preparation, infrastructure development and 
production related operations & maintenance and around 55-60% are 
opex related. We strengthened our service offering in 2014 with the 
addition of Meesters, a specialist fabrication business in the Bakken 
region and the acquisition in December of Swaggart, a civil construction 
and fabrication services business. 
Our opex focused North Sea business accounted for 40% of revenue  
and remained robust, benefitting from growth in Pyeroy, acquired in 2013.  
We secured contract renewals worth in excess of $1.5bn which help 
maintain our leading position and provide good visibility, including  
multi-year contracts with Talisman Sinopec, BP and Enquest for the 
provision of engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance 
services. We have seen a continued focus by customers on their costs in the 
North Sea and have responded by delivering a number of solutions including 
implementing two cuts to contractor rates in May and December, which 
together reduce these costs to customers by around 20%. We continue 
to work with our customers to safely deliver production optimisation, asset 
life extension and operating cost management programmes which are 
becoming increasingly important in this mature basin.
Internationally, we have secured and commenced work on a number 
of important contracts. These include EPCM services for Woodside in 
Australia and ExxonMobil in Malaysia, and brownfield engineering and 
procurement support work for ExxonMobil in Papua New Guinea.  
In the Middle East we are seeing expansion in Iraq with BP and Taqa.  
We anticipate fully exiting our contract with PDO in Oman in mid-2015.
Outlook
Our focus on production related activity significantly weighted towards 
customer opex will provide relative resilience in a more challenging 
market in 2015. We currently see opportunities for growth in a number 
of areas in 2015 including the Middle East, Africa and Australasia, and 
we will benefit from the recent Swaggart acquisition in the US where we 
see a good longer-term market for our shale activities.
Turbine Activities
Our Turbine Activities comprise the two joint ventures with Siemens, 
EthosEnergy (Ethos) and RWG, and our joint venture with TransCanada, 
TransCanada Turbines (TCT) (together “Turbine JVs”). Turbine Activities 
also included the legacy Dorad EPC contract in 2014 and the Dorad and 
GWF contracts in 2013.
In Turbine JVs, revenue fell 8.7% and EBITA fell 38.0% largely due to 
performance in Ethos, which was adversely impacted by lower EPC 
project work, and in the other JVs’ overall which were impacted by lower 
volumes in certain engine types. 
On the Dorad contract we have reached agreement with the customer 
over a final settlement position. The contract generated a profit overall, 
with a loss recognised in 2014 of $11.4m.
Outlook
In 2015 we expect to see some recovery in performance in the Turbine 
JVs, led by EthosEnergy where the focus will be on actions to improve 
performance, including the delivery of synergies. Following a review of 
lump sum & fixed price contracts in 2013, we will not pursue fixed price 
EPC contracts of equivalent size and complexity to Dorad.

"Like for like" trading performance
The “like for like” pro forma performance of the Group, adjusting for 
acquisitions and on a constant currency basis, is shown below. The 2013 
results have been restated to include the results of acquisitions made in 
2013 (Elkhorn and Pyeroy in Wood Group PSN Production Services and 
Intetech in Engineering) as if they had been acquired on 1 January 2013 
and also to apply the average exchange rates used to translate the 2014 
results. The 2014 results have been restated to exclude the results of 
acquisitions made in 2014 (Meesters and Swaggart in PSN Production 
Services and Cape, Sunstone and Agility in Engineering).

Amortisation 
The amortisation charge for 2014 including joint ventures on a proportional 
basis of $101.2m (2013: $102.1m) includes $61.0m (2013: $57.6m) of 
amortisation relating to intangible assets arising from acquisitions. Of this 
amount $27.7m (2013: $38.5m) is in respect of the 2011 acquisition of 
PSN and $21.4m (2013: $8.5m) relates to the acquisitions of Elkhorn and 
Mitchells. Amortisation in respect of software and development costs was 
$40.2m (2013: $44.5m) and this largely relates to engineering software 
and ERP system development. 
Included in the amortisation charge for the year above is $2.3m (2013:

In January 2014, the Group finalised a settlement agreement in respect 
of a contract taken over by the Venezuelan national oil company, PDVSA, 
in 2009. A gain of $58.4m has been recorded in the income statement. 
$5.5m of the settlement relates to a minority shareholder.
Further restructuring charges of $7.5m have been recorded in the year 
in relation to the decision made in 2013 to exit certain markets in  
Wood Group PSN’s Americas business.
In December 2013, the Group provided $28.0m in respect of Wood Group 
PSN’s contract in Oman. The provision has been reassessed at the end 
of 2014 with $9.7m of the provision being released and credited to 
exceptional items.
Transaction related costs of $23.0m are in respect of EthosEnergy in 2014 
and are discussed below.
EthosEnergy Transaction 
On 6 May 2014 we entered a joint venture with Siemens, EthosEnergy, 
to improve the longer-term positioning of our less differentiated Turbine 
Activities. Whilst Wood Group has a 51% shareholding in the new entity, 
all significant decision making requires unanimous consent from both 
shareholders. Wood Group does not have control and the business is 
therefore accounted for as a joint venture. 
The initial transaction was accounted for as follows:

Financial review continued
The value of the investment in EthosEnergy at 31st December 2014 
reduced to $360.2m, reflecting the post-tax results of EthosEnergy for 
the 8 months and foreign exchange losses on the retranslation of the 
underlying net assets.
In respect of cash received and receivable of $157.4m, under the joint venture 
agreement Wood Group received a 51% ownership interest in EthosEnergy 
and EthosEnergy was required to pay Wood Group $70.0m, of which 
$21.0m was paid in May 2014. In addition, $37.6m was paid by EthosEnergy 
in respect of post close adjustments for working capital and indebtedness at 
the date of formation with a further $49.8m payable in future periods.
Foreign exchange losses of $7.0m which were recorded in the currency 
translation reserve in prior periods in relation to the businesses transferred 
into EthosEnergy have been recycled through the income statement as 
required by IAS 21.
Transaction costs include legal fees and other costs associated with the setup 
of the joint venture, accelerated share based charges and a provision for 
liabilities which the Group has retained as part of the joint venture agreement.
An impairment review was carried out in December 2014 based on the 
latest budgets and forecasts for EthosEnergy. The review was based 
on the budgeted and forecast cash flows for the business and showed 
headroom of $32m using a 15% pre-tax discount rate and a 3% terminal 
growth rate. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the basis that the 
expected long-term growth rate falls to 2% and the pre-tax discount rate 
increased by 1% in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible 
changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review. The analysis 
showed that a 1% reduction in growth rate resulted in $1m of headroom 
and a 1% increase in the discount rate resulted in a $10m shortfall.
Management view is that the investment in EthosEnergy is not impaired, 
in part recognising that the management team of EthosEnergy have clear 
plans to improve performance. The carrying value will continue to be 
monitored going forward.
Taxation 
The effective tax rate on profit before tax and exceptional items including 
joint ventures and discontinued operations on a proportionally consolidated 
basis is set out below.
2014 
$m
2013 
$m
Profit from continuing operations before 
tax (pre-exceptional items)

Tax charge (pre-exceptional items) 115.5 113.4
Effective tax rate on continuing 
operations (pre-exceptional items)
27.2% 27.5%
The tax charge above includes $14.0m in relation to joint ventures  
(2013: $10.9m).
Going forward we expect the medium term effective tax rate on a similar 
basis to remain around 27.5%.
The effective tax charge under equity accounting is 23.8%. The pre-tax 
profit number used to compute this figure includes the post-tax 
contribution from joint ventures and as such we do not consider this  
to be a meaningful measure.
Earnings per share 
Adjusted diluted EPS for the year was 99.6 cents per share  
(2013: 98.6 cents). The average number of fully diluted shares used in 
the EPS calculation for the period was 375.2m (2013: 373.5m).
Adjusted diluted EPS adds back all amortisation. If only the amortisation 
related to intangible assets arising on acquisition is adjusted and no 
adjustment is made for that relating to software and development costs, 
the figure for 2014 would be 91.8 cents per share (2013: 90.0 cents).
Dividend
In February 2014, we signalled our confidence in the longer-term outlook 
for the Group and expectation of increasing the dividend in 2014 by 
around 25%, and our intent to increase the US dollar value of dividend per 
share paid from 2015 onwards by a double digit percentage.
In line with our policy, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 18.6 
cents per share, an increase of 25%, which, when added to the interim 
dividend of 8.9 cents per share makes a total distribution for the year of 
27.5 cents per share (2013: 22.0 cents), an increase of 25%. The dividend 
is covered 3.6 times (2013: 4.5 times) by adjusted earnings per share.
Since IPO the Group has increased the dividend by an equivalent of 20% 
per annum compound.
Cash flow and net debt 
The cash flow and net debt position below has been prepared using

Cash generated from operations pre-working capital increased by $77.1m 
to $650.9m and post-working capital increased by $62.8m to $571.4m.
The majority of the higher working capital outflow of $79.5m in 2014 was 
due to increased receivables. This was caused in part by higher levels of 
activity and in part by an increase in average days sales outstanding in 
2014 to 58 days from 54 days in 2013. Financial statements Governance Strategic report
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 13 12
Expenditure on acquisitions of $262.9m (2013: $290.4m) includes 
$217.3m relating to the acquisitions of Agility, Sunstone, Meesters, 
Cape and Swaggart. $40.8m relates to payments made in respect of 
companies acquired in prior periods and $4.8m relates to the acquisition 
of minority shareholdings.
Payments for capex and intangible assets were $110.2m (2013: $135.4m) 
and included investment in plant and infrastructure related to our US 
shale expansion, the ongoing requirement for updated design software in 
relation to the Engineering businesses, plus our continued development of 
our ERP systems across the Group.
Tax paid is lower in 2014 due to the timing of instalment payments in 
certain jurisdictions. Payments for interest, dividend and other are lower in 
2014 as a result of the purchase of shares by the employee share trusts in 
2013, offset by higher dividend payments in 2014.
Summary Balance Sheet
The balance sheet below has been prepared using equity accounting for 
joint ventures, and as such does not proportionally consolidate the joint 
ventures assets and liabilities.
Dec  
2014 
$m 
Dec  
2013

Non-current assets 2,739.6 2,276.3
Current assets 1,647.3 2,052.7
Current liabilities (1,093.9) (1,267.4)
Net current assets 553.4 785.3

the parent
2,546.2 2,407.4
Non-controlling interests 13.1 8.9
Total equity 2,559.3 2,416.3
The increase in non-current assets during the year is largely related to 
the investment in EthosEnergy, goodwill and other intangible assets 
added in relation to acquisitions made, and expenditure on property, 
plant and equipment.
The reduction in net current assets during the year is also largely related to 
the investment in EthosEnergy, offset by higher receivables as noted in the 
cash flow commentary above.
Capital efficiency
Net debt (including our share of JV net debt) to Total EBITDA was 0.5 
times (2013: 0.5 times). The Board would generally expect net debt to 
EBITDA to be in a range of around 0.5 to 1.5 times going forward and to be 
typically below 1.0 times. There was no material change to the closing net 
debt to EBITDA figure if adjusted for the pro forma impact of acquisitions. 
To the extent that the Group has financial capacity which is surplus to 
the anticipated needs for acquisitions and organic growth, and giving 
consideration to market conditions, the Group would look to return this to 
shareholders through share buy backs or special dividends.
The Group’s Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”)
5
 including Turbine JVs 
reduced from 19.4% to 17.7% due to higher average working capital, 
combined with higher goodwill and other intangible assets recognised 
on acquisition and the lower EBITA margin achieved in 2014.
The Group’s ratio of average Operating Capital Employed to Revenue 
(OCER)
6
 including JVs worsened from 15.6% to 16.2%, as average 
operating capital grew at a faster rate than revenue. This was primarily due 
to higher average working capital in Wood Group PSN and Wood Group 
Kenny, offset by a reduction in Wood Group Mustang.
Pensions
The majority of the Group’s pension arrangements are on a defined 
contribution basis. The Group operates one UK defined benefit scheme 
which had 1,167 deferred, pensionable deferred or pensionable members 
at 31 December 2014. The scheme was closed to future accrual at 30 
June 2014. A past service gain of $6.7m arose as a result of the closure of 
the scheme and this amount has been credited to administrative expenses 
in the income statement.
At 31 December 2014 the scheme had a deficit of $27.0m (2013: $41.2m) 
before recognition of a deferred tax asset of $5.4m (2013: $9.1m). 
In assessing the potential liabilities, judgment is required to determine the 
assumptions around inflation, investment returns and member longevity. 
The reduction in the deficit from 2013 was due to the closure of the 
scheme to future accrual and the payment of additional contributions by 
the Group during the year, offset by actuarial losses. 
Full details of pension assets and liabilities are provided in note 29 to the 
Group financial statements.
Acquisitions
During the year the Group completed the acquisitions of Meesters, 
a specialist fabrication business based in the Bakken shale region in 
North Dakota, Cape Software, a Texas based provider of simulation 
software and services for industrial control systems used by the oil & 
gas and other process-based industries, Sunstone Projects, a pipeline 
consulting company providing engineering, procurement and construction 
management services to clients in the Canadian oil & gas industry, 
Agility Projects, a Norwegian engineering, procurement, construction 
management, installation and commissioning company and Swaggart 
Brothers, an Oregon-based provider of civil construction and fabrication 
services to the US oil and gas and other sectors. The initial cost of these 
acquisitions amounted to $217.3m, net of cash and borrowings acquired.
Wood Group PSN Production Services performance in the year was 
impacted by provisioning against receivables in its US business, which also 
benefited from credits resulting from a release of deferred consideration 
provisions relating to prior period acquisitions. The release was in part 
related to provisions taken, and the overall impact was not material.
Footnotes 
1 Total EBITA represents operating profit including JVs on a proportional basis of $486.0m 
(2013: $431.4m) before the deduction of amortisation of $101.2m (2013: $102.1m) 
and exceptional income of $37.6m (2013: $0.5m) and is provided as it is a key unit of 
measurement used by the Group in the management of its business.
2 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“AEPS”) is calculated by dividing earnings before 
exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax, by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period, excluding shares held by the Group's employee share 
ownership trusts and adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
3 Number of people includes both employees and contractors at 31 December and 
includes our proportional share of joint ventures.
4 Interest cover is EBITA divided by the net finance expense. 
5 Return of Capital Employed (“ROCE”) is Total EBITA divided by average capital 
employed calculated using proportional consolidation.
6 Operating Capital Employed to Revenue (OCER) is the average operating capital 
employed (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (excluding intangibles 
recognised on acquisition), inventories and trade and other receivables less trade and 
other payables) divided by total revenue. John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 15 14
Safety & Assurance
Safety & Assurance is our top priority because lives depend on it.  
We passionately care about the safety of our people and behave as 
safety leaders. We are committed to preventing injuries and ill health to 
our people and those we work with so everyone returns home safely. 
In 2014 we delivered measurable improvement in Health, Safety, 
Security and Environment (HSSE) performance, based on our key 
performance indicators. Across our workforce of 42,000 employees we 
had no fatalities and our lost work case frequency (LWCF) showed a 
36% improvement on 2013 performance. We also had positive progress 
in our total recordable case frequency (TRCF) with a 23% improvement.
We launched our Safe Home vision which communicates our belief that all 
accidents are preventable. In support of Safe Home, we also implemented 
our Life Saving Rules which were established following a detailed review of 
critical activities that presented the highest risk of harm to our people. The 
nine rules set out the minimum standard that must be met to ensure the 
safety of our people when performing tasks in these areas.
Wood Group’ s security team worked across the business to ensure that 
security risks were identified and addressed prior to starting new operations. 
The security team is structured to provide regional expertise, which included 
recent enhancements to our security management capability and capacity.
A new Group head of HSSE was appointed with a focus on further 
developing HSSE assurance across Wood Group.
The 2015-2017 HSSE Strategic Plan aims to build on our strong 
foundation, while at the same time recognising the challenges that a 
business of significant breadth and diversity presents and the impact that 
this brings to the HSSE system as a whole. The Plan is centred on six 
core strategic objectives that focus on: robust processes and systems; 
competent people; inspiring leadership; risk understanding, management 
and assurance; and ensuring learning from previous events.
Our Core Values
Relationships
Our business depends on healthy relationships with customers, 
business partners and suppliers.
We have a well balanced portfolio of customers from international oil 
companies, independents and national oil companies. Our track record 
in developing strong relationships is based on working closely with our 
customers in the safe delivery of their business goals. 
This is underlined by the fact that we secured over 50 contract 
extensions and 11 contract renewals in 2014, 3 of which are long-term 
contract extensions with key operator clients in the North Sea.  
Our diverse customer base means that our top 10 customers typically 
generate less than 40% of total Group revenues and our top customer 
generates less than 10%.
Our high win rate is achieved through the strong long-term relationships 
we have fostered with our clients. One of our biggest contract wins 
this year for Wood Group PSN, at a value of $750m, was with BP , 
a company we have worked with globally for more than 40 years, 
testament to the partnership we have established.
Our strength is in helping customers to become more efficient and 
effective and we are committed to growing those relationships based 
on delivery; providing quality, consistency and strong alignment on 
health and safety. Our flexibility and adaptability in today’s continually 
changing business environment is a key differentiator.
Collaboration within the Group has helped secure new contracts in 
Asia Pacific with global operators with whom we have well established 
relationships, utilising the competence and capability of the Group to 
fulfil the needs of customers.
Our Core Values are at the heart of our business because they define who we are, how we work, 
what we believe in and what we stand for. Our Core Values set out how we act and how we expect 
to be treated as part of Wood Group and provide a sound basis to make decisions.

Social Responsibility
Being socially responsible is integral to what we do. We aim to make a 
positive difference to the communities where we operate and seek ways 
to assist them. We focus principally on the areas of health, education, 
poverty and environment.
In 2014, we joined the London Benchmarking Group, an organisation 
whose members strive to measure their company's overall contribution 
to the community, taking account of cash, time and in-kind donations, 
as well as management costs. This will enhance our measurement 
framework and our ability to assess the quality and effectiveness of our 
social responsibility Core Value.
Our charitable and community support is an important part of our 
social responsibility and includes support for educational programmes 
in various locations around the world. Alongside the ongoing support 
for two flagship charities this year, the Vine Trust in Tanzania and 
the ARCHIE Foundation in the UK, we have supported other local 
initiatives. These include our support for the Clontarf Foundation in 
Australia, which improves education and employment prospects for 
young Aboriginal men and our support to the Cardiff High School in 
Houston. We also supported a wide range of local projects that our 
people care passionately about through our Employee Community 
Fund programmes in Aberdeen and Houston and will extend these 
programmes in 2015. 
We manage environmental risks within our business by aligning and 
certifying our environmental management systems to ISO14001 and 
we drive heightened environmental awareness through HSE alerts and 
environmental initiatives. 
In 2014 we continued our investment in a sustainable property portfolio 
for improved working conditions and energy efficiency within key 
strategic hubs including Melbourne, Australia and Houston, Texas. 
Building work also started for Wood Group's new Southern campus 
location in Aberdeen.
Our annual Environmental Day saw activities across the globe ranging 
from ‘switch off’ campaigns and informative presentations, to local area 
cleans and garden planting. The Nigg oil terminal in the north east of 
Scotland ran a community event to demonstrate the tight environmental 
controls we have on the site of specific scientific interest to conserve 
locally protected species. 
We continue to develop our engineering, production support and 
renewable energy expertise to help reduce our customers’ 
environmental impact. SgurrEnergy, our renewable energy consultancy, 
has assessed over 110GW of renewable energy developments 
internationally covering on and offshore wind, solar, hydro, wave 
and tidal and bioenergy. EcoMax, a gas turbine optimisation system, 
enables analysis to optimise gas turbine operations while complying 
with environmental law. 
We are supporting our clients within the US Gulf of Mexico with 
Safety and Environmental management systems (SEMS) compliance 
requirements.
In 2015 we will revise our environmental strategy to reinforce our 
commitment on minimising the impact of our activities and ensure 
compliance with upcoming UK ESOS (“Energy Savings Opportunity 
Scheme”) legislation.

Methodology
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) data gathered to fulfil our 
requirements, and emission factors from the UK Government’s 
GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2014. In a 
few instances, where data was not available, estimation of data 
has occurred to best reflect an accurate view of those sources 
included in the reporting.  John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 17 16
Core Values continued
People
People are the heart of our business. We are professional, high performing 
team players focused on delivering and drawing on our global expertise. 
As we seek to expand our global business we strive to make the best use 
of talent, representing wider communities and stakeholders. As a global 
group with over 42,000 people working in more than 40 countries, we are 
committed to attracting, developing and retaining the best people from 
different backgrounds and cultures, creating a dynamic workforce that can 
apply diverse perspectives and backgrounds to competitive advantage. 
To operate at the highest levels we need to invest in our people wherever 
they are located and whatever role they hold. Our extensive training and 
development programmes are designed to help them learn new skills and 
refine existing ones. Our approach to early careers is an investment in the 
future of the Group with over 120 graduates and apprentices recruited 
into these programmes in 2014. The planned approach to developing 
talent from within the organisation ensures we have the capability to meet 
our current and future business needs.
Talent management is a key priority for our business; we recognise 
that in succession planning for the future, we need to ensure we have 
leaders who understand our global business and who exemplify our 
leadership principles. Supporting our succession planning process, 
our management and supervisory development programmes help our 
people further develop their own skills and prepare for progression in 
their own careers. In addition to internal programmes, there are a range 
of courses provided locally to focus on personal development, specific 
job related skills and vocational and professional qualifications. 
During 2014 we have continued our focus on driving consistency, 
fairness and transparency in the way we reward and incentivise our 
people. We have simplified our approach to annual bonus plans and 
long-term incentives, and aligned our approach to employee benefits in 
key geographical locations. 
To retain and attract the best people, we recognise the need to offer 
challenging and exciting opportunities. During 2014, we enhanced 
processes to allow our people to effectively move around the world and 
throughout our businesses to deliver their full potential.
How we interact with people is crucial and our Human Rights Policy 
which can be found here (www.woodgroup.net/policies/documents/
people/human_rights.pdf) is key to this. We are committed to protecting 
and enhancing the human dignity of all Wood Group personnel and 
everyone who has dealings with the Group worldwide.
Innovation
Innovation gives us competitive advantage. 
In Wood Group we foster a culture of innovation and improvement 
which enables us to unlock or increase value for our customers. In order 
to promote and embed this culture we have a Group-wide Innovation 
Network who take the role of technology thought leaders to unearth blue 
sky thinking which has the potential to become a commercial reality.
More immediately, our continued focus on internal and external cost 
savings stimulates innovation as we look for improvement and efficiency. 
Our internal framework accommodates and encourages the pursuit of 
new ways of working as we work with our customers to overcome the 
challenges that the lower oil price environment presents.
Collaborating with our clients in the search for new ways of working in 
2014 has led to notable innovation successes, the benefit of which has 
been passed onto our customers.
An example of this was the installation of an innovative tank solution for 
Esso Australia by Wood Group PSN which achieved a work schedule 
saving of 18 weeks, capex savings of over $2m and significantly reduced 
projected maintenance costs. 
Again in Wood Group PSN we worked alongside a client on a North Sea 
project where we simplified processes and delivered a fit for purpose 
plant design more suitable for late life operation. This work was part of 
a strategy to help recover a further 35 million barrels of oil from mature 
fields and enhance one of the region's oldest platforms.
Wood Group Kenny's Integrity Management business developed a 
risk-based ROV inspection programme that aims to save approximately 
30% in inspection resources. The team is also developing software tools 
to access and analyse online field measurements, saving thousands of 
hours a year in manual processing, allowing more efficient review and 
decision making based on key performance indicators.
Attention to detail by the Process Plants & Industrial unit in Wood Group 
Mustang led to the development of a more automated application for 
accurate material procurement, improving on the solution offered to 
clients from a perspective of schedule, budget and quality.
Innovation is usually associated with the creation of cost savings 
however alongside these, there can be other benefits. The decision to 
use a Cyberhawk ROAV (Remote Operated Aerial Vehicle) to carry out 
a detailed structural inspection of the drilling derrick on Brent Delta was 
a significantly safer solution than traditional rope access methods and 
removed the need for a 3 week shutdown.

Financial Responsibility
We expect to receive fair reward for our business performance. 
Our financial responsibility Core Value covers five key topics: receiving  
fair reward for what we do; managing financial risk; communicating 
financial performance responsibly; and looking after our own and our 
customers’ costs.
As a primarily reimbursable business, there is transparency in the reward 
we receive. The receipt of fair reward allows us to invest in our people 
and our business. In turn this allows us to improve the service to our 
customers. An example of this is the investment in ERP systems to 
enhance and consolidate our back office capabilities as a step towards 
increased efficiency and improved service to customers.
Financial risk is reviewed by the Board alongside all risks twice a year. 
The business is continually assessing financial risks as part of its normal 
operations. We have Group-wide accounting, treasury and tax policies 
that underpin our approach to managing financial risk. As a move to lower 
our financial risk we adopted a new policy effective in 2014, to limit our 
exposure to fixed price or lump sum work to less than 15% of revenues. 
Key to our business and operations are the flows of information. We regularly 
communicate our financial performance in a clear and concise manner. 
Throughout the year we seek feedback from investors, analysts and 
financial media. This takes the form of roadshows, conferences and also 
one-to-one sessions. In 2014, we held a capital markets day focused 
on Wood Group PSN Production Services, which provided a valuable 
insight for investors, analysts and lenders into the structure, scope, risks 
and opportunities in the business. This was delivered by operational 
management and gave attendees the opportunity to ask questions 
around the content and enabled discussion with extended management 
after the event. 
Managing our customers’ costs is crucially important, particularly in an 
environment of increased focus on efficiency. By working alongside our 
customers at the start of a project we believe that we have the potential 
to significantly reduce the overall cost of the project or extend asset life. 
Our next Annual General Meeting, to be held on 13 May 2015, will 
provide an opportunity for shareholders to raise any questions they  
may have with the Board. 
Integrity
We are proud of our reputation, built over many years, which depends 
on us doing the right thing. 
Our Business Ethics Policy highlights the importance of conducting 
business ethically and legally. Our Business Ethics Committee oversees 
the implementation of this policy and our business ethics compliance 
programme. The Committee comprises senior managers from across 
the Group and is chaired by Robbie Brown, Company Secretary.  
Its members appoint the Group’s Responsible Officers, senior business 
leaders who, liaising with a number of designated Country Officers, 
promote ethical conduct across the business. We use various forms 
of communication and training, both in-person and through electronic 
media, to embed the Integrity message across the Group.
Compliance with the Business Ethics Policy is mandatory for our 
directors, officers and employees, as well as all contractors, consultants, 
representatives, intermediaries and agents retained by Wood Group. It is 
updated regularly, and is available in nine languages. 
Over 5,000 designated business ethics personnel were required to 
undertake on-line training and confirm their continued compliance in 2014. 
Business ethics personnel are identified based on a range of roles and 
responsibilities, including those who liaise with customers and third parties.
We recognise that the use of third party intermediaries increases our 
exposure to corruption risks. Our Commercial Intermediaries Policy requires 
pre-appointment due diligence to be undertaken, as well as on-going 
post-appointment monitoring and audit. In addition to commercial sales 
representatives, the policy also applies to those who assist in securing 
business permits, licenses, visas, work permits, clearances or waivers on 
behalf of Wood Group. 
Using our external, confidential, multi-lingual Business Ethics helpline, 
anyone, anywhere, can raise a concern, or report a suspected violation 
of the Business Ethics Policy. We investigate violations or complaints and 
take necessary action. A register of matters is maintained by the Group’s 
Chief Compliance Officer and the Board receives regular updates. During 
2014 we conducted a number of internal investigations into allegations of 
unethical behaviour. Appropriate disciplinary action was taken based on 
the facts and circumstances, including the dismissal of four employees 
and two other cases where an employee left during or immediately upon 
completion of an investigation.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Wood Group’s Core Values provide a sound basis on which to make decisions and assist us in 
considering the broad spectrum of risks and uncertainties that can impact operational and financial 
performance across the Group. The risks below include the principal risks faced by the Group during 
the year which were included in the Board review process carried out during February 2015.
Effective risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management which is fundamental to the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic objectives.
Our Core Values
The effective management of risk is necessary across all aspects 
of our business model, and our Core Values provide our people, 
customers and suppliers with a clear view of how we operate which 
helps frame the risk culture across the Group.
Operations
Our people across our business operations are at the forefront 
of effective risk management. The risk profile across each of our 
segments varies through the nature of our activities, specific customer 
contracts and geographic spread, and each segment operates under 
an established policy and procedural framework which supports our 
corporate attitude to risk.
Monitoring & Review
The Board formally reviews risk management and internal control  
arrangements twice a year, usually in February and August, and 
through the course of the year the Board will consider current and 
emerging risks facing the Group. 
Our leadership teams review specific activities designed to monitor key 
risks. This is an ongoing process and we are continually seeking to 
enhance our risk monitoring and reporting tools.
Assurance
Various assurance mechanisms are utilised across the Group such as 
peer reviews on certain significant or higher risk contracts as well as a 
programme of risk based audits performed by the Group Internal Audit 
function. This work complements business specific activity in areas such 
as Safety, HR and Quality. 
2014 Developments 
We continue to review our approach to risk management and seek to 
improve associated internal control processes. Some of the more recent 
developments introduced in 2014 include:
 X the introduction of Group-wide Life Saving Rules to help prevent 
the risk of reoccurring accidents
 X an updated Commercial Intermediaries Policy to support revised 
procedures in relation to the selection, appointment and monitoring 
of commercial intermediaries who may represent Wood Group 
 X the update of impact and likelihood definitions used to assess risks 
to ensure greater consistency of risk assessment across the Group Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Letter from the Chairman 
of the Board
Dear Shareholder
During 2014 the Group achieved a significant milestone in the evolution 
of its governance environment and Board composition. 
In May, I succeeded Allister Langlands, becoming the Group’s first 
independent non-executive Chairman, having served as a non-executive 
director since 2006. Allister held the role since 2012, being CEO prior to 
that from 2007. Our principal shareholders unanimously supported the 
Board’s decision to appoint Allister to the role, to provide continuity at the 
top level over the period of transition of executive leadership to Bob Keiller, 
who was appointed CEO in November 2012. My proposed appointment 
was discussed and recommended by the Nomination Committee and 
represents a natural evolution in the Group’s stewardship.
At the beginning of the year, the Group’s strategy was reviewed by the 
Board which agreed a strategic framework to help define the Group’s 
focus and risk appetite. This framework was reviewed by the Board later 
in the year which reaffirmed the Group’s longer term growth ambitions 
in the context of more immediate and significant reductions in customer 
spending which are covered in more detail elsewhere in this annual report.
During the year, the Nomination Committee was also engaged in the 
search for a new non-executive director with strong listed company 
financial experience which ultimately resulted in the appointment of Jann M 
Brown in May, previously Managing Director and CFO of Cairn Energy.  
The review of executive succession planning was a key focus of the 
Committee in 2014. In 2014, Alan Semple expressed a desire to retire after 
19 years with the Group and will be succeeded in May 2015 by David 
Kemp, previously Wood Group PSN CFO. Recognising the breadth of 
the Group’s operations and its longer-term growth potential, we also 
appointed Robin Watson to a new role as chief operating officer (“COO”). 
Michel Contie has informed the Board that he will not seek re-election 
at the AGM and the Committee is considering the future succession 
needs of the Board in the light of this. The Board will continue to comprise 
a majority of independent directors after Michel steps down and we remain 
committed to ensuring that the Board retains an appropriate balance 
of skills, diversity, experience and personalities. In particular, we have 
made progress on addressing the under-representation of women on 
the Board, up from 1/11 (9%) in 2013 to 2/10 (20%) at the year end and 
increasing to 22% following Michel’s retirement. 
The Board is supported by a number of Committees in addition to the 
Nomination Committee, which bring appropriate insight to the Board’s 
deliberations and ensure that the long-term interests of the Group are met. 
Our Safety & Assurance Committee established in May 2013, and 
chaired by Tom Botts, oversees the management of Safety & Assurance, 
consistent with its status as the Group’s top priority. During the year, 
the Group’s new head of HSSE, Nina Schofield joined the Committee, 
replacing Mike Straughen who retired in August 2014. 
In 2014, Jann Brown was appointed as Chair of the Audit Committee. 
Jann brings considerable oil & gas, international finance and financial 
markets experience to the role. The Committee, operating under its 
charter, met four times in the year and their report includes additional 
detail on the primary areas of financial reporting judgement considered in 
relation to the 2014 financial statements and how they were addressed. 
The Remuneration Committee has considered several changes to 
executive remuneration for 2014/15 in line with our longer term approach 
of simplifying the Group’s remuneration arrangements. As a result, 
2015 long-term incentive awards will be based on Group level targets 
only; 20% of any vested long-term incentives award will continue to be 
deferred for a further 2 years, resulting in 5 years in total; and in line with 
best practice the annual bonus and long-term incentive scheme rules 
were revised to ensure the inclusion of appropriate clawback provisions. 
More information within the Directors' Remuneration Report will also be 
provided on performance against targets for 2014.
Following a successful period of transition amongst the executive 
leadership, I feel the Board is now very well placed to ensure continued 
challenge, debate and effective decision making in the best long-term 
interests of the Group.

long-term interests of the Group.” Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and 
the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). The Group and parent 
company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
 X select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
 X make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
 X state that the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, and with regard to the parent  
company financial statements that applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and, hence, for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 
24 and 25, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
 X the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in  
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group, and
 X the directors’ report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the significant risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information  
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. Relevant information is 
defined as ‘information needed by the Company’s auditors in connection 
with preparing their report’. Each director has taken all the steps that he 
ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information. 
Statement of Compliance
The Board remains fully committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance and believes that this is key to overall performance 
and integrity, consistent with our Core Values. This section of the 
annual report explains how the Group has applied the main principles of 
Leadership, Effectiveness, Accountability, Remuneration and Relations with 
shareholders outlined in the Governance Code. A copy of the Governance 
Code is available at www.frc.org.uk. The directors consider that the 
Company has fully complied with the provisions of the Governance Code 
during the year ended 31 December 2014. The Board considers that 
the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.  
The Board also believes that good corporate governance extends beyond 
regulatory compliance and consistently monitors developments in best 
practice, including guidance published by investor groups. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 5 to 20. The financial position of the Group, 
its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the Financial Review on pages 10 to 13. In addition, note 17 to the 
Group financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management 
objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and 
its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with the cash 
inflows generated from its existing activities as set out in notes 13, 15 
and 26 to the Group financial statements. As a consequence, the  
directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully. Having made the appropriate enquiries including a 
review of cash flow projections and key sensitivities, the directors consider, 
in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Governance 
Code), that the business is a going concern. Adequate resources exist for 
the Group to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Group and the parent company financial statements.

Corporate 
governance
What is the role of the Board?
The Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved for its 
consideration and approval. These include responsibility for Group 
strategy, the annual budget, significant acquisitions, risk management 
and the overall system of internal control. Executive management is 
responsible for the implementation of Board decisions in these areas 
and all other aspects of managing the business. A typical Board agenda 
is set out below. 
What is the composition of the Board?
The Board comprised 10 or 11 directors at various times during the year. 
At all times the non-executive directors comprised a majority of the Board 
(excluding the Chairman) as recommended by the Governance Code. 
A clear separation of the roles of the Chairman and the CEO has 
been agreed by the Board, in compliance with the Governance Code. 
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of 
the Board. He chairs the Board meetings, ensures the agendas are 
appropriate and is responsible for facilitating that all directors actively 
contribute to the determination of the Group’s strategy. The CEO 
is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Group and 
implementation of the Group's strategy, develops proposals for Board 
approval, and ensures that a regular dialogue with shareholders is 
maintained. Executive Board Members report directly to the CEO. 
Are the Board members independent?
After careful consideration, the Board considers all of its non-executive 
directors to be independent in character and judgement and, other than 
set out below, that there are no relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement. Brief biographies 
of the directors appear on pages 24-25. 
Jeremy R Wilson was a senior adviser to J.P .Morgan on a part-time basis 
to October 2014. The Company has a material business relationship with 
J.P .Morgan and J.P .Morgan Cazenove, who act as joint corporate broker, 
adviser and lender to the Company. Having considered whether his role at 
J.P .Morgan could affect his judgement as a director of the Company, the 
Board continues to believe that Jeremy is independent in character and 
judgement and, accordingly, has determined that he is an independent 
non-executive director for the purposes of the Governance Code. 
How does the Board manage risk?
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management which is fundamental to the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic objectives. Clear risk management is required in all 
aspects of our objectives as outlined on pages 18-20.
What is a typical Board agenda?
Review of reports from Board Committees - Safety & Assurance, Audit and Remuneration, CEO report, operations updates and functional 
updates - HR, IT&S and Finance (including Tax & Treasury and Investor Relations). The Board also receives a series of management 
presentations and has the opportunity for site visits through the year.

environment including the implications of the reduction in oil price in the second half of the year. In addition, the Board evaluation process and 
potential acquisitions, including the acquisition of Agility Projects (now WG Mustang Norway), were discussed. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Are Board members standing for re-election?
All directors, other than Alan G Semple and Michel Contie, will seek 
re-election at the 2015 AGM.
How does the Board discharge its responsibilities?
There were six scheduled Board meetings during 2014, plus two 
unscheduled meetings. Four of the meetings were scheduled over two 
days and were held in Aberdeen, London and Houston. Safety & Assurance 
is always the first item on the agenda at Board meetings. The Board 
received detailed presentations from senior management within the Group’ s 
businesses during the year, each including updates on Safety & Assurance. 
The Executive Directors attended 12 Group Executive Committee meetings 
throughout the year which include reports and discussions on HSSE, 
operational issues, finance, legal, business ethics, investor relations 
and human resources matters. In addition, divisional CEO’s conduct 
Quarterly Review Meetings with senior managers within their division. 
These meetings are also normally attended by the Group CEO and the 
Group CFO. In addition to Board meetings, a summary of the Group’s 
financial performance is made available to the Board on a monthly basis. 
The directors have access, via a secure intranet site, to presentations from 
the Group’s brokers which contain investors’ feedback, copies of relevant 
regulations, analyst research and appropriate administrative information. 
How is the Board’s performance evaluated?
The Board completed a formal evaluation of its own performance and 
of its Committees, individual directors, and of the Chairman during the 
year. In accordance with paragraph B.6.2. of the Governance Code, the 
Board retained Lintstock Limited (Lintstock) as advisers to facilitate the 
Board evaluation process. The evaluation involved directors completing 
detailed questionnaires, the results of which were analysed by the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary and presented by way of a report 
for discussion both at Board meetings in October and December 2014 
and in separate meetings between each director and the Chairman. 
The non-executive directors, facilitated by Lintstock and led by the senior 
independent director, were responsible for the performance evaluation of 
the Chairman, taking into account the views of the Executive Directors. 
Key areas covered by the Board evaluation were the effectiveness of the 
Board and Committee meetings, individual director performance and 
assessment of the Chairman, and the nature & extent of the Board’s 
interaction with the management of the Group. The main observations 
from the evaluation were:
 X A desire to continue to expand the Board's discussion of 
strategic considerations, industry trends and market factors, 
which will be reflected in the Board schedule by ensuring that 
more time is available at Board meetings for these deliberations
 X A request to review the extent of any duplication in reporting which 
is being addressed through ongoing review of the meeting process
 X A desire to continue the Board’s review of senior management 
succession planning, which was subsequently considered 
at the Board’s meeting in December 2014.
Lintstock have no other connection to the Company. 
How are conflicts of interest dealt with?
The Board requires directors to declare any appointments or other 
situations which would amount to a possible conflict of interest. 
The Board has procedures in place to deal with and, if necessary, 
approve any such conflicts. 
What training do the Board members receive?
The training needs of directors are periodically discussed at Board 
meetings and briefings arranged on issues relating to corporate 
governance. Arrangements are in place for newly appointed directors to 
undertake an induction process designed to develop their knowledge 
and understanding of the Group’s business. This includes briefing 
sessions during regular Board meetings, visits to Group operating sites 
and discussion of relevant business issues. Upon their appointment, 
directors are advised of their legal and other duties and their obligations 
as directors of a listed company and under the Companies Act 2006. 
All directors are encouraged to attend relevant external seminars.  
There is a procedure for any director to take independent professional 
advice at the Group’s expense and all directors have access to the 
services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that 
the Board’s procedures are followed. 
Stewardship – how does the Board engage with  
shareholders?
Our investor relations activities are led by the Group’s CEO and CFO, 
supported by the investor relations team and other members of senior 
management as appropriate. We provide the opportunity for significant 
shareholders to meet with the CEO and CFO twice a year around the 
interim and final results announcements. Our investor relations team 
organises ad-hoc meetings with management, manages capital markets 
day presentations for investors and analysts and maintains an ongoing 
dialogue with the financial community through analyst relationships.

Internal control
The Board has established an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, that has been 
in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of this 
annual report. The process is regularly reviewed by the Board and is 
in accordance with the September 2012 edition of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Group, for the purposes of applying the Code, 
comprises John Wood Group PLC, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Any system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the ongoing procedures, which the directors have 
established to review the effectiveness of the system of internal control on 
an annual basis, are listed below. As a result of these ongoing procedures 
the Board’s assessment was that the internal control environment was 
operating effectively.
Overall control environment:
The Group has a clear organisational structure for the control and 
monitoring of its businesses, including defined lines of responsibility and 
delegation of authority. The Group has issued policies which define the 
standards of business conduct and include Accounting; Contract Risk 
Management and Review; Health, Safety, Security and Environment; 
and Business Ethics. A Group Business Ethics helpline, operated by an 
independent third party, is in place to enable staff and third parties to 
raise concerns in confidence about possible noncompliance with the 
Group’s Business Ethics Policy.
Monitoring of the internal control systems: 
The Board has agreed certain reporting procedures to monitor key risk 
areas on an ongoing basis, including safety, legal and financial matters. 
The Audit Committee has been delegated the responsibility to review the 
effectiveness of the internal financial control systems implemented by 
management. It is assisted by the internal auditors and, where appropriate, 
the external auditors. Where the internal or external auditors identify any 
significant deficiencies in the financial internal control system, a plan of 
action is agreed to remedy these and progress against them is tracked and 
reported with updates provided to the Audit Committee as necessary.  
The Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly reports to the Board on their 
discussions. During the year, specific control deficiencies were identified 
within a business in relation to project controls and the documentation of 
customer approval of work orders. We have subsequently put in place 
additional procedures and management resources to strengthen the control 
environment in that business.
Information and communication:
The Group has a comprehensive system for reporting performance to 
the Board. This includes monthly and quarterly reports. The quarterly 
reports include a detailed financial review against budgets and revised 
forecasts. The executive directors also receive detailed monthly financial 
reports and meet on a monthly basis to discuss financial performance 
and other operational matters. In addition, each division holds Quarterly 
Review Meetings (QRMs) involving discussions with senior managers 
and certain of the executive directors. The CEO and the CFO normally 
attend the QRMs.

Committees of the Board 
The Board has delegated some of its responsibilities to Committees – the Safety & Assurance Committee, the Nomination Committee, the 
Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee. A summary of the Committees' work is set out below and the report of the Remuneration 
Committee is included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 32-44. The Charters of the Board’s Committees are available on the 
Group’s website. Attendance by directors at the meetings of the Board and its Committees is summarised below. The dates of future Board 
meetings have now been agreed until the end of 2016.  Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Nomination Committee
“We adapted the proceedings of the Nomination Committee 
to reflect its transition to a wholly non-executive membership 
and met five times during the year to consider Board and 
Committee appointments and to understand and  
challenge proposals for executive succession planning 
and appointments.”
Ian Marchant 
Chairman, Nomination Committee
Who is on the Nomination Committee?
The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman and all of the 
independent non-executive directors. Allister Langlands, previously 
Chairman, retired from the Board and the Committee on 14 May 2014. 
Safety & Assurance Committee
“The Safety & Assurance Committee is responsible for 
overseeing the Group’s management of Safety and  
Assurance (including personal security), consistent with  
its status as the Group’s top priority” 
Thomas M Botts 
Chairman, Safety & Assurance Committee
Who is on the Safety & Assurance Committee?
The Committee comprises Thomas M Botts, Chairman, Michel Contie, 
Mary L Shafer-Malicki and Bob Keiller. In addition, Nina Schofield joined 
the Committee in August 2014, replacing Mike Straughen. 
How does the Committee discharge its 
responsibilities? 
The Committee meets at least twice a year, and has written terms of 
reference (which are available on the Group’s website) setting out its 
responsibilities. 
Main responsibilities are to review and make recommendations to the 
Board regarding:
 X the Group’s Safety & Assurance strategy and performance
 X the effectiveness of the Group’s policies and systems, 
and evidence of a prevalent safety culture
 X Safety leadership development throughout the 
Group, particularly in frontline operations
 X the quality and integrity of the Group’s internal and external 
reporting of Safety & Assurance performance and issues
 X the Group’s preparedness for response to 
a major safety or security incident
 X the process for and outcomes of investigations into major 
safety and security incidents and the effectiveness with which 
recommendations are assimilated throughout the Group
 X the expertise and appropriateness of the structure of the 
Safety & Assurance function throughout the Group.
The Committee met four times in 2014.
How does the Committee discharge its 
responsibilities?
The Committee meets at least once a year, and has met five times 
in 2014. It operates within a written charter (which is available on the 
Group’s website) setting out its roles and responsibilities.
Main responsibilities:
 X reviewing Board structure, size and composition
 X making recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes
 X identifying and nominating candidates for the approval of the Board
 X filling Board vacancies
 X ensuring succession plans are in place.
The Committee met twice early in the year, to consider the appointment 
of a new Chairman in succession to Allister Langlands (those discussions 
were chaired by David Woodward and excluded Ian Marchant); David 
Woodward’s appointment as Senior Independent Director (SID) to 
succeed Ian Marchant; and to receive an update from its advisers, Korn 
Ferry, on the search for a further non-executive director, preferably with 
strong listed company financial experience to assume the chair of the 
Audit Committee, which ultimately led to the appointment of Jann Brown 
in May. Those appointments were concluded in time to be included in 
last year’s annual report. 
In August the Committee reviewed executive succession planning and 
this was subsequently broadened to include a wider senior management 
group and summarised to the Board at its meeting in December. Having 
completed his initial term of three years, Jeremy Wilson’s reappointment 
to the Board was considered, noting in particular his knowledge of 
international oil & gas and financial markets, and was recommended to 
the Board. 
In the final quarter of the year, the Committee again met twice to 
consider the appointment of a Chief Financial Officer after Alan Semple 
expressed a desire to retire after 19 years with the Group. David Kemp 
emerged as the clear candidate for recommendation to the Board 
following a rigorous selection process that included a series of interviews 
with members of the Committee and internal and external benchmarking 
supported by its advisers, Spencer Stuart. 
The Committee also spent considerable time considering proposals for 
the reorganisation of executive director roles in order to capitalise on the 
Group’s through-cycle growth potential and endorsed Robin Watson’s 
promotion to a new role as Chief Operating Officer, which will take effect 
during 2015. 
Having joined as Group Head of HSSE in August, Nina Schofield’s 
appointment to the Safety & Assurance Committee was recommended. 
Mary L Shafer-Malicki stepped down from the Audit Committee at the 
end of the year and joined the Remuneration Committee, enhancing the 
balance and composition of those Committees. 
Committee evaluation
With external facilitation from the advisers, Lintstock, in the final quarter of 
the year the Committee assessed its own performance during the year and 
concluded that it had benefited from more frequent meetings during the 
year and would continue to meet on a more regular and structured basis. 
The Committee is cognisant of the Governance Code’s requirement 
to pay due regard to the benefits of diversity, including gender when 
conducting a search for Board candidates. Wood Group is committed to 
remaining an equal opportunities employer. John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 31 30
How does the Committee discharge  
its responsibilities?
The Committee met four times since the date of the last annual report 
and on each occasion we invited the Group CFO, Group Financial 
Controller, Group Head of Internal Audit and the external auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to attend. During the year other 
relevant people from the business were invited to attend certain meetings 
to provide deeper insight into specific issues and developments across 
the Group. The Group Head of Internal Audit and the external auditors 
have the right of direct access to the Chair of the Committee at all times, 
and to meet the Committee without management present. 
The Chair of the Committee reports to the Board as part of a separate 
agenda item, on the activity of the Committee.
During the year the Committee focused on the following areas:
Financial reporting and significant accounting issues
The primary areas of financial reporting judgement considered by the 
Committee in relation to the 2014 financial statements and how they 
were addressed are outlined below.
 X Review of significant contracts
During 2014, the Committee reviewed the Group's largest ongoing 
contracts including those executed on a fixed price and lump sum basis. 
The recognition of profit or loss on lump sum and fixed price contracts is 
subject to management estimation, albeit these contracts only accounted 
for a small percentage of the Group’s revenue in 2014. During the year the 
Committee received regular updates from management on the status of 
significant contracts and the accounting for these. In addition, the external 
auditors assessed this as an area of particular focus and the Committee 
received updates on related work undertaken by PwC.
 X Impairment reviews 
At the half year and the year end the Committee considered 
management’s assessment of whether or not indicators of impairment 
existed and where this was the case the results of impairment reviews.
Annual reviews are carried out in relation to goodwill and intangible 
assets. This involves challenging the significant assumptions and 
estimates made and the basis for them. No impairments were noted.
The Committee also considered the assumptions used by management 
to support their view that the Group’s investment in the EthosEnergy JV 
was not impaired, and reviewed the outcome of the sensitivities prepared; 
noting that under certain conditions impairment was possible. Overall, 
taking into account that the joint venture was only formed during 2014 and 
the specific factors which impacted 2014 performance, the Committee 
was satisfied that the carrying value of our investment in EthosEnergy was 
not impaired at this time. The Committee will continue to monitor actual 
performance against that forecast to ensure that this remains the case. 
 X Joint Ventures and the Adoption of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
During 2014 the Group entered into a Joint Venture with Siemens, now 
known as EthosEnergy. The joint venture combined elements of both 
parties’ Gas Turbine activities, with further details set out in note 10 and 27 
to the Group financial statements. The Committee reviewed the accounting 
for this transaction, and received reports from PwC on their audit work. 
The Group adopted IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements effective 1 January 
2014, which meant that the Group could no longer elect to proportionately 
consolidate joint ventures and must apply equity accounting. When taken 
in combination with the EthosEnergy transaction this had a significant 
impact on the way the Group’s statutory results are presented for the 
current and comparative periods. 
Who is on the Audit Committee?
The Audit Committee comprises Jann M Brown, Chair, Jeremy R Wilson, 
David K Woodward and Mary L Shafer-Malicki. Jann Brown joined the 
Audit Committee from the August 2014 meeting, replacing Ian Marchant 
as the Chair following his appointment as Chairman of the Group.  
To provide continuity on certain issues and as part of the handover 
process, Ian attended subsequent meetings as an observer. 
What are the Committee’s responsibilities?
The Committee has a written charter, which is reviewed on an annual 
basis, setting out its roles and responsibilities, including:
 X reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s financial controls 
 X monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial statements 
and its interim and preliminary announcements 
 X reviewing the Company’s procedures for whistle blowing 
in relation to possible improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting, financial control or any other financial matters
 X monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal audit function 
 X reviewing the terms of engagement, independence 
and objectivity of the external auditors
 X advising the Board on the policy with regard to audit tendering, 
taking into account relevant regulatory requirements
 X assessing the external audit process and the effectiveness  
of the external auditors to supply non-audit services, 
in accordance with Group policy 
 X reporting to the Board, identifying any matters in respect of 
which it considers that action or other improvement is needed 
and making recommendations as to the steps to be taken.
Audit Committee members have been selected with the aim of providing 
the range of financial and commercial expertise necessary to fulfil the 
Committee’s responsibilities. The Board considers that Jann Brown has 
recent and relevant financial experience as required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Audit Committee 
“I was delighted to be asked to Chair the Audit Committee 
following my appointment to the Board in May. Since my 
appointment I have taken the opportunity to meet with 
senior management around the Group to find out more 
about the business and to promote the work of the Audit 
Committee. Our meetings during the year covered a wide 
range of topics including the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal financial controls, the integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting and effectiveness of the internal and 
external audit processes.”

Corporate governance continued Financial statements Governance Strategic report
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 31 30
In May the Committee received a presentation by the Group Financial 
Controller on the impact on the Group and the proposed additional 
disclosures which were to be provided to allow users to better understand 
the changes. At the August 2014 and February 2015 meetings the draft 
interim and full year financial statements which contained the revised 
disclosures were reviewed and approved.
 X Current and deferred tax balances
The Group operates in a number of different tax regimes and must 
comply with various corporate tax regulations. Provisioning for potential 
current tax liabilities and the basis for deferred tax assets and liabilities is 
underpinned by a range of judgements. The Committee addresses these 
issues through a combination of reporting from senior management and 
the extent to which these are supported by professional advice from 
advisory firms and considers the positions taken by management to be 
appropriate. This has also been recognised by PwC as an area of higher 
audit risk and external audit test the basis for significant uncertain tax 
positions and the recognition of tax asset and liabilities.
 X Review of provisions for doubtful debts
At each meeting the Committee receives and reviews a management 
report which includes details of more material provisions including those 
made around doubtful debts, which are discussed and challenged.  
In particular during 2014 the recoverability of certain disputed debts in 
our North American business was discussed and the level of provision 
was agreed as appropriate.
Internal financial control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Audit Committee has been 
delegated the responsibility to review the effectiveness of the internal 
financial control systems implemented by management. In supporting 
the Board the Committee considered the process by which the Group 
evaluated its internal financial control environment. This work was primarily 
driven by regular updates from the Group Head of Internal Audit on the 
effectiveness of internal financial controls and the results of the financial 
risk self-assessment process undertaken across the Group. External audit 
also provide feedback on assessment of specific areas of financial control 
as appropriate during the course of their work. 
 X Internal audit
Monitoring the activity of the Group Internal Audit function is an agenda 
item at each Committee meeting. Reports from the Group Head of 
Internal Audit typically include updates on progress against the annual 
internal audit plan, a summary of the key matters arising from internal 
audit reviews, an update on the status of actions arising from the work of 
internal audit and updates on relevant regulatory matters impacting on the 
role of the Audit Committee.
The Chair of the Committee holds private discussions with the Group 
Head of Internal Audit as necessary during the year outside the formal 
Committee process.
 X External audit
As part of the external audit process, PwC prepare an audit plan 
identifying their assessment of key audit risks. These risks are discussed 
during the year with input from management and the Group Head of 
Internal Audit as necessary, providing the Committee with an opportunity 
to challenge matters of judgement. 
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of the audit process through 
consideration of the reporting received from PwC at both the half year 
and year end, the robustness of the external auditors’ handling of key 
judgemental areas and the quality of the external auditors’ interaction 
with, and reporting to, the Committee. 
The Committee also reviews the standing, experience and tenure 
of the external audit lead partner, the arrangements for ensuring the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditors and the nature and 
level of services provided. In addition, we conduct an annual exercise 
to seek feedback from financial management around the Group on the 
effectiveness of the audit process. We provide an opportunity for open 
dialogue and feedback between the external auditor and the Committee 
without management being present.
 X Appointment and independence
The Committee has overall responsibility for ensuring that the external 
auditors’ independence and objectivity is not compromised.
The Committee considers the reappointment of the external auditor 
each year and also assesses their independence on an ongoing basis. 
During the year we received confirmation from the external auditors 
regarding their independence. In accordance with UK regulations and 
to help ensure independence, our auditors adhere to a rotation policy 
based on Auditing Practices Board standards that require the Group 
audit partner to rotate every five years. This is the second year that the 
current lead audit partner has been involved in the audit of the Group.
PwC have been the Group’s external auditors since the Group became 
a publicly listed company in 2002. Whilst the Group has not formally 
tendered the audit since then, as part of the Committee’s review of the 
objectivity and effectiveness of the audit process, a detailed assessment 
was undertaken in 2012 as part of the audit partner rotation process 
where it was decided not to put the audit engagement out to tender. 
During the year we considered the audit tendering provisions outlined in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the UK Competition and Markets 
Authority (CMA) Order and regulations issued by the European Union. 
Having considered the need to tender the external audit, to date the 
Committee has been satisfied with the effectiveness of the external 
auditors and has not considered it necessary to require PwC to tender 
for the external audit work during 2014.
The Committee provided the Board with its recommendation to 
shareholders on the reappointment of PwC as external auditor for the 
year ending 31 December 2015. Accordingly a resolution proposing the 
reappointment of PwC as our external auditor will be put to shareholders 
at the 2015 AGM.
We will continue to assess when the Group should put the audit 
engagement out to tender and at present our intention is that the latest 
date such a tender exercise would be undertaken is on conclusion of the 
2017 audit process, when the current lead audit partner is due to rotate. 
There are no contractual obligations that restrict the Group’s choice of 
external auditors.
 X Non-audit services
One of the key risks to external auditor independence is the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditor. The Committee considers and 
approves fees in respect of non-audit services provided by the external 
auditors in accordance with the Group’s policy in this area, which is set 
out in the Audit Committee’s terms of reference. The cost of non-audit 
services provided in 2014 is reported in note 3 to the financial statements. 
In the opinion of the Committee, the provision of these non-audit services 
did not impair PwC’s independence. 
Committee evaluation
The Committee’s activities formed part of the external review of Board 
and Committee effectiveness performed in the year. Details of this 
process can be found on page 27. John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 33 32

This is the Board’s report to shareholders on directors’ 
remuneration and covers both executive directors and  
non-executive directors. It has been prepared by the  
Remuneration Committee and has been approved by  
the Board. This report is subject to an advisory vote in  
relation to the annual report on Remuneration (Part 2 of  
this report) at the 2015 Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
Letter from the Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
The Group’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy, comprising Part 1 of the 
Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR), sets out the Group’s remuneration 
policy. The policy is subject to a binding shareholder vote held at 
least every three years and received overwhelming support from our 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM. The Group will continue to follow the 
agreed policy during 2015. As there are no proposed changes to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy there is no requirement for a shareholder 
vote on this part of the DRR at the 2015 AGM. Our agreed Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy with updated scenario charts can be found at: 
www.woodgroup.com/rempolicy
Part 2 of the DRR contains the annual report on Remuneration, which 
describes how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been operated 
in 2014 and how it will be applied in 2015. This part of the DRR will be 
subject to an advisory vote by shareholders at the 2015 AGM. 
Our objective is to provide a remuneration package that promotes 
the long-term success of the Group. In line with our agreed policy, 
we do this through a balance of fixed and variable pay, which we 
intend will result in competitive total remuneration packages that 
reflect performance, while creating an appropriate alignment between 
executives and the long-term interests of shareholders. 
Resolutions in respect of remuneration were overwhelmingly supported 
at the 2014 AGM, however it was noted that there were a number of 
abstentions. As a result, the Committee consulted major shareholders 
holding in aggregate just over 48% of the equity of the Company to 
better understand the reasons why some shareholders felt unable 
to support the relevant resolutions at the 2014 AGM. In reviewing 
the comments received and in conjunction with a general review of 
arrangements for 2015 with the aim of simplifying and standardising the 
variable pay structure for executive directors and senior managers, the 
Committee decided to base 2015 long-term incentive awards on Group 
targets only for all executive director participants. It was also decided 
to include more detail retrospectively on performance against targets 
for annual bonus within the DRR for 2014. I trust these changes will be 
welcomed by our shareholders. 
The Committee also considered the period over which our long-term 
incentive awards must be held. Wood Group was one of the first 
companies in our sector to extend deferral beyond the traditional  
3 year-period when we introduced our current requirement in 2008 for 
20% of any vested award to be held for a further two years, i.e. five 
years in total. Having considered this issue, the Committee believes 
that this arrangement, in conjunction with our recently introduced 
requirement that the deferred 50% of annual bonus paid to executive 
directors will be in the form of shares and the introduction in 2013 of 
minimum shareholding requirements for executive directors, continues 
to help promote the long-term success of the Group and creates an 
appropriate alignment with the interests of shareholders. I hope you will 
be able to continue to support these arrangements. 
Directors’  
Remuneration 
Report Financial statements Governance Strategic report
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 33 32
The Committee also considered the changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code which were published in September 2014 by the 
Financial Reporting Council. In particular, the Committee noted the 
requirement for bonus and long-term incentive schemes to contain 
“clawback” provisions (the ability to recover sums already paid) as  
well as “malus” provisions (the ability to withhold any payments due)  
in circumstances considered by the Committee to be appropriate.  
As a result, the Committee revised our annual bonus and long-term 
incentive scheme rules to ensure both of these provisions were 
included, thereby ensuring that our arrangements remain fully  
compliant with the Code. 
Against a market backdrop of falling oil prices, increased focus on 
efficiency by oil & gas operators generally and the consequential impact 
on investment in certain areas, EBITA performance was up 3.1% on 
2013, which contributed to annual bonuses of between 48% and 
64% of maximum being awarded to executive directors. The 2014 
performance also contributed to a moderate payout in the LTIP cycle 
2012 – 2014 with growth in AEPS over the three year cycle of 65% and 
TSR performance against selected peer companies at 9 out of 17. 
During the year, the Committee considered the executive directors’ 
remuneration packages for 2015. As you may recall, last year the 
Committee considered that Bob Keiller should be awarded a salary 
increase at 1 January 2014 of 12.5% to an annual base salary of 
£630,000 reflecting the progress he had made since appointment as 
Group CEO. Bob decided to defer this increase for 12 months and this 
increase duly took effect on 1 January 2015. After consideration, and 
recognising the current difficult operating environment, the Committee 
agreed that no general salary increases should apply to executive 
directors at 1 January 2015. However the Committee were mindful of 
the appointment of Robin Watson into his new role of Chief Operating 
Officer of Wood Group, which is scheduled to take place at 6th April 
2015. The Committee has agreed that a significant adjustment to 
salary should take place at that time to £500,000 p.a. and that it would 
be appropriate for Robin’s 2015 annual bonus opportunity to remain 
at 125% of base salary while increasing his LTIP award to 150% of 
base salary reflecting the scope and long-term importance of this 
new role. The Committee consulted with major shareholders holding 
in aggregate just over 48% of the Company at that time in relation 
to these points and no objections were received. Further details of 
these changes are included in the section on policy implementation in 
2015. The Committee also determined the remuneration arrangements 
on retirement for Allister Langlands and Mike Straughen as they 
stepped down from the Board on 14 May 2014 and 31 August 2014 
respectively. These arrangements were in line with our agreed policy 
and are fully documented in Part 2 of this report. 
33
In setting targets for the 2015 annual bonus and LTP 2015-2017 cycle, 
the Committee has been particularly mindful of the more challenging 
market conditions currently being seen in the oil & gas sector, and the 
uncertainty that these conditions bring. Details of the selected AEPS 
targets for the LTP 2015-2017 cycle are provided in Part 2 of this report 
while the 2015 annual bonus targets will be disclosed retrospectively in 
next year’s DRR.
At the time of preparing this report, consideration was being given by 
the Company to an employee share purchase plan for all employees 
other than executive directors. The Committee is supportive of this type 
of plan and hope shareholders will vote in favour of its adoption should a 
relevant Resolution be tabled at the 2015 AGM.
In preparing the DRR for 2014, the Committee has endeavoured to 
provide full and clear explanations of decisions made and the reasons 
for these. I hope you will be able to support the relevant resolution.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Remuneration Committee
During 2014, the Remuneration Committee comprised three 
independent non-executive directors: David K Woodward (Chairman), 
Michel Contie and Jeremy R Wilson. Mary L. Shafer-Malicki joined the 
Committee in February 2015.
The Remuneration Committee advises the Board on executive 
remuneration and sets the remuneration packages of each of the 
executive directors within the approved policy. The Committee has a 
written charter which is publicly available on the Group’s website.
Where appropriate, the Committee receives input from the Chairman, 
Group CEO, Group Head of Human Resources and the Director 
of Compensation & Benefits. This input never relates to their own 
remuneration. The Company Secretary attends each of the Committee 
meetings in his role as Secretary to the Committee. 
The aim of the Committee is to establish an overall remuneration 
structure which will:
 X promote the long-term success of the Group
 X reflect the size and complexity of the Group’s business
 X take account of executives’ individual 
responsibilities and geographical location
 X attract, retain and motivate executives 
 X clearly align remuneration with the Group’s long-term 
strategy in the pursuit of maximising shareholder value
 X consider executive remuneration within the broader setting 
of pay conditions elsewhere within Wood Group.
In setting remuneration policy the Committee gives full consideration to 
the relevant provisions of the Governance Code and relevant regulations 
enacted under the Companies Act 2006.

During the year, the Committee took advice from Deloitte LLP , who 
were retained as external advisors to the Committee. Deloitte LLP 
is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such 
voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in relation to Executive 
Remuneration Consulting in the UK. Deloitte received £55,925 for the 
provision of services to the Committee during the year. These fees 
consisted of core services (where the cost was agreed in advance) and 
additional services (which were charged on a time and materials basis). 
As well as advising the Remuneration Committee, Deloitte LLP also 
provided tax and global mobility advice to the Group during 2014.  
The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by Deloitte during the 
year and is comfortable that it has been objective and independent.  
The Committee has reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and 
judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
During 2014, the Committee met four times to discuss the remuneration 
issues arising and the operation of the remuneration policy. The following 
table sets out what the Committee covered at each of those meetings. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Statement of shareholder voting
The Committee is committed to shareholder dialogue. Where there 
are a substantial number of votes against any resolution on directors’ 
remuneration, the Committee seeks to understand the reasons for any 
such vote, and will detail here any actions in response to it. 
The following table sets out actual voting in respect of our 
previous remuneration report:

The Committee noted the number of abstentions and contacted a 
number of leading shareholders to better understand the reasons why 
some shareholders felt unable to support the relevant resolutions at 
the 2014 AGM. In reviewing the comments received and in conjunction 
with a general review of arrangements for 2015 the Committee has 
decided to base 2015 long-term incentive awards on Group targets only 
for all executive director participants as well as including more detail 
retrospectively on performance against targets for annual bonus within 
Part 2 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2014.

(a) Salary or fees received during the year.
(b) Taxable benefits received during the year. Taxable benefits include 
company car or car allowance, private medical, dental and contributory 
health and welfare cover as applicable. For those directors based in the 
US, the cost of benefits reflects the amounts that would be chargeable to 
UK income tax if the director were resident in the UK for tax purposes. 
(c) Bonus awarded in relation to the year inclusive of all amounts subject 
to further deferral. 
For 2014, maximum bonus opportunity was 125% of base salary for all 
executive directors. Bonus for Bob Keiller was based on his deferred 
salary of £630,000. Bonus measures were split between financial (60%) 
and non-financial (40%) measures. The financial measures consisted of 
EBITA (50%) and average DSO (10%). DSO is Days Sales Outstanding 
and is a key contributing factor to cash flow. Non-financial measures 
were split between corporate objectives (30%) and individual personal 
objectives (10%).
Group financial targets applied to all executive directors other than Robin 
Watson where EBITA and DSO targets were split 25/75 between Group 
and Divisional targets. The financial targets for the bonus year ended 31 
December 2014, and the extent to which they were achieved, are set 
out below. Once 90% of the relevant financial measure is met, bonus 
starts to accrue with 71% of maximum paid at target and maximum 
paid when the respective measure is 10% above target. Achievement 
is calculated on a straight-line basis between threshold and target and 
between target and maximum.
Measures Threshold Target Maximum Achieved

Corporate objectives, amounting to 30% of the bonus opportunity, 
were shared by all executive directors with each executive director’s 
individual personal objectives amounting to 10% of the bonus opportunity. 
The Committee determined awards of 36.375% of base salary for the 
combined corporate and personal performance against these objectives 
for each of the executive directors. Payment of 50% of the total bonus 
was deferred in the form of shares for a further two years (based on an 
average share price computed using the 20 day trading average in the 
period running up to 31 December 2014), with continued employment 
a requirement to receive the deferred payment other than for those 
classified as good leavers. 
For 2013, maximum bonus opportunity was 125% of base salary for all 
executive directors. Bonus measures were split between financial (70%) 
and non-financial (30%) measures. The financial measures consisted of 
EBITA and average DSO weighted 70/30. Group targets applied to all 
executive directors other than Robin Watson and Mike Straughen where 
EBITA and DSO targets were split 50/50 between Group and Divisional 
targets. The financial targets for the bonus year ended 31 December 
2013, and the extent to which they were achieved, are set out below. 
Once 85% of the EBITA measure is met (90% for DSO), bonus starts to 
accrue with 71% of maximum paid at target and maximum paid when 
the EBITA measure is 15% above target (10% above target for DSO). 
Achievement is calculated on a straight-line basis between threshold 
and target and between target and maximum.

Performance against non-financial objectives varied by each director with 
payments under this element ranging from 27.5% to 31.0% of base salary. 
Payment of 50% of the total bonus was deferred in the form of cash for a 
further two years with continued employment a requirement to receive the 
deferred payment other than for those classified as good leavers. 
(d) The value of long-term incentives which vested in respect of 
performance periods ending during the year inclusive of all amounts 
subject to further deferral. 
For 2014, this figure relates to awards under the LTIP 2012-2014 cycle 
which vested at 31 December 2014. The figure has been calculated 
using the number of share options that vested multiplied by the closing 
mid-market share price on 31 December 2014 of £5.965. The exchange 
rate at 31 December 2014 of £1 = $1.5593 was used for those executive 
directors paid in US dollars. Maximum awards under the 2012-2014 
cycle were 125% of base salary for all executive directors. For Allister G 
Langlands, Bob Keiller and Alan G Semple the LTIP measures were split 
between TSR and AEPS weighted 25% and 75% respectively. 
Mike Straughen was also measured on Divisional EBITA, the split of his 
award being TSR 25%, AEPS 37.5% and Divisional EBITA 37.5%.  
Robin Watson was measured exclusively on Divisional performance  
(his award being made prior to his appointment as an executive 
director), with the measures being EBITA and OCER weighted 75% 
and 25% respectively. 
The TSR of the Group was compared to a peer group comprising 
Aker Solutions, AMEC, Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, Fluor, Foster 
Wheeler, Jacobs Engineering, KBR, McDermott, Petrofac, Saipem, 
SBM Offshore, Sulzer, Technip, Weir Group, Worley Parsons and WS 
Atkins. Foster Wheeler was retained in the comparator group despite 
their acquisition by AMEC in November 2014 given that almost 35/36ths 
of the performance period had been completed. The targets for the 
LTIP 2012-2014 and the extent to which they were achieved, are set 
out below. On reaching the threshold, one-third of the relevant measure 
becomes payable and on reaching the maximum, 100% of the relevant 
measure becomes payable. For achievement between threshold and 
maximum, the allocation is on a straight line basis.

Divisional EBITA (Watson) $293.5m $323.5m $341.7m
Divisional OCER (Watson) 5.1% 4.6% 10.8%
For all participants, 20% of the share options that were awarded 
were deferred for a further two years to contribute to alignment with 
shareholders and to aid retention, with continued employment a 
requirement to receive the deferred payment other than for those 
classified as good leavers. 
For 2013, this figure relates to awards under the LTIP 2011-2013 cycle 
which vested at 31 December 2013. The figure has been calculated 
using the number of share options that vested multiplied by the closing 
mid-market share price on 31 December 2013 of £6.86. Maximum 
awards under the 2011-2013 cycle were 125% of base salary for 
all executive directors except for Robin Watson (whose award was 
made prior to him becoming an executive director) where 100% of 
base salary applied. For Allister G Langlands and Alan G Semple the 
LTIP measures were split between TSR and AEPS weighted 25% 
and 75% respectively. Bob Keiller (whose award was made before his 
appointment as Group CEO) and Mike Straughen were also measured 
on Divisional EBITA, the split of their awards being TSR 25%, AEPS 
37.5% and Divisional EBITA 37.5%. Robin Watson was measured 
exclusively on Divisional performance (his award being made prior to his 
appointment as an executive director), with the measures being EBITA 
and OCER weighted 75% and 25% respectively with EBITA being split 
50/50 between two separate business units. The TSR of the Group was 
compared to a peer group comprising Aker Solutions, AMEC, Chicago 
Bridge & Iron Company, Fluor, Foster Wheeler, Jacobs Engineering, 
KBR, McDermott, Petrofac, Saipem, SBM Offshore, Sulzer, Technip, 
The Weir Group, Worley Parsons and WS Atkins. The targets for the 
LTIP 2011-2013 and the extent to which they were achieved, are set 
out below. On reaching the threshold, one-third of the relevant measure 
becomes payable and on reaching the maximum, 100% of the relevant 
measure becomes payable. For achievement between threshold and 
maximum, the allocation is on a straight line basis.  John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 39 38

Benefits
The current executive directors will continue to participate in existing 
benefit arrangements in line with the agreed remuneration policy. 
Pension
The current executive directors will continue to participate in existing 
pension arrangements in line with the agreed remuneration policy. 
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the executives will remain at 
125% of salary in 2015. 
The table below provides further information on the performance 
measures against which performance will be measured.
Relative weighting 
(% of bonus opportunity)
Financial measures 60%
EBITA 48%
DSO 12%
Non-financial measures 40%
For 2015, the threshold EBITA performance required for a payment 
under this bonus element will be set at 90% of target. Once 90% of 
EBITA target is achieved, bonus starts to accrue with 70% of maximum 
paid at target and maximum paid when EBITA is 10% above target. 
No payment is made against Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) performance 
if DSO is 10% worse than target, with 70% of maximum paid at target 
and maximum paid when DSO is 10% better than target. 
The Committee has set the financial targets for the annual bonus 
plan for the year ending 31 December 2015 but has chosen not to 
disclose the detail in this Report as in the opinion of the Committee, 
these are commercially sensitive and it would not be in the Company’s 
best interests to disclose these. The specific targets and the extent to 
which the targets are met will be disclosed retrospectively in next year’s 
Report. Non-financial measures consist of corporate and personal 
objectives which are aimed at the achievement of the Group’s business 
goals and core values. For 2015, corporate objectives include objectives 
related to HSSE & business growth. Personal objectives include objectives 
related to leadership; customers and stakeholders; cost efficiencies and 
people & organisation. 
LTP
Awards of up to 125% of salary will be made to executive directors other 
than to Bob Keiller and Robin Watson where the awards will be 150%. 
Alan Semple has notified the Board of his intention to retire during 2015, 
therefore no LTP award will be made in 2015. 
For 2015, awards made to the executive directors will be based on TSR 
and AEPS weighted 25% and 75% respectively. 
The performance measures have been chosen in light of their 
appropriateness to the objectives of the Group, and targets are set 
against these measures at the commencement of each performance 
cycle. During the course of a performance cycle, the Committee has 
the discretion to adjust the achievement levels, but only so that the new 
levels are considered as demanding as those first set. 
In setting the targets for the 2015–2017 cycle, the Committee took into 
consideration the current market conditions in the oil & gas sector and 
the uncertainties that a significantly reduced oil price will have on our 
customer’s spending patterns. The AEPS targets were set at 100 cents 
at threshold and 120 cents at maximum. This represents a broadly flat 
position to the 2014 actual AEPS at threshold and 6.4% compound annual 
growth from 2014 actual AEPS at maximum. The Committee believe that 
the uncertainty and more challenging markets are likely to apply throughout 
2015, and possibly beyond, therefore a more appropriate measure would 
be growth against analyst consensus for 2015. As at the date of this 
report, analyst consensus of 2015 AEPS was 94.3 cents and as such the 
range selected represents 3.0% compound annual growth at threshold 
and 12.8% compound annual growth at maximum.
The TSR of the Group is compared to a peer group comprising the 
following engineering/construction and support services companies – Aker 
Solutions, AMEC Foster Wheeler, Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, Fluor, 
Jacobs Engineering, KBR, McDermott, Petrofac, Saipem, SBM Offshore, 
Sulzer, Technip, The Weir Group, Worley Parsons and WS Atkins. 
No awards are made for less than the threshold performance for 
AEPS and the 50th percentile for TSR. On reaching the threshold or 
50th percentile, 25% of the AEPS or TSR-related element becomes 
payable and on reaching the maximum performance for AEPS or 
75th percentile for TSR, 100% of the AEPS or TSR element becomes 
payable. For achievement level between threshold and maximum for 
AEPS or between the 50th and 75th percentile performance for TSR, 
the allocation is on a straight line basis.

2.2 Total pension entitlements
Pension benefits provided to UK executive directors
Bob Keiller is provided with pension benefits via the Wood Group Group Personal Pension Plan (WG GPP), which is a defined contribution scheme. 
A Company contribution of 15% of base salary is split between pension contribution up to the UK HMRC annual allowance and a cash payment in 
lieu of pension. He is provided with life assurance cover of eight times basic salary up to a maximum of £2,500,000.
Robin Watson is provided with pension benefits via the WG GPP . A Company contribution of 15% of base salary is split between pension 
contribution up to the UK HMRC annual allowance and a cash payment in lieu of pension. He is provided with life assurance cover of four times 
basic salary up to a maximum of £1,200,000.
Mike Straughen received a cash payment of 10% of base salary in lieu of pension provision and was provided with life assurance cover of four times 
basic salary up to his employment end date of 31 October 2014.
Allister G Langlands accrued no pension in 2014. He was provided with life assurance cover of four times basic salary up to his retiral from the Board 
on 14 May 2014.
Pension benefits provided to US-based executive directors
From 1 July 2014, Alan G Semple is provided with a cash payment of 15% of base salary in lieu of pension provision. Prior to this, he was provided 
with a pension arrangement of a defined benefit nature providing an equivalent level of benefits to that provided in the John Wood Group PLC 
Retirement Benefit Scheme (RBS). Benefits ceased to accrue under this arrangement at 30 June 2014 in line with the date the RBS closed to future 
accrual for all members. As Alan is a US resident, his pension arrangement has been structured within a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
(SERP) in line with common practice in the US. He is provided with life assurance cover of approximately four times basic salary.

Note 
(a) The face value of the awards is calculated from the salary at the beginning of the cycle multiplied by the maximum award. For Bob Keiller, the award was based on his deferred 
salary of £630,000.
(b) The face value of the award for Alan G Semple is calculated using an exchange rate of £1 = $1.6563, being the exchange rate at the beginning of the performance cycle.
2.4 Payments to past directors
Mark S Dobler served as an executive director from 1 January 2013 until he stepped down from the Board on 9 October 2013 to lead EthosEnergy, 
the joint venture with Siemens AG. His long-term incentive award that was due to vest at 31 December 2014 lapsed on his move to the joint venture 
company and was replaced by a long-term cash plan designed to produce a broadly similar outcome. The value of the long-term cash plan award at 
vesting on 31 December 2014 was $170,766.
There were no other payments made to past directors during 2014 which had not already been disclosed in previous Directors’ Remuneration Reports. 
2.5 Payments for loss of office
There were no payments made for loss of office to any director during 2014 which had not already been disclosed in previous Directors’ 
Remuneration Reports. 
2.6 Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests
Shareholding guidelines were introduced at 1 July 2013 requiring the CEO to hold shares valued at 150% of base salary and the other executive directors 
to hold shares valued at 100% of base salary. The holding is expected to be built up as quickly as after-tax share awards from long-term plans allow.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 47
The area of our audit focus specifically included
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked 
at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, 
including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. As part of this we 
considered the appropriateness of the classification of exceptional items.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as “areas of 
focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks 
identified by our audit.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Carrying value of investment in EthosEnergy joint venture
In May 2014 the Group entered into a joint venture with Siemens to create 
EthosEnergy. At 31 December 2014 the carrying value of the investment in 
the joint venture was $360.2m.
Since formation the joint venture has not performed as well as expected 
which, together with a challenging trading outlook, indicates the investment 
may be impaired. 
Management performed an impairment assessment at 31 December 2014 
which took into consideration the performance of EthosEnergy since its 
establishment and the forecasted future cash flows to determine the “value 
in use” of the joint venture compared to its carrying value, to ascertain 
whether the carrying value was impaired. This shows headroom of $31.7m.
Management’s assessment of the “value in use” is judgemental in nature 
because it is based on forecasted results and uncertain outcomes. As a 
result this is an area of focus for our audit.
We have evaluated and challenged management’s assessment of the 
carrying value at 31 December 2014 with a focus on the future cash flow 
forecasts as compared to the recent performance of EthosEnergy. 
 
Our challenge focused on: 
 X The significant revenue and profit growth assumptions within  
the forecast cash flows for the next 2 years. These were supported 
by backlog, current sales pipeline and strategic opportunities together 
with a comparison to historic performance. We also focused on 
planned synergies (for example leveraging supplier relationships) and 
future cost reduction plans.
 X The longer term growth rate assumptions by comparing them to 
economic and industry forecasts; and
 X The post-tax discount rate used of 11% (pre-tax 15%) by 
benchmarking against the rates used by comparable organisations in 
the economic environments in which EthosEnergy operates.
We found the key drivers assumptions above used in the cash flow forecasts 
to be acceptable, although, we note that these assumptions are sensitive 
and as a result detailed disclosures regarding key drivers and assumptions 
have been set out within the investments note of the financial statements.
As reflected in the disclosures, upward changes to the discount rate and 
downward changes to the growth rate may result in elimination of the 
headroom.
Carrying value of goodwill and intangibles
The carrying value of goodwill and intangibles as at 31 December 2014 is 
$1,943.5m. This relates to a number of acquisitions, the most significant of 
which is PSN goodwill ($900m) which was acquired in 2011.
Management’s assessment of the “value in use” of the Group’s Cash 
Generating Units (“CGU’s”) involves judgements about the future results of the 
business and the discount rates applied to future cash flow forecasts. This is 
particularly relevant at the current time due to the lower price of crude oil.
We evaluated and challenged managements’ future cash flow forecasts 
and tested the underlying “value in use” model. We assessed the 
appropriateness of the inputs into managements’ model through challenge 
of the following key assumptions: 
 X The long term growth rate of 3% by comparing it with economic and 
industry forecasts and, in particular, considering the recent fall in the 
price of crude oil; and
 X The post-tax discount rate used ranging from 9% to 11% (12% to 15% 
pre-tax) depending on region was benchmarked against the rates used 
by comparable organisations in the economic environments in which 
Wood Group operates.
We performed additional sensitivities to those performed by management 
on the key assumptions. Any changes in the assumptions that would result 
in a material impairment are considered unlikely, but given the nature of the 
estimates, are not without risk. 
Independent auditor’s report continued John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 48
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Subjective provisions
There are a number of provisions across the Group that require significant 
management judgement during the estimation process. We have focused 
on the following:
Oman onerous contract provision – In 2013 management recorded 
an onerous contract provision in relation to Oman. At 31 December 2014 
$15m of this provision remains after a release of $9.7m and is expected to 
be utilised in 2015 when the contract will be exited.  
The provision is based on expected losses and estimated exit costs still to 
be incurred and as such, remains subjective in nature.
Provision against trade receivables balances – In the current lower oil 
price environment there is a heightened risk of non-recovery of amounts 
due from customers. Provisions against receivables have increased from 
$25m to $47m in the year.
Due to the highly judgemental nature of subjective provisions, our testing 
focused on the need for provisions and the accuracy of the amounts 
recorded. Our work focused on the following most significant provisions:
Oman onerous contract provision - We tested the calculation of the 
provision by challenging management on the following key assumptions:
 X Future losses compared with historic performance and expected 
activity changes; and
 X Exit costs provision for completeness and accuracy based on available 
information and our knowledge of the known costs to exit for example 
employee termination costs.
 X On the basis of the work we performed we concluded that there is still 
sufficient evidence to support the recognition of the onerous contract 
provision and consider the level of provision is appropriate based on 
the future expected cash outflows in Oman.
Provisions against trade receivable balances - We performed detailed 
sample tests of accounts receivable including agreement to original invoice, 
tests of ageing, circularisation of customers and agreement to subsequent 
receipts. In addition we also focused our work in areas where the level of 
provisioning has increased to understand the specific customer disputes 
which have been provided. Based on the evidence we have seen we 
consider the level of provisions to be adequate and supportable.
We also performed legal enquiries and audit procedures in respect of 
ongoing legal cases and warranty claims and did not identify the need for 
any material provisions.
Revenue recognition in significant contracts 
There is a risk of material misstatement over revenue recognition and 
unbilled revenue as it relates to Wood Group’s significant contracts. 
Most of the Group’s contracts are reimbursable in nature however, in the 
current environment of significantly lower crude oil prices, Wood Group’s 
customers are increasingly more cost focused; therefore, recognition of 
unbilled work in progress is an area of focus.
Wood Group also have a small number of major lump sum and fixed price 
contracts which represent less than 5% of the Group’s total revenue. 
Revenue on these contracts is recognised based on the stage of completion 
reached by measuring the proportion of costs incurred against total 
estimated costs. Measuring the costs to completion is a key judgement in 
respect of the revenue recognition on these contracts. As such there is a risk 
that material revenue amounts may either be recognised inaccurately or in 
the incorrect period.
We reviewed the significant contracts across the Group and met with both 
senior management and operational staff to corroborate our understanding of 
the operations and future outcomes of these contracts, including any ongoing 
disputes with customers. We tested the recognition of unbilled revenue for 
evidence to support customer acceptance of the work performed. 
We focused our procedures on revenue where it is subject to 
management’s estimates such as costs incurred versus costs to complete. 
We tested the timing of revenue recognition by reconciling to the contract 
terms and reviewing journal entries impacting revenue. We tested the profit 
taken in the context of the revenue recognition over the life of the contract. 
These procedures included agreement of a sample of significant revenue 
streams to documents such as invoices, evidence of delivery, cash receipts, 
and order variations.
No significant issues arose from our work.
Uncertain tax provisions
The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions and has a number of ongoing 
disputes and investigations with tax authorities where certain tax positions and 
treatments may be successfully challenged at a later date.
There is judgement required in assessing the level of provisions to cover 
the risk of successful challenge of certain of the Group’s tax positions. 
Provisions are held principally in respect of current tax deductions 
previously taken, ongoing tax audits, and uncertainties on the utilisation of 
deferred tax assets (tax losses and excess tax credits).
We evaluated and challenged management’ s rationale for the level of provisions 
held. We considered the status of recent and current tax audits and enquiries, 
the outturn of previous claims, the macro-tax environment in each territory, and 
where necessary the statute of limitations for open enquiries.
We also considered any interest and penalty regimes that could apply 
should any of the tax positions be successfully challenged.
This is an area which requires significant judgement and has a range of 
possible outcomes. However from the evidence we have obtained and 
our challenge on the key assumptions we consider the overall level of 
provisioning in respect of uncertain tax provisions is reasonable in the 
context of our group materiality. 
Independent auditor’s report continued Financial statements Governance Strategic report
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 49
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking 
into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
We scoped the audit by determining the reporting units which are significant for a full scope audit either based on contribution of profit to the Group or 
by inherent risk (for example significant acquisitions in recent years such as Elkhorn and Mitchells). We then looked for reporting units where individual 
account balances were significant to the Group as a whole and scoped these in for specified audit procedures for those account balances.
Where the work was performed by other audit teams, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work by these teams to be 
able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
The Group engagement team in Aberdeen performed audit work at multiple locations in North America and the UK, including Head Office. This was 
supplemented by PwC offices in Australia, Oman, Canada and Guernsey. Together we obtained coverage of 70% of the Group’s revenues and 77% of 
the profit before tax.
Further, specific audit procedures over central functions and areas of significant judgement, including taxation, goodwill, treasury, acquisitions, 
impairment analysis, post-retirement benefits and litigation, were performed at the Group’s head office.
Materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality $23 million (2013: $22 million)
How we determined it Based on 5% of profit before tax
Rationale for benchmark applied
We have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, in the absence of indicators that an 
alternative benchmark would be appropriate
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $1m (2013: $1m) as well as 
misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis 
of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do 
so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information Companies Act 2006 opinions
In our opinion:
 X the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and

(the “Code”), that they consider the annual report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy 
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility.

not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the 
parent company. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with 
nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 22, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland).  
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 X whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 X the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 X the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and 
evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis 
for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by 
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.

(b) EthosEnergy joint venture
The Group’s investment in the EthosEnergy joint venture is recorded 
at the book value of the net assets transferred to the joint venture by 
the Group less cash received and receivable. An impairment review 
was carried out in December 2014 based on the latest budgets and 
forecasts for EthosEnergy using a pre-tax discount rate of 15%. See 
note 10 for further details.
(c) Revenue recognition
Revenue on fixed price or lump sum contracts for services, construction 
contracts and fixed price long-term service agreements is recognised 
according to the stage of completion reached in the contract by 
measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total 
estimated costs. Estimating the costs to completion and therefore 
the total contract costs is a key judgment in respect of the revenue 
recognition on these contracts.
(d) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. 
Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income 
taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on 
estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final outcome 
of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, 
such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
(e) Retirement benefit liabilities
The value of the Group’s retirement benefit liabilities is determined on 
an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. Changes in these 
assumptions will impact the carrying value of the liability. The Group 
determines the appropriate discount rate to be used in the actuarial 
valuation at the end of each financial year following consultation with 
the retirement benefit scheme actuary. In determining the rate used, 
consideration is given to the interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have 
terms to maturity similar to those of the related retirement benefit 
obligation. The Group’s retirement benefit scheme was closed to future 
accrual on 30 June 2014. See note 29 for further details.
(f) Provisions
The Group records provisions where it has a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate of the obligation can be made. Where the outcome is less 
than probable, but more than remote, no provision is recorded but a 
contingent liability is disclosed in the financial statements, if material. 
The recording of provisions is an area which requires the exercise of 
management judgement relating to the nature, timing and probability of 
the liability and typically the Group’s balance sheet includes provisions 
for doubtful debts, inventory and warranty provisions, contract 
provisions (including onerous contracts) and pending legal issues.
Notes to the financial statements 
for the year to 31 December 2014
General information
John Wood Group PLC, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, provide services 
to the oil and gas and power generation industries worldwide. Details of 
the Group’s activities during the year are provided in the Strategic Report. 
John Wood Group PLC is a public limited company, incorporated and 
domiciled in Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
and IFRIC interpretations adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and 
with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The Group financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention 
as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value through the income statement.
Significant accounting policies 
The Group’s significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of 
these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements are the result of the consolidation of the 
financial statements of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings from the date 
of acquisition or up until the date of divestment as appropriate. Subsidiaries 
are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies and generally accompanies a shareholding of more 
than one half of the voting rights. The Group’s interests in joint ventures 
are accounted for using equity accounting. Under this method the Group 
includes its share of joint venture profit on the line ‘Share of post-tax profit 
from joint ventures’ in the Group income statement and its share of joint 
venture net assets in the ‘investment in joint ventures’ line in the Group 
balance sheet. All Group companies apply the Group’s accounting policies 
and prepare financial statements to 31 December.
Critical accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. These estimates 
are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions and actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The 
estimates and assumptions that could result in a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are addressed below.
(a)Impairment of goodwill
The Group carries out impairment reviews whenever events or changes 
in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be 
recoverable. In addition, the Group carries out an annual impairment 
review. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of 
goodwill is less than the carrying amount. The impairment tests are carried 
out by CGU (‘Cash Generating Unit’) and reflect the latest Group budgets. 
The budgets are based on various assumptions relating to the Group’s 
businesses including assumptions relating to market outlook, resource 
utilisation, foreign exchange rates, contract awards and contract margins. 
The outlook for the Group is discussed in the CEO Review.  
Pre-tax discount rates of between 11% and 13% have been used to 
discount the CGU cash flows and a sensitivity analysis has also been 
performed (see note 8). Financial statements Governance Strategic report
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 57
Notes to the financial statements continued
Accounting Policies (continued) 
Functional currency
The Group’s earnings stream is primarily US dollars and the principal 
functional currency is the US dollar, being the most representative 
currency of the Group. The Group’s financial statements are therefore 
prepared in US dollars.
The following exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these 
financial statements:
2014 2013
Average rate £1 = $ 1.6469 1.5673
Closing rate £1 = $ 1.5593 1.6563
Foreign currencies
Income statements of entities whose functional currency is not the 
US dollar are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange 
for the period and assets and liabilities are translated into US dollars 
at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences arising on translation of net assets in such entities held at 
the beginning of the year, together with those differences resulting from 
the restatement of profits and losses from average to year end rates, are 
taken to the currency translation reserve.
In each individual entity, transactions in overseas currencies are 
translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rates 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Where more than one exchange 
rate is available, the appropriate rate at which assets can be readily 
realised and liabilities can be extinguished is used. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Any exchange 
differences are taken to the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated 
equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the 
exchange rate ruling on the date it was raised.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of 
the Group’s activities. Revenue is recognised only when it is probable 
that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow 
to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. 
Revenue from services is recognised as the services are rendered, 
including where they are based on contractual rates per man hour in 
respect of multi-year service contracts. Incentive performance revenue 
is recognised upon completion of agreed objectives. Revenue from 
product sales is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally upon 
delivery of products and customer acceptance, if any. Revenue is stated 
net of sales taxes (such as VAT) and discounts.
Revenue on fixed price or lump sum contracts for services, construction 
contracts and fixed price long-term service agreements is recognised 
according to the stage of completion reached in the contract by 
measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to 
total estimated costs. An estimate of the profit attributable to work 
completed is recognised, on a basis that the directors consider to be 
appropriate, once the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably, 
which is when a contract is not less than 20% complete. Expected 
losses are recognised in full as soon as losses are probable. The net 
amount of costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less the sum 
of recognised losses and progress billings is disclosed within trade and 
other receivables/trade and other payables.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately 
disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Transactions 
which may give rise to exceptional items include gains and losses 
on divestment of businesses, write downs or impairments of assets 
including goodwill, restructuring costs or provisions, litigation 
settlements, provisions for onerous contracts and acquisition and 
divestment costs.
Finance expense/income
Interest income and expense is recorded in the income statement in the 
period to which it relates. Arrangement fees and expenses in respect of 
the Group’s debt facilities are amortised over the period which the Group 
expects the facility to be in place. Interest relating to the unwinding 
of the discount on deferred and contingent consideration liabilities is 
included in finance expense. Interest relating to the Group’s retirement 
benefit scheme is also included in finance expense.
Dividends
Dividends to the Group’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in 
the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid.
Goodwill 
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for 
acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. 
Acquisition costs are expensed in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will be future 
economic benefits attributable to the asset, the cost of the asset can 
be measured reliably, the asset is separately identifiable and there is 
control over the use of the asset. Where the Group acquires a business, 
intangible assets on acquisition such as customer contracts are identified 
and evaluated to determine the carrying value on the acquisition balance 
sheet. Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, as 
follows:
Software and development costs 3-5 years 
Intangible assets on acquisition  3-10 years John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 58
Notes to the financial statements continued
Accounting Policies (continued) 
Property plant and equipment
Property plant and equipment (PP&E) is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. No depreciation is charged with respect to 
freehold land and assets in the course of construction. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the 
following estimated useful lives of the assets:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 25-50 years 
Short leasehold buildings  period of lease 
Plant and equipment   3-10 years
When estimating the useful life of an asset group, the principal factors 
the Group takes into account are the durability of the assets, the 
intensity at which the assets are expected to be used and the expected 
rate of technological developments. Asset lives and residual values are 
assessed at each balance sheet date.
Impairment
The Group performs impairment reviews in respect of PP&E, investment 
in joint ventures and intangible assets whenever events or changes in 
circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
In addition, the Group carries out annual impairment reviews in respect 
of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable 
amount of an asset, which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less 
costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the 
appropriate cash generating unit (‘CGU’). The CGUs are aligned to 
the structure the Group uses to manage its business. Cash flows are 
discounted in determining the value in use.
Inventories
Inventories, which include materials, work in progress and finished 
goods and goods for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Service based businesses’ inventories consist of spare 
parts and other consumables. Serialised parts are costed using the 
specific identification method and other materials are generally costed 
using the first in, first out method. Product based businesses determine 
cost by weighted average cost methods using standard costing to 
gather material, labour and overhead costs. These costs are adjusted, 
where appropriate, to correlate closely the standard costs to the actual 
costs incurred based on variance analysis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 
of business, less the estimated costs of completion and estimated 
selling expenses. Allowance is made for obsolete and slow-moving 
items, based upon annual usage.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and other short-term 
bank deposits with maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts 
are included within borrowings in current liabilities. Where the Group 
uses pooling arrangements with a right of set-off, overdrafts and cash 
are netted and included in the appropriate category depending on the 
net position of the pool.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able 
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
The provision is determined by reference to previous experience of 
recoverability for receivables in each market in which the Group operates.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Deferred and contingent consideration 
Where it is probable that deferred or contingent consideration is payable 
on the acquisition of a business based on an earn out arrangement, an 
estimate of the amount payable is made at the date of acquisition and 
reviewed regularly thereafter, with any change in the estimated liability 
being reflected in the income statement. Changes in the estimated 
liability in respect of acquisitions completed before 31 December 2009 
are reflected in goodwill. Where deferred consideration is payable 
after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an 
appropriate rate of interest.
Taxation
The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred 
tax. Tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the profit reported in the income statement 
due to items that are not taxable or deductible in any period and also 
due to items that are taxable or deductible in a different period. The 
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The 
principal temporary differences arise from depreciation on PP&E, tax 
losses carried forward and, in relation to acquisitions, the difference 
between the fair values of the net assets acquired and their tax base. 
Tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at the balance sheet date 
are used to determine deferred tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging 
activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract 
is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The 
method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the 
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature 
of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as 
either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a 
firm commitment (fair value hedge); (2) hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions (cash flow hedge); or (3) hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations (net investment hedge). Financial statements Governance Strategic report
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 59
Notes to the financial statements continued
Accounting Policies (continued) 
Where hedging is to be undertaken, the Group documents the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the inception 
of the transaction, as well as its risk management objective and strategy 
for undertaking the hedge transaction. The Group also documents 
its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of 
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged 
items. The Group performs effectiveness testing on a quarterly basis.
(a) Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as 
fair value hedges are recorded in administrative expenses in the income 
statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged 
asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
(b) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are 
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the hedging 
reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in administrative expenses (in the case of 
forward contracts) or finance income/expense (in the case of interest 
rate swaps) in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity 
are recycled through the income statement in periods when the hedged 
item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when 
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the 
income statement.
(c) Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted 
for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in 
the currency translation reserve in equity; the gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses 
in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are 
included in administrative expenses in the income statement when the 
foreign operation is disposed of.
(d) Derivatives that are not designated as hedges
Certain derivatives, whilst providing effective economic hedges are 
not designated as hedges. Changes in the fair value of any derivative 
instruments that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognised 
immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value 
of their estimated future cash flows. The fair value of forward foreign 
exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market 
rates at the balance sheet date. The fair values of all derivative financial 
instruments are obtained from valuations provided by financial institutions. 
The carrying values of trade receivables and payables approximate to 
their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future 
contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available 
to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Operating leases
As lessee
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits 
received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease 
are also spread on a straight line basis over the period of lease.
As lessor
Operating lease rental income arising from leased assets is recognised in 
the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Retirement benefit liabilities
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and a number of defined 
contribution schemes. The liability recognised in respect of the defined 
benefit scheme represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations less the fair value of the scheme assets. The assets of this 
scheme are held in separate trustee administered funds. The scheme 
was closed to future accrual on 30 June 2014.
The defined benefit scheme’s assets are measured using fair values. 
Pension scheme liabilities are measured annually by an independent 
actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at the current 
rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and 
currency to the liability. The increase in the present value of the liabilities 
of the Group’s defined benefit scheme expected to arise from employee 
service in the period is charged to operating profit. The interest income 
on scheme assets and the increase during the period in the present 
value of the scheme’s liabilities arising from the passage of time are 
netted and included in finance expense. Re-measurement gains and 
losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in 
full in the period in which they occur. The defined benefit scheme’s net 
assets or net liabilities are recognised in full and presented on the face of 
the balance sheet.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged 
to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
Provisions 
Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products and services 
still under warranty, including claims already received, based on past 
experience. Other provisions are recognised where the Group is deemed 
to have a legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that a transfer of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable 
estimate of the obligation can be made. Where amounts provided are 
payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted 
using an appropriate rate of interest. John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 60
Following the formation of the EthosEnergy joint venture in May 2014,  
all of the Group’s predominantly opex related turbine activities are carried 
out through joint ventures and now managed and reported as part of 
Wood Group PSN. In order to provide visibility over the performance of 
the turbine activities, they are included on a separate line (Wood Group 
PSN – Turbine Activities) in the Group’s management information.
The Chief Executive measures the operating performance of these 
segments using ‘EBITA’ (Earnings before interest, tax and amortisation).
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal management reports provided to the Chief Executive who is 
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments.
Wood Group Engineering offers a wide range of engineering services 
to the upstream, subsea and pipelines, downstream, chemical process 
and industrial and clean energy sectors. These include conceptual 
studies engineering, project and construction management (‘EPCM’) 
and control system upgrades. Wood Group PSN Production Services 
offers production facilities support focused on optimising production 
and extending asset life safely. Wood Group PSN Production Services 
provides life of field services to producing assets through brownfield 
engineering and modifications, production enhancement, operations and 
management, facility construction and maintenance management training, 
and abandonment services. Wood Group PSN Turbine Activities provides 
industrial gas turbine and rotating equipment repair, maintenance, overhaul 
and power plant EPC services to the oil and gas and power sectors.
Disclosure of impact of new and future accounting standards 
(a) Amended standards and interpretations 
The following relevant standards and amendments and interpretations 
to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the 
Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014:
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’
• IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’
There has been no material impact on the financial statements on the 
adoption of IFRS 10, nor IFRS 12.
Until 31 December 2013, the Group accounted for its interests in 
joint ventures using proportional consolidation. As IFRS 11 does not 
permit proportional consolidation, from 1 January 2014, for all periods 
presented, the Group has accounted for its interests in joint ventures 
using equity accounting. The use of equity accounting has no impact 
on Group profit for the year or earnings per share, but does impact 
the presentation of the Group’s interests in joint ventures in the income 
statement, the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. Comparative 
figures have been restated to reflect the change to equity accounting. 
For further details see note 36 to the financial statements. 
 
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing 
standards that are not yet effective and have not been early 
adopted by the Group 
The following relevant standards and amendments and interpretations 
to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the 
Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, but 
the Group has not early adopted them:
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ was published 
in May 2014 and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2017. The Group is in the process of assessing the 
likely impact of this standard on the financial statements.

Accounting Policies (continued) 
Share based charges relating to employee share schemes
The Group has a number of employee share schemes:-
(i) Share options granted under Executive Share Option Schemes 
(‘ESOS’) are granted at market value. A charge is booked to the income 
statement as an employee benefit expense for the fair value of share 
options expected to be exercised, accrued over the vesting period. 
The corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings. The fair value is 
calculated using an option pricing model.
(ii) Share options granted under the Long Term Retention Plan (‘LTRP’) 
are granted at par value. The charge to the income statement for LTRP 
shares is also calculated using an option pricing model and, as with ESOS 
grants, the fair value of the share options expected to be exercised is 
accrued over the vesting period. The corresponding credit is also taken to 
retained earnings.
(iii) The Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for executive directors 
and certain senior executives was in place from 2008 to 2012. Participants 
are awarded shares or share options dependent on the achievement of 
performance targets. The charge to the income statement for shares 
awarded under the LTIP is based on the fair value of those shares at the 
grant date, spread over the vesting period. The corresponding credit is 
taken to retained earnings. For those awards that have a market related 
performance measure, the fair value of the market related element is 
calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
(iv) The Group’s Long Term Cash Incentive Plan (‘LTCIP’) for senior 
management was in place in 2011 and 2012. Participants are paid a cash 
bonus dependent on the achievement of performance targets. The charge 
to the income statement is based on the fair value of the awards and is 
linked to movements in the Group’s share price. The charge is spread over 
the vesting period with the corresponding credit being recorded in liabilities.
(v) During 2013, the Group introduced the Long Term Plan (‘LTP’) to replace 
the LTRP , LTIP and LTCIP . The LTP comprises two separate awards, an 
award of share options on a similar basis to the LTRP and an award of 
shares or share options on a broadly similar basis to the LTIP scheme. 
The charge to the income statement for the LTP is as outlined for the 
LTRP and LTIP above with the corresponding credit being recorded in 
retained earnings.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share 
capital and share premium.
Share capital
John Wood Group PLC has one class of ordinary shares and these are 
classified as equity. Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a 
liability or charged to equity until they have been approved by shareholders. 
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and 
costs of its employee share trusts, therefore they have been consolidated 
in the financial statements of the Group. Shares acquired by and disposed 
of by the employee share trusts are recorded at cost. The cost of shares 
held by the employee share trusts is deducted from equity.
Segmental reporting
The Group has determined that its operating segments are based 
on management reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (‘CODM’), the Group’s Chief Executive. The Group’s reportable 
segments are Wood Group Engineering and Wood Group PSN.  Financial statements Governance Strategic report

1 Segmental reporting 
The Group operates through two segments, Wood Group Engineering and Wood Group PSN. Following the formation of the EthosEnergy joint 
venture in May 2014, all of the Group’s predominantly opex related turbine activities are carried out through joint ventures and now managed and 
reported as part of Wood Group PSN. In order to provide visibility over the performance of the turbine activities, they are included on a separate line in 
the table below (Wood Group PSN – Turbine Activities). This presentation is consistent with the Group’s internal management reporting. Under IFRS 
11 ‘Joint arrangements’, the Group is now required to account for joint ventures using equity accounting, however for management reporting the 
Group continues to use proportional consolidation, hence the inclusion of the proportional presentation in this note.
The segment information provided to the Group’s Chief Executive for the reportable operating segments for the year ended 31 December 2014

Notes
1. The Group’s reportable segments are Wood Group Engineering and Wood Group PSN. Following the formation of the EthosEnergy joint venture in May 2014, all of the Group’s 
predominantly opex related Turbine Activities are carried out through joint ventures and managed and reported as part of Wood Group PSN. In order to provide visibility over the 
performance of the Turbine Activities, they are included on a separate line (Wood Group PSN – Turbine Activities) above.
2. Total EBITDA represents operating profit of $486.0m (2013 : $431.4m) before depreciation of property plant and equipment of $61.0m (2013 : $51.9m), amortisation of $101.2m (2013 : 
$102.1m) and net exceptional income of $37.6m (2013 : $0.5m). EBITA represents EBITDA less depreciation. EBITA and EBITDA are provided as they are units of measurement used by 
the Group in the management of its business.
3. Central costs include the costs of certain management personnel in both the UK and the US, along with an element of Group infrastructure costs. Central operating profit in 2014 is 
stated after deducting $23.0m of exceptional costs relating to the formation of the EthosEnergy joint venture.
4. Profit from discontinued operations, net of tax, represents the profit from the Wood Group GTS businesses transferred to EthosEnergy in May 2014. The profit from discontinued 
operations for 2013 also includes additional profit relating to the Well Support business divested in 2011. See note 27 for further details.

5  Taxation (continued)
Tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The expected rate is the weighted average rate 
taking into account the Group’s profits in these jurisdictions. The expected rate has decreased in 2014 due to the change in mix of the tax jurisdictions 
in which the Group operates. The tax charge for the year is lower (2013: lower) than the expected tax charge due to the following factors:

attributes and expenditure which is not allowable as a deduction for tax purposes.

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to owners of the parent divided by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held by the Group’s employee share trusts. For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. The Group’s 
dilutive ordinary shares comprise share options granted to employees under Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long Term Retention Plan and 
shares and share options awarded under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan and Long Term Plan. Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per 
share are disclosed to show the results excluding the impact of exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’, goodwill was tested for impairment during the year. The impairment tests were carried out against 
the Group’s Cash Generating Units (‘CGU’), being the key Strategic Business Units (‘SBUs’) within the operating divisions, which are aligned with 
how the Group manages and monitors performance.  John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 70

8 Goodwill and intangible assets (continued)
Value-in-use calculations have been prepared for each CGU using the cash flow projections included in the financial budgets approved by 
management for 2015 and 2016. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3% per annum for a further three year period. 
A terminal value is applied thereafter in order to calculate long term estimated cash flows using the same anticipated long term growth rate of 3% 
across all CGUs. The growth rate used does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate. The cash 
flows have been discounted using pre-tax discount rates appropriate for each CGU.

Details of the key assumptions underlying the cash flows are included in critical accounting judgements and estimates in the Accounting Policies on 
page 56.
The value-in-use has been compared to the carrying value for each CGU. No goodwill has been written off during the current or prior year.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the expected long-term growth rate falls to 2% and that the discount rates are 1% higher 
than those above in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review. This analysis did 
not identify any impairment.
Intangibles arising on acquisition include the valuation of customer contracts and customer relationships recognised on business combinations.  Financial statements Governance Strategic report

The Group’s joint venture with Siemens, EthosEnergy Group Limited was formed in May 2014. Wood Group contributed net assets of $541.8m 
to the joint venture. Cash received and receivable of $157.4m was netted against that amount and the net investment in EthosEnergy at date 
of formation was $384.4m (see note 27). The value of the investment at 31st December 2014 was $360.2m, reflecting the post-tax results of 
EthosEnergy for the 8 months and foreign exchange losses on the retranslation of the underlying net assets.
An impairment review was carried out in December 2014 based on the latest budgets and forecasts for EthosEnergy, the results of which are shown 
in the following table.
Pre-tax discount rate 15%
Terminal growth rate 3%

10 Investment in joint ventures (continued)
The impairment test was based on the budgeted and forecast cash flows for the business. The calculation shows headroom of $31.7m using a 15% 
pre-tax discount rate and a 3% terminal growth rate.
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the basis that the expected long-term growth rate falls to 2% and the discount rate is increased by 1% in 
order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review. The results of the sensitivity analysis 
are shown in the following table.
Pre-tax discount rate 15% 16%
Terminal growth rate 2% 3%
Net present value of future post-tax cash flows $361.2m $350.1m
Book value of investment $360.2m $360.2m
Headroom $1.0m $(10.1)m
The sensitivity analysis shows that a 1% reduction in growth rate results in $1.0m headroom and a 1% increase in the discount rate results in a $10.1m 
shortfall. EthosEnergy has only been in operation for eight months and the carrying value of the investment will continue to be monitored going forward. 
The joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed, nor has the Group any significant contingent liabilities in 
relation to its interest in the joint ventures. The name and principal activities of the most significant joint ventures is disclosed in note 35.

Receivable days are calculated by allocating the closing trade receivables balance to current and prior year revenue including sales taxes. A receivable 
days calculation of 58 indicates that closing trade receivables represent the most recent 58 days of revenue. A provision for the impairment of trade 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the 
original receivables.

17 Financial instruments
The Group’s activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse 
impact on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Group’s Treasury policies. Group Treasury, together with the Group’s 
business units identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks. The Group’s Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
Where the Board considers that a material element of the Group’s profits and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is significant  
geo-political uncertainty a strategy is agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised. John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 78
Notes to the financial statements continued
17 Financial instruments (continued)
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies. The Group has a number of subsidiary companies whose revenue 
and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Where possible, the Group's policy is to eliminate all significant currency 
exposures on revenues at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts. Changes in the forward 
contract fair values are booked through the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used in which case the change in fair value is 
recorded in equity. 
The Group does not have any financial instruments in place to hedge foreign currency movements in its balance sheet. However, strategies such as 
payment of intercompany dividends are used to minimise the amount of net assets exposed to foreign currency revaluation.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to 
minimise any foreign currency exposure. 
The Group’s largest foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling/US dollar exchange rate. Movements in the sterling/US dollar rate 
impact the translation of sterling profit earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets. The potential impact of changes in 
the sterling/US dollar exchange rate is summarised in the table below. As the Group reports in US dollars a strengthening of the pound has a positive 
impact on translation of its sterling companies’ profits and net assets.
2014 2013
$m $m
Impact of 10% change to average £/$ exchange rate on profit after tax 12.3 15.1
Impact of 10% change to closing £/$ exchange rate on equity 72.9 59.4
10% has been used in these calculations as it represents a reasonable possible change in the sterling/US dollar exchange rate. The Group also has 
foreign exchange risk in relation a number of other currencies, in particular, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the Norwegian kroner.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and debt. The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of 
interest and then uses interest rate swaps into fixed rates to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Group's exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations. At 31 December 2014, 89% (2013: 24%) of the Group's bank borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps. 
The increase during the year is due to the repayment of most of the Group’s floating rate debt following the issue of senior loan notes in the US private 
placement market. If the senior loan notes are taken into account the percentage of debt at fixed rate increases to 97%. 
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit. The Group’s policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring 
that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of ‘A ’ or better , where possible. If average interest rates had been 1% higher or 
lower during 2014 (2013: 1%), post-tax profit for the year would have been $2.7m lower or higher respectively (2013: $2.4m). 1% has been used in this 
calculation as it represents a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
(iii) Price risk
The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
(b) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables. The Group’s operations comprise Wood Group Engineering and Wood Group PSN, 
each of which is made up of a number of businesses. Responsibility for managing credit risks lies within the businesses with support being provided by 
Group and divisional management where appropriate.
A customer evaluation is typically obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency. Where required, appropriate trade finance instruments such as 
letters of credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance will be used to manage credit risk.
The Group’s major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. Where a 
customer does not have sufficiently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments referred to above may be 
obtained. The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for 
impairment of trade receivables.
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance. There is significant management 
focus on receivables that are overdue. A table showing trade receivables and receivable days is provided in note 12. Receivable days calculations are 
not provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is a relevant metric.
The Group also has credit risk in relation to cash held on deposit. The Group’s policy is to deposit cash at institutions with a credit rating of ‘A’ or better 
where possible. 100% of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2014 (2013: 81%) was held with such institutions. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

(c) Liquidity risk
With regard to liquidity, the Group’s main priority is to ensure continuity of funding. At 31 December 2014, 89% (2013: 84%) of the Group’s 
borrowing facilities were due to mature in more than one year. Based on the current outlook the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its 
future obligations. During 2014, the Group issued US$375m of unsecured senior loan notes in the US private placement market. The notes were 
issued at a mix of 7, 10 and 12 year maturities. In January 2015, the Group extended its bilateral facilities of $950m to January 2020.
(d) Capital risk
The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure. The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and when 
applicable, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. These ratios are calculated using the proportionally consolidated figures used for management reporting.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by equity attributable to owners of the parent. Gearing at 31 December 2014 was 11.6% (2013: 12.9%).
Interest cover is calculated by dividing total EBITA by net finance expense. Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2014 was 22.7 times  
(2013: 28.7 times).
The ratio of net debt to total EBITDA at 31 December 2014 was 0.5 (2013: 0.5).
Financial liabilities
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date 
to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Drawdowns under the bilateral 
bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and therefore loan interest payable is excluded from the amounts below.

Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
The fair value of short-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term deposits and cash at bank and in hand 
approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of interest rates in respect of these instruments. Drawdowns under long-term 
bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same. 
Details of derivative financial instruments are not disclosed in the financial statements as they are not material.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As these earnings are continually reinvested by 
the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. 
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of $93.7m (2013: $51.1m) to carry forward against future taxable income.

20 Share based charges 
The Group currently has a number of share schemes that give rise to share based charges. These are the Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’), the 
Long Term Retention Plan (‘LTRP’), the Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), the Long Term Cash Incentive Plan (‘LTCIP’) and the Long Term Plan (‘LTP’). 
The LTP replaced the LTRP , LTIP and LTCIP in 2013. The charge to operating profit in 2014 for these schemes amounted to $17.4m (2013: $22.4m). 
$18.2m (2013: $21.0m) relating to the charge has been credited to retained earnings and $0.8m (2013: $1.4m charge) has been deducted from liabilities 
reflecting a credit to operating profit for the year in respect of 2013 true-ups to the LTCIP , which is a cash settled scheme. 
In addition, accelerated charges of $4.8m have been booked to exceptional items in the period relating to employees who transferred to the EthosEnergy 
joint venture. $1.3m of this amount is credited to equity and $3.5m, representing the cash amount payable to former Group employees in compensation 
for loss of the options, is credited to non-current liabilities.
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below.
ESOS and LTRP
For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used. Based on past experience, 
it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, 
and there will be a lapse rate of between 20% for ESOS and 25% for LTRP . The share price volatility used in the calculation of 40% is based on the 
actual volatility of the Group’s shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies. The risk free rate of return is based on the implied yield 
available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) was in place from 2008 to 2012. Under this Scheme, the executive directors and certain senior executives 
were awarded shares or share options dependent upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee.  
The performance measures for the LTIP were EBITA, OCER (ratio of operating capital employed to revenue), total shareholder return and adjusted 
diluted earnings per share. The LTIP awards are in the form of shares or share options and forfeitable restricted shares or share options. 20% of any 
award earned over the three year performance cycle is deferred for a further two years in the form of forfeitable restricted shares or share options.
Long Term Plan
The Group’s Long Term Plan (‘LTP’) was introduced during 2013 to replace the LTRP , LTIP and LTCIP . Two distinct awards will be made under LTP .
Nil value share options will be awarded on the same basis as awards under the LTRP (see above). Awards to former LTIP and LTCIP participants 
will be made on a broadly similar basis to LTIP with the performance measures being EBITA, total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings 
per share. Participants may be granted conditional share awards or nil cost options at the start of the cycle. Performance is measured over a three 
year period and up to 80% of an award may vest based on the performance over that period. The vesting of at least 20% of any award is normally 
deferred for a further period of at least two years.
Performance based awards
Details of the LTIP/LTP awards are set out in the table below. The charge for market related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte 
Carlo simulation model taking account of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected 
lifetime of the award. Further details of the LTIP/LTP are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Options issuable at 31/12/14 - - 616,202 - -
The awards outstanding under cycles 3 and 4 represent 20% of the award at vesting which is deferred for two years. The options issuable under 
cycle 5 are estimated based on anticipated achievement against the set targets.
Further details on the LTP are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
LTCIP
The share based charge for the LTCIP for cycle 4 and 5 was calculated using a fair value of £5.95 (2013: £6.62). The fair value is calculated using 
a Black-Scholes option pricing model using similar assumptions to those used for ESOS and LTRP above. Payments under the LTCIP are linked to 
movements in the Group’s share price. John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 82

The Group has used acquisition accounting for the purchases and, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, the goodwill arising on 
consolidation of $200.0m has been capitalised. The table reflects payments in respect of deferred and contingent consideration made in relation to 
acquisitions in prior periods. 
During the year the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Agility Projects AS, 100% of the share capital of Cape Software Inc, 100% of the share 
capital of Sunstone Projects Ltd and 100% of the share capital of Swaggart Brothers Inc. The Group also acquired the assets of Meesters. Due to its 
size, the acquisition of Agility Projects AS is considered material and has been presented separately in the table above. The other acquisitions are not 
considered to be material on an individual basis and therefore have been aggregated above.
The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Group’s wider client base and use the Group’s resources to further grow and develop 
their businesses. These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised on the acquisitions. 
Provisional fair value adjustments of $27.6m, representing the fair value of customer contracts, have been recorded in relation to the acquisitions 
made in the year. Other provisional fair value adjustments of $2.8m have also been recorded. Trade and other receivables acquired of $87.4m are 
expected to be recovered in full.
The outflow of cash and cash equivalents in respect of acquisitions is analysed as follows:
$m
Cash consideration 267.8
Cash acquired (13.6)
Borrowings acquired 8.7
Cash outflow 262.9
Included in the cash outflow above are deferred and contingent consideration payments of $40.8m made during the year in respect of acquisitions 
made in prior periods and $4.8m in respect of the acquisition of non-controlling interests. John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 88

Divestments
In May 2014, the Group’s joint venture with Siemens, EthosEnergy Group Limited was formed. Whilst the Group has a 51% shareholding in the new 
entity, all significant decision making requires unanimous consent from both parties and therefore the Group does not have control and the new company 
is accounted for as a joint venture. The transaction was accounted for under IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ as follows -:

Net impact of transaction included in exceptional items per note 4 23.0
The value of the Group’s investment in EthosEnergy represents the fair value of the net assets disposed. 
Under the joint venture agreement the Group received a 51% ownership interest in EthosEnergy and EthosEnergy was required to pay the Group 
$70.0m, of which $21.0m was paid during 2014. In addition, an estimated $87.4m is payable by EthosEnergy in respect of post close adjustments for 
items including working capital and indebtedness at the date of formation. $37.6m of this amount was received during 2014. Foreign exchange losses 
of $7.0m which were recorded in the currency translation reserve in prior years have been recycled through the income statement as required by IAS 21 
‘The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates’. Further details of the accelerated share based charges are provided in note 20.
The results of the Wood Group businesses transferred to EthosEnergy are shown as profit from discontinued operations in the Group income statement. 
EBITA losses for the four month period were $1.7m, operating losses (after deducting the $23.0m disposal costs above) were $27.3m, and losses after 
tax were $25.9m. Cash outflows from discontinued operations amounted to $24.3m, comprising $12.7m operating cash outflows, $7.1m investing 
cash outflows and $4.5m financing cash outflows. At 31 December 2013 the assets and liabilities that the Group anticipated transferring to EthosEnergy 
were classified as held for sale. 
During the year, the Group disposed of one of its South American businesses for net proceeds of $1.7m. No gain or loss was recorded on the 
transaction, the net assets having already been written down in 2013.

29 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme, which is contracted out 
of the State Scheme, and a number of defined contribution plans. The assets of the defined benefits scheme are held separately from those of the 
Group, being invested with independent investment companies in trustee administered funds. From April 2007 members accrued benefits under the 
scheme on a ‘CARE’ (Career Averaged Revalued Earnings) basis. On 30 June 2014, the scheme was closed to future accrual. A past service gain of 
£4.0m ($6.7m) arose as a result of the closure of the scheme and this amount has been credited to administrative expenses in the income statement.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2013 by a professionally qualified actuary. On closure of the scheme 
to future accrual, £7.5m was paid by the Group to reduce the scheme deficit. The Group has also agreed to pay deficit reduction contributions of 
£1.7m per annum from 2014 until 2021. At 31 December 2014, there were no active members (2013: 241), 330 pensioners (2013: 286) and 837 
deferred members (2013: 654) of the scheme.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were:

Discount rate 3.6 4.5
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries N/A 5.4
Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.1 3.4

At 31 December 2014, the mortality assumption used to determine pension liabilities is based on the most recent mortality tables which consider 
UK wide mortality data relevant to the Group’s pension scheme. The mortality rates are then adjusted to allow for expected future improvements in 
mortality using up to date projections. The mortality assumption can be fully described as PXA00 CMI_2012 (1.25%).

Scheme risks
The retirement benefit scheme is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are –
Volatility
The defined benefit obligation is measured with reference to corporate bond yields and if scheme assets underperform relative to this yield, this will 
create a deficit, all other things being equal. The scheme investments are well diversified such that the failure of a single investment would not have a 
material impact on the overall level of assets.
Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the defined benefit obligation. This would however be offset to some extent by a corresponding 
increase in the value of the scheme’s bond asset holdings.
Inflation risk
The majority of benefits in deferment and in payment are linked to price inflation so higher actual inflation and higher assumed inflation will increase 
the defined benefit obligation.
Life expectancy 
The defined benefit obligation is generally made up of benefits payable for life and so increases to members’ life expectancies will increase the 
defined benefit obligation, all other things being equal. John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 92
Notes to the financial statements continued
29 Retirement benefit obligations (continued) 
Sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation
The impact of changes to the key assumptions on the retirement benefit obligation is shown below. The sensitivity is based on a change in an 
assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant.In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be 
correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied 
as when calculating the pension obligation recognised in the Group balance sheet.  
Assumption Change Impact on obligation

Rate of retail prices index inflation 0.1% $3.3m
Rate of consumer price index inflation 0.1% $1.2m

The Group leases various offices and facilities under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The leases have various terms, escalation clauses

31 Contingent liabilities
At the balance sheet date the Group had cross guarantees without limit extended to its principal bankers in respect of sums advanced to subsidiaries. 
The Group is aware of potential legal challenges which may affect historic and future employment costs and may have an impact on the Group.  
At this point it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the liability, if any, that may arise and therefore no provision has been made.
From time to time and in the normal course of business the Group is notified of legal claims in respect of work carried out. Management believe that 
the Group is in a strong position to defend these claims. In addition, the Group is currently cooperating with investigations in relation to facilities where 
it provides or previously provided services. Management do not believe that it is probable that any material liability will arise from any of these matters.

The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 have been restated as a result of the introduction of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’. 
Previously, the Group used proportional consolidation to account for its interests in joint ventures. Under IFRS 11, equity accounting must be used to 
account for interests in joint ventures and therefore these periods have been restated accordingly.

Report on the Parent Company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, John Wood Group PLC’s parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 X give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014;
 X have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 X have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
John Wood Group PLC’s financial statements comprise:
 X the Balance sheet as at 31 December 2014; and
 X the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the annual report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are 
cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
Opinions on matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 X we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 X adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 X the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. Financial statements Governance Strategic report

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 X whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 X the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 X the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and 
evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis 
for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by 
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
for the year to 31st December 2014
Accounting policies
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom. A summary of 
the principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is 
set out below.
Reporting currency
The Company’s transactions are primarily US dollar denominated and 
the principal functional currency is the US dollar.
The following sterling to US dollar exchange rates have been used in the 
preparation of these financial statements:-
2014 2013
Average rate £1 = $ 1.6469 1.5673
Closing rate £1 = $ 1.5593 1.6563
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are included 
in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less any provision for 
impairment.
Impairment
The Company performs impairment reviews in respect of fixed asset 
investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss 
is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the 
higher of the asset’s net realisable value and its value in use, is less than 
its carrying amount.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates 
ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward contracts have 
been arranged, at the contractual rates. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates 
ruling at the balance sheet dates or at a contractual rate if applicable 
and any exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated 
equity share capital in the financial statements of John Wood Group PLC 
at the exchange rate ruling on the date it was raised.
Financial instruments
The accounting policy for financial instruments is consistent with 
the Group accounting policy as presented in the notes to the Group 
financial statements with the exception of the policy on net investment 
hedges which does not apply to the Company. The Company’s financial 
risk management policy is consistent with the Group’s financial risk 
management policy outlined in note 17 to the Group financial statements. 
Use of estimates
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at 
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Employee share trusts
The Company is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income 
and costs of its employee share trusts. They have therefore been 
included in the financial statements of the Company. Under UITF 38 
the cost of shares held by the employee share trusts is deducted from 
shareholders’ funds.
Share based charges
The Company has a number of share schemes as detailed in the Group 
accounting policies and note 20 to the Group financial statements.  
Details relating to the calculation of share based charges are provided in 
note 20 to the Group financial statements. In respect of the Company, 
the charge is shown as an increase in the Company’s investments, as 
the employees to which the charge relates are employed by subsidiary 
companies.
Taxation
The tax expense in the profit and loss account represents the sum of 
taxes currently payable and deferred taxes. The tax currently payable 
is based on taxable profit for the year and the Company’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Taxable profit 
differs from profit as reported in the profit and loss account because 
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible 
in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible.
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary 
differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that a taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an 
undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists 
to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred 
taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the 
Company to make a single net payment.
Tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are 
credited or charged to equity. Otherwise, tax is recognised in the profit 
and loss account.
Dividends
Dividends to the Group’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Dividend 
income is credited to the profit and loss account when the dividend has 
been approved by the board of directors of the subsidiary company 
making the payment. John Wood Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 102

6 Financial instruments
Financial risk factors
The Company’s activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk), credit 
risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential 
adverse impact on the Company’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Group’s Treasury policies which are approved by the Board of 
Directors. Group Treasury identify, evaluate and where appropriate hedge financial risks. The Group Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies. Where possible the Company’s policy is to eliminate all significant 
currency exposures at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts. Changes in the forward contract 
fair values are booked through the profit and loss account.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Company finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and debt. The company borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of 
interest and then uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Company’s exposure to interest 
rate fluctuations. At 31 December 2014, 100% (2013: 30%) of the Company’s borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit. The Company’s policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst 
ensuring that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a cr edit rating of ‘A’ or better, where possible.
(iii) Price risk
The Company is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
(b) Credit risk
The Company’s credit risk primarily relates to its inter-company loans and inter-company receivables. Management believe that no further risk 
provision is required in excess of the current provision for impairment.
The Company also has credit risk in relation to cash balances or cash held on deposit. The Company’s policy is to deposit cash at institutions with 
an ‘A’ rating or better where possible. There was no cash held on deposit at 31 December 2014.
(c) Liquidity risk
With regard to liquidity, the Group’ s policy is to ensure continuity of funding. At 31 December 2014, 100% (2013: 100%) of the Company’ s borrowing 
facilities were due to mature in more than one year. Based on the current outlook the Company has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
(d) Capital risk
The Company’s capital risk is determined by that of the Group.

Information for shareholders
Payment of dividends
The Company declares its dividends in US dollars. As a result of the shareholders being mainly UK based, dividends will be paid in sterling, but if you 
would like to receive your dividend in US dollars please contact the Registrars at the address below. All shareholders will receive dividends in sterling 
unless requested. If you are a UK based shareholder, the Company encourages you to have your dividends paid through the BACS (Banker’s Automated 
Clearing Services) system. The benefit of the BACS payment method is that the Registrars post the tax vouchers directly to the shareholders, whilst the 
dividend is credited on the payment date to the shareholder’s Bank or Building Society account. UK shareholders who have not yet arranged for their 
dividends to be paid direct to their Bank or Building Society account and wish to benefit from this service should contact the Registrars at the address 
below. Sterling dividends will be translated at the closing mid-point spot rate on 10 April 2015 as published in the Financial Times on 11 April 2015.

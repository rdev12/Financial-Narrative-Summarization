01 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Delivering value  
Driving further growth
Strong operating  
track record
Throughout our corporate history, we have  
built a sustainable track record of delivering on  
our promises. We have beaten our production 
guidance for four consecutive years, despite 
challenging market conditions from 2013-2015. 
This success is underpinned by the quality  
of our high-grade assets, strong management 
team and a robust operational risk management 
system. Crucially, we generated substantial free 
cash flow throughout the period.
in 2015, Polymetal continued to deliver 
solid production results, producing 
1.27 Moz of gold equivalent. The 
production guidance was exceeded  
by 4%. This was achieved against the 
backdrop of depressed gold and silver 
prices, and continued macroeconomic 
instability. Our operational results  
were driven by a better than expected 
performance at Dukat, which has 
increased both underground mining 
and processing capacity, and a solid 
performance across the rest of the 
asset portfolio. 
Operational highlights in 2015 included 
the performance at Dukat, where the 
total ore mined at the underground 
mines grew 13% year-on-year to  
2.2 Mt and underground development 
increased 11% year-on-year to  
match the increased mill throughput.  
The silver grades were stronger than 
expected, contributing to a record 27.4 
Moz silver production (up 15% year-on-
year). n otably, our flagship amursk 
POX plant performed above its original 
design parameters in terms of recovery 
for the blend of albazino and Mayskoye 
concentrates, which were at a 
consistent 94% level throughout  
the year. We have commenced 
underground mining at albazino’s  
Olga zone which will complement  
the feed from the existing anfisa pit. 
importantly, all of our assets generate 
free cash flow at significantly lower 
commodity price levels. This is due 
both to high grades and, more recently, 
the significant devaluation of the 
r ussian r ouble and Kazakh Tenge.

03 02 Polymetal International plc annual r eport & accounts 2015 annual r eport & accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Kyzyl is known for its complex  
double refractory ore and challenging 
underground conditions. So, despite  
a sizeable resource and high grade,  
this project had not been successfully 
developed by its previous owners. 
Polymetal, on the back of its excellent 
track record in open-pit mining and 
trading refractory gold concentrates, 
has adopted a different approach. 
During the first nine years of its  
22-year mine life, the deposit will be  
run as an open-pit mine, switching  
to underground at a later stage. 
additionally, instead of investing 
significant capital in downstream 
processing upfront, Polymetal  
is building a conventional flotation plant 
on-site, with concentrate to be shipped 
to one of our offtake partners in China.
This approach significantly reduces 
capital intensity and operational risk, 
resulting in a superior return on capital 
and cash flow generation. among 
major gold development projects 
worldwide, Kyzyl is prominent because 
of its long mine life and significantly 
lower-per-ounce capital expenditure  
as well as its short-and-clear path  
to production. Kyzyl will be the main 
source of medium-term growth 
for Polymetal.

at Kyzyl
Acquired in September 2014, Kyzyl is progressing 
well towards its scheduled launch in Q3 2018.  
In 2015, the completed feasibility study confirmed 
the viability of polymetal’s approach: initial  
mining with a large open pit and the sale of 
flotation concentrate – an approach characterised 
by lower operational risk and capital intensity. 
This enabled the Board to give the go-ahead  
for construction to start in Q2 2016.

allows us to pursue longer-term growth 
opportunities. This was certainly the 
case in 2015, when we were able

projects with high-option values  
at attractive prices.
Our key greenfield exploration project 
currently is the v iksha Pg M (platinum

also acquired Primorskoye, a silver/gold 
site 215 km from our Omsukchan 
concentrator, which fits well into  
our portfolio of near-mine advanced 
exploration projects. We also acquired 
l ichkvaz, in armenia, where initial 
exploration has started and a JOr C-
compliant resource estimate  
is expected later in 2016.
We have begun an exciting joint  
venture with Polyus g old to develop 
n ezhdaninskoye, the fourth largest  
gold deposit in r ussia (based on g KZ 
resources), with significant potential  
for high-grade ore and a long mine life.

While Kyzyl is on track to deliver production 
growth from 2018, we still need to ensure  
that there are further sources of growth in the 
pipeline. We accomplish this through continuous 
investment in greenfield exploration projects  
and opportunistic M&A activity. With acquisitions, 
the commodity cycle is currently at an ideal  
stage for acquiring high-optionality assets  
at attractive valuations.

What makes us different
Investing in exploration
investment in both greenfield and near-mine exploration 
provides us with a cost-effective increase in our reserve 
base and, along with successful acquisitions, is the key 
source of our long-term growth.
Hub-based system
Our centralised hub-based system handles ores from 
different sources, achieving economies of scale by 
minimising processing and logistics costs, as well as 
capital spending per ounce. This facilitates production  
at otherwise-uneconomical medium- and small-sized 
near-plant deposits.
Focus on high-grade assets
r eturn on investment in the precious metals industry  
is reliant on grades and mining conditions. We achieve 
better returns and lower risks from our project portfolio  
by setting appropriate thresholds on head grades and 
largely focusing on open-pit mines.
Strong capital discipline
We engender a strong focus on capital discipline 
throughout the business; maximising risk-adjusted  
return on capital is our priority in all investment decisions. 
We do not retain excess cash and return free cash flow  
to shareholders through substantial dividend payments 
while retaining a safe leverage level.
Exemplary governance
We believe that good corporate governance is key to  
the ongoing success of the business and value creation  
for our shareholders. We are compliant with all regulatory 
requirements and adopt best practice in nurturing 
sustainable relationships with all our stakeholders in 
government, industry and the communities in which  
we operate.
Operational excellence
We pride ourselves on our operational excellence and 
delivering on our promises to shareholders. Despite difficult 
trading conditions, we beat our production guidance for 
the fourth consecutive year.

Chairman’s statement
Dear fellow stakeholders
i am delighted to report that, despite the challenges  
in end markets for our products and currency volatilty, 
Polymetal has again delivered a solid set of operating  
and financial results. 
While depressed commodity prices and geopolitical 
pressures continued to dominate in 2015, making market 
conditions ever-more difficult for the global gold mining 
industry, Polymetal’s fundamental strengths have enabled  
us to continue making good progress.
The price of gold declined by 8% in 2015. The silver price 
was 18% lower. The price of copper and other non-precious 
minerals remained depressed suggesting an end of the 
commodity super-cycle. 
 
The rapid decline in the price of oil had a major impact on the 
economies of both r ussia and Kazakhstan, where Polymetal 
operates, resulting in currency devaluation, recession and 
increased inflation levels. The devaluation itself had a positive 
effect on the business, significantly reducing our r ouble- and 
Tenge-denominated costs. However, greater macroeconomic 
instability did impact our operations and created challenges 
for local governments and our own employees 
as consumers.
Our g roup Chief executive, v italy n esis, reports in more 
detail about our performance on the following pages.
Dividends
Strong free cash flow generation remains a key differentiator 
for Polymetal. g enerating a healthy free cash flow of  
u S$263 million during the year coupled with a strong 
balance sheet, we continued to translate this into cash 
returns for our investors.
The Company paid out u S$127 million in special dividends  
in 2015. This brings the total amount of dividends declared 
during 2015 to u S$216 million, an increase of almost 25%  
on last year’s total of u S$173 million. Despite global and  
local challenges, Polymetal remains fully committed  
to delivering value to its shareholders.
Increased focus on health and safety is vital
i am extremely sad to report that we lost six of our colleagues 
at our operations during 2015. i would like to offer my 
personal condolences, along with those of the Board,  
to all their families and friends. 
With the increased scope of underground mining across  
our operating mines and the geotechnical complexities that 
this entails, we must intensify our focus on improving the 
safety of underground operations and preventative risk 
management. With this objective, the Board has now 
established a dedicated Safety & Sustainability Committee. 
We are determined to turn the situation around in 2016 and 
the Committee has already begun an in-depth review of the 
safety and environmental management systems, along with 
the measures and incentives currently in place for better 
safety performance. 
Capital discipline secures future
The Board upholds the principles of good corporate 
governance with clear and accountable reporting practices 
that ensure proper balance sheet management and  
an appropriate approach to leverage by the Company.  
The capital discipline we impose on all investment and 
operational decisions has enabled us – even in a depressed 
commodity cycle – to be confident about the business 
choices we make. in the current complex macroeconomic 
conditions, we remain committed to maintaining a healthy 
dividend stream whilst continuing to pursue value creating 
growth opportunities and maintaining appropriate 
leverage levels.
The Kyzyl project is a prime example of our business 
fundamentals. The feasibility study confirmed both the  
robust economics and development approach of the project. 
The Board approval was unequivocal and our task now  
is to ensure the timely construction of Kyzyl within the 
approved budget.
We are also well positioned to take advantage of new 
opportunities as they arise. One such opportunity is the 
recently formed joint venture with Polyus g old for the 
development of the n ezhdaninskoye deposit. With 
Polymetal’s management approach, this is another 
undertaking set to be characterised by low capital intensity.

Today’s resilient performance 
underpins future growth
Our resilient financial performance 
today allows us the flexibility  
to develop our focused pipeline  
of long-life projects and continue 
to generate cash flow now and  
in the future.
although currency movements were generally favourable  
for us during 2015, we still had to contend with continued 
pressure from depressed commodity prices in the gold 
mining sector. We retained our focus on preparing for the 
next growth stage and fulfilled expectations with a year of 
strong operational delivery.
The start of 2016 saw a moderate upturn in the global gold 
market and, while we are unlikely to see prices peak at 2011 
levels, gold is certainly being viewed as a safe haven for 
investors during the continuing economic and political 
upheaval. looking to the future, the gradual depletion of 
higher grade resources worldwide and the suspension  
of costly expansion projects will become more evident,  
with the reduction in supply serving to boost the gold price. 
Dynamic performance reaps rewards
Polymetal’s gold equivalent production for 2015 (based on 
1:80 ag/au conversion ratio) comprised 1.27 Moz. This was 
4% above the original production guidance for the year and 
the fourth year in a row in which we have exceeded our 
annual estimates. 
Whilst all our operations delivered in line with expectations, 
the gold equivalent production at Dukat made a significant 
contribution, increasing by 14% year-on-year. The amursk 
pressure oxidation (POX) plant delivered a stable operating 
performance. it has become a flagship operation, producing 
260 Koz of gold in 2015.
Kyzyl – the highlight of the year
Our top priority is clearly the launch of Kyzyl, one  
of the highest grade and largest untapped gold deposits  
in the world. Our confidence in Kyzyl as an investment that 
matched our strategic growth priorities, whilst leveraging  
our core strengths, was fully validated by our audited 
feasibility study.
The feasibility study confirmed the economic viability of  
the project, which is now set to become one of the highest 
grade and largest development projects in the sector 
globally. it also endorsed Polymetal’s capabilities for handling 
complex refractory ores and the proposed low-capital 
intensity approach, maximising the return on invested capital. 
Following Board approval, construction work is now under 
way and we are on track to bring Kyzyl into production  
in 2018, ramping it up to full capacity in 2019. Kyzyl  
is set to become a substantial free cash flow contributor 
for Polymetal.
Safety and sustainability at the forefront
reviewing and reinforcing our health and safety procedures 
continues to be a matter of urgency following the loss of six 
of our colleagues during 2015. The establishment of the new 
Safety and Sustainability Committee and the in-depth study 
of our risk and environmental management systems is part  
of a concerted effort to improve this situation. Management 
at all levels are committed to radically improving the 
Company’s safety performance with zero fatalities  
still very much our aim.
The increase in underground mining across our operations 
has brought with it a heightened level of risk and we are 
working hard to alleviate this. at Mayskoye, one of our major 
underground mining sites, we have initiated a change to the 
mining method that aims to reduce geotechnical hazards. 
We are very mindful of our duty of care towards all 
employees and to the communities in which we operate, 
particularly given the currently depressed general economic 
climate. We take our social and environmental responsibilities 
very seriously and were honoured to receive recognition from 
two significant bodies during 2015. We were integrated into 
the euronext v igeo emerging 70 index, comprised of the top 
70 emerging market companies with the most advanced 
corporate social responsibility programmes. We were  
also included in both the FTSe4g ood g lobal index and 
FTSe4g ood europe index for the first time; companies 
selected for both indices must meet stringent environmental, 
social and governance criteria.
Investing in future growth
Our resilient financial performance today allows us the 
flexibility to develop our focused pipeline of future projects. 
During the year we expanded our portfolio of near-mine 
advanced exploration projects through the acquisition of 
Primorskoye, a silver/gold site 215 km from our Omsukchan 
concentrator, and by acquiring l ichkvaz, our first asset 
in armenia. initial exploration drilling at l ichkvaz has begun 
and a JOr C-compliant resource estimate is expected in 
2016; drilling at Primorskoye will begin later in the year with 
an audited reserve estimate due by December 2016. 
at the end of 2015 we announced an exciting new joint 
venture with Polyus g old at n ezhdaninskoye, the fourth 
largest gold deposit in r ussia based on the r ussian reserves 
and reporting system (g KZ) resources. n ezhdaninskoye fits 
perfectly with Polymetal’s proven capabilities in developing 
remote assets, selective underground mining and refractory 
ore processing. g iven the size of the deposit, there is 
significant potential for high grade and a long mine 
life operation.
looking further ahead, we are actively engaged in putting 
together a portfolio of long-life projects with high-option 
value, like that of Kyzyl, which will allow us to reap the benefit 
of major contributions to cash flow in the future. However, 
this in no way detracts from our firm commitment of 
delivering considerable value to our shareholders through 
substantial dividend payments out of free cash flow.
Our achievements to date are a testament to the quality,  
skills and commitment of our management and employees.  
i would like to thank them for all their efforts and i look 
forward to their continuing support and enthusiasm in  
helping Polymetal realise the next phase in its strategic plan.

Demand
in 2015, gold and silver markets were again driven mostly  
by demand dynamics. Physical demand for gold fell  
by 2% to 4,076 tonnes, largely due to weakening jewellery 
fabrication and retail investment. This was partially offset  
by demand from central banks wishing to strengthen 
reserves – particularly in emerging markets – and was up 
3% on 2014 at 482 tonnes. n evertheless, total investment 
demand declined by a further 2%, down to 1,361 tonnes  
in 2015. 
eTF outflows continued in 2015, but accounted for only 
125 tonnes versus 160 tonnes in 2014. Demand pressures 
are mainly attributed to investors’ expectations of further 
strengthening of monetary policy in the u S. 
Supply
Total gold supply decreased by 2% in 2015, while mine 
production and scrap supply remained stable. n et hedging 
supply was the biggest contributor to the gold supply drop. 
The mine supply of gold remained flat, although in Q4 2015 
an estimated 4% drop in mine output was recorded, the 
largest quarterly reduction since 2008. This, in our view,  
is the first sign of a supply-side response to a prolonged  
price downturn, and is a result of decreasing production  
of mature operations and fewer new mines coming on 
stream. Total world mine production for the year reached 
3,126 tonnes, only 6 tonnes more than in 2014. Thomson 
r euters g FMS forecasts a further decline in mine supply  
in 2016 and the first annual decrease since 2008.
Global pricing
as a result, both gold and silver prices continued to decline 
in 2015. The average price decreased by 8% year-on-year –  
from u S$1,266 to u S$1,160/oz. The closing price for the 
year was u S$1,062/oz, with the lowest price of u S$1,050/
oz recorded in December. That was u S$137 less (-12%) 
than at the beginning of year. 
Throughout 2015, the silver price dynamics followed gold, 
although the silver price fell more sharply in the second half 
of the year. The closing price for the year of u S$13.82/oz 
was 13% lower compared with u S$15.97/oz at the end of 
2014. The average price for 2015 was u S$15.7/oz, down 
18% compared with 2014.
g iven the relatively larger decline in the silver price, the  
gold/silver price ratio reached 77:1 compared with 75:1  
at the beginning of the year; the average ratio in 2015  
was 74:1 versus 68:1 in 2014.
2016 is likely to be a critical year for both gold and silver.  
a potential further rise in u S interest rates by the Federal 
r eserve seems remote, given the challenges currently 
facing the global economy. This may prompt a gradual 
rebound of investors’ interest in ‘safe haven’ assets. 
Mine production around the world
The biggest mining countries in 2015 were China, r ussia  
and australia, with little change in production volumes.  
While most gold producers continued to experience  
pressure from depressed commodity prices, the devaluation 
of national currencies in many mining jurisdictions and lower 
oil prices helped to maintain the profitability of existing mines. 
There was not, however, sufficient capital available for any 
major mine expansions or new projects.
Our operating environment 
r ussia remained the second largest gold producer globally  
in 2015. Despite the country’s huge resource potential, 
including many large-scale deposits, the level of investment 
in the sector reduced significantly. This was largely due  
to the collapse of the gold price and geopolitical tensions, 
which restricted the availability of foreign debt and equity 
investments. at the same time, falling oil prices and the 
subsequent devaluation by more than 100% of the r ussian 
r ouble buoyed up the economics of existing mines.
although Kazakhstan has a smaller share in global gold  
mine production, the country has a much stronger growth 
profile. in 2015, refined gold production increased by 15%  
to 31 tonnes. This is partially attributable to a welcoming 
climate for foreign investment in the sector as well as other 
government incentives. The economics of Kazakh gold 
mining were also supported by the significant devaluation  
of the Kazakh Tenge in late 2015.
How we respond  
to these trends
Polymetal has always selected high 
grade assets in order to ensure  
robust economics and sustainable  
free cash flow generation at each  
of our mines – even at depressed 
commodity price levels. 
The new project approval process 
requires that stress testing is 
performed at a 20% discount to 
current spot prices. The prices that 
we use for reserve and resource 
estimates are reviewed regularly  
to reflect market fluctuations.
Due to robust free cash flow 
generation and a strong balance 
sheet, we are also using the low  
point of the commodities cycle  
to invest in high quality assets at 
attractive valuations. The acquisition 
of Kyzyl and several smaller-scale 
acquisitions in 2014-15 exemplify  
the success of this approach.

Consistent strategy and agile execution
Strategic 
objectives  
to achieve  
key goals
Key goals –  
combining growth  
and dividend
I.  pay significant and 
sustainable dividends  
through the cycle
  Polymetal already stands  
out in the mining sector for  
its dividend policy and track  
record of substantial dividend 
payments. We want to continue 
delivering meaningful cash 
returns to our shareholders  
at any stage of the commodity 
cycle and our investment cycle 
through a combination of regular 
and special dividends.
II.  Continue to grow  
our business without  
diluting its quality
  at the same time, we also want  
to grow production and, hence, 
free cash flow, through the 
addition of new high-grade, 
value-accretive assets.
1.  Ensure robust operating 
performance and 
financial performance  
at existing mines
2.  Deliver medium-term  
growth through building  
and ramping up Kyzyl
3.  Opportunistically pursue  
high-optionality M&A  
targets, combined with  
own exploration efforts
4.  Maintain high standards 
of corporate governance 
and sustainable 
development
Focus on full-capacity utilisation 
and robust cost performance of 
our operating mines by driving 
continued operating improvement. 
extend our life-of-mine by  
investing in near-mine exploration.  
This will allow us to generate  
free cash flow and translate  
it into significant dividends.
The Kyzyl project is a major 
medium-term growth driver for 
Polymetal, with average production 
of 320 Koz per annum from 2019. 
We are aiming to deliver the first 
gold at Kyzyl in Q3 2018. in 2016-
2017 , we will enter the active 
construction phase and will 
continue marketing concentrate.
While delivering free cash flow,  
we want to secure high-quality 
sources of long-term growth 
through our own greenfield 
exploration programme and M&a. 
We are actively looking at targets 
within the Former Soviet u nion 
where we can create value with  
our core competencies.
Maintaining high standards  
of corporate governance and 
sustainable development gives  
us a license to operate and  
the much-needed trust of all 
stakeholders. Health and safety  
at our operations is a key priority 
for the year.

21 20 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Operating review
r obust operating performance
in 2015, Polymetal continued to deliver a consistent operating 
performance against a backdrop of depressed commodities 
prices and global macroeconomic volatility. The Company 
reported another year of strong operational delivery with  
gold equivalent production for the year reaching 1.27 Moz, 
which exceeded the original production guidance for 2015  
of 1.22 Moz by 4%.
1
 
g old production was 861 Koz, a 9% year-on-year decrease, 
mainly as a result of scheduled production declines at mature 
mines, including voro, Omolon hub and varvara. Meanwhile, 
silver production increased by 12% reaching 32.1 Moz, driven 
mainly by the excellent grade and throughput at the Dukat 
hub. 827 Kt of copper were produced at our varvara mine.
g old sales were 864 Koz, down 8% year-on-year while,  
at 31.2 Moz, silver sales were up 6% year-on-year, in line  
with production dynamics and volume.

Exploration 
Our sustained investment in both greenfield and brownfield 
exploration, despite the current weak commodity price levels, 
is one of the key components of our strategy, and one that 
will ensure the extension of the mine life at existing operations 
and achieve further production growth through greenfield 
projects. Our exploration activities are focused on five regions 
in r ussia – Khabarovsk, Magadan, Chukotka, Karelia and 
ekaterinburg – as well as on Kazakhstan. 
Polymetal currently has 79 licences for geological studies 
and gold, silver, copper and platinum group metals (Pg M) 
mining, covering a total area of approximately 9,000 km
2
.  
Of these licenses, 45 currently involve active 
exploration activities.
Analysis of production results
Mining 
Stripping volumes in 2015 were 65.3 Mt of rock moved,  
a decrease of 16% year-on-year due to the completion 
of open-pit mining on several deposits, including Dalneye, 
Sopka and Tsokol (Omolon hub) and Khakanja (Okhotsk 
hub). at varvara, there was a decrease in the amount of ore 
mined while processing stockpiles and due to the temporary 
shutdown of the flotation circuit. at the same time, due to 
favourable economic conditions, we resumed open-pit 
mining at Birkachan and commenced mining at Oroch 
(Omolon hub) and Svetloye. 
u nderground development increased by a further 20%  
to more than 73 km, with increased capacity to match 
processing volumes at the Dukat hub underground mines 
and a change in the mining method at Mayskoye. The 
underground development also continued at an active pace 
at albazino, and Tsokol (Omolon hub), where the first ore 
from stopes was mined. 
Ore mined decreased by 7% year-on-year to 12.7 Mt as  
we continued de-stockpiling at some of our operations,  
in particular Omolon and Okhotsk. We had to slow down  
ore mining at Mayskoye in the second half of the year  
due to a change in the mining method, which necessitated 
additional underground development. 
processing 
Ore processed decreased by 4% to 10.8 Mt, mainly as a 
result of the copper circuit shutdown at varvara in the first 
half of the year and the temporary shutdown of the Mayskoye 
concentrator in Q4 as a result of a change in the mining 
method. average gold equivalent grade in ore processed 
remained strong at 4.6 g/t and ensured a robust economic 
performance despite depressed commodity prices.
production and sales dynamics 
While most of the sales are comprised of refined metals, we 
continue to sell concentrates from Dukat (gold/silver), varvara 
(gold/copper) and Mayskoye (refractory gold) to offtakers  
in Kazakhstan, Japan, Bulgaria, Belgium and China. Offtake 
allows us to maximise our margins, compared with the  
cost of processing these materials in-house. in 2015, we 
continued to diversify our offtaker base in China and europe 
in order to achieve an optimal combination of transportation 
costs and treatment charges/recoveries. Offtake concentrate 
trading was pioneered by Polymetal in the r ussian gold 
sector and has now clearly become one of our core 
competencies. This will be leveraged further in our  
approach to the initial development of the Kyzyl project. 
Our key exploration objectives in 2015 included: 
•	 ongoing brownfield exploration activities aimed at 
extending mine lives at our existing operations:  
Okhotsk hub (currently the shortest mine life), Dukat, 
Omolon, albazino and voro;
•	 extending life-of-mine by resource-to-reserve conversion  
at Kyzyl through in-fill drilling; 
•	 estimating hard-rock Pg M resources at our v iksha project 
in Karelia, sufficient for a standalone mining operation;
•	 resource estimates for newly acquired exploration projects, 
including l ichkvaz (armenia) and Dolinnoye (Kazakhstan);
•	 completion of reserve and resource estimates for gold/
copper deposits in the u rals (including n orth Kaluga  
and Tarutin) for further processing at either voro or 
varvara; and 
•	 further greenfield exploration for new precious metal 
deposits with a potential resource base sufficient in grade 
and size to justify the construction of a standalone mine.
in 2015, our drilling volumes decreased by 12% year-on-year 
to 232 km, mainly as a result of the completion of major 
drilling at Tarutin, v iksha and albazino during 2014. additional 
drilling volumes were allocated to new deposits, including 
l ichkvaz, Dolinnoye and Kyzyl. The total capital expenditure 
on exploration decreased by 34% to u S$47 million on the 
back of the substantial devaluation of the r ussian r ouble, 
which had a direct impact on drilling costs.
as a result of our exploration efforts, meaningful  
resource-to-reserve conversions were achieved during the 
year, along with maiden reserve-and-resource estimates 
completed for several projects. These included: 
•	 upgrade of resource quality at Tamunier with current 
estimate of 626 Koz ge at 4.1 g/t;
•	 an initial resource estimate at Primorskoye (Dukat hub) 
acquired in 2015 (+21.3 Moz silver);
•	 an initial reserve estimate at Khrustalny zone (Dukat)  
of 11.5 Moz silver and 23 Koz gold (+167 Koz ge ); and
•	 initial resources at irbychan, Yolochka, n evenrekan 
(Omolon hub) which, combined, added 298 Koz of  
gold equivalent. 
in 2016, we plan to further expand our brownfield exploration 
activities at all processing hubs and to continue to pursue 
new greenfield exploration targets through the acquisition  
of new licences in key regions, including Karelia (for Pg Ms), 
u rals, armenia and Kazakhstan.

 g iven the persistent change in gold/silver market price ratio, 
Polymetal has decided to change the gold/silver ratio used in 
presenting gold equivalent (ge ) production from 1/60 to 1/80.  
all gold equivalent production numbers for current and prior 
periods in this report have been restated accordingly.

Reserves and resources 
in 2015, our reserves remained almost unchanged as  
we were largely able to compensate for the depletion of 
existing mines by new reserve additions. g old reserves 
decreased by 1% to 17.7 Moz, and silver reserves decreased 
by 2% to 207.2 Moz, while copper reserves increased  
by 7% to 85.4 thousand tonnes. g old equivalent reserves 
decreased by 4% to 20.8 Moz, mainly as a result of change 
in the gold/silver price ratio.
The increase in reserves due to revaluation and new 
discoveries (a combined increase of 1.4 Moz gold equivalent) 
almost matched the depletion at existing operations.  
These increases included an upgrade of reserves at Kyzyl  
to 7.3 Moz (following the results of the feasibility study),  
initial reserve estimates at Perevalnoye and Khrustalny  
(Dukat hub), Tarutin (varvara) and underground reserves  
at Burgali and Tsokol (Omolon hub). We have also revalued 
upwards reserves at Birkachan, Dukat and l unnoye due  
to cut-off grade revisions on the back of the r ussian 
r ouble devaluation.
Mineral resources (additional to ore reserves) decreased  
by 12% in 2015 to 12.8 Moz of gold equivalent. Key drivers 
were the change in gold/silver price ratio and conversion  
of resources into reserves, including Kyzyl, Perevalnoye,  
and Tarutin. a more conservative approach has also been 
taken for the Oroch, Svetloye and g oltsovoye resources.  
Key brownfield resource additions during the year include 
initial resource estimates at the Primorskoye deposit 
(acquired in 2015), Khrustalny zone (Dukat hub) and 
irbychan, Yolochka, n evenrekan (Omolon hub), as well  
as the newly discovered Farida zone at albazino.
average reserve grade decreased to 4.2 g/t gold equivalent, 
mainly due to the change in the gold/silver price ratio, but 
continues to be one of the highest in our sector. average 
resource grade increased by 15% to 4.8 g/t gold equivalent 
as a result of high-grade resource additions. We continued  
to use conservative gold and silver price assumptions, of 
u S$1,100/oz and u S$15/oz respectively, in both reserve  
and resource estimates in 2015 (2014: u S$1,200/oz and 
u S$17/oz).
in 2016, we plan to complete independent audits of the initial 
resource estimates at our Pg M project in Karelia (v iksha) and 
at the newly acquired assets: l ichkvaz in armenia and 
Dolinnoye in Kazakhstan. 
Outlook for 2016 
in 2016 Polymetal will focus on consistent operational 
delivery with a focus on safety at our existing mines,  
as well as moving the Kyzyl development towards  
meeting our first production target date in 2018.
Management will progressively concentrate its efforts on 
Kyzyl where construction is on track to start in Q2 2016,  
and pre-stripping will also commence. We take confidence  
in our development approach, with low capital intensity and 
conventional processing technology, which ensures a lower 
degree of operational risk during the construction and ramp-
up period.
We will also focus on our new projects, including exploration 
drilling at the n ezhdaninskoye (a new joint venture with 
Polyus g old) and the operational turnaround at the newly 
acquired Kapan mine in armenia.
The Company is on track to produce 1.23 Moz of gold 
equivalent for 2016 and 1.30 Moz of gold equivalent for  
2017
1
. First gold will be produced from the Svetloye heap 
leaching operation and ensure sustained production levels  
at the Okhotsk hub. We anticipate a continued strong 
performance at Dukat, albazino, voro and Omolon, and an 
improvement at Mayskoye and varvara after the temporary 
production declines in the second half of 2015.
importantly, in 2016, we will continue to be focused  
on health and safety performance, in particular at our 
underground mines, and our aim is to substantially  
improve our safety record.

Operating review continued
Dukat was a key driver of the g roup’s operating performance 
in 2015, producing a record 27.4 Moz and reducing total cash 
cost by 26% to u S$6.4/ag equivalent oz.
Mining 
The annual amount of ore mined at the Dukat hub, which 
now includes four underground mines, grew 13% year-on-
year to 2.2 Mt while underground development increased 
11% year-on-year to match the increased mill throughput. 
at the Dukat mine, a record volume of ore mined was 
achieved – 1,656 Kt (up 13% year-on-year). u nderground 
development grew by 11% as a result of narrow ore bodies 
preparation. u nderground garages were set up. We 
continued with the expansion of the fleet of small-scale 
equipment for mining narrow veins. Supporting machinery 
was supplemented by fuelling equipment and mine transport. 
at g oltsovoye, mining continued at design capacity  
with 201 Kt ore mined at 486 g/t silver. u nderground 
development increased by 10% year-on-year, mainly  
due to the development in ore zone 2 of grade control  
drilling and resource-to-reserve conversion. 
The l unnoye plant demonstrated a very strong set of results: 
ore processed grew by 4% year-on-year to 416 Kt, with 
grades improving significantly by 15% for gold and 10%  
for silver due to input of high-grade ore from arylakh and 
zone 7 underground mines. average recoveries were strong 
at 90.5% for gold and 89.3% for silver. g old production was 
18.1 Koz, up 30% year-on-year, and silver production was 
5.0 Moz, up 15%. The hub’s total silver production was a 
record 27.4 Moz, up 15% year-on-year, due to continued 
strength of grades at the Dukat mine and steady increase  
in mine and plant throughput during the year. g old 
production grew to 51 Koz, up 12% year-on-year. 
Resources and exploration 
Our near-mine exploration efforts were again focused  
on tracing ore bodies adjacent to the main deposits; for 
example, the Khrustalny zone next to Dukat has high-grade 
intercepts that represent a continuation of the Dukat ore 
bodies. at Perevalnoye, we focused on in-fill drilling (10 km)  
to refine the geometry of known-ore bodies and prepare 
them for pilot mining works. We have also commenced 
drilling at the newly acquired Primorskoye deposit where 
5 km of drilling were performed to define ore zones 1 and 3.  
Drilling and resource modelling at Primorskoye are set to  
continue in 2016. 
at the l unnoye mine, amounts of ore mined grew by 5% 
while average grades increased by 11% for gold, due to the 
redistribution of volumes between ore zones 9 and 7 , and 
remained at the 2014 level for silver. Pilot cut-and-fill mining 
was successfully completed in horizontal layers in ore zone 7 . 
Sublevel caving mining was launched in ore zone 9.
at arylakh, total ore mined tripled year-on-year in line with  
the mine plan. average gold and silver grades increased,  
by 51% and 2% respectively.
processing and production 
Processing volumes at the Omsukchan concentrator and 
l unnoye plant continued to increase (up 6% and 4% year-
on-year, respectively) due to debottlenecking through 
continuous improvement programmes. The volume of ore 
processed at Omsukchan rose to a new record of 1,817 Kt, 
with average grades increasing by 1% for gold to 0.7 g/t and 
by 11% for silver to 452 g/t. Silver and gold recoveries were 
sustainably high (85.3% and 85.7% respectively) due to an 
ore quality control system based on geological and process 
mapping. g old and silver production increased by 4% and 
14%, respectively, to 32.9 Koz of gold and 22.3 Moz of silver. 
priorities for 2016
in 2016, in order to reinforce safety monitoring, we plan to 
introduce position control systems for underground mining 
workers and equipment throughout all mines. at Dukat 
underground mine, any further increase in throughput  
will be limited due to increased mining from narrow veins.  
We will complete the integration of fuelling and mining 
transportation equipment into the automated business 
process. at g oltsovoye, after completion of in-fill drilling,  
we will commence underground development at ore  
zone 2. at the l unnoye mine, we will fully transition  
to sublevel caving method in ore zone 9. 
We expect to maintain strong gold and silver recoveries  
and throughput at both the Omsukchan concentrator  
and l unnoye CiP, and maintain the solid production levels 
achieved in 2015.

27 26 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Operating review continued
Omolon continued
at Omolon operations, gold equivalent production decreased 
by 12% year-on-year to 188 Kt as the Kubaka plant chiefly 
processed ore with lower gold grades from Dalneye and 
Sopka stockpiles. Tsokol is switching to underground mining 
and we have resumed open-pit mining at Birkachan, 
devaluation making it economically attractive, and have 
started open-pit mining at Oroch.
Mining 
in 2015, the total ore mined decreased by 20% to 1,990 Kt 
following the completion of open-pit mining at Sopka and 
Dalneye. Open-pit mining resumed at Birkachan, on the back 
of strong economics supported by devaluation of the r ouble, 
with 779 Kt of ore mined. u nderground operations there 
were postponed due to extension of open-pit reserves and 
the consequent redirection of the underground operations 
to Tsokol.
at Tsokol, the amount of ore mined was 176 Kt, a 45% 
decrease compared with 2014 as we completed open-pit 
mining. u nderground development continued while the  
first 4 Kt of ore were mined from development openings. 
at Dalneye, ore mining and ore volumes for transportation to 
the Kubaka mill for processing increased as we accelerated 
the completion of open-pit mining.
at Oroch, open-pit mining commenced with a total  
of 400 Kt of ore mined, ahead of original schedule.  
The additional volumes will enable optimised throughput  
at the Kubaka mill in 2016. 
processing 
Throughput at the Kubaka mill remained stable, with  
835 Kt of ore processed during 2015 (up 1% year-on-year). 
r ecoveries for both gold and silver increased to 95% and 
86.8% respectively. average grades processed decreased 
by 16% for gold to 5.6 g/t and increased by 14% for silver  
to 151 g/t, due to a large share of ore processed from  
Sopka and Dalneye with high silver grades. as a result,  
gold production at Kubaka decreased by 18% to 144 Koz 
and silver production was up 19% to 3.5 Moz.
There was no ore stacking and processing of accumulated 
stockpiles at the Birkachan heap leach, however the process 
is expected to resume in 2017.
Reserves, resources and exploration 
at Tsokol, we are continuing down-plunge drilling and 
exploration at deep horizons in order to increase resource 
base. We have also started exploration drilling at Yolochka 
(40 km south of the Kubaka plant, 5 km drilling in 2015) and 
irbychan (150 km south of the Kubaka plant, 6 km drilling  
in 2015) which may become the next satellite deposits for 
the hub.
priorities for 2016 
in 2016, in order to reinforce safety monitoring, we plan to 
introduce position control systems for underground mining 
workers and equipment at the underground mines, including 
Tsokol and Birkachan (where underground mining will be 
resumed). at Oroch, full scale will be achieved at the open-pit 
mine, with the completion of ore mining scheduled by the 
end of 2016. Open-pit mining at Olcha will start in Q3 2016, 
with a subsequent switch to underground mining. We plan  
to process ore from Olcha at the Kubaka plant.
g old production at the Kubaka mill is set to increase, while 
silver production will decline as the shift in the Omolon hub’s 
ore feedstock mix will provide ores with higher gold and 
lower silver grades.
n ew brownfield exploration areas, such as nizhniy Birkachan 
and r yzhik, will be incorporated into the hub’s drilling 
programme in 2016.

2015 highlights 
in 2015, the amursk POX plant worked steadily at the  
design parameters while gradually increasing throughput. 
The concentrate processed increased by 2% year-on-year  
to 167 Kt, while total gold production amounted to 260 Koz  
of gold equivalent (up 7% year-on-year). The production 
increase was also propelled by the higher average grade 
processed (at 52.6 g/t, up 4% year-on-year), due to the 
higher share of Mayskoye concentrate in the feed. The mix 
was enhanced to achieve an optimal sulphur grade in the 
POX process feed.
Concentrate processed from albazino dropped to 143 Kt 
(down 6% year-on-year) while the average grade was 
52.3 g/t gold (up by 4% year-on-year). Concentrate 
processed from Mayskoye increased to 22 Kt (up 125% 
year-on-year) with the average grade at 57.9 g/t (up by 5% 
year-on-year). r ecoveries from both albazino and Mayskoye 
concentrate amounted to 94% and, in the case of Mayskoye, 
consistently exceeded design levels. Trial batches of third-
party concentrate were processed and achieved similar 
recovery levels. These purchases are expected to continue 
in 2016.
We are very sad to report the untimely passing of  
Mr v iktor n ikitanov, managing director of amursk POX  
since 2012, who made a great contribution to the Company. 
priorities for 2016 
in 2016, the share of Mayskoye concentrate processed 
through the POX will further increase as sufficient stockpiles 
have now been built up. We are targeting stable gold 
recoveries at 94% for both albazino and Mayskoye 
concentrates. To supplement the internal feed, we plan  
to process concentrate from third parties should it  
become available in 2016.

Life of mine: 2023
Operating review continued
in 2015, Mayskoye produced 138 Koz of gold, a slight 
decrease compared with 143 Koz in 2014. The production 
was split between the in-house POX processing (40 Koz)  
and concentrate offtake to China, which amounted  
to 98 Koz. it was a challenging year for the Mayskoye 
underground mine with 3 fatalities, which triggered  
an in-depth review and change of underground mining 
methods in the second half of the year with a consequent 
temporary reduction in volumes.
Mining 
Persistent geotechnical problems with ground stability were 
partially responsible for fatalities at the mine. in response to 
these events, we accelerated a planned changeover from 
drift-and-fill mining to sublevel open stoping with backfill.  
The new mining system will ensure that employees are not 
exposed to rock falls within the partially broken stopes since 
all ore production drilling will be done from drawpoints.
as a result, ore mined at Mayskoye was 628 Kt, down 4% 
year-on-year. average grade was 6.4 g/t (compared with 
8.4 g/t in 2014) due to both the complex geological and 
mining conditions, and a transition to the new mining method 
that limited the availability of prepared extraction blocks at 
the target grade. Currently, mining is ramping up as stopes 
are redeveloped using a new mining method (sublevel open 
stoping with backfill). The current rate is approximately 
2,000 tpd with dilution in line with forecasts. 
in 2015 albazino produced 220 Koz of gold; 3% lower 
year-on-year due to a 6% reduction in POX concentrate 
throughput, which was partially offset by the increase in 
grades and recoveries. The gold in concentrate produced 
increased to 233 Koz, up 7% year-on-year.
Mining 
The open-pit mine at albazino continues to run in 
accordance with the mine plan and with a stable grade 
profile. The amount of ore mined decreased 2% year-on-year 
to 1,533 Kt. u nderground mining commenced in the Olga  
ore zone. First stopes were successfully completed, meeting 
tonnage and grade estimates, with 49 Kt mined. as a  
result, the total ore mined increased by 1%. We continued  
testing the use of the cut-and-fill method to optimise  
the underground mining system. l aser scanning has  
been implemented in the underground mine.
processing
Ore processed was at the level of 2014 and amounted to 
1,607 Kt with average grades processed of 5.2 g/t gold  
(up 8% year-on-year), while recoveries reduced by 1% to 
87% due to the processing of ore with partially oxidised 
minerals from the top levels of the Olga ore zone.
We also commenced in-fill drilling for oxidised and transitional 
ore, and continued within the crown pillar, in order to evaluate 
open-pit mining and CiP processing of these reserves. 
processing 
in 2015, a total of 683 Kt of ore (down 15% year-on-year) with 
an average gold grade of 6.71 g/t (down 23% year-on-year) 
were processed, while average recoveries comprised 
85.95% (up 3% year-on-year). The decrease in volume and 
grade is attributable to the change in mining method, forcing 
the processing of lower-grade historic stockpiles in Q3 and 
concentrator stoppage in n ovember. as a result, the gold in 
concentrate produced decreased by 33% year-on-year and 
comprised 126 Koz. 
priorities for 2016 
in 2016 we expect to deliver a more stable performance  
in terms of both mining and processing. electric accumulator-
driven underground trucks will be brought in to reduce 
ventilation costs and prevent stopes thawing. We will start 
the preparatory works for open-pit mining of oxidised ores. 
The concentrator was successfully restarted in February 2016, 
as the mine had accumulated sufficient amounts of high-
quality ore to maintain full capacity. as a result, an increase  
in the concentrator throughput with higher average grades is 
anticipated. We are planning to add a concentrate decarbon-
isation section in the flowsheet in order to optimise concentrate 
parameters for processing at the amursk POX plant.
136 Kt of concentrate with an average grade of 53.3 g/t  
were produced. The concentrate was processed at the 
amursk POX plant. The application of a combined lining 
(rubber and steel) at the Sag mill helped reduce power 
consumption at the plant. 
Exploration and development 
We continued our brownfield exploration programme  
at albazino in 2015. it involved drilling at the flanks of the 
ekaterina-2 zone and at the newly discovered Farida zone, 
east of ekaterina.
priorities for 2016 
in 2016, we expect to complete testing of cut-and-fill options 
at the underground mine and source increasing volumes  
of ore from underground. 
Position control systems for underground workers and 
equipment to reinforce safety monitoring will be introduced. 
We will begin drilling a transport adit for the anfisa ore  
zone. in the Olga zone, we will complete open-pit mining.  
We will start pre-development works at the ekaterina-1  
and ekaterina-2 ore zones.

Production start date: 2000 (voro heap leach), 2005 (voro CiP)
Life of mine: 2026 
Operating review continued
Despite the mature stage of operations and a moderate 
scheduled decrease in production (mainly due to depletion  
of heap leach ore), voro demonstrated an excellent operating 
and financial performance, making a significant contribution 
to free cash flow.
Mining
in 2015, total volumes of ore mined at voro decreased by 8% 
to 1.75 Mt, due to a 60% decrease in oxidised ore volumes, 
while primary ore mined increased by 46%. Both types of ore 
saw the gradual decrease in grade as the mine approaches 
its maturity stage.
Significant efforts were made to optimise the mining process. 
Blasting operations were outsourced. 
processing and production
Heap leach operations entered seasonal stoppage earlier 
than usual due to the gradual depletion of oxidised ore. 
n evertheless, total gold production at the heap leach  
plant was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher grades  
and the switch from Merrill-Crowe recovery to carbon-in-
column technology.
Total gold production decreased 12% to 139 Koz, driven  
by the planned decrease in grade and a related decline  
in CiP recoveries.
Resources and exploration 
Our exploration targets mainly include satellite deposits that 
may provide oxidised ore for heap leaching operations and 
gold/copper ores for flotation. We completed 10 km of drilling 
at the Shilovskaya and verkhoturskaya areas in 2015. We 
also resumed exploration at the Tamunier deposit where 
relatively high grade (3-5 g/t) polymetallic ore bodies were 
discovered. We are finalising the feasibility study for the  
north Kaluga gold/copper deposit.
priorities for 2016
in 2016 mining activities will be focused on the Central  
and Western parts of the South-eastern pit. 
We expect the heap leach will operate at 40-50% capacity  
in 2016 while the average grade processed is expected to 
increase slightly. at the CiP plant, an increase in processing 
volumes combined with a slight decrease in grade 
is expected.

Mining
The annual amount of ore mined at the Okhotsk hub 
decreased considerably in 2015 by 63% to 399 Kt.  
This was due to the completion of mining at two mature  
assets – Khakanja and Ozerny – and the subsequent  
sale of the Khakanja open-pit mine.
avlayakan underground mine reached its design capacity 
and produced 114 Kt of ore in 2015, with average grade  
in ore mined of 11.0 g/t gold and 170.7 g/t silver.
processing and production
annual gold production during 2015 increased by 2% in 
accordance with expectations. Silver production decreased 
by 32% as the Khakanja open-pit mine was depleted. The 
plant used ore from Ozerny and avlayakan as well as historic 
stockpiles. Both throughput and recovery remained stable.
Svetloye development project
at Svetloye, construction is progressing on schedule and  
the heap leaching operation is on track to produce first gold 
in 2016. Summer navigation was successfully completed  
with all materials delivered to the access point at u nchi.  
The accommodation camp and fuel storage depot have 
been commissioned. Open-pit mining commenced at the 
end of the year and was resumed at the start of 2016.
Resources and exploration 
With the depletion of historic resources, brownfield 
exploration at Okhotsk hub is of primary importance.  
Our drilling programme in 2015 focused on the Khotorchan 
and gyrbykan deposits where open-pittable ore bodies with 
an average grade of 14 g/t and 13 g/t gold were discovered.
We are continuing step-out drilling at the flanks of Svetloye.  
in 2015, we identified a new l evoberezhny zone with gold/
silver mineralisation and promising intercepts. The works  
will continue during 2016.
priorities for 2016
in 2016 we will focus on the optimisation of mining equipment 
at the hub, with excess items to be transferred to Olcha mine 
(Dukat hub). 
The processing volume in 2016 is expected to remain flat, 
with feed drawn from Khakanja and Ozerny ore stockpiles 
on-site as well as from newly mined avlayakan ore. 
n evertheless, before the ramp-up of Svetloye, further grade-
driven decreases in gold and silver are expected in 2016. 
Our brownfield exploration in 2016 will involve a number  
of new licence areas, while we will also continue step-out  
and in-fill drilling at existing exploration projects.

Operating review continued Development project
Mining
Mining in 2015 was mainly concentrated in the Central, 
Southern and north-Western pits. Mining volumes increased 
slightly to 4,068 Kt although we experienced a reduction 
in grades.
processing and production
g old production decreased by 30% to 68.2 Koz, driven 
largely by lower grades and complex metallurgy in the 
currently mined ores. Copper production, which was 
resumed in 2015, was also impacted by lower grade  
sources from stockpiles. at the leaching circuit, 3,142 Kt  
was processed in 2015 (up 1% year-on-year) while the 
flotation circuit processed 315 Kt (down 42% year-on-year  
as copper production was only resumed in Q2).
in July 2015, we completed the construction of and launched 
a 13 km railway spur at varvara, enabling the long-distance 
transportation of third-party material and resulting in a 
sizeable reduction in concentrate transportation costs. 
in n ovember 2015, just 14 months after the acquisition of the 
project, we completed the project feasibility study at Kyzyl. 
The feasibility study, audited by r oscoe Postle associates, 
confirmed the economic viability of Polymetal’s development 
approach characterised by low capital intensity and  
operating risk. 
it will include a 1.8 Mtpa open pit to be mined for the first  
10 years, followed by 12 years of underground mining at  
1.2 Mtpa. Ore will be processed by sulphide flotation with 
concentrate to be sold to third-party processors. a 1.8 Mtpa 
flotation plant will produce 325 Koz of payable gold in 
concentrate per year on average from open pit mining followed 
by 270 Koz of gold in concentrate from underground mining. 
The high grade ensures robust project economics: 
•	 The average all-in Sustaining Cash Cost is u S$630/oz of 
gold and the average Total Cash Cost is u S$591/oz of gold. 
•	 initial capital expenditures are estimated at u S$328 million, 
and have benefited a lot from the devaluation of r ouble 
and Tenge. an additional u S$69 million will be invested in 
pre-production stripping in 2016-2017. Sustaining capital  
is estimated at u S$228 million over the life of mine. 
•	 u nderground mine start-up costs in 2024-2027 are 
estimated at u S$202 million. 
•	 Project irr of 32% (after tax) was estimated at the gold 
price of u S$1,200/oz, ru B/u S$ exchange rate of 72 and 
Tenge/u S$ exchange rate of 300, and is very resilient to any 
adverse movement in commodity prices or exchange rates.
Resources and exploration 
We have completed exploration drilling at the Tarutin deposit 
in the Chelyabinsk r egion with a proven significant potential 
for becoming a satellite deposit for varvara given its reserves 
and resources of 47 Koz and 50 Koz ge , respectively.
priorities for 2016
Mining works will be focused on the Central, n orth-eastern 
and Southern pits. We will also commence the Prirechny 
pit development.
We expect an improvement both in grade and recovery from 
the beginning of 2016 as mining works will be redirected to 
new zones and additional measures to improve geotechnical 
mapping will be implemented.
Purchase of third-party ore is expected to resume in 2016  
on the back of the lower Tenge exchange rate and reduced 
transportation costs due to the recently opened railway spur. 
We will also continue the feasibility study at the Tarutin 
deposit, which may become another component of the  
hub strategy at varvara.
Based on the feasibility study results, the Board approved 
the construction which is expected to start in Q2 2016.  
in the meantime, we have been conducting preparatory 
works on-site in 2015. These included dismantling of the old 
buildings in the zone of the future open pit, and preparation 
of the site infrastructure such as roads, administrative 
buildings and local power networks. We have also signed 
contracts for the major items of the mining fleet, including 
trucks (made in Belarus) and electric shovels (made in 
r ussia). The first equipment arrived on-site in early 2016,  
and the pre-stripping is expected to commence in Q2 2016. 
Contracting of processing equipment is well underway.
in 2015, we also completed the environmental and social 
impact assessment (eSia ) for the project. as part of this 
assessment, we conducted public hearings for the project 
approval by the local communities and received their  
full support. 
at Bolshevik, a satellite deposit to the main Bakyrchik deposit 
at the Kyzyl project, we have performed 10 km of core drilling 
during 2015 in order to prepare for a JOr C resource 
estimate. Bolshevik is set to become a significant contributor 
of ore feedstock to Kyzyl once the main Bakyrchik deposit 
shifts to underground mining, following the first nine years 
of operation.

exploration
Our sustained investment in both greenfield and brownfield 
exploration is one of the core pillars of our strategy as our 
continued growth is conditional on the replenishment and 
further increase in our ore reserves and mineral resources. 
We continue to explore areas adjacent to our processing  
and potential hubs (brownfield exploration) in order to extend 
the life of mine of existing operations. at the same time, we 
maintain an active portfolio of greenfield exploration projects 
with the potential to become sizeable standalone operations. 
The advancement of each exploration project is subject  
to a rigorous review through pre-established project stages 
that are linked to our estimate of its resource potential  
and economic prospects. at any stage, a project may  
be terminated, suspended or moved to the next 
exploration stage.
Our key greenfield exploration targets for 2015 were: 
•	 continued exploration for platinum group metals (Pg M) 
deposits in the Karelia and ekaterinburg regions in order  
to establish new hard-rock Pg M resources sufficient  
for a standalone mining operation; and 
•	 exploration at key greenfield gold assets (including  
the newly acquired l ichkvaz (armenia) and Dolinnoye 
(Kazakhstan), n orth Kaluga and Tarutin (u rals).

Key greenfield projects 
Karelian pGM 
Our key Pg M asset, v iksha, is very well-positioned for 
establishing a large Pg M resource in Karelia, an accessible 
region with developed infrastructure. Currently, we are 
awaiting a conversion from exploration to mining licence  
at v iksha in 2016, which will allow us to publish the maiden 
JOr C resource estimate for the project and open up 
pathways to further project development. Our exploration 
programme in Karelia extends well beyond v iksha, involving 
a number of nearby licence areas. 
Dolinnoye (Kazakhstan)
at the Dolinnoye deposit, where Polymetal currently holds 
25% with a further earn-in option for additional 25%, we  
have conducted in-fill and step-out drilling. We are currently 
preparing the deposit for a pilot mining project with ore sold 
to a third party. 
Lichkvaz (Armenia) 
Polymetal acquired an initial 25% stake in l ichkvaz in  
april 2015. l ichkvaz is located in the Meghri area of the 
Syunik-Marz province of southern armenia, 380 km south  
of Yerevan. The infrastructure in the area is developed, with 
the availability of power, water, accommodation and a skilled 
labour force. a previous resource estimate (not JOr C 
compliant) put the total mineral endowment of the property  
at 2.4 Mt of material at 6.9 g/t in the inferred category for 
approximately 0.5 Moz of gold equivalent contained.
Following successful exploration drilling, performed during 
the surveying season in 2015, a decision was taken to 
increase the Company’s interest to 100%. Drilling has  
been completed, with 15.8 km drilled across 70 diamond  
drill holes. We plan to complete a resource estimate  
(JOr C compliant) for release in Q2 2016.

39 38 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Sustainability
Ensuring a 
sustainable  
future
at Polymetal, we are committed to delivering sustainable 
value for all our stakeholders. For us, this means generating 
returns for our shareholders while fulfilling our responsibilities  
to society and the environment. By balancing our commercial 
interests with those of local communities and natural 
habitats, we are working to ensure a sustainable future. 
Our approach
Sustainability forms a core part of our overall business 
strategy. Shaping our interactions with society and the 
environment, it is essential to our licence to operate and  
to our long-term future as an organisation. at the heart  
of our business ethos and operations, we have developed 
long-term commitments to safety, efficiency, community 
engagement and environmental protection. We also help  
to deliver economic development and prosperity in the 
regions where we operate. 
in 2015, we established a dedicated Safety and Sustainability 
Committee; a clear sign of our commitment to systems  
and processes that will enhance our overall sustainability 
performance. During the year, we continued our strong focus 
on safety, health and the environment, reinforcing efforts to 
achieve zero harm while maintaining operational excellence. 
We also continued to focus on economic sustainability, 
working to ensure that, through in-house exploration and 
acquisition of new assets, we will extend the life of our 
business for many years by replenishing our reserves. 
Our sustainability strategy is designed to meet the principles 
of the un g lobal Compact, a voluntary international standard 
which Polymetal first signed up to in 2009. For the past  
six years we have complied with the Compact’s ten 
principles in relation to human rights, labour, environment 
and anti-corruption. We also participate in the un g lobal 
Compact n etwork r ussia. 
These standards, along with our corporate values of 
dialogue, compliance, ethical conduct, fairness, stewardship 
and effectiveness, help to inform our sustainability policies 
and management systems. We define these policies at 
g roup level and implement them via our head office and 
subsidiaries. We also ensure that, through regular monitoring 
and auditing, we benchmark our performance against the 
most up-to-date regulatory requirements.
Stakeholder engagement and materiality
it is essential that our sustainability programmes and 
initiatives address those issues that are most relevant, or 
‘material’, to our stakeholders. For this reason, we adhere 
closely to the principles of stakeholder inclusiveness and 
materiality that form a core part of the g lobal r eporting 
initiative’s (gri ) prioritisation guidelines. in order to identify 
the stakeholders on which we have the greatest impact,  
we regularly conduct stakeholder mapping exercises.  
Once we have identified these core groups, we engage  
with them and record all issues and concerns they raise.  
This process gives us insight into the issues that matter most 
to our stakeholders and ensures that we incorporate their 
ideas and opinions into our decision making. To reinforce 
these efforts, each year we conduct an in-depth materiality  
analysis to identify the key ‘aspects’ we need to tackle  
in our sustainability initiatives and reports. These six core 
focus areas are set out above.
Sustainability risk management
r isk management is another key component of our 
approach to sustainability. Drawing on our engagement  
and dialogue with stakeholders, we work hard to identify, 
manage and mitigate the sustainability risks that Polymetal 
faces. r esponsibility for this process lies with the Board’s 
audit and r isk Committee and Safety and Sustainability 
Committee (read more on pages 64-69).
Sustainability Report 2015
This section of our annual r eport presents  
an overview of Polymetal’s sustainability 
approach and performance in 2015. We have 
also published a full Sustainability r eport 
2015, which provides more detailed coverage.
This and copies of our previous reports are 
available on our website, along with regular 
updates about our sustainability activities 
during the year:

Minimising our environmental footprint
We are committed to balancing our commercial interests  
and operational goals with the need to protect the natural 
environment. To this end, we manage and mitigate our risks 
and conduct our business in an environmentally 
responsible way.
We carry out highly complex processes, which generate 
large volumes of emissions and waste materials. We also  
use toxic substances, such as cyanide, and oversee 
operations in remote rural locations which can impact  
the natural environment.
To ensure we are able to manage and mitigate these  
risks, we have developed a g roup-wide environmental 
management system (eMS) which adheres to national and 
international standards, legislation and best practice. it is 
overseen by dedicated environmental teams who now report 
directly to our environment Department, which is responsible 
for collating and managing all g roup-wide sustainability data. 
The Head of the environment Department reports directly  
to the Chief Operating Officer (COO), our g roup CeO and 
Chief Sustainability Officer. The system focuses on driving 
resource and energy efficiency, preventing pollution, 
employee engagement and using modern equipment 
and technologies.
as a result of our work in this area, and following a 
certification audit by an independent environmental 
assurance agency, in 2015 we initiated a three-year transition 
programme designed to achieve compliance with the revised 
iSO 14001:2015 standard. This programme will enable  
us to ensure that our eMS is compatible with key trends, 
such as an increased focus on leadership and strategic 
planning processes.
The Polymetal eMS is underpinned by  
our environmental policy, which can be viewed  
at www.polymetalinternational.com.
Auditing and compliance
in 2015, we continued our excellent compliance record  
in relation to environmental laws and regulations, receiving  
no significant fines or non-monetary sanctions for breaches 
or infringements. Historically, we have had no major 
environmental incidents and there were no spills or leakages 
in 2015. in our contractual agreements with suppliers, we 
insist on compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
We enable our stakeholders to articulate their concerns  
and share their grievances by complying with rigorous 
environmental impact assessment procedures, including 
public hearings and other mechanisms. 
Training is critical to ensure our staff are up-to-speed with  
key environmental issues and developments; we supplement 
our professional development programmes with site visits 
and conferences. in 2015, executive environmental personnel 
across the g roup received formal training in 
environmental audit.
Investment in environmental protection
During 2015, our overall investment in environmental 
protection was u S$5.1 million
1
, a slight increase from 
u S$4.9 million in 2014. Of this total, 36% went into the 
protection of water resources, 54% into land reclamation  
and 9% into the reduction and purification of 
atmospheric emissions.
Kyzyl environmental and social impact assessment
in 2015, two top international consultants completed a 
detailed review of the Kyzyl gold project in east Kazakhstan 
and issued a formal environmental and social impact 
assessment (eSia ) report, along with a project feasibility 
study, outlining priority action areas and benchmarking  
the project. Following detailed analysis of the management  
plan’s findings, in 2016 we will implement best practice 
recommendations and solutions at Kyzyl and other 
production sites. These recommendations will help us 
address all social and environmental impacts in line with the 
international Finance Corporation Performance Standards 
and World Bank environmental Health and Safety g uidelines.
We are committed to improving the quality of our eSia 
assessments and building community support by involving 
local individuals and communities in associated decision 
making and consultation.

Measuring sustainability performance 
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices
43 42 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Water
across our operations we withdraw and use significant 
volumes of water. all water is re-used, treated and 
discharged as effluent to surface water. alternatively,  
it can be treated and stored in tailings dams. We use water 
meters, flow meters and indirect measuring to capture all 
water consumption and discharge data.
each year, local and state authorities consent to our 
withdrawal of water from a wide range of sources near to  
our operating sites. as our operations are dispersed across  
a wide geographical area, we are able to use water without 
over-exploiting any one single source. Our usage always 
remains within acceptable limits, and we take very little  
(less than 10%) from surface water bodies such as rivers  
or springs, with approximately 80% of our water sources 
located underground. Furthermore, we avoid withdrawing 
from surface sources in environmentally sensitive areas,  
and those found in areas where water is of great importance 
to local or indigenous communities.
in each of our sites, we are committed to reducing the 
amount of water we use per unit of output. We also aim to 
minimise the volume and impact of the liquids we discharge 
into watercourses, while ensuring the safety and sustainability 
of our tailings dams.
Over 2015, the volume of water re-used by all g roup 
companies has averaged 65% of the total withdrawn. 
Materials, waste and tailings
in our production processes, we use large quantities of ore 
and energy. During 2015, we mined 12,679 Kt of ore and 
processed 10,821 Kt. We also generate specific waste 
materials. in 2015, our total operations generated 69,900 Kt 
of production and consumption waste, compared with 
79,435 Kt in 2014 and 81,141 Kt in 2013.
at our processing facilities we consume a range of materials, 
with associated economic and environmental impacts.  
in order to minimise such impacts, we drive efficiency  
in material use and closely monitor costs across all  
our production processes. Once the ore is processed,  
our final products include Doré bars, zinc precipitate,  
and flotation and gravity concentrates.
Overburden and tailings
Overburden and tailings are the most significant waste 
streams associated with our operations, accounting for  
more than 99% of the total volume. Overburden is the 
material that is extracted to uncover ore deposits,  
while tailings is a by-product of ore processing.
Recycled materials
Our aim, wherever we can, is to recycle the waste we 
generate. The proportion of recycled materials used across 
our operations as a percentage of total waste produced 
slightly decreased from 19.9% in 2014 to 18.6% in 2015.
Waste management
We are firmly committed to the responsible management  
of waste materials. We have developed systems and 
procedures that enable us to maximise the amounts we 
recycle and minimise our negative environmental impacts.  
as part of our approach, we re-use the production and 
consumption waste we generate within our own production 
processes, outsource them to external companies and 
dispose of them in our own waste facilities. 
Cyanide and hazardous waste management
Our production methods involve several harmful 
consumables. The largest is cyanide, which generates 
hazardous waste components during the recovery of gold 
from the ore we process. in 2015, we used 8.5 thousand 
tonnes of cyanide, compared with 7.5 thousand tonnes  
in 2014. Within our process, cyanide can also exist as a 
chemical compound found in gas, water and solids, which 
we later purify. additionally, to ensure there is no waste 
element, we always use 100% of the volumes of cyanide  
we purchase. We also take a rigorous approach to the 
transportation of hazardous materials. 
Energy
The very nature of our work means that our operations 
involve significant energy use. in support of our sustainability 
commitments, across our sites we have implemented a 
range of energy-saving initiatives.
Our facilities are often situated in remote locations, where 
extreme weather and limited grid power combine to make us 
dependent upon diesel as a fuel source. along with natural 
gas we procure from third-party suppliers, diesel accounts 
for the bulk of our total direct energy consumption –  
primarily for heating, powering equipment and vehicles.
Our operational power infrastructure helps ensure energy 
security: we use coal mined at our production sites as an 
internal energy source, as well as Company-owned diesel 
generators. in 2015, in-house power generation accounted 
for 34% MWh of our total electric power consumption.
We are committed to achieving energy efficiency and 
savings, and are actively pursuing strategic options  
for alternative and renewable energy sources.

During 2015, we made excellent progress in our environmental management programmes and initiatives.
Our major achievements in this period include the authorisation of all environmental control and accounting processes,  
and their transfer to g roup-wide software; the completion of the eSia in Kyzyl, with recommendations being rolled out  
across the project and other production sites; the training of our executive environmental personnel in environmental audit; 
and the complex auditing of our Omolon site by state environment and technology agencies, with no violations recorded.
Minimising our environmental footprint
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices
45 44 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 it is therefore with deep regret that we report that during 
2015 there were six fatalities across the g roup. Five of these 
fatalities were at underground operations and the sixth 
occurred as a result of a road accident. We offer our sincere 
condolences to the families and friends of those colleagues 
who lost their lives; we are deeply distressed by their deaths 
and would like to pay tribute to their dedication and hard 
work. We are of course covering any related costs and 
delivering ongoing financial support to the families of 
the deceased.
During 2015 there were also 10 non-fatal accidents in total 
across the Polymetal g roup. Of these, two were severe 
accidents and eight were minor. although our lost Time 
injury Frequency r ate (l TiFr ) increased 69% during the year, 
the reduction in the number of injuries and attainment of zero 
fatalities remain critical KPis. achieving these objectives is 
our foremost priority, and we are working to improve our 
performance in these areas in the future.
Enhancing personal safety
after thorough research and analysis, we have drawn 
comprehensive conclusions and are implementing measures 
to ensure that factors that could cause such fatalities again 
are taken into account and addressed. We have informed all 
employees and contractors of our findings and incorporated 
these new measures into our Company safety action plan. 
We will also implement any actions recommended by the 
state authorities, following completion of their investigations.
To enhance personal safety and risk awareness across  
our operating mines, we have put in place a number of 
processes to help identify issues and devise corrective and 
preventative measures. Polymetal continuously monitors 
employees’ disciplinary procedures and reviews the safety 
performance of the technical staff at the most 
problematic operations.
Our overall approach is driven by the Company’s Health  
and Safety Policy (implemented in 2013 and updated in 2014) 
and underpinned by our Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System (OHSMS). We comply fully with  
health and safety legislation in the states and regions  
where we work, as well as meeting all relevant international 
requirements. additionally, our OHSMS is based on  
the most up-to-date health and safety standards.
g roup-wide, we operate 120 production sites and processes, 
comprising open-pit and underground mines, geological 
exploration sites, explosives depots and ore processing 
facilities. There are risks associated with each site, and,  
in r ussia and Kazakhstan, 93 of Polymetal’s production 
facilities have been classified as ‘hazardous’.
as a consequence of fatalities and injuries between 2013  
and 2015, we continue to refine our existing OHSMS. This 
system is currently undergoing a three-stage external audit 
by the external assurance agency Bureau veritas. Covering  
a three-year period, the first stage was completed in 2015, 
when four production sites were audited. During 2016-2017 , 
four more subsidiaries will be audited randomly each year  
to evaluate the efficacy of our system.

  any restatement and variances are due to changes in methodology: we now use 
200,000 man-hours rather than one million man-hours for the calculation of l TiFr .
as part of our safety action plan, in 2015 we implemented  
a number of new safety initiatives, including:
•	 reinforcing transport speed control and safety monitoring;
•	 changing the incentive system where it has led to unsafe 
conduct for the jobs affected by certain risk (drifters, 
supporters and blasters);
•	 reviewing training programmes with a focus on key risks;
•	 visualising risks, consequences and personnel conduct  
in specific situations;
•	 improving the quality of safety checks and increasing the 
number of checks by independent external auditors;
•	 ensuring the geotechnical conditions assessment and 
management loop function effectively; and
•	 expanding and upgrading our geotechnical capabilities.

Greenhouse gas emissions
Heat and electricity from our diesel generators and our 
mining fleet operations produce greenhouse gas (g Hg ) 
emissions. The burning of natural gas and coal and the  
use of landfill also contributes to our g Hg output.
We measure and monitor our CO 2 emissions using 
established international methodology. in 2015, direct CO 2 
emissions linked to our operations amounted to 244 Kt 
compared with 304 Kt in 2014 and 327 Kt in 2013.

 Direct emissions include: CO 2 -equivalent emissions produced by combustion of 
fuel (diesel fuel, petrol, gas, coal) and use of electric power when operating own 
power-generating facilities, automobile transport, main and auxiliary mining equipment.
3
 indirect emissions include: CO 2 -equivalent emissions that relate to the generation 
of power purchased (imported) by the Company’s operations.

 The increase of SOx emissions in 2015 is due to growth of heat energy generation  
and volumes of coal used.
Biodiversity management
We tread lightly in the regions where we operate and work 
hard to minimise our impact on local biodiversity. Due to  
the extreme northern location of the majority of our sites, 
where the surrounding territory is low in conservational value, 
there are no significant biodiversity impacts linked to our 
operations. all site staff, including contractors, take part  
in environmental, health and safety awareness training  
to ensure that they understand their responsibilities  
to protect local fauna and flora.
as a matter of policy, we do not operate in or adjacent  
to protected or vulnerable areas. We also respect, and  
will not encroach upon, land that has particular value – 
natural, historical or cultural – for indigenous Minorities  
of the n orth (iMn ). 
planning for mine closures
Mine closure planning forms an integral part of the 
development of all our mines and projects. as all sites will 
eventually exploit their mineral resource and ore reserves,  
it is essential that we plan responsibly for the end of each 
mine’s operational life with an in-depth assessment of 
potential closure liabilities. 
progress against goals within our action plan
Our action plan for 2013-2017 is geared towards the 
continuous improvement of our environmental footprint. 
During 2015 this included completing reclamation in the 
Ozerny area; a sewage collector at amursk POX; and 
obtaining a licence to recycle industrial waste at Mayskoye. 
g ood progress has also been made on waste and water 
purification projects at l unnoye and voro.
Health and safety 
putting health and safety first
Keeping employees safe and well is a key priority for 
Polymetal. Our people are our greatest asset, and 
maintaining their health and well-being is critical to  
our future success and sustainability. We are committed to 
creating safe working environments across our operations 
and meeting stringent health and safety standards.
Mining is, inevitably, a dangerous operation. Our employees 
work in remote locations and environments where rigorous 
safety procedures can be difficult to uphold. However, it is  
our responsibility to embed robust procedures across our 
organisation and safeguard employees’ well-being. in recent 
years, we have renewed our focus on health and safety 
performance, and we are improving the ways in which we 
engage our people with health and safety issues and embed 
the right attitudes and behaviours internally. This is a journey of 
continual improvement and reassessment; we are committed 
to achieving a zero harm culture in which everyone takes 
responsibility both for individual and collective safety.
Strengthening safe practices
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices
47 46 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 The Polymetal pay structure is built around a base salary:  
this comprises a fixed salary plus a bonus aligned to personal 
attributes and qualifications. Our operational staff receive  
a time-paid salary, based on the number of hours worked 
and the amount of work completed, plus monthly and annual 
allowances. Our policies and procedures in these areas  
are fully compliant with, and indeed exceed, all legal 
requirements in r ussia and Kazakhstan. We also provide 
annual bonuses for all our professional employees, which  
are linked to targets based on the Company’s KPis, and  
have developed a comprehensive range of social support 
and compensation measures, including:
•	 financial aid for those experiencing difficult 
life circumstances;
•	 partial sponsorship of a kindergarten, afterschool  
activities and a holiday camp;
•	 compensation of travel costs for those travelling  
to remote sites from other regions;
•	 reimbursement of holiday travel costs for all family members 
for those working in remote locations once every two years;
•	 housing support; and
•	 covering interest payments on employee mortgages.
in 2015, we maintained our reputation as a progressive  
and attractive employer in the regions where we operate, 
winning an attractive employer award for the eighth time. 
This both demonstrates the trust with which candidates  
view Polymetal, and confirms our credentials as a company 
with integrity and a stable market position.
During the year we sustained stable wage growth in line  
with inflation. We continued improving working and living 
conditions for employees, particularly those in remote 
locations: building a new 60-bed dormitory and renovating 
canteen facilities at varvara; renovating an entire housing 
estate for duty personnel at l unnoye (Dukat hub);  
beginning construction of a 100-bed dormitory at albazino; 
building a new gym and saunas at Omolon hub; and in 
Mayskoye completing a new gym, recreation room 
and dormitory.
Emergency preparedness
ensuring preparedness for any emergency that might 
jeopardise the well-being of our employees or damage the 
environment is crucial. We analyse historic accidents and 
conduct regular safety audits of the buildings and technical 
facilities used in hazardous activities. every year, we initiate 
simulated emergency events and related training at each  
of our 93 hazardous production facilities. Within high-risk 
sites, we conduct more frequent – sometimes monthly –  
emergency preparation sessions. 
as well as complying with legal requirements in the countries 
where we operate, all Polymetal facilities have accident 
Prevention plans, developed collaboratively with local 
emergency authorities. We also have trained in-house 
rescuers and contracts with professionals who specialise  
in life-saving services and accident prevention.
Occupational diseases
every year, each employee undergoes at least one medical 
check to evaluate their health and well-being, and our in-
house team of medical professionals monitor employee 
health on an ongoing basis. in 2015 no cases of occupational 
diseases were recorded.
Employee engagement and training
Training and engaging employees is critical to establishing 
safe practices. Polymetal’s human resources system has 
defined procedures for recruiting and assigning employees 
with specific skills, and providing training to further develop 
employees’ skills. We also clarify competence requirements 
for each relevant job description, with training needs 
identified by the heads of business units. The Company 
funds comprehensive specialist training in occupational 
health, and industrial, electric and fire security as well as 
refresher courses and special-purpose training.
progress against the goals in our action plan
as part of our risk reduction and automated safety control, 
we integrated geotechnical assessments and additional 
machinery for auxiliary underground work as well as 
implementing safety monitoring and control software.  
We developed a formal procedure to inform employees  
about hazards, risks, consequences and mitigation 
measures, and utilise their feedback to better analyse and 
eliminate hazardous conditions. We also involved contractors 
in risk management and assessment, and worked jointly  
on health and safety analysis and control.
Training and development
We are always looking to enhance the skills and capabilities 
of our people, investing in g roup-wide training and 
development programmes. These are structured to help 
build the workforce we require to meet our Company 
objectives over the long term, and to provide opportunities 
for our employees to progress and develop in their careers.
each time someone joins Polymetal, we conduct a 
preliminary appraisal which helps to shape and inform  
a detailed training plan.
in 2015, we invested u S$678 thousand in professional 
training across all areas of the business, which amounts  
to u S$149 per trained employee for the year. in addition to 
our corporate training centres and on-site teaching facilities 
for general managers and technical specialists, we provide  
a distance learning programme, which is of particular benefit 
to employees in remote locations. 
We have also created the Polymetal Talent Pool, which 
focuses on developing the next generation of skilled 
managers, expanding their professional horizons and 
developmental stimuli, as well as providing opportunities to 
train with other international mining companies. Our schedule 
of activities designed to prepare our younger employees for 
the leadership challenges of the future this year included 
effective Hr management, change management and 
decision making. in 2016, the focus will be on occupational 
health and safety, production control, construction, mine 
planning and business ethics.

The training, development and well-being of our employees  
is of paramount importance. We invest heavily in these areas 
as part of our commitment to our people and the long-term 
future of our Company.
Building a motivated, loyal and capable workforce is critical  
to the expansion of our business. every year we work to

49 48 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Our interactions with local people and communities are 
numerous and varied. across all our sites and facilities,  
we provide employment opportunities and use local services 
to help generate supply and demand. in addition, we invest  
in local education, health, culture and infrastructure, putting 
community interests at the centre of our local activities.
We have also developed rigorous measures designed to 
mitigate the negative impacts of our operations, such as the 
generation of waste materials and emissions. each year, we 
exceed our regulatory obligations in an effort to ensure that 
local communities and environments are not affected by 
these aspects of our business.
in our social investment activities, we use industry 
benchmarks and standards to assess our progress and 
performance. We injected u S$28 million into local projects 
from 2010-2015. in 2015, we invested u S$3.6 million on 
social support and territorial development programmes. 
While this is less in u S Dollar terms than the u S$5 million 
invested in 2014, due to devaluation it is higher year-on-year 
in russian and Kazakh currencies.
The Polymetal Board of Directors and management teams 
review our annual community investments and associated 
targets. They base their decisions on the perceived potential 
of a project to deliver meaningful change to local people and 
communities, with a particular focus on the following areas:
•	 Health and education – the quality of life of local 
communities depends upon access to healthcare and 
education and this underpins sustainable development  
at a local, regional and national level. 
•	 Infrastructure – we invest heavily in local and regional 
infrastructure, by carrying out repairs and improvements  
to bridges, roads and built environments. This both creates 
employment opportunities and contributes to the socio-
economic development of villages and towns. 
•	 Sport and lifestyle – another key aspect is the promotion 
of health and well-being through sport and lifestyle 
initiatives; our primary focus is supporting mass  
sporting events and youth sports projects. 
•	 Culture and creative potential – for many years, we have 
worked to preserve local history, traditions and ways of life, 
and to support schemes designed to promote local arts 
and crafts, including ethnographic museums, indigenous 
language programmes and music groups. 
Diversity
in 2015, women occupied 23% of our senior management 
roles, compared to 22% with 2014, and represented 44%  
of our qualified personnel. Women also made up 22%  
of our Board composition and 23% of our total workforce.
We have also been working with 12 local universities and  
five technical colleges to enable internships, placements and 
other opportunities for young people. at the end of 2015, 
people aged under 30 accounted for 24% of our workforce.

Headcount and turnover
at 31 December 2015, we employed 9,238 people across 
the g roup’s research, development, design, exploration, 
production, logistics and management activities. This slight 
increase in headcount is a result of new project works getting 
underway at our Kyzyl and Svetloye sites. 
Over the last six years, we have been steadily reducing  
our average employee turnover rate (including fly-in/fly-out 
operations) and this trend continued in 2015 when we  
further reduced our turnover rate to 8.3% (11.4% in 2014). 
This is partly attributable to the complex macroeconomic 
environment which has impacted manpower demand. 
However, our efforts to promote internal employee mobility, 
our employee training and development programmes and  
the favourable working conditions that we have created  
were also key.

•	 Indigenous Minorities of the North (IMN) – our support 
programmes are aimed at enhancing living standards for 
indigenous people in Chukotka, the Magadan r egion and 
Khabarovsk Territory; we work closely with indigenous 
community members to ensure that we address iMn 
issues, needs and expectations. 
•	 Environmental protection – over the years, we have 
created a strong culture of environmental protection  
and responsibility, developing activities to help raise 
awareness of ecological issues and safeguard the 
natural environment.
progress against the goals in our action plan
We held public meetings, visits to our sites and implemented 
a feedback mechanism for local people and public 
associations in our new territories in the u rals and 
Kazakhstan. We developed local community engagement 
and social partnership programmes in line with local 
requirements, doubling the number of people surveyed  
in our social project assessments. We enhanced our 
methods of communication with residents in remote areas 
and iMn and signed an additional partnership agreement 
aimed at supporting iMn .
Anti-corruption
The Polymetal Code of Conduct sets out our positioning  
on issues like bullying and harassment, bribery, drugs, 
entertainment and gifts, government relations, anti-trust  
and anti-competition laws, community relations, insider 
dealing, data protection, transparency and disclosure,  
and environmental protection. Through appropriate training, 
we ensure that our employees comply with our rigorous 
stance against corruption of any kind. at the same time,  
by listening and responding to their concerns, we are building 
a Company culture based on mutual understanding, respect 
and trust.
progress against the goals in our action plan
We made good progress with all our training objectives:  
we introduced a new management course for the Talent 
Pool; increased our in-house training capabilities; and 
developed programmes at our plants for engineers and 
technicians. We continued our collaboration with universities 
to attract talented interns and set up the Quick Start 
graduates programme. We increased the promotion  
of the employee feedback channels and can report  
a reduction in turnover of 28%.
Communities
as a mining company, our licence to operate depends  
upon the goodwill, trust and understanding of local 
communities and authorities. Our operational activities  
cover a vast geographical area, encompassing the Chukotka 
autonomous Territory, Khabarovsk Territory, the Magadan 
r egion, Yakutia, Sverdlovsk r egion, Kazakhstan and 
armenia. Building strong links and relationships in the  
regions where we operate is a core part of our corporate 
ethos and commitment to sustainability.
Our approach to community relations in these areas is 
underpinned by our belief that, as our operations increase,  
so do our responsibilities and commitments to the people 
whose lives we impact. as part of this, we adhere to relevant 
international standards and conventions, including the  
un Declaration on the r ights of indigenous Peoples and  
the un g lobal impact. u ltimately, our aim is to balance our 
commercial priorities with the interests and needs of local 
communities. To date, we have 21 community cooperation 
agreements in place in areas where we operate (18 in 2014).

51 50 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial review
Highlights
•	 Polymetal has delivered a solid set of operating and financial results. The original production guidance was exceeded  
by 4% while operating costs and capital expenditures for the year were below original guidance.
•	 r evenue for the year ending 2015 decreased by 15% to u S$1,441 million (‘year-on-year’) as a result of average realised 
gold and silver prices decreasing by 8% and 17% respectively year-on-year. g old sales were 864 Koz, down 8% year-on-
year while silver sales were 31.2 Moz, up 6% year-on-year, in line with production volume dynamics.
•	 g roup Total cash cost
1
 (‘TCC’) was u S$538/gold equivalent ounce (‘ge oz’), down 15% from 2014 levels and below 
original guidance of u S$575-625/ge oz driven by significant r ussian r ouble depreciation against the u S Dollar, which 
more than offset the combined negative impact of domestic inflation and change in the gold/silver price ratio. 
•	 all-in sustaining cash costs
1
 (‘ai SC’) decreased by 18% year-on-year to u S$733/ge oz and were below original guidance  
of u S$750-800/ge oz primarily as a result of decline in total cash costs during the period, and other expenditures 
significantly influenced by the r ouble and Tenge devaluation.
•	 adjusted eBiTDa
1
 was u S$658 million, a decrease of just 4% year-on-year despite the revenue decline which was largely 
offset by a strong cost performance. adjusted e BiTDa margin was 46% compared to 41% in 2014.
•	 n et earnings
2
 were u S$221 million versus a u S$210 million loss in 2014. u nderlying net earnings (adjusted for the after-tax 
amount of impairment charges/reversals and foreign exchange loss) were u S$296 million (2014: u S$282 million), up 5% 
year-on-year, driven by the depreciation of local currencies. 
•	 Capital expenditure was u S$205 million, below the original guidance of u S$240 million, as a result of currency devaluation. 
The g roup is on track with construction at the Kyzyl and Svetloye projects.
•	 The Company continued to generate significant free cash flow
1
, which was u S$263 million in 2015 (2014: u S$306 million). 
On the back of robust cash flow generation for the year, the Company paid out u S$127 million of special dividends to 
shareholders, bringing the total amount of dividends declared during 2015 to u S$216 million.
•	 n et debt at 31 December 2015 was u S$1,298 million, an increase of 4% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the net 
settlement of the Kyzyl put option in September 2015 and other cash-based acquisitions. The g roup maintains a 
comfortable n et debt/adjusted e BiTDa ratio of 1.97x.
•	 a final dividend of u S$0.13 per share representing 30% of the g roup’s underlying net earnings for 2H 2015 is proposed  
by the Board, which, in accordance with the current dividend policy, has the discretion to declare a regular dividend  
at a n et debt/adjusted e BiTDa ratio above 1.75.

Market summary
Please see the market overview on pages 16-17.
Foreign exchange
The g roup’s revenues and the majority of its borrowings are denominated in u S Dollars, while the majority of the g roup’s 
costs are denominated in r ussian r oubles. as a result, changes in exchange rates affect its financial results and performance.
The r ussian economy, heavily reliant on crude oil exports, was hit by plummeting oil prices. During 2015, the r ussian r ouble 
remained weak against the u S Dollar on the back of a further decline in the oil price. 
Following the oil price dynamics, from 1 January to 31 December 2015 the r ussian r ouble depreciated against the u S Dollar 
by 29.5% from 56.3 ru B/u S$ to 72.9 ru B/u S$, and the average rate was down 37% year-on-year from 38.42 ru B/u S$  
in 2014 to 60.96 ru B/u S$ in 2015. The devaluation of the r ouble had a positive effect on the Dollar value of the g roup’s 
r ouble-denominated operating costs and adjusted e BiTDa, which was partially offset by the negative effect on the g roup’s 
net earnings in 2015 due to the effect of the retranslating of its u S Dollar debt.
in august 2015, Kazakhstan opted to set the Tenge free following devaluations by r ussia and China, its neighbours and  
two biggest trading partners. as a result, the Kazakh Tenge devalued by 46% during 2015, falling from about 182 KZT/u S$  
to 339 KZT/u S$. The average rate was 222 KZT/u S$, 18% down year-on-year.

in 2015, revenue decreased by 15% year-on-year to u S$1,441 million driven mainly by an 8% decline in the average  
realised gold price and a 17% decline in average silver price. g old equivalent volume sold decreased by 7%, mainly driven  
by the decline in silver price versus gold. g old sales volumes decreased by 8%, while silver sales volumes increased by 6% 
year-on-year, both following the production dynamics. 
The average realised price of gold was u S$1,127/oz in 2015, down 8% from u S$1,231/oz in 2014, and slightly below the 
average market price of u S$1,160/oz. The average realised silver price was u S$14.7/oz, down 17% year-on-year, and 6% 
below the average market price of u S$15.7/oz due to a larger share of sales recorded in the second half of the year when 
market prices were lower.
The share of gold sales as a percentage of total revenue was 68% and remained almost flat compared to the 2014 share  
of 69%.
Copper sales resumed but were limited due to the continuing weakness in the copper concentrate market, which had 
resulted in a temporary shutdown of the flotation circuit at varvara in 2014. The copper circuit was restarted in June 2015, 
after positive feedback was received from a european copper concentrate offtaker based on a trial product shipped in Q1. 
Currently, the circuit processes low-grade stockpiled copper/gold ore. Mining will be re-directed towards the float feed  
on a stable basis once a long-term offtake contract has been secured.

Total cost of sales decreased by 25% in 2015 to u S$766 million, mainly on the back of the oil price decline and consequent 
r ussian r ouble devaluation during 2015, more than offsetting domestic inflation in r ussia (12.9%). another significant cost 
reduction driver was the decrease in depreciation charges across the portfolio as the g roup’s mining assets are accounted 
for in r oubles and Tenge (see below).
The cost of consumables and spare parts and the cost of services decreased by 30% and 34%, respectively, compared with 
2014 and driven mostly by the r ouble devaluation and decrease in the price of diesel fuel which is a significant component  
of transportation services costs. 
The total cost of labour within cash operating costs in 2015 was u S$128 million, a 24% decrease, mainly stemming from 
r ouble devaluation and the decline in the average number of employees at Okhotsk operations and Omolon, which 
collectively offset the annual salary increase (tracking r ussian CPi inflation) and additional labour costs at the new Kyzyl asset. 
Mining tax decreased by 12% year-on-year to u S$97 million, mainly due to the decrease in average realised prices. 
Depreciation and depletion was u S$154 million, down 47% year-on-year. The decrease was mainly attributable to r ouble and 
Tenge devaluation. The specific decreases are attributable to Omolon, where mineral rights attributable to Sopka and Dalneye 
were fully depreciated in 2014, and to albazino due to an increase of JOr C reserves which serve as the depreciation basis. 
an amount of u S$3 million of depreciation and depletion expenses in 2015, related to ore and concentrate stockpiles, was 
included in metal inventories as at 31 December 2015. 
in 2015 a net metal inventory increase of u S$27 million was recorded (excluding write-downs to net realisable value), mainly 
represented by concentrate produced but not yet sold at Dukat and albazino, and ore stockpiles at Okhotsk operations and 
varvara. in the second half of the year, the Company successfully progressed with scheduled stockpile reductions, with total 
gold equivalent sales exceeding production by 40 Koz. De-stockpiling was mainly driven by concentrate shipments 
from Mayskoye.

Other 16 14 +15%
Total 127 131 -3%
g eneral, administrative and selling expenses were quite stable at u S$127 million as compared to 2014. Despite the 
meaningful impact of the r ussian r ouble devaluation, the labour costs within general, administrative and selling expenses 
decreased only moderately by 5%, mainly due to the increased headcount at Kyzyl and Svetloye where most employee costs 
are included in general, administrative and selling expenses prior to the start-up of production. The increase in share-based 
compensation is related to an increase in the number of option programme participants and outstanding share option 
tranches under the current long-term incentive programme (l TiP) and deferred share award (DSa).

Other operating expenses decreased by 61% to u S$51 million in 2015, mainly due to a decrease in exploration expenses 
written off during the period. Cash-based exploration expenses in 2015 were u S$12.6 million (2014: u S$16 million).  
Taxes, other than income tax, and additional mining tax charges and va T exposures recognised in 2014 were recorded  
by the Company in relation to tax exposure at varvara with respect to the commercial discovery bonus; and at Omolon  
and Dukat with respect to the calculation of technical loss exempt from the mineral extraction tax; as well as tax penalties 
related to a previously identified tax exposure at Magadan Silver. in 2015 the g roup released several mining tax provisions  
at Magadan Silver following the completion of tax audits, and paid u S$12.6 million in early 2016 to settle these cases.

assets. g old equivalent sales volume is calculated based on average realised metal prices in the relevant period. Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated as total 
cash costs divided by total gold equivalent unit ounces sold.

in 2015 the total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold (‘TCC’) were u S$538/ge oz, down 15% year-on-year.  
The recent depreciation of the r ussian r ouble had a meaningful positive impact on cost levels reported in u S Dollars,  
which was supported by the robust operating performance across most operations. 
The table below summarises the major factors that have affected the g roup’s TCC dynamics year-on-year:
Reconciliation of TCC movements
u S$/oz Change, %
Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce – 2014 634
Domestic inflation 72 11%

Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce – 2015 538 -15%
Total cash cost by mine: 
•	 Dukat’s total cash cost per silver equivalent ounce sold decreased by 26% year-on-year to u S$6.4/oz. Beyond the major 
effect of the r ouble depreciation, this decrease in cash costs has been achieved as a result of stronger grades and 
continuing debottlenecking at both the Omsukchan and l unnoye plants.
•	 voro continues to be our lowest cost operation. Cash costs decreased further by 11% compared to 2014, to u S$336/ge 
oz. The key driver of cost dynamics was the significant devaluation of the r ussian r ouble offsetting the impact of the 
scheduled decline in the average grades processed and a related decline in CiP recoveries.
•	 at Okhotsk operations, TCC was u S$573/ge oz, a 19% decrease year-on-year. This cost performance was supported  
by the significant devaluation of the r ussian r ouble, which offset the scheduled decline in average gold and silver  
grade processed. 
•	 at varvara, TCC was u S$818/ge oz, growing by 16% year-on-year. The increase mainly stemmed from lower average 
grades. The Tenge devaluation happened only late in the year, thus limiting the positive impact of exchange rate dynamics. 
•	 at Omolon, TCC amounted to u S$555/ge oz, a 2% decrease year-on-year, thanks to the r ussian r ouble devaluation 
offsetting the lower head grades processed at the Kubaka mill compared to 2014. 
•	 at albazino/amursk, TCC was u S$460/ge oz, down 26% compared to 2014. Beyond the strong support by the r ouble 
devaluation, this improvement was achieved on the back of steady mine performance and increased throughput 
at albazino.
•	 Total cash cost at Mayskoye was u S$752/ge oz, a 22% decrease year-on-year, as a larger share of gold was produced  
at the lower-cost in-house amursk POX facility.

The net write-down of metal inventories of u S$13 million recognised in 2015 is related to the low-grade material at varvara 
mined before re-starting the copper circuit and the low grade ore stockpiled for heap leaching at Birkachan. r eversals 
recorded in 2014 were related to ore in heap leaching piles, work-in-progress and metal for refinery previously impaired,  
which was further processed or determined to be economic for further processing. The reversals were mainly driven  
by the decline in unit cash costs required to bring the work-in-progress stockpiles into saleable metal.

The Company defines adjusted eBiTDa (a non-iFr S measure) as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortisation, impairment of non-current assets, write-downs and 
reversals of inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation, rehabilitation expenses, gains and losses on acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries, foreign exchange 
gains or losses, change in fair value of contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs, income tax expense and other tax exposures accrued within other operating 
expenses. adjusted eBiTDa margin is a djusted eBiTDa divided by revenue. The figures presented above have been rounded and may not add to the total shown.
in 2015, adjusted e BiTDa was u S$658 million, 4% lower year-on-year, resulting in an adjusted e BiTDa margin of 46%.  
The decrease was mainly driven by an 8% reduction in the average realised gold price and 17% reduction in the average 
realised silver price, which was substantially offset by a 15% decrease in TCC. adjusted e BiTDa increased at Dukat, a lbazino 
and Mayskoye, while at other operating segments it declined year-on-year on the back of a price-driven revenue decrease.
Other income statement items
Polymetal recorded a net foreign exchange loss in 2015 of u S$133 million compared with u S$559 million in 2014.  
These unrealised non-cash losses represent the appreciation of the g roup’s predominantly u S Dollar denominated 
borrowings against the r ussian r ouble, the functional currency of the g roup’s operating companies other than for varvara 
and Kyzyl (which is the Tenge). The g roup’s average gross debt during 2015 was u S$1,336 million, fully denominated in  
u S Dollars, while the u S Dollar appreciated against the r ussian r ouble by 29.5% during the period, from 56.3 ru B/u S$  
at 31 December 2014 to 72.9 ru B/u S$ at 31 December 2015. Since 2015, the functional currency of the g roup’s top holding 
companies is the u S Dollar, therefore the part of debt that is borrowed at the top holding company level and not pushed 
down to the operating company level is no longer generating these non-cash gains or losses.
The Company does not use any hedging instruments for managing foreign exchange risk, other than a natural hedge arising 
from the fact that the majority of the g roup’s revenue is denominated or calculated in u S Dollars. Though income statement 
volatility may arise in the financial reporting, Polymetal believes that the underlying matching of revenue cash flows against 
debt repayments and related interest represents an economically effective hedging strategy.
The exchange differences resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the g roup entities from their functional 
currencies to the presentation currency are included in equity and presented as movements relating to the effect of translation 
to the g roup’s presentation currency within the Translation reserve.
Net earnings, earnings per share and dividends
The g roup recorded a net income of u S$221 million in 2015 versus a u S$210 million loss in 2014. The underlying net 
earnings (excluding an after-tax impact of impairment charges/reversals and foreign exchange losses) were u S$296 million, 
compared to u S$282 million in 2014. The increase in underlying net earnings was mainly driven by stable eBiTDa and the 
decrease of other r ouble-denominated expenses (mainly depreciation charges).
Basic earnings per share were u S$0.52 per share compared to a u S$0.53 loss per share in 2014. u nderlying basic ePS  
was u S$0.70 per share, compared to u S$0.71 per share in 2014.
in accordance with the Company’s dividend policy, the Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of u S$0.13 per share  
(giving a total expected dividend of u S$55 million) representing approximately 30% of the g roup’s underlying net earnings  
for the period. During 2015, Polymetal paid a total of u S$216 million in dividends, representing final dividends for FY 2014, 
interim dividends for 1H 2015 and special dividends for 2015 paid on the back of strong free cash flow generation and  
a comfortable leverage level.

61 60 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Financial review continued
The major capital expenditure items in 2015 were: 
•	 across all mature open-pit mines, except for Okhotsk operations and albazino, capital expenditures remained almost 
unchanged or slightly deviated year-on-year and were mainly represented by mining fleet upgrades/replacements and 
maintenance expenditure at the processing facilities.
•	 Capital expenditure at Okhotsk operations was u S$26 million, almost a two-fold increase year-on-year, and was mostly 
represented by the construction of the Svetloye mine. in 2015, the Company obtained a full set of construction permits for 
the Svetloye project. Summer navigation started on time and the construction is progressing on schedule. Open-pit mining 
was suspended due to very heavy snowfall with the equipment diverted to construction activities. Mining was resumed  
in Q1 2016.
•	 u S$20 million was invested at albazino/amursk, mostly related to commencement of underground development at the 
Olga zone and the start of underground mining.
•	 at Dukat and Mayskoye, the increased capital expenditure is mainly related to larger volumes of capitalised 
underground development.
•	 at Kyzyl, capital expenditure in 2015 comprised u S$32 million, mainly representing project design costs, minor 
infrastructure and mining equipment. Major mining equipment contracts were agreed for trucks (Bela Z from Belarus)  
and electric shovels (OMZ from r ussia), with equipment expected to arrive on site in the first half of 2016. Site activities 
progressed as planned with the focus on the construction of external infrastructure, including an access road, coal-fired 
boiler house and water pipeline. Polymetal is on track to start full-scale construction in Q2 2016.
•	 The Company continues to invest in standalone exploration projects. Capital expenditure on exploration in 2015 was 
u S$47 million compared to u S$72 million in 2014, due to the decrease in r ouble-denominated drilling costs on the back  
of the r ouble devaluation, although drilling volumes remained largely stable. in addition to near-mine properties, the 
exploration programme focused mostly on the Kyzyl, Svetloye and Pg M assets.
•	 Capitalised stripping costs totalled u S$16 million in 2015 (2014: u S$31 million) and are attributable to operations with 
stripping ratios exceeding their life of mine (l OM) averages during the period, including most importantly varvara, voro and 
albazino. The decline is mainly related to the completion of major stripping campaigns at Omolon and varvara last year.
•	 Total capital expenditure in 2015 includes u S$4 million of capitalised interest (2014: u S$5 million), mainly related to small-
scale growth projects.

Operating cash flows in 2015 were under pressure from declining commodity prices. Operating cash flows before changes  
in working capital decreased by 18% year-on-year to u S$504 million as a result of the decrease in adjusted e BiTDa and 
increase in cash tax payments by albazino and Omolon, where previously tax losses carried forward were available.  
n et operating cash flows were u S$490 million, compared to u S$518 million in 2014. This was also slightly affected  
by an increase in working capital in 2015 of u S$14 million.
 
Total cash and cash equivalents decreased by 67% compared to 2014 and comprised u S$52 million, with the following  
items affecting the cash position of the g roup:
•	 operating cash flows of u S$490 million;
•	 investment cash outflows totalled u S$302 million, down 43% year-on-year, and are represented by capital expenditure 
(almost unchanged from prior year at u S$205 million) and other investing cash flows mainly represented by the net 
settlement of the put option for the Kyzyl acquisition (u S$68 million);
•	 payment of regular and special dividends for 2014 and 1H 2015 amounting to u S$300 million; and
•	 the net increase in borrowings of u S$27 million.

The g roup aims to maintain a comfortable liquidity and funding profile in the current turbulent market environment.
The g roup’s net debt increased slightly to u S$1,298 million as of 31 December 2015, representing a n et debt/adjusted 
eBiTDa (over the last 12 months) ratio of 1.97. The increase is mainly attributable to the net settlement of the Kyzyl put  
option in September 2015.
The proportion of long-term borrowings comprised 79% as at 31 December 2015 (58% as at 31 December 2014). 
in addition, as at 31 December 2015, the g roup had u S$1.2 billion (31 December 2014: u S$1.0 billion) of available undrawn 
facilities, of which u S$1.0 billion is committed, from a wide range of lenders. This ensures that Polymetal maintains its 
operational flexibility in the current environment. 
The average cost of debt remained low at 4.06% in 2015 (2014: 3.5%), supported by low base interest rates and the ability  
to negotiate competitive premiums given the solid financial position of the Company and Polymetal’s excellent credit history. 
The increase in absolute finance costs (including capitalised interest) from u S$41 million to u S$81 million is mainly related  
to the notional accrual of interest on the put option liability on the Kyzyl transaction which expired in October 2015. Despite 
challenges in the credit markets in r ussia and globally, the g roup is confident in its ability to refinance the existing borrowings 
as they fall due. 
2016 outlook
While we recognise that our financial performance is heavily dependent on the ru B/u S$ exchange rate, inflation in r ussia 
and oil price dynamics, Polymetal expects to deliver resilient financial performance at current price levels which will be driven 
by the following factors:
•	 the Company is fully on track to deliver on its production guidance of 1.23 Moz of gold equivalent for 2016  
(after restatement of the gold/silver price ratio to 1/80);
•	 in 2016, Polymetal expects total cash costs of u S$525-575/ge oz and all-in sustaining cash costs of u S$700-750/ge oz  
at the current exchange rates;
•	 at the current exchange rates, capital expenditure in 2016 is expected to total approximately u S$340 million (including 
exploration, capitalised stripping and construction of the Kyzyl project) in line with previous guidance;
•	 as a result, the Company expects to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow with the capacity to make further 
dividend payments in 2016.

effective risk identification  
and management
Our policy is to identify and assess risks at the earliest 
possible stage (preferably at the planning stage) and  
to implement an appropriate risk response and internal 
controls in advance. Our risk management procedures are 
designed to delegate the responsibility for risk identification 
while avoiding gaps and duplications. r isk identification 
requirements are also taken into account in the design of 
accounting and documentation systems in order to be able 
to identify and process information on potential risk triggers.
The audit and r isk Committee has approved risk KPis  
for all principal risks and monitors these KPis on a quarterly 
basis. r isk matrices and assurance maps are used to record, 
prioritise and track each risk through the risk management 
process. These are reviewed regularly by the audit and 
r isk Committee.
Risk assessment
Once identified, potential risk factors are assessed to 
consider the quantitative and qualitative impact that they 
might have on the business and the likelihood of the event 
(see table below). Together these create a risk profile.
Risk response
When the appropriate ranking has been identified,  
a response to each risk is formulated and implemented. 
Management assesses the effects of a risk’s likelihood  
and impact, as well as the costs and benefits of possible 
mitigating actions. a response is then determined  
and implemented to bring the risk within acceptable 
tolerance levels.
Monitoring and reporting
Ongoing monitoring processes are embedded in  
Polymetal’s business operations. These track the effective 
application of internal control and risk management policies 
and procedures, including internal audit and specific 
management reviews. r isk matrices and assurance maps 
are used to re-evaluate and adjust controls in response  
to changes in the Company’s objectives, its business  
and the external environment.
Management is responsible for the implementation of 
effective follow-up procedures to ensure appropriate  
actions occur in response to changes in risk and 
control assessments.
risk and risk management
effective risk management is critical to the long-term 
sustainability and success of the mining business with  
its significant exposure to macroeconomic cycles.  
at Polymetal, we have developed a strict culture of risk 
management, which, we believe, is paramount to delivering 
sustainable value to our stakeholders. as the global and local 
markets in which we operate continue to be volatile in many 
ways – commodity prices, exchange rates, macroeconomic 
stability, climatic conditions – the Board continues to place 
significant focus on risk management, including both risk 
identification and response.

Polymetal’s risk management process is designed to minimise 
the potential threats to achieving our strategic objectives.
internal control and risk management systems are 
continuously reviewed to incorporate global best practices 
and add value to our business.
The risk management process includes the 
following stages:
•	 identification and documentation of risks;
•	 assessment, qualification and quantification of each risk;
•	 development and implementation of risk mitigation/
control strategies;
•	 monitoring, reporting and reviewing risks; and
•	 establishment and enhancement of effective internal 
control procedures.
The Audit and Risk Committee of the Board sets  
the agenda for the risk management policies and 
procedures of the Group and is responsible for 
reviewing their effectiveness. Its duties include  
the review of:
•	 policies and processes to identify and assess principal 
business risks and to manage their impact on the 
Company and the g roup;
•	 regular assurance reports from management, internal 
audit, external audit and others on matters related  
to risk and control;
•	 periodic ‘deep dives’ into significant risk areas; and
•	 the timeliness of and reporting on the effectiveness  
of corrective actions taken by management.
Risk identification
r isk awareness is embedded within the g roup and is 
grounded in our strong ethical values and pro-active 
corporate culture. Our risk management philosophy is driven 
by the Company’s Board of Directors and runs through all 
our management, employee and connected stakeholder 
activities – from developing strategy to day-to-day operations. 
r isk management is one of the key functions of the audit  
and r isk Committee. Principal risks are identified by the 
Board based on a detailed understanding of the Company, 
its markets and the legal, social, political, economic, 
technological, environmental and cultural environments  
in which we operate. 
Our risk identification system considers not only single, 
mutually exclusive risks, but also multiple linked and 
correlated risks.

1. Market risk High
Gold and silver price volatility may result in material 
and adverse movements in the Company’s operating 
results, revenues and cash flows.
The Company has developed and implemented plans to ensure consistent 
cash flow generation at operating mines, including:
•	 re dist r ibu t io n 	 o f 	 o re 	 fe e dst o c k 	 b et w e e n 	 hu b 	 d e pos it s 	 t o 	 ac hie v e 	 b et t e r	
margins due to better grade profile, better logistics or less expensive  
mining methods;
•	 d efe r r ing 	 t h e 	 sta r t 	 o f 	 pr odu ct io n 	 w hile 	 c o nt inuing 	 o re 	 stac k ing	 
to achieve better cost profiles due to positive effects of scale;
•	 m a n aging 	 t h e 	 vo lu m e 	 o f 	 t hir d-pa r t y 	 o re 	 pu r c h a se s ;
•	 staf fing 	 le v e l 	 re v iew 	 a nd 	 hir ing 	 f re ez e ; 	 a nd
•	 a s set -le v e l 	 c ost - cu t t ing .
r eserve and resource prices, as well as cut-off grades, are reviewed at least 
annually to reflect the prevailing commodity price levels. Short-, medium-,  
and long-term life-of-mine plans are adjusted as appropriate. 
Stress testing for these conservative price assumptions is performed to 
ensure resilience of the operating mines in a stress scenario and continued 
value creation. Contingency action plans have been developed to address 
performance in a stress scenario.
in 2015, while the precious metals prices continued to decline, the measures 
taken by the Company ensured that each operating mine remained cash 
flow positive. The Company will continue with this approach going forward.
Currently the g roup does not hedge its commodity price exposure since its 
strategy is to offer stakeholders full exposure to the potential upside of gold 
and silver pricing.
2. production risks High
The risk of failure to meet the planned production 
programme. Failure to meet production targets may 
adversely affect operating performance and the 
financial results of the Group. 
The key sources of risk may include:
•	 in a bilit y 	 t o 	 a c hie v e 	 v olu me, 	 g r ade 	 o r 	 r e c o v e r y	
assumed in life-of-mine plans;
•	 fa ilu r e 	 of 	 s up pl y 	 c h a in s 	 t o 	 p r o cu r e 	 c o mple x	 
logistics to remote locations; 
•	 fa ilu r e 	 t o 	 r e t a in 	 k ey 	 e mplo ye e s 	 o r 	 t o 	 r e c r ui t	 
new staff; and
•	 fa ilu r e 	 of 	 c o ntr a c t o r s 	 t o 	 me et 	 r e quir e d	 
performance standards.
Inability to achieve volume, grade or recovery assumed  
in life-of-mine plans 
annual, quarterly and monthly production budgeting and subsequent 
monthly control against budget is designed to mitigate the risk.  
The effectiveness and efficiency of the production process is ensured  
by the g roup’s engineering team senior management. an approved 
production programme includes increased volume of operational 
prospecting works, such as in-fill drilling and grade control sampling.
To mitigate the risk, the g roup invests considerable amounts in ore quality 
assessment procedures and seeks to control ore quality by formation of ore 
stacks with the required characteristics.
Failure of supply chains to procure complex logistics  
to remote locations  
The g roup has implemented and constantly improves the supply chain 
system to closely link the production demand of resources with inventory 
levels, optimise the number of order placements and ensure in-time 
inventory and equipment delivery to production sites.
Failure to retain key employees or to recruit new staff 
a working conditions improvement programme is in place. r emuneration 
policies are designed to incentivise, motivate and retain key employees.  
There is an increased focus on health and safety – refer to pages 46-47  
of this report. There is an active promotion of a positive corporate culture 
within the g roup.
Failure of contractors to meet required performance standards 
The contractors’ performance control system is designed, implemented  
and applied.
Risk description and potential effect Risk response Residual risk level
3. Construction and development risk Medium
Inability to achieve target return on capital for large 
investment projects, such as building new mines and 
processing facilities or extension/refurbishment of 
existing operating mines, due to delay in commissioning 
or capital expenditure overruns. This may have a 
negative impact on the Group’ financial performance 
and cashflows
The Company applies global best practices in project management. 
Technical personnel of the g roup are in charge of the project’s capital 
expenditure, including project support, supply chain management and 
permitting process. a significant share of the projects is developed by the 
in-house engineering company Polymetal engineering that has vast 
experience and a successful track record of design and ramp-up of mines 
and processing facilities. We are continuously improving our construction 
risk management systems and employ leading world class consultants in 
applicable areas. 
4. Tax risks High
Due to frequent changes in tax legislation in Russia 
and Kazakhstan, lack of established practices in tax 
law means that additional costs such as taxes or 
penalties may occur.
The taxation risk level correlates with the legal  
and political risks levels.
The g roup’s policy is to comply fully with the requirements of the applicable 
tax laws, providing adequate controls over tax accounting and tax reporting.
n evertheless, the ongoing changes to r ussian and Kazakh tax legislation, 
and the evolving practice of application of these laws in courts, could lead  
to tax disputes and potential additional tax liabilities. 
The g roup regularly evaluates its tax positions and makes sure they are 
adequately reflected in the consolidated financial statements. To date the 
g roup is not aware of any significant outstanding tax claims, which could 
lead to additional taxes accrued in the future (except for amounts already 
booked or disclosed in the g roup’s financial statements).
a new anti-offshore law has been enacted in r ussia since 1 January 2015. 
The law introduced material changes into the taxation procedures for 
controlled foreign companies and established new criteria for beneficial 
ownership of income and tax residency in r ussia. as all major operating 
entities of the g roup are domiciled in r ussia and Kazakhstan, Polymetal 
generates all of its revenues and profits and pays all related taxes in these 
countries. Therefore the g roup does not expect any material impact from  
the ‘de-offshorisation’ law on its operations going forward. The Company  
fully complies with the new requirements.
5. Exploration risks Medium
Exploration and development are time- and capital-
intensive activities and may involve high degrees of risk 
but are necessary for the future growth of the business. 
Failure to discover new reserves of sufficient 
magnitude could adversely affect the Company’s future 
performance.
r isk and uncertainty are inherent for exploration and development activities.
The g roup invests considerable amounts in key exploration projects to 
obtain sufficient information about the quantity and quality of new reserves 
and to estimate expected cash flows. The g roup’s geology and engineering 
teams have a strong track record of successful greenfield and brownfield 
exploration, leading to the subsequent development of exploration fields  
into commercial production.

Risk description and potential effect Risk response Residual risk level
6. Health and safety risk Medium
The Group operates potentially hazardous sites such 
as open pits, underground mines, exploration sites, 
processing facilities and explosive storage facilities. 
The operation of these sites exposes our personnel  
to a variety of health and safety risks.
a control system covering occupational and industrial safety in the Company 
is in place, including risk assessment of individual work places and the use 
of safety equipment for the protection of personnel.
The Company has reinforced the need for individual responsibility for 
personal safety and risk awareness, and developed additional security 
measures to ensure strict compliance with safety requirements 
by employees.
The general approach of the g roup to this risk is determined by the g roup’s 
Health and Safety Policy, which serves as the basis for the health and safety 
management system. The g roup adopts the industry’s global best practices  
in managing these risks and ensuring safe working conditions for  
our employees. 
Our health and safety management system ensures compliance with 
international, national and local regulatory requirements and is based on 
modern standards, including il OOSH 2001, OHSaS 18001 and national 
safety standards.
However, in 2015 we sadly report six fatalities on our sites. The increased 
frequency of injuries and these fatalities are mainly related to increased 
volumes of underground mining in complex geotechnical conditions.  
in response, we have intensified training programmes, with a particular focus 
on high-risk functions, and implemented a number of other measures, 
including a change of underground mining methods at certain sites. We are 
continuing to conduct a detailed review of the source of injuries and are 
further improving the shift risk assessment system, as well as conducting  
an external audit of our health and safety system. 
7. Environmental risk Medium
Major pollution arising from operations includes: 
deforestation, air and water pollution, and land 
contamination. potential impacts include fines  
and penalties, statutory liability for environmental 
redemption and other financial consequences  
that may be significant.
The Company operates a certified environmental management system  
which meets international standards and is audited for compliance.
The Company has implemented a number of initiatives to monitor and limit  
the impact of its operations on the environment, including external expert 
assessment of pollution generated and adopting industry best practices  
for corporate and mine level policies and procedures.
8. Legal risk Medium
Operating in developing countries, such as Russia  
and Kazakhstan, involves the risk that changes in tax 
and other legislation may occur from time to time.  
The most sensitive areas are regulation of foreign 
investments, private property, environmental 
protection and taxation. 
In recent years, the governments of both Russia and 
Kazakhstan have become more consistent regarding 
the introduction of new regulations and taxes, 
demonstrating an awareness of investment climate 
issues. However, in the application of existing 
legislation requiring interpretation, courts often uphold 
the more assertive position of the tax authorities, which 
does not always coincide with the  
Company’s position. 
As a result of changes in laws and regulations, certain 
types of transactions and technologies may become 
unavailable to the Group or the costs of compliance 
may be increased. 
Polymetal has a successful track record of operating in both r ussian and 
Kazakh jurisdictions, having developed its own expertise in corporate, tax, 
licensing and other legal areas. 
Corporate and operating management teams are responsible for meeting 
the legal requirements in their operating activities. Head office and on-site 
legal teams guarantee appropriate controls over compliance issues.
The g roup’s policy is to ensure strict legal compliance in all jurisdictions 
where the g roup companies operate. The g roup’s financial and legal teams 
monitor current legislation and proposed changes, and incorporate these 
into the practice, involving leading external experts where appropriate. 
Risk description and potential effect Risk response Residual risk level
9. political risk Medium
Operating in Russia and Kazakhstan involves some risk 
of political instability, which may include changes in 
government, negative policy shifts and civil unrest. 
Financial and economic sanctions imposed in 2014 by 
the United States and the European Union on certain 
businesses and individuals in Russia have increased 
political tensions and increased economic instability; 
there is a risk that further sanctions could impact the 
Group’s ability to operate in Russia or Kazakhstan. 
Russia’s complex relations with the United States and 
European Union, as well as its involvement in conflicts 
in the Middle East, may potentially present a risk to 
Group’s operations.
In addition, there is a risk that due to deterioration  
of the macroeconomic situation, governments in 
Russia and Kazakhstan may consider imposing 
currency controls and limitations on capital flows. 
These factors are not expected to affect the Group’s 
operating performance yet may have a negative impact 
on the ability of the Group to secure external financing.
These factors may have an adverse effect on the 
Group’s market value and operating environment. 
The g roup actively monitors political developments on an ongoing basis.  
We aim to maintain open working relationships with local authorities in the 
countries where we operate.
Sanctions imposed on r ussian individuals and businesses in 2014, as well 
as further developments in 2015 have not currently had any direct influence 
on the g roup’s operations, however at the same time they have affected 
both the macroeconomic situation in r ussia and interest rates  
for borrowings. 
10. Currency risk High
The risk arises from the Company’s receipts from metal 
sales and foreign currency denominated debt, as well 
as the foreign currency denominated cost of imported 
capital goods and consumables. 
n atural hedging is used to reduce the risk exposure: revenue is matched 
with u S Dollar denominated debt.
Flexible budgeting is used to monitor the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
on the g roup’s financial results. The g roup has determined critical exchange 
rates levels for its operations and is monitoring risk against  
these levels.
Depreciation of the r ussian r ouble and Kazakhstan Tenge in 2014-2015 
against the u S Dollar and euro resulted in recognition of unrealised negative 
foreign exchange losses on the revaluation of u S Dollar denominated debt. 
However, the lower exchange rate resulted in a decrease in operating costs 
and higher cash flows from operations as most costs are denominated in 
local currencies. 
11. Liquidity risk Medium
The inability to raise sufficient funds to meet current 
operating or ongoing financial needs or to develop  
new projects and growth.
Inadequate cash management in terms of cash flow 
forecast, available resources and future requirements. 
The g roup’s Treasury function is responsible for ensuring that there are 
sufficient funds in place, including loan facilities, cash flow from operating 
activities and cash on hand to meet short-term business requirements. 
l ong-term credit lines and borrowings are used to finance new projects  
and organic growth. The g roup ensures that significant undrawn committed 
facilities are in place to cover any funding gaps. 
12. Interest rate risk Medium
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as  
the significant part of the Group’s debt portfolio  
is US Dollar denominated floating rate borrowings. 
Based on analysis of the current economic situation, the g roup has decided 
to accept the risk of floating interest rates rather than hedge it or borrow at 
fixed rates. The recent increase in base rate by the u S Federal reserve has 
not changed the overall interest rate levels significantly.
However, the g roup does not rule out the possibility of fixing the interest rate 
on its borrowings in the future should assessment of the ongoing economic 
situation suggest this may be profitable.
Due to the financial sanctions imposed against some r ussian banking 
institutions in 2014, the overall level of interest rates in r ussia has increased. 
Considering this, the g roup has assessed risk level as medium.

Dear Shareholders
Our commitment to our shareholders remained paramount 
during 2015. Despite sustained trading difficulties in an 
unsettled global economy and a low point in the commodities 
cycle, the strength of our free cash flow generation enabled us 
to maintain meaningful dividend returns to our shareholders. 
But this has not compromised our ability to re-finance debt 
and maintain a comfortable leverage level: a testament  
to our commitment to capital discipline.
in 2015, the Board approved the approach for the Kyzyl 
project development and commencement of construction. 
The timetable is on track for production to start in 2018, with 
lower costs than previously predicted. With the Kyzyl put 
option, which could have stretched the balance sheet, now 
out of the way, we continue to look for value-accretive M&a 
opportunities and are focusing on projects with a low-cost 
entry level and long-term potential.
Maintaining an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and the 
investor-and-analyst community about major developments 
within Polymetal is vital to building and maintaining good 
relationships, and creating value. Through our investor 
relations programme, with regular presentations, webcasts 
and opportunities to meet members of our senior team,  
we are able to communicate a better understanding  
of the Company’s strategy and how it operates.
The ability of the business to compete successfully in its 
marketplace relies on effective and strategic leadership. 
Through succession planning, we ensure that we maintain  
the right level of skills and experience in the Company and our 
Young l eaders Programme will certainly help us achieve this.
Sadly, our safety record for the year was poor, with six 
fatalities at the Company’s sites. We have set up a new 
Safety and Sustainability Committee to fast track major 
improvements in our risk management procedures.  
The Committee met three times in 2015 and has already 
made good progress in addressing this situation. 
On a more positive note, Polymetal was included in both  
the FTSe4g ood g lobal index and FTSe4g ood europe index  
for the first time. l isting on both indices is determined by 
companies demonstrating good environmental, social  
and governance practices. Please read more in our 2015 
Sustainability r eport.
as a Board, we are committed to ensuring that Polymetal 
operates its business by adhering to the highest standards  
of ethical and responsible behaviour. g ood corporate 
governance should be the hallmark by which all our 
stakeholders recognise the Company’s standing as we 
continue to build and develop the future of the business.
Bobby Godsell
Chairman
Statement of compliance with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Directors are committed to maintaining high standards  
of corporate governance. as a premium u K-listed company, 
during the year ended 31 December 2015 Polymetal 
international was required to comply with the u K Corporate 
g overnance Code (the u K Code) – published in September 
2014 and available through the u K Financial r eporting 
Council’s website – or, where the provisions of the u K  
Code have not been complied with, to provide appropriate 
explanations. During 2015, the Company was in compliance 
with all provisions of the u K Code. 
as well as complying with the u K Code, the Company has 
complied with all applicable regulations of the Moscow Stock 
exchange and r ussian securities laws since its shares were 
admitted for secondary trading on the Moscow exchange.
Role and structure of the Board
The Company’s Board comprises the non-executive 
Chairman, one executive Director, and seven non-executive 
Directors. excluding the Chairman, four members of the 
Board are independent non-executive Directors. r efer  
to the schedule opposite for the structure of the Board  
and its Committees, showing the status of each Director.
The independent non-executive Directors are those 
determined by the Board to be independent in character  
and judgement and to be free from relationships or 
circumstances which may affect or could appear to affect 
their judgement. The role of the independent Directors  
on the Board is to challenge the strategy and scrutinise the 
performance of management in meeting agreed goals and 
objectives, to monitor the reporting of performance of the 
Company, to review the integrity of financial information,  
and ensure that the Company’s internal financial controls  
and system of risk management are robust and defensible. 
They are responsible for determining the appropriate level  
of remuneration for the g roup Chief executive (g roup CeO) 
and have a primary role in appointing and, when necessary, 
removing him.
Directors’ interests are disclosed in annual declarations and 
the Company Secretary is notified promptly of any changes 
to those interests. Before each Board meeting, independent 
non-executive Directors reconfirm their independence and  
all Directors disclose whether they hold any interests in any 
matters to be reviewed at the Board meeting.
n on-independent non-executive Directors include  
Mr Yanakov (who is a representative of Powerboom 
investments l imited); Ms g rönberg (who is a representative 
of v italbond l imited, l ynwood Capital Management Fund 
l imited) and Mr Duvieusart (who is a representative of PPF 
g roup). Mr n esis is the brother of the beneficial owner of 
Powerboom investments l imited. Save for the potential 
conflicts inherent in these relationships, there are no potential 
conflicts of interest between the duties owed by the Directors 
or senior management to the Company and their private 
interests or other duties.

The g roup CeO’s responsibilities include: 
•	 developing and proposing g roup strategy, including 
communicating annual plans and commercial objectives  
to the Board; 
•	 upholding the g roup’s responsibilities to its shareholders, 
customers, employees and other stakeholders; 
•	 identifying and executing strategic opportunities; 
•	 reviewing the operational performance and strategic 
direction of the g roup; 
•	 making recommendations on remuneration policies, 
executive remuneration and terms of employment  
for senior employees; 
•	 ensuring that the development needs of senior 
management are identified and met;
•	 ensuring effective succession planning; and 
•	 ensuring effective communication with shareholders  
and that appropriate, timely and accurate information  
is disclosed to the market, with issues escalated  
promptly to management and the Board.
Senior Independent Director (SID)
Christine Coignard serves as a SiD of Polymetal. 
Ms Coignard is available to major shareholders in order  
to listen to their views and help develop a balanced 
understanding of their issues and concerns. She also  
acts as an intermediary for the other Directors if necessary.  
in 2015, Ms Coignard attended a series of one-on-one 
meetings with institutional shareholders and investors, 
arranged as part of the Company’s roadshow, and the 
investor events organised by the Company’s brokers.  
The Board is regularly updated on shareholders’ opinions 
following meetings with the Directors and management.
Separate meetings are held between the non-executive 
Directors without the Chairman or the g roup CeO being 
present; between non-executive Directors without the 
Chairman, led by the SiD, to appraise his performance 
annually and on such other occasions as appropriate;  
and between the independent non-executive Directors 
without the other non-executive Directors being present.  
This includes both formal and informal meetings 
between Directors.
The Board has determined Jonathan Best, Christine 
Coignard, l eonard Homeniuk, and r ussell Skirrow to be 
independent non-executive Directors. Bobby g odsell met  
the independence criteria on appointment. 
Jonathan Best has been on the Board of the Company  
since September 2011 and on the Board of JSC Polymetal 
since December 2006, and his reappointment is subject to 
particularly rigorous review. The Board believes that Mr Best 
continues to display all of the qualities of independence 
pursuant to the criteria set out in the Code. From October 
2014, Mr Homeniuk no longer holds any shares, and since 
December 2014 is no longer executive Chair and CeO of 
Polygon g old inc. (Polygon), in which Polymetal holds a 
42.6% equity ownership and one of the three board seats. 
Polymetal’s interest in Polygon, with a carrying value of less 
than u S$0.5 million, is not material. accordingly, the Board 
continues to consider that Mr Homeniuk was independent 
throughout 2015 and continues to be an independent  
non-executive Director.
The Company considers that the Board and its  
Committees have the appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company 
to enable them to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively. all Directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary, and are 
able to take independent professional advice, if necessary, 
at the Company’s expense.
Board meetings
in 2015, the Board met seven times. Further business was 
approved by written resolution on one further occasion  
and by a Committee of the Board on six occasions  
(four by way of a written resolution). 
The Board is responsible for: 
•	 defining the commercial strategy and long-term objectives 
of the g roup; 
•	 approving annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets and any material changes to them; 
•	 overseeing the g roup’s operations, ensuring competent 
and prudent management, sound planning, a strong 
system of internal control, and compliance with all statutory 
and regulatory obligations; 
•	 reviewing the performance of the g roup in the light of its 
business strategy, objectives, business plans and budgets 
and ensuring that any necessary corrective action is taken; 
•	 approving any material extension of the g roup’s activities 
into new businesses or geographic areas and any decision 
to cease to operate all or any material part of the g roup’s 
business; and 
•	 ensuring a mutual understanding of objectives and 
maintaining constructive dialogue with shareholders.
The schedule of matters reserved to the Board is reviewed  
at least annually.

Roles of the Chairman, Group Chief Executive and 
Senior Independent Director
The Board has approved the division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the g roup Chief executive  
(g roup CeO) and the role of the Senior independent  
Director (SiD).
Chairman
The Chairman reports to the Board and is responsible  
for the leadership and overall effectiveness of the Board and 
for setting the Board’s agenda. His responsibilities include: 
•	 effective running of the Board; 
•	 ensuring there is appropriate delegation of authority  
from the Board to executive management; 
•	 promoting a culture of openness and debate by facilitating 
the effective contribution of non-executive Directors in 
particular and ensuring constructive relations between 
executive and non-executive Directors; 
•	 encouraging active engagement by all members of the 
Board and ensuring that the Directors receive accurate, 
timely and clear information; and 
•	 ensuring that the views of the shareholders are 
communicated to the Board as a whole.
Mr g odsell is able to commit sufficient time to his role as 
non-executive Chairman of Polymetal international and the 
Board believes that other commitments do not adversely 
affect his contribution to the Company. Mr g odsell’s other 
significant commitment is a non-executive directorship in  
the South african industrial Development Corporation. He is 
also the Chairman of Business l eadership South africa and 
co-Chairman of the South african Millennium l abour Council.
Group CEO
The g roup CeO exercises his role through his executive  
and/or director positions in the g roup subholding 
companies. He reports to the Chairman and the Board 
directly and upholds the g roup’s responsibilities to its 
shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders. 
He is responsible for the management of the g roup and  
for developing the g roup’s business strategy, objectives, 
budget and forecasts, and overseeing their successful 
implementation, once approved by the Board.
The Board interacts with management on a regular basis. 
Directors invite senior managers to attend relevant parts of 
the Board and Committee meetings, to report on agenda 
items and participate in discussion.
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board uses the annual g eneral Meeting (ag M)  
to communicate with investors and to encourage their 
participation. To ensure the Company’s shareholders have 
time to consider our annual r eport and n otice of ag M and 
lodge their proxy votes in good time, all meeting materials are 
made available more than 20 working days prior to the ag M. 
Separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially 
separate subject and all resolutions are put to a poll. The 
Company also offers shareholders the option to abstain.
Shareholders who are not able to attend the ag M are 
encouraged to submit proxy votes either electronically  
or in paper format. at the Company’s 2015 ag M, we 
received votes representing approximately 75% of our  
issued share capital. The Company did not have a significant 
percentage of shareholders voting against any resolution. 
The results of the proxy vote are presented at the meeting, 
with the final results announced via the london Stock 
exchange and available on the website.
in addition, our ag M provides a valuable opportunity for 
shareholders to meet with and put questions to the Directors 
in person. The 2015 ag M was attended by all Directors, 
including the Chairs of the audit and r isk, r emuneration  
and n omination Committees. The 2016 ag M of the 
Company will be held in london to enable easier 
participation of shareholders in the meeting.
The primary means of communication with the majority  
of our shareholders, who have not requested paper copies  
of our documentation, is through our corporate website:  
www.polymetalinternational.com.

Nomination Committee
The n omination Committee is chaired by Mr g odsell  
and its other members are Mr Homeniuk and  
Ms Coignard. The Committee has responsibility for  
making recommendations to the Board on the composition 
of the Board and its Committees, including appointments  
of additional and replacement Directors. The Committee: 
•	 leads the process for Board appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board; 
•	 regularly reviews the Board structure, size and composition 
(including skills, knowledge, independence, experience 
and diversity) and makes recommendations to the  
Board about any changes that the Committee  
considers necessary; 
•	 considers plans and makes recommendations to the 
Board for orderly succession to the Board and to senior 
management, so as to maintain an appropriate balance  
of skills and experience within the Company and on the 
Board and to ensure progressive refreshing of the Board, 
taking into account the challenges and opportunities  
facing the Company; 
•	 keeps under review the leadership needs of the g roup, 
both executive and non-executive, with a view to ensuring 
the continued ability of the g roup to compete effectively  
in the marketplace; 
•	 evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge, experience, 
independence and diversity of the Board before any 
appointment is made by the Board, and in the light  
of this evaluation prepares a description of the role  
and capabilities required for a particular appointment  
and the expected time commitment; and 
•	 reviews the results of the Board’s performance evaluation 
process that relates to the composition of the Board and 
whether non-executive Directors are spending enough 
time in discharging their duties.
There were two meetings of the n omination Committee in 
2015. at its meetings, the Committee continued discussing 
succession planning in the Company and the development  
of the Young l eaders Programme. This programme helps 
evaluate the talent pool for the g roup and tailors training  
for the future senior management needs of the g roup.  
as part of this programme, a series of meetings took place 
between young leaders and Board members. Training 
opportunities for all of the g roup’s employees continue  
to be discussed. 
The n omination Committee acknowledges that a deep  
and rigorous approach to succession planning is vital for  
the Company’s continuing success so that leadership  
is fully aligned to corporate strategy, both at Board and  
senior management levels.
Diversity continues to be the focus of attention. in 2015,  
the proportion of women working in the g roup was  
23% (2014: 22%). Women represent 22% of Board  
members (2014: 22%), 23% of senior management positions  
(2014: 22%); and 44% of qualified employees (2014: 43%). 
The Board welcomes diversity at all levels; it believes that the 
right way to approach diversity is by putting competence  
first and seeking the right qualities for each and every 
appointment. Diversity becomes a distinct advantage with 
such an approach and is in line with the Company’s objective 
of promoting women at all levels of the g roup. The Company 
facilitates promotion of women within its offices and 
operations, including hiring women in positions traditionally 
held by men.
The regular monitoring of compliance in relation to the 
diversity policy is undertaken by the Hr Department.  
n o instances of discrimination towards the g roup’s 
employees have been reported. all candidates and 
employees have equal opportunities regardless of gender, 
age, race, nationality, language, origin, wealth, residence, 
religion and other beliefs, social membership or other 
personal circumstances.

 Further business conducted by the r emuneration Committee was approved by written resolution on three further occasions. 
The Board considers that the composition of the Board and 
the n omination Committee complies with the requirements  
of the u K Code.
Board evaluation
in 2015, the Board carried out a performance evaluation  
of itself, its Committees, the Chairman and the g roup CeO.  
This was conducted without the assistance of an external 
facilitator. The first externally facilitated Board review had 
taken place in 2013 and was performed by l intstock l td,  
an independent advisor with no other connection to the 
Company. in accordance with the u K Code, it is the  
Board’s intention that the evaluation process will be  
externally facilitated every three years and the next  
one will take place over the course of 2016.
Self-evaluation consisted of the Board discussing its 
composition and operational integrity; the balance of 
executive and non-executive Directors, independent 
Directors and Directors representing major shareholders;  
the balance of skills, experience, and knowledge of the 
Company; and international diversity. The number of  
Board and Committee meetings held was discussed 
as well as the performance of each Committee of the  
Board. The remuneration of Directors and senior 
management was also considered.
The outcomes of the self-evaluation were as follows:
•	 it was agreed that the Board worked effectively together  
as a unit;
•	 overall the Board and its Committees operated successfully;
•	 Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information 
ensuring ongoing Board effectiveness; 
•	 each Director continues to contribute effectively and  
to demonstrate commitment to the role (including their 
commitment of time for Board and Committee meetings 
and any other duties);
•	 the Directors’ training programme will be further tailored 
(with assistance from external advisors) to answer the skills 
development needs of the Board.
Re-election policies 
in accordance with the u K Code, all Directors are subject  
to annual re-election.
Full terms and conditions of the appointment of non-
executive Directors are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office.
The Directors’ biographical details are set out on pages  
70 to 71 and following their performance evaluations, the 
Board and Chair consider that each of the Directors standing 
for re-election will continue to be an effective contributor to  
the g roup’s success and demonstrate commitment to his  
or her role. a performance evaluation of the Chairman was 
conducted by the Board in 2015, and the Board believes that 
the Chairman continues to be effective and to demonstrate 
commitment to his role.
Induction
u pon appointment, Directors receive a full induction, 
including information about the Company; an outline of the 
role of a Director and a summary of his or her responsibilities 
and ongoing obligations under legislation, regulation and  
best practice; and a copy of the Memorandum on inside 
information, insider l ists and Code of Practice on Dealing in 
Securities. Directors also receive the Company’s guidelines 
on matters reserved to the Board, terms of reference of the 
Board Committees and other governing documents of the 
Company. Directors and Chairs of the Board Committees 
regularly receive updates on changes to corporate 
governance and regulatory requirements and other changes 
affecting the Company. The Board is kept informed of 
relevant developments in the Company by way of monthly 
management reports, including comprehensive information 
on operating and financial performance, and the progress  
of capital projects. a field trip to Mayskoye for Directors took 
place in august 2015.
Board site visits
annual site visits greatly improve the Board’s 
understanding of Polymetal’s operations and organisation 
and contribute to the Board’s evaluation of the g roup’s 
business plan and strategy. On a two-day visit to the 
Company’s operations in Kazakhstan during 2014, the 
Board of Directors gained valuable first-hand insights  
into local management, challenges and opportunities. 
They met with key mine executives and employees, and 
were given a detailed tour of production facilities at the 
varvara mine and of the proposed site at the Kyzyl project. 
in 2015, the Board visited Mayskoye, the newest operating 
mine in Polymetal’s portfolio.

The audit and r isk Committee monitors the Company’s 
relationship with its external auditor relating to the provision  
of non-audit services to ensure that auditor objectivity  
and independence are safeguarded. This is achieved by 
disclosure of the extent and nature of non-audit services  
(see n ote 14 to the consolidated financial statements) and 
the prohibition against selected services being provided  
by the external auditor.
The policy governing the provision of non-audit services  
by the external auditor approved by the Committee defines 
permitted audit and non-audit services.
Pre-approval thresholds are in place for the provision  
of non-audit services by the external auditor, being:  
pre-approval by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of JSC 
Polymetal if the services are provided to a r ussian or Kazakh 
business entity of the g roup, and the Director of the Cyprus 
office of Polymetal international plc if the services are 
provided to other g roup companies if below u S$5,000;  
by the Chair of the audit and r isk Committee if between 
u S$5,000 and u S$20,000; or by the audit and r isk 
Committee if above u S$20,000.
above a certain threshold, if it is determined that the  
external auditor has no obvious competitive advantage  
in the performance of proposed non-audit services, then  
the provider of those services must be chosen by way of  
a competitive tender. Certain types of non-audit work may  
be undertaken by the auditor without prior referral to the 
audit and r isk Committee up to a cumulative annual value  
of u S$100,000. any further non-audit work is subject to 
approval by the audit and r isk Committee in further tranches 
of u S$100,000. in the event that the cumulative value of 
non-audit fees exceeds u S$500,000 in any given year, 
separate approval by the audit and r isk Committee is 
required explaining why there is no threat to independence.  
a copy of the policy is available on the Company’s website: 
www.polymetalinternational.com.
The audit and r isk Committee has considered information 
pertaining to the balance between fees for audit and non-
audit work for the g roup in 2015 and concluded that the 
nature and extent of non-audit services provided do not 
present a threat to the external auditor’s objectivity 
or independence.
Dear Shareholders
as reported in more detail elsewhere in this annual r eport, 
2015 proved yet another difficult year for precious metals 
mining companies. Our own businesses in russia and 
Kazakhstan were subjected to high levels of economic 
uncertainty, caused by the general geopolitical situation  
and the continued weakness in commodity prices. 
The audit and r isk Committee plays a key role in 
safeguarding the Company’s exposure to risk and,  
in particular, confirming the adequacy of the risk 
management process and the procedures in place to 
minimise any potential negative impact. g iven the current, 
challenging macroeconomic situation, we increased the 
focus on risk analysis during this year’s Committee meetings.
i would also like to specifically highlight the sterling work 
carried out by the internal audit function. This has included 
both raising the awareness and understanding of risk levels 
within the Company and focusing on the operational risk 
matrix and its impacts on the business.
u nder amendments to the u K Code, there is now a 
requirement for companies to include a longer-term viability 
statement to provide shareholders with an improved and 
broader assessment of the solvency and liquidity of a 
business over an extended period of time. Polymetal  
has been fully compliant with this process and able  
to demonstrate the strength of its disciplined financial 
planning in ensuring long-term stability for the Company.
The audit and r isk Committee and the Board are pleased 
with the continued progress of the finance team. The high 
quality of financial reporting and implementation of internal 
controls has contributed greatly to our ability to police the 
principal risks to the business in an increasingly efficient 
manner; particularly for those relating to financial, tax and 
market risk.
The audit and r isk Committee is a fully independent body, 
consisting only of independent non-executive Directors  
with relevant skills and experience in financial reporting  
and risk management.
in 2015, six meetings of the audit and r isk Committee were 
held and further business conducted by the Committee was 
approved by written resolution on three additional occasions.

The Board considers that the audit and r isk Committee 
complies with the requirements of the u K Code and 
g uidance on r isk Management, internal Control and  
related Financial and Business reporting.
Internal control and risk management
The Company aims to ensure that all its activities are 
adequately controlled to mitigate risk and support the 
achievement of its objectives while avoiding the creation  
of excessive bureaucracy. The system of internal controls  
is designed to manage rather than completely eliminate risk, 
to achieve the Company’s business objectives whilst bringing 
residual risk to an acceptable level, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
in conducting its annual review of the effectiveness of  
risk management and internal control (including financial, 
operating and compliance controls), the Board considers  
the key findings from the ongoing monitoring and reporting 
processes, management assertions and independent 
assurance reports.
The Board also takes account of material changes and 
trends in the risk profile and considers whether the control 
system, including reporting, adequately supports the Board 
in achieving its risk management objectives.
During the course of the year, the Board considered the 
g roup’s responsiveness to changes within its business 
environment. The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing 
process, which has been operational during the year, and up 
to the date of approval of the annual r eport, for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by 
the g roup.
Internal audit
The internal audit function supports this aim by providing  
the Directors, through the audit and r isk Committee, with  
an objective evaluation of the Company’s and the g roup’s 
governance framework. The internal audit function also aims 
to raise levels of understanding and awareness of risk and 
control throughout the g roup.
The head of internal audit reports to the g roup CeO and, 
through the audit and r isk Committee, to the Board of 
Directors. Where relevant, the internal audit function will 
additionally report its findings to members of the g roup’s 
executive management.
The internal audit function’s annual work plan is designed to 
focus on matters arising from the operational risk matrix and 
is approved by the audit and r isk Committee in advance. 
The internal audit function uses an annual self-certification 
process, which requires managers throughout the g roup  
to personally confirm the testing of internal controls and 
compliance with g roup policies within their business  
or function and the steps taken to address actual  
or potential issues that are identified.
Management provides a timely response to issues raised by 
internal audit. Where possible, the issues are resolved within 
one reporting period.
Internal control framework and activities
The management structure of the g roup and internal  
policies and procedures are aimed at maintaining a robust 
control framework within the g roup which will result in the 
achievement of strategic objectives within the set risk 
tolerance levels.
This framework includes: 
•	 an appropriate tone set from the top (Board level), aimed  
at building the appropriate control environment; 
•	 a proper risk identification and management system  
(for more detail please refer to pages 64-69); 
•	 a strict division of responsibilities and adequate delegation 
of authority; 
•	 specific control activities implemented at all levels of the 
g roup; and 
•	 a periodic review of the effectiveness of internal controls.
The governance framework reflects the specific structure and 
management of the g roup, where authority and control are 
delegated by the Board to different levels, from the g roup 
CeO to the managers of the g roup’s operating entities  
and then downward to business and project managers 
as appropriate.
Within this framework, authority is delegated within clearly 
prescribed limits and decisions are escalated where either 
project size or risk profile require a higher level of authority.  
in addition to controls operating in specific areas (production, 
exploration, construction, procurement), the control framework 
also includes a set of common procedures for financial 
accounting, reporting and budgeting – see details on the 
next page.
The Board confirms that the actions it considers necessary 
have been or are being taken to remedy any failings or 
weaknesses in the g roup’s system of internal controls.  
This has involved considering the matters reported to it  
and developing plans and programmes that it considers are 
reasonable in the circumstances. Based on the results of the 
review of risk management and internal control activities 
undertaken by the Board and the audit and r isk Committee, 
the Board considers that the risk management and internal 
control systems are in accordance with the r evised g uidance 
for Directors in the u K Code.
used for assessing the fair value less costs to sell of the 
individual Cgu s tested for impairment. The Committee 
examined and challenged the commodity price, discount 
rate and exchange rate assumptions used by management 
in its impairment tests; 
•	 evaluating the existence and recoverability of metal 
inventories. The Committee examined the price 
assumptions used by management as well as unit costs 
and other internal assumptions used in determining  
the net realisable value of unfinished goods within metal 
inventories (ore and concentrate stockpiles); 
•	 evaluating the recoverability of exploration and development 
assets. The Committee evaluated management’s approach 
to determine whether the existing exploration and 
development assets are likely to generate future economic 
benefits and whether any indicators of impairment had 
been identified; 
•	 the impact of sanctions on the Company’s performance 
and its access to external funding; 
•	 internal controls and the risk of misstatement: the 
Committee reviewed reporting from internal audit in respect 
of its audit plan and discussed all significant findings; 
•	 reviewing the construction risks at Kyzyl in detail as part  
of the annual ‘deep dive’ exercise; and
•	 reviewing readiness for preparing the longer-term viability 
statement and reviewing its draft.
The Chair of the audit and r isk Committee makes himself 
available to major institutional shareholders annually to 
discuss the Company’s annual reporting to shareholders as 
part of the Company’s investor day. He is also available for 
one-on-one meetings with key shareholders at their request.
The re-appointment of Deloitte ll P as the g roup’s external 
auditor is reviewed annually by the audit and r isk Committee. 
Deloitte ll P was appointed auditor in 2011, with Deloitte CiS 
having been auditor of JSC Polymetal since the last tendering 
process in 2007 . The g roup has a policy of tendering the 
external audit at least every ten years. The Committee’s 
assessment of the external auditor’s performance and 
independence underpins its recommendation to the Board to 
propose to shareholders the re-appointment of Deloitte llP 
as auditor until the conclusion of the ag M in 2017 . r esolutions 
to authorise the Board to re-appoint and determine the 
auditor’s remuneration will be proposed at the ag M  
on 17 May 2016.
We intend to tender our external audit in 2020 for the 2021 
audit, which will coincide with the completion of the 5 year 
term of our current audit partner, and at that point Deloitte 
ll P will have been our auditor for 10 years following our 
listing on the london Stock Market. i t is our intention that 
Deloitte will be invited to participate in this tender process, 
along with other appropriately qualified international audit 
firms. We are in compliance with the provisions of The 
Statutory audit Services for l arge Companies Market 
investigation Order 2014. 
Review of the effectiveness of the external audit  
process and audit quality
The audit and r isk Committee has adopted a formal 
framework in its review of the effectiveness of the external 
audit process and audit quality which focuses on the 
following areas: 
•	 the audit partners, with particular focus on the lead audit 
engagement partner. in 2015 the Company’s existing  
audit partner was rotated and the Committee started 
working with the new partner; 
•	 the audit team; 
•	 planning and scope of the audit and identification  
of areas of audit risk; 
•	 execution of the audit; 
•	 the role of management in an effective audit process; 
•	 communications by the auditor with the audit and r isk 
Committee, and how the auditor supports the work of the 
audit and r isk Committee; 
•	 how the audit contributes insights and adds value; and
•	 the independence and objectivity of the audit firm and the 
quality of the formal audit report to shareholders.
an auditor assessment is completed annually by each 
member of the audit and r isk Committee and by the  
CFO. Feedback is also sought from the g roup CeO, other 
members of the finance team, divisional management and 
the head of internal audit.
The assessment tool adopted is comprehensive and includes 
detailed questions which are completed by way of a formal 
questionnaire every three years, while the key areas are 
reviewed every year. The feedback from this process is 
considered by the audit and r isk Committee and is provided 
both to the auditor and to management. action plans arising 
are also reviewed by the Committee.
The effectiveness of management in the external audit process 
is assessed principally in relation to the timely identification  
and resolution of areas of accounting judgement, the quality 
and timeliness of papers analysing those judgements, 
management’s approach to the value of the independent 
audit, the booking of audit adjustments arising (if any) and the 
timely provision of draft public documents for review by the 
auditor and the audit and r isk Committee.
every three years, the audit and r isk Committee requests 
that a partner independent of the audit engagement team 
discusses the quality of the external audit process with the 
audit and r isk Committee Chair and the CFO using this 
evaluation framework.
During this year, the audit and r isk Committee focused on: 
•	 evaluating the recoverability of goodwill and PPe. The 
Committee examined the potential indicators of impairment 
(or impairment reversal, where appropriate) for each of the 
cash-generating units and the life-of-mine financial models

UK Bribery Act 2010
The Company and its Directors are committed to ensuring 
adherence to the highest legal and ethical standards. This 
must be reflected in every aspect of the way the g roup 
operates. Bribery is a criminal offence in the countries in 
which the g roup operates. Corrupt acts expose the g roup 
and its employees to the risk of prosecution, fines and 
imprisonment, as well as endangering the Company’s 
reputation. The g roup has a Code of Conduct in place, 
which refers to its anti-bribery and corruption policy.  
The policy extends across all of the g roup’s business 
dealings in all countries and territories in which the g roup 
operates and applies to directors, managers and all 
employees of the g roup, as well as relevant business 
partners and other relevant individuals and entities.
The Board attaches the utmost importance to this policy  
and applies a zero tolerance approach to acts of bribery and 
corruption by any of the g roup’s employees or by business 
partners working on the g roup’s behalf. The policy prohibits 
the payment, offer or authorisation of bribes, the receipt or 
acceptance of a bribe, or the payment, offer or promise to 
pay any facilitating payments. any breach of this policy is 
regarded as a serious matter by the Company and is likely  
to result in disciplinary action.
as part of its implementation of internal procedures to 
comply with the u K Bribery act, the g roup has a formalised 
whistle-blowing policy which defines the processes in place 
for staff to communicate, in confidence, concerns about 
possible improprieties, unethical or illegal activities and 
ensures that arrangements are in place for the independent 
investigation of such matters.
The Company affirms that it has not denied any personnel 
access to the audit and r isk Committee and that it has 
provided protection to whistle-blowers from adverse 
personnel action.
The Code of Conduct, anti-Bribery and Corruption  
Policy and the Whistle-Blowing Policy are available on the 
Company’s website: www.polymetalinternational.com.
Financial reporting systems
The quality of financial accounting and reporting is ensured 
through a set of control procedures in the following areas: 
accounting methodology, preliminary review of new 
transactions, documentation, accounting techniques  
and financial closing procedures. accounting policies are 
developed centrally for each of the g roup’s subsidiaries and 
are adapted for the specifics of each entity and g roup-wide 
policies. employees responsible for accounting and reporting 
functions have powers to review upcoming transactions and 
propose adjustments, where necessary, to ensure proper 
accounting and tax treatments. The use of a centralised 
enterprise r esource Planning (er P) system in each of the 
g roup companies ensures unification of the business and 
accounting processes. The g roup implements a multi-level 
set of controls over financial and accounting data recorded in 
the system. These controls involve the accounting department 
of each subsidiary, senior management of the subsidiary and 
controls at the relevant headquarters level. in addition, the 
accounting and reporting data are regularly audited by internal 
and external auditors.
procedures for approval of capital and current 
expenditures
The g roup prepares annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets based on its current and strategic goals and 
objectives. in addition to periodic control of actual versus 
budgeted financial performance, a procedure of ongoing 
control and authorisation of expenses is in place. The current 
system of pre-approval of significant transactions, along with 
accounting procedures in the er P system, achieves a level  
of control over the amount and appropriateness of expenses.
Treasury operations
The g roup operates a centralised treasury function, which  
is responsible for payments on behalf of all operating 
subsidiaries of the g roup. u se of such a centralised system 
achieves the best level of control over the payments function 
without compromising the speed and reliability of payments. 
all transactions with banks on accounts maintenance, 
deposits and borrowings and foreign currency transactions 
are also performed at relevant headquarters level in 
compliance with the treasury policy approved by the Board.
Controls over IT systems used in financial accounting 
and reporting
The g roup uses a 1C:enterprise 8 er P system for the 
automation of everyday enterprise activities. These include 
various business tasks of the economic and management 
functions, such as management accounting, business 
accounting, Hr management, supplier relationship 
management (Sr M) and material requirements planning 
(Mr P). The g roup also uses the er P system for budgeting, 
accounting, Hr record-keeping and payroll, supply chain 
management, operational reporting and procurement.  
The g roup operates an iT management framework based  
on COBiT (Control Objectives for information and r elated 
Technology), which provides a complete set of high-level 
requirements to be considered for effective control of each 
iT process.
remuneration report
Dear Shareholders
i have the pleasure to now chair the r emuneration 
Committee. i am proud to take over the role from  
Mr Homeniuk and to continue the excellent work that  
he has carried out on behalf of the Board. His skills and 
experience will be a valuable asset in his role as the Chair  
of the newly formed Safety & Sustainability Committee.
Remuneration principles and strategy
Polymetal has, over the years, developed and implemented 
remuneration policies and structures that are aligned with  
our strategy, commercial objectives and culture as well as 
adapted to the large mining company that we have now 
become. a simple yet robust and comprehensive system, 
which is in line with best practices for FTSe 250 companies 
and our international peers, is in place. Therefore, at this 
stage i see our role in the r emuneration Committee as 
assisting the Board in ensuring that remuneration continues 
to allow us to attract and retain top talent and qualified 
executives as well as evolving smoothly with regulatory 
changes, market requirements and best practice.
Throughout the g roup, we aim to compensate our 
employees fairly for their contribution and treat compensation 
as part of an overall motivation system that includes 
promoting an open, positive, fair, cooperative and thriving 
work environment, targeting best practice in all our 
endeavours. an environment in which everybody  
is offered the chance to progress.
The r emuneration Committee focuses on determining the 
framework and broad policy for the remuneration of our 
senior management team while reviewing remuneration 
trends across the g roup. Salaries and benefits structures  
for operational and other professional staff are broadly 
covered in the investing in our People section of the 
Sustainability r eport.
Remuneration structure
The focus on sustainable shareholder value creation is the 
cornerstone of our executive remuneration system and is 
taken into consideration in all components of our 
remuneration structure.
Despite the significant recent devaluation of the currencies  
in which our g roup CeO and only executive Director 
v italy n esis, our senior management and our employees  
are remunerated, we have had very low staff turnover.  
We attribute this in part to our quick reaction early in 2015  
in adjusting senior management and all employees’ base 
salary with forecasted CPi numbers, a decision we have 
again endorsed early this year with a base salary increase of 
13% for all g roup employees (including senior management) 
whose salaries are denominated in r oubles and Tenge, and 
12% for our g roup CeO, effective from 1 april 2016. We 
remain nevertheless very prudent in maintaining a stable pay 
structure that is sustainable throughout a period of currency 
volatility, bearing in mind the risks associated with a potential 
reversal in currency trends.
The remuneration of Mr n esis, all senior management and  
all key employees includes a clearly defined KPi component 
derived from top-level goals and adjusted to individual 
responsibilities and performance that forms the basis for 
determining, in a fully transparent manner, the variable part  
of remuneration. This year, following several fatalities at our 
mines, we have introduced a new bonus calculation system 
for senior managers and mine management that includes 
much more focus on health and safety KPis.
as in 2014, 50% of bonuses awarded to the g roup CeO  
and the senior management team were deferred into shares 
in the Company through the long-Term i ncentive Plan (l TiP), 
to ensure senior management’s commitment to the Company 
and to its long-term objectives.
2015 was the second year in which our l TiP scheme was 
implemented. Shares granted in the previous year were 
allotted to the respective senior managers. as a clear sign 
that senior management interests are aligned with those  
of our shareholders, our l TiP plan stipulates that no option 
vests in the event that TSr for the period, as measured 
relative to peers and on the Company’s absolute TSr , 
is negative.
There has been no change in 2015 in non-executive Directors’ 
remuneration and no change is further planned in 2016.
Context to the Committee’s decisions
2015 continued to be a challenging year with continued 
weakness in the commodities markets and ongoing 
macroeconomic and geopolitical issues in r ussia and 
Kazakhstan. We continued to concentrate on controlling 
costs, delivering robust operating performance and 
maintaining capital discipline which allowed us to pay  
regular and special dividends on the back of a robust  
cash flow generation for the year. 
We are well-informed about remuneration disclosure 
requirements and ensure that all procedures in place are fully 
compliant with the applicable regulations and best practice. 
These priorities are reflected in our remuneration decisions 
when awarding performance bonuses to the g roup CeO and 
senior employees, and when reviewing their base salaries.  
as a result, we consistently receive over 96% of votes in 
favour of ag M resolutions related to remuneration and  
to the re-appointment of Directors.

83 82 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Key Committee decisions
•	 g iven the prevailing market conditions, the r emuneration 
Committee decided that any significant changes to the 
existing approach to the remuneration of Directors and 
senior officers of the g roup in 2015 would 
be inappropriate.
•	 The Committee approved the increase of 12% in the g roup 
CeO’s r ouble-denominated base salary from 1 april 2016 
in line with inflation in r ussia.
•	 an annual bonus, representing 33% of the maximum 
available amount, was awarded to the g roup CeO in 
respect of 2015.
•	 a Health and Safety KPi carrying a 25% weight in overall 
KPi measures, with a nil fatalities threshold, was introduced 
to the g roup CeO’s annual bonus targets.
•	 in 2015 the r emuneration Committee continued 
implementing the long-Term i ncentive Plan (l TiP),  
which was supported by a 99.8% shareholders’ vote.  
The plan includes a total shareholder return (TSr )  
underpin stipulating that no options will vest in the event 
that TSr for the period is negative. Other features include 
the mandatory deferral of 50% of annual bonuses for three 
years, to be paid in shares, and clawback provisions for 
the g roup’s executives.
Corporate governance and approach to disclosure
as a FTSe 250 company, listed on the london Stock 
exchange, we believe that our shareholders expect 
Polymetal to comply with the strictest of corporate 
governance requirements. We remain committed to  
full adherence to all regulatory requirements and best 
practice as reflected in our remuneration policy, decisions, 
disclosure practices and requests for shareholders’ vote. 
The Company’s remuneration policy was approved by 
binding vote at the ag M held in 2014 with 99.77% of votes 
cast in favour, with the policy to be in force for three years 
and to be put to a new binding vote in 2017. The 2014 
remuneration report was approved at the ag M held  
in May 2015, with 99.32% of votes cast in favour. 
This section sets out the Company’s remuneration policy  
and report for its Directors and provides details of their 
remuneration and share interests for the year ended 
31 December 2015. 
With our commitment to adhering to best practice in the 
marketplace and following shareholders’ representatives’ 
request, we are disclosing this year’s retrospective targets 
when reporting executive Director remuneration, as it helps 
provide a clearer picture of the relationship between the 
Company’s performance and executive remuneration. 
as there were no changes to the approved Directors’ 
remuneration policy this year we will not be putting it to a 
binding shareholder vote. The Directors’ annual remuneration  
report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at  
the ag M of the Company on 17 May 2016. 
Moving forward
in accordance with regulatory requirements, the Company’s 
remuneration policy must be put to a new binding vote in 
May 2017. Therefore we will review it during the course of 
2016 and adjust if and where required.
We anticipate keeping the 2017 remuneration policy broadly 
aligned with that put to a vote in 2014. n evertheless we will 
review it this year against our strategy, market adjustments 
and in light of ongoing regulatory requirements, best 
corporate governance practice and investors’ views. With 
caution, we intend to benchmark our total senior executive 
remuneration structure and level against a representative 
peer group. We also intend to obtain advice in respect  
of the compliance of our remuneration structure, corporate 
governance relating to remuneration and adequacy of 
existing terms of reference with best practices, and will act 
accordingly when appropriate.
On behalf of the Committee and of the Board, i welcome 
feedback from shareholders and look forward to receiving 
your support at the ag M.

of a mix of financial and non-financial 
measures. For 2015, performance 
metrics and associated weightings 
for each were: 
• 	 pr odu c t io n 	 ( 2 5 %) ;	
•	 t o ta l 	 c a s h 	 c ost s 	 ( 2 5 %) ;

•	 he a lt h 	 a nd 	 s af et y 	 ( 2 5 %) .	
There is an additional penalty factor 
for fatal/severe cases for up to 50% 
of the annual bonus earned for 
non-safety related KPis.
The Committee has discretion  
to vary the weighting of performance 
metrics over the life of this 
remuneration policy. in addition, the 
Committee has discretion to vary 
performance metrics part-way 
through a performance year if there is 
a significant event which causes the 
Committee to believe that the original 
performance conditions are no 
longer appropriate. Performance is 
measured over the financial year.

87 86 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for the other members of the g roup’s executive team and broader management team of the g roup  
is consistent in both structure and KPis with the policy in respect of the g roup CeO. Whilst the value of remuneration will vary 
throughout the g roup, depending upon the individual’s role, criticality to the business and level of seniority, the remuneration 
of all senior executives consists of a base salary, an annual bonus and participation in the new l TiP (the PSP and DSa). 
employees up to three levels below the Board (approximately 300 employees throughout the g roup) participate in the l TiP  
at the discretion of the r emuneration Committee. The PSP policy grant level is 150% of base salary for the g roup CeO,  
100% for executive Committee members and 50-100% for employees of the level below the executive Committee. 
Shareholding requirements are also set below Board level. The DSa operations mirror the arrangement set out for executive 
Directors in the policy table, where 50% of the annual bonus is compulsorily deferred into shares and released annually to 
employees over a period of three years.
r emuneration policy for the wider group of employees is aimed at aligning pay with the achievement of targeted results for 
each employee. The Company’s policy on fair pay provides for the payment of additional remuneration for employees living  
in difficult climatic locations and the delivery of appropriate levels of pay for different levels of work. The bonus component of 
remuneration for mid-level management and operational staff is measured based on the achievement of production targets, 
increasing output, the level of justified cost savings and health and safety records. in terms of pension arrangements, the 
Company applies a consistent approach for the g roup CeO and other employees and adheres to the mandatory pension 
contributions required under applicable laws.
Salaries are considered for annual increases based on the Company’s performance results, inflation rates and the competitive 
level of salaries versus the wider market.
Notes to the policy table
performance measures and targets
The Committee selected the performance conditions indicated in the policy table because they are central to the Company’s 
overall strategy, and are the key metrics used under the annual bonus and l TiP by the g roup CeO to oversee the operation  
of the business.
Performance targets for all of our incentive plans are reviewed annually, and where appropriate are typically set at a level that  
is in line with the Company’s forecasts.
Changes to remuneration policy for 2016
Design element Changes made during the year
Base salary a 13% increase, equal to r ussian CPi, across the workforce, including top management,  
and a 12% increase for the g roup CeO v italy n esis has been approved starting from 1 april 2016. 
Annual bonus n o changes made. 50% of bonus deferred into shares as required by the DSa.
LTIp Two grants of options were made under the new PSP plan in april 2014 and 2015. a new tranche  
of options is expected to be granted in april 2016 in the ordinary course of business.
Non-executive Directors no changes made.
The LTIp
Following shareholder approval at the ag M in June 2013, a long-term incentive programme (the ‘Performance Share Plan’  
or ‘PSP’) was put in place. Some minor amendments to the l TiP were approved by shareholders at the ag M in May 2014.
The key terms of the l TiP are described in the policy table above.
The Board believes that the l TiP ensures continued alignment of the executive team’s performance with shareholder interests 
and rewards superior long-term performance and the creation of sustainable shareholder value. The Board also believes that 
the l TiP is in line with u K best practice and follows fully the provisions of the u K Corporate g overnance Code and other 
relevant guidelines, while also containing features which are superior to common practice in the u K – such as a positive  
TSr underpin for vesting of the l TiP .

(Maximum performance, Target performance and Minimum performance) is set out in the chart below.
This chart shows that the proportion of remuneration delivered through short-term and long-term incentive schemes  
is in line with our remuneration policy and changes significantly across the three performance scenarios. as such, the 
package promotes the achievement of both short-term and long-term performance targets and drives the alignment  
of the g roup CeO’s interests with the interests of shareholders.

89 88 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Approach to recruitment remuneration 
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay a competitive overall package as appropriate to attract  
and motivate the right talent for the role. if an executive is promoted to the Board from within the Company, any pre-existing 
awards or benefits that were made available to him or her prior to becoming a Director (and not in anticipation of an imminent 
promotion to the Board) will be retained and allowed to vest or be provided under the original terms.
The following table sets out the various components, which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package 
for the appointment of an executive Director. any new Director’s remuneration package would include the same elements,  
be set at a level consistent with the scope of the role (at a level not exceeding that of the g roup CeO as set out in the 
remuneration policy table) and be subject to the same constraints as those of existing Directors performing similar roles,  
as shown below.
area Policy and operation
Base salary and benefits The base salary level will be set by taking into account the experience of the individual and the salaries 
paid in comparable companies. Depending on the circumstances of any particular appointment, the 
Committee may choose to set the base salary below market median and increase the amount paid over  
a period of time to achieve alignment with market levels for the role (with reference to the experience and 
performance of the individual), subject to the Company’s ability to pay. in line with the remuneration policy, 
as set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table, no benefits will be provided to recruited Directors.
pension Pension contributions will be limited to the mandatory contributions required by r ussian/Kazakh/Cypriot 
or any other applicable law, as set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table.
Annual bonus The executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme as set out in the 
Directors’ remuneration policy table. The maximum annual opportunity is 150% of base salary. 50% of 
any bonus is deferred into shares under the DSa, as set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table.
Long-term incentives The executive Director will be eligible to participate in the l TiP at the r emuneration Committee’s 
discretion in line with the details set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table. The maximum annual 
grant permitted under the scheme rules is 200% of base salary and the normal grant level is up to 150% 
of base salary. Performance measures would apply, as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Replacement awards The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards so that overall they are no more generous 
in terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited as a consequence of the 
individual joining the Company. in determining the quantum and structure of any replacement awards,  
the Committee will seek to replicate the fair value and, as far as practicable, the timing, form and 
performance requirements of the forfeited remuneration. The maximum value of replacement awards  
is capped at 50% of the individual’s base salary, and at least 50% of any replacement award should  
be delivered in the Company’s shares.
Other Should relocation of a newly recruited executive Director be required, reasonable costs associated  
with this relocation will be met by the Company. Such relocation support may include, but not be  
limited to payment of legal fees, removal costs, temporary accommodation/hotel costs, a contribution  
to stamp duty, and replacement of non-transferable household items. in addition, and in appropriate 
circumstances, the Committee may grant additional support in relation to the payment of school fees  
and the provision of tax advice. The Company will reimburse the executive Director for all reasonable 
expenses which he/she may incur while carrying out executive duties.

Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
Loss of office policy
The Committee’s approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take into account individual 
circumstances, including the reason for termination, contractual obligations of both parties and applicable share plan and 
pension scheme rules (including any relevant performance conditions).
v italy n esis is an executive Director of Polymetal international plc and CeO of JSC Polymetal, a 100% subsidiary of the  
g roup incorporated in r ussia. Further details are set out in the Current Directors’ service contracts section on page 92.

of office.

Treatment of annual  
bonus awards
Where an executive Director’s employment is terminated after the end of the performance year, but 
before the payment of the annual bonus is made, the executive may be eligible for an annual bonus 
award for that performance year subject to an assessment based on performance achieved over  
the period. n o award will be made in the event of gross misconduct. 
Where an executive Director’s employment is terminated during a performance year, a pro-rated  
annual bonus award for the period worked in that performance year may be payable, subject to an 
assessment based on performance achieved over the period.
Treatment of unvested  
Deferred Share Awards  
under plan rules
in normal circumstances, Deferred Share awards will continue until the normal time of vesting upon 
cessation of employment in g ood l eaver Circumstances. alternatively, the Board may determine that 
Deferred Share awards will vest immediately. in both circumstances there would be no pro-rating of the 
Deferred Share awards for time from the award date until cessation of employment or for performance.
Treatment of unvested 
performance Share plan  
awards under plan rules
any outstanding award will lapse at cessation of employment with the g roup, unless the cessation is 
due to death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, or any other circumstances which the 
Committee determines, when the award will vest as normal in accordance with the terms of the award. 
alternatively, the Committee may determine that a proportion of the award will vest immediately, with 
the proportion determined by the Committee, taking into account (where relevant) the extent to which 
the performance conditions have been met or are likely to be met at the end of the performance period, 
and any other factors the Committee may consider relevant. The number of shares shall also normally 
be pro-rated down to reflect the reduced service period.
Exercise of discretion any discretion available in determining the treatment of incentives upon termination of employment  
is intended only to be relied upon to provide flexibility in unusual circumstances. The Committee’s 
determination will take into account the particular circumstances of the Director’s departure and the 
recent performance of the g roup.
Change of control in relation to Performance Share Plan awards in the event the Company’s shares cease to trade on  
the l ondon Stock exchange or any other recognised stock exchange (Delisting) or the Directors of the 
Company pass a resolution to the effect that Delisting is imminent or where the Board determines that a 
‘significant event’ has occurred, which may be a demerger, winding up or compulsory acquisition of the 
Company, or any other event as determined by the Board, at the discretion of the Board and, where 
applicable, with the consent of the acquiring company, PSP awards will not vest but will be exchanged 
for new PSP awards.

excluding the value of long-term incentives, the percentage change in total remuneration for the g roup CeO was a 44% 
decrease from u S$907 ,790 in 2014 to u S$511,665 in 2015 due to the significant devaluation of the r ussian r ouble against 
the u S Dollar and a penalty factor applied to the annual bonus because of fatalities (see page 47 , 85, 93). in r ouble terms  
the g roup CeO’s total remuneration for 2015 decreased by 10% compared with 2014. The average percentage change  
in total remuneration for all employees in the year was a 18% decrease mainly driven by devaluation.
To ensure the comparability of this figure, and to minimise distortions, the all-employee remuneration figure is on the

Implementation of remuneration policy in the following financial year
in 2016, the Committee intends to implement the executive and non-executive Director remuneration policies as follows:
Base salary
The policy for determining 2016 base salaries will remain unchanged. Base salary for the g roup CeO for 2015 and 2016 is set 
out below:
2016 salary

 Base salary for 2016 is translated at the closing exchange rate of r ouble to u S Dollar stated by the Central Bank of the r ussian Federation as at 28 March 2016. Base salary for 2015 
is translated at the closing exchange rate of r ouble to u S Dollar stated by the Central Bank of the r ussian Federation as at 1 February 2015.
The r emuneration Committee decided to increase the base salary by 13% for all g roup employees whose salaries are 
denominated in r oubles, and by 12% for the g roup CeO v italy n esis, effective 1 april 2016. 
pension and benefits
n o pension or benefits plans are in place for 2016, except for the defined pension contributions to the mandatory pension 
fund of the r ussian Federation.
Annual bonus
The targets for annual bonus measures are considered commercially sensitive, particularly in the gold mining industry, 
because of the sensitivity of information that their disclosure may provide to the Company’s competitors, given that these are 
largely based outside the u K and hence are not subject to the same reporting requirements as the Company.

to provide support in relation to the design and operation of the new l TiP and on the changes associated with the new 
remuneration report regulations. PwC is a member of the r emuneration Consultants’ g roup (r Cg ) and a signatory of the 
r Cg v oluntary Code of Practice, and incorporates the principles of the voluntary Code of Practice into its engagement.  
n o other services were provided by PwC during 2015 other than external assurance services for the Company’s Sustainability 
report. Fees paid to PwC in relation to remuneration services provided to the Committee in 2014 totalled u S$48,000 (no fees

Corporate governance
r efer to pages 73 to 77 for a description of the g roup’s 
corporate governance structure and policies.
Going concern
in assessing its going concern status, the g roup has taken 
account of its financial position, anticipated future trading 
performance, its borrowings and other available credit 
facilities, and its forecast compliance with covenants  
on those borrowings and its capital expenditure commitments 
and plans. as at 31 December 2015, the g roup held 
u S$52 million in cash and had net debt of u S$1,298 million, 
with u S$1,196 million undrawn facilities of which u S$980 
million are considered committed. Debt of u S$287 million is 
due for payment within one year and certain committed but 
undrawn facilities expire within that period, but the g roup’s 
cash generation and liquidity remains strong and the g roup 
believes it will be able to operate within existing facilities,  
but could secure additional financing if and when needed.
The Board is satisfied that the g roup’s forecasts and 
projections, having taken account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, show that the g roup has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
at least the next 12 months from the date of this report and 
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2015.
Longer-term viability statement
Based on key drivers and measures of success used within 
the business, the Board assessed the prospects of the 
g roup, taking account of potential impact of the principal 
risks to the g roup’s business model and ability to deliver  
its strategy, including solvency and liquidity risks during  
the reasonably reliable lookout period.
Lookout period
The period over which the Board considers it possible to 
form a reasonable expectation as to the g roup’s longer-term 
viability, based on the stress testing and scenario planning 
process employed by the g roup, is the three-year period to 
December 2018. This is aligned with the g roup’s existing 
mid-term forecasting performed on the annual basis and 
covering strategic and investment mid-term planning. The 
Board is confident that routine operational risks are being 
effectively managed within the three-year lookout period and 
corporate scenario planning is focusing primarily on plausible 
changing external factors with a reasonable degree of 
confidence whilst still providing an appropriate longer-
term outlook.
principal risks
The Board has continued to place great emphasis on risk 
management in 2015, taking account of material external 
economic and geopolitical challenges and considering the 
g roup’s responsiveness to changes within its business 
environment. The detailed assessment of principal risks  
and uncertainties facing the g roup is set out on  
pages 64-69 of this annual r eport.
The corporate planning process is underpinned by life-of-
mine plans and stress scenario testing. The stress tests are 
designed to evaluate the resilience of the g roup to the 
potential impact of principal risks and the availability and 
effectiveness of the mitigating actions that could be taken to 
avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying 
risks. in considering the likely effectiveness of such actions, 
the conclusions of the Board’s regular monitoring and review 
of risk and internal control systems, as discussed on pages 
64-65, were taken into account.
Key assumptions
The key assumptions underpinning the Board’s assessment 
include gold and silver prices, production volumes, foreign 
exchange rates and the ability to roll forward borrowing 
facilities as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.  
in making these forecasts, full consideration has also been 
given to all other principal risks to the business. These  
risks have been considered in our stress testing where 
appropriate, or are considered to be either immaterial  
or too remote to affect our viability over a three-year period.
Liquidity and solvency
The sources of funding available to the g roup are set out  
in n ote 25 to the consolidated financial statements. Our base 
case projections demonstrate that the g roup should be able 
to operate within the currently available debt facilities and 
comply with all related covenants during the lookout period, 
assuming necessary roll-overs and limited additional debt 
based on the historically successful ability of the g roup to 
raise finance. Our stress testing focuses in particular on 
significant adverse changes in market prices of gold and 
silver and demonstrates that under reasonably possible 
downside gold and silver price assumptions, only limited 
mitigating action is required to maintain liquidity and covenant 
compliance, including the refinancing of existing facilities  
as they mature.
Expectations
The Board confirms that taking into account the g roup’s 
current position and based upon the robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the g roup and stress testing-based 
assessment of the g roup’s prospects, the Board has a 
reasonable expectation that the g roup will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall  
due over the period to 31 December 2018.

Capital structure
The structure of the Company’s share capital is detailed in 
n ote 31 to the financial statements. There are no specific 
restrictions on the size of a holding or on the transfer of 
shares, which are both regulated by the articles of the 
Company and applicable legislation. The Directors are not 
aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares 
or on voting rights.
The articles of the Company can be altered by a special 
resolution of the Company. a resolution is a special resolution 
when it is passed by three-quarters of the members who 
(being entitled to do so) vote in person, or by proxy, at a 
g eneral Meeting of the Company. Pursuant to the Company’s 
articles, the Directors have the power to allot equity Securities 
(as defined in the a rticles).
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter  
or terminate upon a change of control of the Company,  
such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements and 
employees’ share plans. n one of these is considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of 
the g roup as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not 
aware of any agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or employees that provide for compensation  
for loss of office or employment that occurs because  
of a takeover bid. Substantial shareholdings in the  
Company are disclosed on page 178.
Details of employee option schemes are set out in the 
remuneration report on pages 93 to 98. There were no 
acquisitions of the Company’s own shares in 2015.  
as at 31 December 2015, the g roup and its subsidiaries  
held no treasury shares (31 December 2014: no shares).  
as at 31 December 2015, the Company had shareholders’ 
authority to purchase up to 42,260,272 of its own 
ordinary shares.
at the ag M of the Company held in 2015, the power to allot 
equity Securities was renewed up to an aggregate number  
of 140,867 ,574 ordinary shares, provided that the Directors’ 
power in respect of such an amount may only be used  
in connection with a pre-emptive issue (as defined in  
the articles).
The Directors are further empowered pursuant to article 12.4 
of the Company’s articles to allot equity Securities for cash 
as if article 13 of the articles (Pre-emptive rights) did not 
apply and for the purposes of paragraph (b) of article 12.4  
of the articles, the n on Pre-emptive Shares (as defined  
in the articles) are an aggregate number of up to 
21,130,136 ordinary shares. 
Dividends
The g roup’s profit for the year ended 31 December 2015 
attributable to equity holders of the Company was  
u S$244 million (2014: loss of u S$210 million). u nderlying  
net earnings (adjusted for the after-tax amount of impairment 
charges/reversals and foreign exchange losses) in 2015  
were u S$293 million (2014: u S$282 million). in august 2015,  
the Company declared an interim dividend of u S$0.08  
per share (2014: u S$0.08 per share), which was paid in 
September 2015. a special dividend of u S$0.30 per share 
(2014: u S$0.20 per share) was declared and paid by the 
Company in December 2015. The Directors have proposed 
the payment of a final dividend of u S$0.13 per share  
(2014: u S$0.13 per share).
Annual General Meeting
The ag M of shareholders of the Company will take place  
on Tuesday 17 May 2016 at 10.30 am (BST) at etc venues, 
Bishopsgate Court, 4-12 n orton-Folgate, 5th Floor, l ondon, 
e1 6DQ, u K.
Auditors
each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval 
of this annual r eport confirms that: 
•	 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the g roup’s auditor is unaware; and 
•	 the Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to 
have taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the g roup’s auditor is aware of that information.
Deloitte ll P has expressed its willingness to continue in 
office as auditor and a resolution to re-appoint it will be 
proposed at the forthcoming ag M. The audit and r isk 
Committee reviews both the level of the audit fee and the 
level and nature of non-audit fees as part of its review  
of the adequacy and objectivity of the audit process.
Having taken all matters considered by the Board and 
brought to the attention of the Board during the year into 
account, we are satisfied that the annual r eport, taken as  
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

101 100 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Directors’ responsibility statement independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Polymetal international plc
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. u nder that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the g roup financial statements in accordance with international Financial r eporting Standards as adopted 
for use in the european u nion (iFr S). The financial statements are required by law to be properly prepared in accordance  
with the Companies (Jersey) l aw 1991. international accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present  
fairly for each financial year the g roup’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition 
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the international accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework  
for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’.
in virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable iFr Ss.  
However, the Directors are also required to:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in iFr Ss are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
(Jersey) l aw 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. l egislation in the u K and Jersey governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with international Financial r eporting Standards, give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
•	 the management report, which is incorporated into the strategic report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Opinion on financial statements of polymetal International plc
In our opinion the financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of the Group’s profit  
for the year then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union; and
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income, 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in equity, Consolidated Statement of Cash flows and the 
related n otes 1 to 35. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and iFr Ss 
as adopted by the european u nion.
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained 
within n ote 1 to the financial statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the g roup contained 
within the Directors’ report on page 99. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
•	 the directors’ confirmation on page 99 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing  
the g roup, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
•	 the disclosures on pages 65-69 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
•	 the directors’ statement in n ote 1 to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the g roup’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
•	 the director’s explanation on page 99 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the g roup, over what period  
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have  
a reasonable expectation that the g roup will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due  
over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee  
as to the g roup’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial r eporting Council’s ethical Standards for auditors and we confirm that we  
are independent of the g roup and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  
We also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.

103 102 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Polymetal international plc continued
l ast year our report included one additional risk which is not included in our report this year, being accounting for and 
valuation of the Kyzyl consideration payable. The accounting treatment was established last year and has not changed  
since, therefore it has not been necessary for us to consider this a significant risk in the current year.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the audit and r isk 
Committee discussed on page 80.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the g roup to be $16 million (2014: $18 million), which is 4% (2014: 5%) of adjusted pre-tax  
profit and 3% of equity (2014: 2%). Pre-tax profit is adjusted to exclude net foreign exchange losses recognised which would, 
if included, significantly distort materiality year on year. in 2014 we also excluded impairment losses, however there were  
no such losses to exclude in 2015.
We agreed with the audit and r isk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 
$320,000 (2014: $360,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We also report to the audit and r isk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our g roup audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the g roup and its environment, including g roup-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement across the g roup. Our audit scope focused primarily on the eight key 
reportable segments (voro, Okhotsk, Dukat, Omolon, varvara, amursk-albazino, Mayskoye and Kyzyl) and the corporate 
entities such that 100% (2014: 100%) of revenue and 97% (2014: 99%) of total assets were subject to a full scope audit, 
which is consistent with last year’s approach.
at the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement in the aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit.
The g roup audit team was involved in the work of the component auditors at all stages of the audit process. The signing 
partner and senior members of the g roup engagement team visited the Head Office in St. Petersburg on multiple occasions  
in the past year and continued to follow a programme of regular planned visits to the g roup’s other business units.  
The g roup audit team directed and reviewed in detail the work performed on significant risks by the component auditors.
Our audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component, which were between 
$8.0 million and $10.4 million (2014: $9.0 million and $12.6 million).
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
u nder the Companies (Jersey) l aw, 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•	 proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or proper returns adequate for our audit  
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
r isk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Recoverability of pp&E and Goodwill (Notes 2, 3, 18 and 19)
as a consequence of the recent volatility in gold  
and silver prices, foreign exchange rates and the 
political and economic uncertainties in r ussia, the 
assessment of recoverability of PP&e (carried at  
$744 million) and goodwill (carried at $14 million)  
is a key judgement.
Management has assessed whether any indicators  
of impairment existed at its eight cash generating 
units (‘Cgu s’) (as set out in n ote 5). Where goodwill is 
allocated to that Cgu (at Dukat and Mayskoye), 
management performs formal impairment testing  
as at 31 December 2015 to assess whether the 
recoverable amount of the Cgu exceeds its net  
book value.
We challenged management’s assessments as to whether indicators of impairment 
(or impairment reversal) exist for the g roup’s Cgu s through critical assessment of 
developments in the wider economic environment and the performance of each of 
the Cgu s in the year and through meetings with local  
and g roup operational management. 
We obtained copies of the valuation models used to determine the recoverable 
amount of Cgu s and tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models.
We challenged the assumptions underpinning the models, including the discount 
rate used, expected metal prices, capital and operating expenditure forecasts, 
production profiles and foreign exchange rates. This was achieved by comparison 
to third party documentation, the review of reserves and resources reports, 
consultation with Deloitte specialists (to critically assess the discount rate  
applied) and discussions with operational management. We assessed whether 
assumptions had been determined and applied consistently across the g roup.  
We applied sensitivities to the price assumptions and operating cost forecasts.
We assessed management’s ability to forecast accurately by comparing  
their 2015 forecasts to 2015 actual financial results.
Recoverability of Exploration & Development (E&D) assets (Notes 2, 3 and 18)
at 31 December 2015 the g roup held $616 million  
in respect of e&D expenditure on the Balance Sheet 
of which $428 million related to Kyzyl project (‘Kyzyl’).
r ecoverability is dependent on the expected future 
success of exploration activities. e&D expenditure  
is capitalised once it has been determined that the 
mineral property can be economically developed. The 
valuation assessment of each asset’s future 
prospects requires significant judgement.
in 2015, management completed a feasibility study for 
Kyzyl and the development was subsequently 
sanctioned by the Board in n ovember 2015.
We reviewed the Competent Persons’ r eport prepared by management’s 
technical experts and held discussions with them regarding the assumptions used 
in their report to ensure consistency with our understanding. We assessed the 
Competent Person’s competence, capabilities and objectivity in providing their 
report. We challenged the recoverability of the Kyzyl asset carrying value  
by assessing management’s assumptions used in their net present value (‘n Pv ’) 
calculation. We reviewed license conditions to ensure there were no breaches  
in the terms.
For the remainder of the e&D assets, management 
undertook a detailed assessment of e&D assets for 
impairment, which included a review of developments 
in the year and planned further e&D expenditure, 
including the expected timings for that spend.
We challenged management’s conclusions as to where impairment indicators, 
under the requirements of iFr S 6 ‘exploration and evaluation assets’, existed for 
the remainder of the e&D assets and assessed the recoverability of assets by 
meeting with operational management to discuss material e&D assets, reviewing 
drilling and other testing results in the year and confirming future development 
plans. We reviewed Board-approved budgets for 2016/7 to check that specific 
exploration project spend was committed and we performed detailed testing  
to assess the validity of costs capitalised in the year.
Existence and valuation of metal inventories (Notes 2, 3 and 22)
at 31 December 2015 the g roup held $295 million  
in respect of metal inventories on the Balance Sheet.
Management’s determination of the contained  
metal levels in ore stockpiles and work in progress 
involves the use of sampling techniques and 
theoretical models.
We tested the existence of metal inventories through attending inventory counts 
performed by management’s experts and assessing the controls surrounding 
measuring the net realisable value of the inventory at a sample of operating 
locations and performing roll forward testing from the count dates through  
to year end by testing management’s metal inventory models. We assessed  
the management’s experts’ methodology, expertise and objectivity.
The assessment of the recoverability of metal 
inventories requires judgement both in terms of 
calculating expected costs to process and refine  
ore stock piles to produce concentrate or doré for 
sale, and in terms of estimating future prices to be 
realised on sale.
We tested the recoverability of metal inventories through the recalculation of 
projected net realisable values based on expected commodity prices (which  
were consistent with prices used in the g roup’s PP&e and goodwill impairment 
calculations) and costs to complete. We also performed substantive analytical 
procedures on management’s inventory costing calculations.
We tested inventories for obsolescence by reviewing management’s strategic 
mine plans and assessing whether there is appropriate provisioning in place,  
in particular where stockpiles are no longer expected to be used.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception continued
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising  
from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if in our opinion information  
in the Annual Report is:
•	 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
•	 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course 
of performing our audit; or
•	 otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee 
which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.
Other matters
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance  
with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied to the company.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools 
aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) 
Law, 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify  
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired  
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

Going concern 
In assessing its going concern status, the Group has taken account of its financial position, anticipated future trading 
performance, its borrowings and other available credit facilities, and its forecast compliance with covenants on those 
borrowings and its capital expenditure commitments and plans. As at 31 December 2015, the Group held US$51.8 million of 
cash and had net debt of US$1,297.8 million, with US$1,195.8 million, of which US$979.7 million were considered committed. 
The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, having taken account of reasonably possible changes  
in trading performance, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the  
next 12 months from the date of this report and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
While assessing the Group’s longer-term viability, the Board confirms that taking into account the Group’s current position and 
based upon the robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and stress-testing based assessment of Group’s 
prospects, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2018. Please refer to the Longer-term viability statement on page 99 of the 
Annual report. 
Basis of presentation
The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements have been 
prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments and share-based payments which are measured 
at fair value. 
The accounting policies have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2015. 
Amended accounting standards adopted by the entity
The following new accounting pronouncements which became effective in the current reporting period: 
•	 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 cycle; 
•	 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 cycle;
•	 Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans – Employee Contributions. 
The adoption of these new accounting pronouncements has not had a significant impact on the accounting policies,  
methods of computation or presentation applied by the Group.
New accounting standards issued but not yet effective
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers (‘IFRS 15’), which covers principles that an entity shall apply to report information to users of financial statements 
about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. 
Application of the standard is mandatory for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with earlier 
application permitted. The Group is in the process of determining the impact of IFRS 15 on its consolidated financial 
statements and doesn’t expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments. In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (‘IFRS 9’).  
This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January, 2018, and permits early adoption. IFRS 9 
provides a revised model for recognition, measurement and impairment of financial instruments. IFRS 9 also includes a 
substantially reformed approach to hedge accounting. The Group is in the process of determining the impact of IFRS 9  
on its consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16 Leases. IFRS 16 replaces the following standards and interpretations: IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining 
whether an Arrangement contains a Lease. The new standard provides a single lessee accounting model for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. IFRS 16 applies to all leases including subleases and requires lessees to 
recognise assets and liabilities for all leases, unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the underlying asset has a low 
value. Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance. The Group is in the process of determining the impact of 
IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interest in Joint Operations. The amendments to IFRS 11 provide 
guidance on how to account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation in which the activities constitute a business 
as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combination and state that the relevant principles on accounting for business combinations in 
IFRS 3 and other standards should be applied. The same requirements should be applied to the formation of a joint operation 
if and only if an existing business is contributed to the joint operation by one of the parties that participate in the joint venture. 
A joint operator is also required to disclose the relevant information required by IFRS 3 and other standards for business 
combinations. Entities should apply the amendments prospectively to acquisitions of interest in joint operations occurring  
from the beginning of annual periods beginning on nor after 1 January 2016. 
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure. Initiative provides guidance on the use of judgement 
in presenting financial statement information, including: the application of materiality; order of notes; use of subtotals; 
accounting policy referencing and disaggregation of financial and non-financial information.
Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Joint Ventures: Sale or Contribution of Assets 
between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture remove an inconsistency between the two standards on the 
accounting treatment for gains and losses arising on the sale or contribution of assets by an investor to its associate or joint 
venture. Following the amendment, such gains and losses may only be recognised to the extent of the unrelated investor’s 
interest, except where the transaction involves assets that constitute a business.

2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, from 
the date that control effectively commenced until the date that control effectively ceased. Control is achieved where the 
Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line 
with those used by the Group.
All intra-group balances, transactions and any unrealised profits or losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated 
on consolidation.
Changes to the Group’s ownership interests that do not result in a loss of control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as 
equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the 
change in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest 
is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners 
of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on the disposal is calculated as the difference between  
1) the aggregated fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and  
2) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and non-controlling interests.
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion 
of the fair values of net assets recognised at acquisition. Thereafter, a share of the profit or loss for the financial year and other 
movements in the net assets or liabilities of the subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interests as shown in the income 
statement and balance sheet.
Business combinations
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. 
When acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed constitute an integrated set of activities, whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as 
a business by a market participant, and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination, using the guidance 
provided in the standard. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for 
each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred. Transaction costs incurred in connection with the business 
combination are expensed. Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition may include an asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the 
consideration transferred in a business combination. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of 
acquisition retrospectively with the corresponding adjustment against goodwill where they qualify as measurement period 
adjustments. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the 
measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The measurement period may not 
exceed one year from the effective date of the acquisition. The subsequent accounting for contingent consideration that does 
not qualify for as a measurement period adjustment is based on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as equity is not subsequently remeasured. Contingent consideration that is classified as an 
asset or liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets or IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement with the corresponding amount being 
recognised in profit or loss.
The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, 
except that:
•	 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and 
measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits, respectively;
•	 liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment 
arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment at the acquisition date; and
•	 assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are 
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date 
that have previously been recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if 
that interest was disposed of. 
Goodwill and goodwill impairment
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in 
the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the 
acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held 
equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as a 
bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Acquisition of mining licences
The acquisition of mining licences is often effected through a non-operating corporate entity. As these entities do not represent 
a business, it is considered that the transactions do not meet the definition of a business combination and, accordingly, the 
transaction is accounted for as the acquisition of an asset. The net assets acquired are accounted for at cost. Where asset 
acquisition is achieved in stages net assets acquired are accounted for sum of cost of the original interest acquired and the 
cost of additional interest acquired.
Investments in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 
arrangement. Significant influence constitutes the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the 
investee but does not extend to a control or joint control over the enactment of those policies. The results and assets and 
liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities 
require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
A joint operation is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the assets, and obligations 
for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. This includes situations where the parties benefit from the joint activity through  
a share of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the results of trading. In relation to its interest in a joint operation,  
the Group recognises: its share of assets and liabilities; revenue from the sale of its share of the output and its share of any 
revenue generated from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and its share of expenses.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the 
arrangement and is accounted for using the equity accounting method.
Equity method of accounting
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised in the consolidated balance 
sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income  
of the investee. When the Group’s share of the losses of an associate or a joint venture exceeds the Group’s interest in that 
entity, the Group ceases to recognise its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the 
Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of an investee at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying 
amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The requirements of IAS 39 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect  
to the Group’s investments. Where an indicator of impairment exists or the carrying value of the asset contains goodwill with 
an indefinite useful life, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance 
with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (IAS 36) as a single cash generating unit through the comparison of its recoverable amount 
(the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part 
of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36.
When a Group entity transacts with its investees, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the investee are 
recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate or the jont venture 
that are not related to the Group.
Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates. For all Russian entities the functional currency is the Russian Rouble (RUB). The functional currency of the 
Group’s entities located and operating in Kazakhstan (JSC Varvarinskoye, Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLP, JSC Inter Gold 
Capital) is the Kazakh Tenge (KZT). 
The Group determined that from 1 January 2015, there had been a change in facts and circumstances surrounding the 
operations of its parent company (Polymetal International plc) and some of its intermediate holding companies indicating that 
the functional currency of these companies had changed from the Russian Rouble to the US Dollar.
Following a number of international acquisitions in second half of the year ended 31 December 2014 and first half of the year 
ended 31 December 2015 funded by US Dollar-denominated loans, and a resulting increase in the share of the Group’s 
operations outside Russia, management has determined that the functional currency of the parent company and some  
of the intermediate holding companies had changed to US Dollar from 1 January 2015.
In accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, this change has been accounted for 
prospectively from this date.
The Group has chosen to present its consolidated financial statements in US Dollars (US$), as management believes it is  
a more convenient presentation currency for international users of the consolidated financial statements of the Group as it is  
a common presentation currency in the mining industry. The translation of the financial statements of the Group entities from 
their functional currencies to the presentation currency is performed as follows:
•	 all assets and liabilities are translated at closing exchange rates at each reporting period end date;
•	 all income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the periods presented, except for significant 
transactions that are translated at rates on the date of such transactions;
•	 resulting exchange differences are included in equity and presented as movements relating to the effect of translation to the 
Group’s presentation currency within the Translation reserve; and
•	 in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash balances at the beginning and end of each reporting period presented 
are translated using exchange rates prevalent at those respective dates. All cash flows in the period are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the periods presented, except for significant transactions that are translated at rates on the date 
of transaction.
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal 
involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a 
jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate 
that includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation 
attributable to the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.
In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign 
operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are 
not recognised in the consolidated income statement. For all other partial disposals (i.e. reductions in the Group’s ownership 
interest in associates or jointly controlled entities that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the 
proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets and liabilities acquired arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the 
end of each reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity.
The Group translated income and expenses occurred from second half of the year ended 31 December 2014 on monthly 
basis at average monthly exchange rates.
Exchange rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements were as follows:

The Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge are not freely convertible currencies outside the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan 
and, accordingly, any translation of Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge denominated assets and liabilities into US Dollar for 
the purpose of the presentation of consolidated financial statements does not imply that the Group could or will in the future 
realise or settle in US Dollars the translated values of these assets and liabilities.

Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currencies (foreign currencies) are recorded at the exchange rates 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary items carried at historical cost are translated at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Non-monetary items carried at fair value are translated at the exchange 
rate prevailing on the date on which the most recent fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising from changes in 
exchange rates are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Exchange differences generated by monetary items 
that form part of the intra-group net investment in the foreign operation are recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements within foreign currency translation reserve.
Property, plant and equipment
Mining assets
Mining assets include the cost of acquiring and developing mining assets and mineral rights. Mining assets are depreciated  
to their residual values using the unit-of-production method based on proven and probable ore reserves according to the 
JORC Code, which is the basis on which the Group’s mine plans are prepared. Changes in proven and probable reserves are 
dealt with prospectively. Depreciation is charged on new mining ventures from the date that the mining asset is capable of 
commercial production (Note 5). In respect of those mining assets whose useful lives are expected to be less than the life of 
the mine, depreciation over the period of the asset’s useful life is applied. 
Mineral rights for the assets under development are included within Exploration and development. When a production phase 
is started, mineral rights are transferred into Mining assets and are depreciated as described below.
Capital construction-in-progress
Capital construction-in-progress assets are measured at cost less any recognised impairment. Depreciation commences 
when the assets are ready for their intended use. 
Exploration and development assets
Mineral exploration and evaluation costs, including geophysical, topographical, geological and similar types of costs, are 
capitalised into Exploration and development assets if management concludes that future economic benefits are likely to be 
realised and determines that economically viable extraction operation can be established as a result of exploration activities 
and internal assessment of mineral resources. 
When it has been determined that a mining asset can be economically developed as a result of established proven and 
probable reserves, the costs to remove any overburden and other waste materials to initially expose the ore body, referred  
to as stripping costs, are capitalised as a part of mining assets when these costs are incurred.
Non-mining assets
Non-mining assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When 
parts of an item of property, plant and equipment are considered to have different useful lives, they are accounted for and 
depreciated separately. Depreciation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Estimated useful lives are as set out below:
•	 Machinery and equipment 5-20 years
•	 Transportation and other assets 3-10 years
Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with 
the asset’s carrying amount at the date. The gain or loss arising is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Stripping costs
During the production phase of a mine when the benefit from the stripping activity is the improved access to a component of 
the ore body in future periods, the stripping costs in excess of the average ore to waste ratio for the life of mine of that 
component are recognised as a non-current asset. After initial recognition, the stripping activity asset is depreciated on a 
systematic basis (unit-of-production method) over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body made 
accessible as a result of the stripping activity.
Estimated ore reserves
Estimated proven and probable ore reserves reflect the economically recoverable quantities which can be legally recovered in 
the future from known mineral deposits. The Group’s reserves are estimated in accordance with JORC Code.
Leases
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals 
arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
An impairment review of property, plant and equipment is carried out when there is an indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the estimated 
recoverable amount of the asset in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to 
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The carrying amounts of all the cash-
generating units are assessed against their recoverable amounts determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation. 
Fair value is based on the application of the Discounted Cash Flow Method (DCF) using post-tax cash flows. The DCF method 
is attributable to the development of proved and probable reserves and certain resources where a relevant resource-to-
reserve conversion ratio can be reasonably applied.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
original carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately.
Inventories
Metal inventories
Inventories including refined metals, metals in concentrate and in process, doré and ore stockpiles are stated at the lower of 
production cost or net realisable value. Production cost is determined as the sum of the applicable expenditures incurred 
directly or indirectly in bringing inventories to their existing condition and location. Refined metals are valued at the average 
total cost of production per saleable unit of metal. Work in-process, metal concentrate and doré are valued at the average 
total production costs at each asset’s relevant stage of production. Ore stockpiles are valued at the average cost of mining 
that ore. Where ore stockpiles and work in-process are not expected to be processed within 12 months, those inventories are 
classified as non-current.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for that product based on forward metal prices for inventories which 
are expected to be realised within 12 months, and the flat long-term metal prices for non-current inventories, less estimated 
costs to complete production and selling costs.
Consumables and spare parts
Consumables and spare parts are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted 
average moving cost. The portion of consumables and spare parts not reasonably expected to be used within one year is 
classified as a long-term asset in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, 
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial instruments designated as Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
A financial instrument other than a financial instrument held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial 
recognition if:
•	 such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise 
arise; or
•	 the financial instrument forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment 
strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
•	 it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial instruments at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit 
or loss. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 30.
Effective interest rate method
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating 
interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash 
receipts or payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, 
transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial instrument, or, where 
appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: FVTPL, available for sale (AFS) financial 
assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is 
determined at the time of initial recognition. No financial instruments have been classified as available for sale.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for financial instruments other than those financial assets classified as 
at FVTPL.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is determined by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of 
interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been 
affected. For equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its 
cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
•	 significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
•	 breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
•	 it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation; or
•	 the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognised is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception 
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable 
is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and 
the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the 
investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the 
impairment not been recognised.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, 
the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise 
the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they 
expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and 
payable is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to certain risks. Further details of 
derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 30.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the 
timing of the recognition in the consolidated income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics 
are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the hybrid contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets 
is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or fewer, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured 
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices
121 120 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Environmental obligations
An obligation to incur environmental restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs arises when disturbance is caused 
by the development or ongoing production of mining assets. Such costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other 
site preparation work, discounted to their net present value using a risk-free rate applicable to the future cash flows, are 
provided for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs  
are recognised in the consolidated income statement over the life of the operation, through the depreciation of the asset  
in the cost of sales line and the unwinding of the discount on the provision in the finance costs line. Costs for restoration of 
subsequent site damage which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values 
and recognised in the consolidated income statement as extraction progresses.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work (that result 
from changes in the estimated timing or amount of the cash flow or a change in the discount rate), are added to or deducted 
from the cost of the related asset in the current period. If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, 
the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
The provision for closure cost obligations is remeasured at the end of each reporting period for changes in estimates and 
circumstances. Changes in estimates and circumstances include changes in legal or regulatory requirements, increased 
obligations arising from additional mining and exploration activities, changes to cost estimates and changes to the risk free 
interest rate.
Employee benefit obligations
Remuneration paid to employees in respect of services rendered during a reporting period is recognised as an expense in 
that reporting period. The Group pays mandatory contributions to the state social funds, including the Pension Fund of the 
Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, which are expensed as incurred.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Income taxes are computed in 
accordance with the laws of countries where the Group operates.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they 
are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability  
is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end 
of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow 
from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its 
assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends  
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when they relate to items that are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and 
deferred tax is also recognised in consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where 
current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the 
accounting for the business combination.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived principally from the sale of gold and silver bullion and copper, gold and silver concentrate and is measured 
at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts.
Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion and sale of copper, gold and silver concentrate is recognised when the risks 
and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer, the Group retains neither a continuing degree of involvement nor 
control over the goods sold, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion represents the invoiced 
value of metal shipped to the buyer, net of value added tax (VAT).
Sale of gold and silver bullion
The Group processes doré produced in the Russian Federation (at Dukat, Okhotsk, Voro, Omolon, and Amursk-Albazino) into 
London Good Delivery Bars prior to sale. This final stage of processing is carried out on a toll-treatment basis at four state-
owned refineries. The Group sells gold and silver bullion to banks through long-term agreements. The sales price, as 
determined in the agreement, may be variable based upon the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) spot or fixed price, 
however the Group does not enter into fixed price contracts. For domestic sales, title passes from the Group to the purchaser 
at the refinery gate with revenue recognised at that point. For export sales, once the gold and/or silver bars have been 
approved for export by Russian customs, they are then transported to the vault of the purchaser, which is typically located in 
London. Title passes and revenue is recognised at the point when the gold and/or silver bars are received by the purchaser.
Sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate
The Group sells copper, gold and silver concentrate under pricing arrangements where final prices are determined by quoted 
market prices in a period subsequent to the date of sale. Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on forward prices for 
the expected date of final settlement. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment, which is also when risks and rewards pass 
to the buyer. Revenue is calculated based on the copper, gold and silver content in the concentrate and using the forward 
London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) or London Metal Exchange (LME) price to the estimated final pricing date, 
adjusted for the specific terms of the relevant agreement. Until final settlement occurs, adjustments to revenue are made to 
take into account the changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay. Revenue is presented net of 
refining and treatment charges which are subtracted in calculating the amount to be invoiced.
The Group’s sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate are based on a provisional price and as such, contain an embedded 
derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable 
from the sale of the concentrate at the forward exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not 
qualify for hedge accounting, is measured at FVTPL with changes in its fair value recognised within revenue in the 
consolidated income statement for each period prior to the final settlement.
Share-based compensation
The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to account share-based compensation. IFRS 2 requires companies to 
recognise compensation costs for share-based payments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
At the Annual General Meeting in June 2013, shareholders approved the new Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’). Under the 
new LTIP options are awarded on the annual basis after the publication of annual results and before the AGM. The first grant 
of options under LTIP took place on 22 April 2014.
Total number of options granted under the LTIP during the year ended 31 December 2015 amounts to 2,448,413 (2014: 
2,464,041 shares).
The fair value of the awards granted was estimated using a Monte Carlo model valuation (see Note 32). 
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices
123 122 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Under the management bonus deferral award plan, which is defined in the Remuneration report, a total amount of 187 ,953 
shares was granted in 2015 (2014: 103,936), which will be released over a period of three years. The Deferred bonus was 
measured at share price at a grant date and will be prorated across periods to the different vest dates. During the year ended 
31 December 2015 36,089 shares were released and issued in accordance with the plan (Note 31).
The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as a general, administrative and selling expense over the vesting period 
with a corresponding increase in the share-based compensation reserve. Upon the exercise of the awards, the proceeds 
received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to the stated capital account, and the amounts 
recognised within the share-based compensation reserve transferred to retained earnings.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share calculations are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the 
period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method, whereby the proceeds from the potential 
exercise of dilutive stock options with exercise prices that are below the average market price of the underlying shares are 
assumed to be used in purchasing the Company’s common shares at their average market price for the period.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that management has made in 
the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in consolidated financial statements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. The determination of estimates requires judgements which are based on historical experience, current and expected 
economic conditions, and all other available information. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the 
reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial period.
The most significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to:
•	 fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations;
•	 ore reserve estimates;
•	 depreciation;
•	 impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment;
•	 recoverability of exploration and development assets;
•	 valuation of stockpiles and work in-process;
•	 environmental obligations;
•	 contingencies; and
•	 income taxes.
Acquisitions
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. 
When acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed constitute an integrated set of activities and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination, using 
the guidance provided in the standard. In making this determination, management evaluates the inputs, processes and 
outputs of the asset or entity acquired. 
Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, joint arrangements are classified as joint operations or joint ventures based on the rights 
and obligations of the parties to the joint arrangements (Note 2). When entering in a new joint arrangement, the Group applies 
judgement to assess whether the parties that have joint control over the arrangement have rights to the assets, and 
obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement (joint operation) or rights to the net assets of the arrangement (joint 
venture), using the guidance provided in the standard.
Fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations
In accordance with the Group’s policy, the Group allocates the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed based on their fair values as estimated on the date of acquisition. Any difference between the cost of the acquired 
entity and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Group exercises significant 
judgement in the process of identifying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, valuing these assets and liabilities, and 
estimating their remaining useful lives. The valuation of these assets and liabilities is based on assumptions and criteria that,  
in some cases, include management’s estimates of discounted future cash flows. 
If actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions considered, the Group may have to adjust its estimates  
of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised and the goodwill balance during the measurement period. Such a 
remeasurement could have an impact on the amounts reported in the consolidated income statement in current and 
future periods.
Ore reserve estimates
An ore reserve estimate is an estimate of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the 
Group’s properties. Ore reserve estimates are used by the Group in the calculation of: depletion of mining assets using the 
units-of-production method; impairment charges and in forecasting the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land 
restoration costs. Also, for the purpose of impairment review and the assessment of the timing of the payment of 
decommissioning and land restoration costs, management may take into account mineral resources in addition to ore 
reserves where there is a high degree of confidence that such resources will be extracted.
In order to calculate ore reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about geological, technical and economic factors, 
including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, 
commodity prices, discount rates and exchange rates. Estimating the quantity and/or grade of ore reserves requires the size, 
shape and depth of ore bodies to be determined by analysing geological data such as the logging and assaying of drill 
samples. This process may require complex and difficult geological judgements and calculations to interpret the data.
Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period as additional geological data becomes available during the course of 
operations or if there are changes in any of the aforementioned assumptions. Such changes in estimated reserves may affect 
the Group’s financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including the following:
•	 asset carrying values due to changes in estimated future cash flows;
•	 depletion charged in the consolidated income statement where such charges are determined by using the units-of-
production method;
•	 provisions for decommissioning and land restoration costs where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about 
the timing of the payment of such costs; 
•	 carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities where changes in estimated reserves affect the carrying value of the 
relevant assets and liabilities; and
•	 contingent consideration liabilities when it depends on future sales of metal produced by certain mines.
Depreciation
Mining assets are depreciated using the units-of-production method except where the useful lives of the assets are shorter 
than the life of mine. The units-of-production depreciation calculations are based on proved and probable reserves under  
the JORC Code, which is the basis on which the Group’s mine plans are prepared as the useful lives of these assets are 
considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. For other property, plant and equipment, the straight-line method is 
applied over the estimated useful life of the asset which does not exceed the estimated mine life. 
The calculation of the units-of-production rate of depreciation could be impacted to the extent that actual production in the 
future is different from current forecast production based on proved and probable ore reserves. This would generally arise 
when there are significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in estimating ore reserves.
Impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment
The Group considers both external and internal sources of information in assessing whether there are any indications that 
goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment owned by the Group are impaired. External sources of 
information the Group considers include: changes in the market and economic and legal environment in which the Group 
operates, that are not within its control and that affect the recoverable amount of goodwill, mining assets or other property, 
plant and equipment.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices
125 124 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Internal sources of information the Group considers include the manner in which mining properties, plant and equipment are 
being used or expected to be used and indications of economic performance of the assets. In determining the recoverable 
amounts of the Group’s mining assets and other property, plant and equipment, the Group’s management determines the fair 
value less costs to sell by estimating the discounted future after-tax cash flows expected to be derived from the Group’s 
mining properties, costs to sell the mining properties and the appropriate post-tax discount rate. Reductions in metal price 
forecasts, increases in estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the 
amount of recoverable reserves and resources and/or adverse current economics can result in a write-down of the carrying 
amounts of the Group’s goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment.
In making the assessment for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are allocated to an 
appropriate cash-generating unit. Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets that do not generate 
independent cash inflows to appropriate cash-generating units, and also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash 
flows within the value-in-use calculation. Subsequent changes to the cash-generating unit allocation or to the timing of cash 
flows could impact the carrying value of the respective assets.
Exploration and development assets
Exploration and development assets include mineral rights for the assets under development and exploration and evaluation 
costs, including geophysical, topographical, geological and similar types of costs.
Exploration and evaluation costs are expensed as incurred, unless the Group concluded that a future economic benefit is 
more likely than not to be realised. Conclusion on recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets is based on internal 
evaluation of current exploration results and mineral resources identified for each exploration area within exploration licence. 
A high degree of confidence that the Group will determine the sufficient probability of future benefits viable requires a significant 
degree of judgement and assessment of all relevant factors such as the nature and objective of the project; the project’s 
current stage and the extent of exploration and evaluation that has been performed; project timeline; current estimates of the 
project’s net present value, including sensitivity analyses for the key assumptions; and the main risks of the project.
Mineral rights, usually acquired through business combination or acquisition of group of assets, are recognised in the balance 
sheet in accordance with applicable accounting policies (Note 2). Once mineral reserves and resources are established, such 
properties and capitalised evaluation and pre-production development expenditure are assessed for impairment in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy stated above. 
Stockpiles and work in-process
In determining mine operating costs recognised in the consolidated income statement, the Group’s management uses survey 
and assay techniques to estimate quantities of ore stacked on leach pads and in process and the recoverable gold and silver in 
this material to determine the average costs of finished goods sold during the period. Changes in these estimates can result in a 
change in mine operating costs of future periods and carrying amounts of inventories. At 31 December 2015 the carrying value 
of the ore stockpiles was US$166 million (2014: US $207 million) and work in-process was US$34 million (2014: US$51 million). 
Environmental obligations
The Group’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the 
environment. The Group’s provision for future decommissioning and land restoration cost represents management’s best 
estimate of the present value of the future cash outflows required to settle the liability which reflects estimates of future costs, 
inflation, movements in foreign exchange rates and assumptions of risks associated with the future cash outflows; and the 
applicable interest rate for discounting the future cash outflows. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ materially 
from the estimates. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations, life of mine estimates and discount 
rates could affect the carrying amount of this provision. 
Contingencies
By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of 
such contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgements and estimates of the outcome of future events.
Income taxes and mining taxes
The Group is subject to income tax and mining taxes in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Mining taxes do not meet 
the definition of a tax under IAS 12 Income taxes. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for these taxes 
due to the complexity of legislation. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes, 
penalties and interest will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially 
recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination 
is made.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The estimation of that probability 
includes judgements based on the expected performance. Various factors are considered in order to assess the probability  
of the future utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plan, expiration of tax losses carried 
forward, and tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from these estimates or if these estimates must be adjusted in 
future periods, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.

Kyzyl purchase price allocation
As described below, on 4 September 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Altynalmas Gold Ltd (AAG), the 
holding company for the Kyzyl gold project in Kazakhstan. 
As at 31 December 2014, purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Kyzyl was not completed and mineral rights were 
accounted for on a provisional basis. The Group completed the purchase price allocation review during the year ended 
31 December 2015 and retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts (Note 4b) recognised at the acquisition date to 
reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The adjusted fair 
values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Kyzyl as at the date of acquisition are presented in the following table:

4. Acquisitions and disposals continued
Settlement of the Kyzyl put option
In accordance with Kyzyl acquisition terms, the seller (Sumeru Gold B.V.) was entitled to a put option giving it a right to require 
Polymetal to acquire or procure acquirers for the consideration shares, described below, by notice to Polymetal during the 
one month period immediately following the first anniversary of completion at a price per consideration share equal to 
US$9.57027. On completion Polymetal recognised the repurchase obligation at the net present value of maximum repayment 
of US$300 million, which approximated to US$273 million, with a corresponding decrease in equity. At the same time the 
Group recognised the seller put option fair value in amount of US$54.6 million within consideration transferred with 
corresponding increase in equity. 
The put option had an exercise period from 4 September to 4 October 2015. 
In September 2015 the Group agreed to the following settlement mechanism for the put option:
•	 Polymetal settled the full contractual put option liability to the seller and delivered a cash payment in the amount of 
US$300 million;
•	 Simultaneously, Polymetal transfered the right to receive consideration shares to Otkritie Investments Cyprus Limited in 
exchange for a cash consideration of US$232 million. The cash consideration payable by Otkritie to Polymetal represented 
the average closing price of the Polymetal shares for the agreed quotation period being one month ended five business 
days before the date of signing the assignment agreement, which was US$7.41 per share, multiplied by the number of 
Consideration Shares.
As a result the net amount of US$67.7 million was paid by Polymetal and the consideration shares remained in issue. On the 
put option being exercised, both the liability of US$300 million and the corresponding balance in equity of US$218.7 million 
were derecognised. After the cash payment has been taken into account, the balancing figure of US$13.6 million was 
recognised within retained earnings.
Primorskoye
In July 2015 Polymetal purchased a 100% interest in Primorskoye LLC, the company holding the licence for the Primorskoye 
silver/gold property located in the Magadan region of Russia from Decamor Investments Limited. The consideration for the 
acquisition comprised the initial consideration of US$4.1 million payable by issuing 533,301 new Polymetal International plc 
shares and the deferred conditional cash consideration payable in February 2017. The deferred consideration will be 
determined as the higher of US$13,333 per tonne of contained silver equivalent (translating into US$0.415 per silver 
equivalent ounce) based on the audited reserves estimate of the deposit, and US$8 million. On acquisition, the contingent 
consideration was valued at US$6.9 million. As of 31 December 2015 contingent consideration was valued at US$7.2 million 
(Note 29). 
Primorskoye does not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3, as it represents an acquisition of mining license 
though a non-operating corporate entity, and thus it was accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets. The Group 
purchased mineral rights of US$11.1 million and other current liabilities of US$0.1 million.
LV Gold Mining 
In April 2015 the Group purchased a 25% stake in CJSC LV Gold Mining, the company owning the Lichkvaz exploration and 
mining licence in Armenia (including related shareholder loans). The consideration comprised 429,260 shares equal to 
US$3.6 million. Polymetal has also entered into an ‘earn-in’ agreement for financing of exploration, metallurgical testing and a 
JORC-compliant feasibility study in exchange for a right to increase its share in the project up to 50% after the completion of 
these tasks. The arrangements constituted a joint venture and the investment was accounted for using the equity method at 
cost of US$3.6 million as of 30 June 2015.
On 11 November 2015, Polymetal signed an agreement to purchase the remaining 75% of LV Gold mining shares. The 
purchase price comprised 1,047 ,756 Polymetal International plc shares and a deferred consideration in an amount equal to 
2% of value of precious metals in the ore extracted from the Lichkvaz deposit in the future during the life of mine. Under the 
contract the seller has also assigned to Polymetal an intercompany loan receivable of US$0.3 million in exchange for 
additional 37 ,097 Polymetal International plc shares. Total consideration payable in shares was valued at US$9.1 million and 
the contingent consideration was valued at US$5.4 million (Note 29).
LV Gold Mining does not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3, as it represents an acquisition of mining license 
though a non-operating corporate entity, thus it was accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets. The acquisition was 
achieved in stages and accounted for at cost which is the total of the cost of the original 25% interest and of the additional 
75% interest. The Group purchased mineral rights of US$20.2 million and other current liabilities of US$0.1 million.
Disposal of subsidiary
Khakandjinskoye LLC
On 26 October 2015 the Group sold its subsidiary Khakandjinskoye LLC, which holds the Khakanja licence, for the cash 
consideration of US$0.5 million to an unrelated party. Total net assets disposed of amounted to US$(0.7) million, resulting  
in a gain on disposal of subsidiary amounting to US$1.2 million.
(b) Year ended 31 December 2014
In the prior year, the following transactions took place:
Kyzyl acquisition
On 4 September 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Altynalmas Gold Ltd (AAG), the holding company for 
the Kyzyl gold project in Kazakhstan. 
The initial consideration for this acquisition comprised US$318.5 million in cash and 31,347 ,078 new ordinary shares of 
Polymetal International plc issued to Sumeru Gold B.V., representing approximately 7.45% of the Company’s enlarged issued 
share capital. The number of shares issued was determined by dividing US$300 million by the unweighted mean average 
closing price of Polymetal shares on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in the twelve calendar months ending 
three trading days before completion which equated US$9.57027 per share. Using the share price in completion gave a fair 
value for the share consideration of US$274.9 million. Deferred additional cash consideration up to an agreed cap, contingent 
on certain conditions being met and dependent on the relative dynamics of the gold price and the price of Polymetal’s shares, 
may be payable over the next seven years, and this forms the basis for a contingent consideration liability which was valued 
on acquisition at US$27.7 million. 
AAG meets the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 thus it was accounted for at fair value using the acquisition 
method. 
Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition
The initial accounting of the acquisition of AAG has only been provisionally determined at the end of the year ended 
31 December 2014 based on the directors’ best estimate.
The management believes that this business acquisition does not give rise to goodwill and excess of consideration over net 
asset assets of the acquiree should be fully attributed the mineral rights. The amount recognised in respect of the identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below.

4. Acquisitions and disposals continued
Contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination of US$5.6 million, represent social obligations set by the Sub-Soil 
Use contracts, being amounts committed to be spent on professional trainings and other social engagements over the life of 
project. The potential undiscounted amount of future payments that the Group could be required to make approximates to 
US$10 million (refer to Note 29).
No significant financial assets were acquired in the business combination.
Valuation of consideration
The fair value of the 31,347 ,078 ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration paid for AAG was determined based on 
the spot price at the acquisition date, being US$8.77.
The deferred additional cash consideration described above meets the definition of contingent consideration and was fair 
valued as of the acquisition date using a Monte Carlo valuation simulation. Potential amounts payable for each of the next 
seven years are linked to the average gold price in each period, with a deduction for the effect of the share value appreciation. 
The average annual gold price must exceed US$1,250/oz for any consideration to be payable. The total amount payable is 
limited to US$500 million. The key assumptions used in the contingent consideration calculation are set out below:
Gold price volatility 7.16%
Share price volatility 31.2%
Constant correlation between gold price and share price 93.3%
Dividend yield 2%
Gold price as of the acquisition date US$1,271.5
Share price as of the acquisition date US$8.77
Discount rate 9%
The acquisition date fair value was calculated at US$27.7 million.
At acquisition the fair value of the Seller’s put option was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, using 
assumptions consistent with the Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value has been calculated at US$54.6 million.
Impact of the acquisition on the result of the Group
Acquisition-related costs (included in Other operating expenses) amount to US$4 million (Note 12). 
Altynalmas Gold Ltd (AAG) contributed US$3 million loss to the Group’s loss for the period between the acquisition date and 
year end. AAG generated no revenues in 2014. Had the acquisition completed on the first day of the financial year, it would 
have increased the Group’s loss by US$10.1 million.
North Kaluga deposit
On 29 August 2014 Polymetal International plc acquired 100% ownership in the North Kaluga property following the 
restructuring of the JSC Ural-Polymetal, which was previously classified as an associate in the IFRS consolidated 
financial statements.
Under the terms of the restructuring agreement, the Ural-Polymetal was dissolved and the assets and liabilities of the former 
associate were distributed amongst the shareholders. Polymetal received a 100% interest in the North Kaluga property and 
assumed US$20.3 million of debt. The other assets and liabilities of the associate were transferred to the other shareholders. 
Polymetal owned 49.99% of the Ural-Polymetal prior to the transaction and the asset had nil carrying value in the Group’s 
financial statements due to write-off in 2013 following the commodities price decline.
North Kaluga did not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus it is accounted for as an acquisition of  
a group of assets. As a result the Group acquired mineral rights at cost of US$20.9 million, debt amounting to US$20.3 million 
and other current liabilities of $0.6 million.
Other minor acquisitions
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group acquired several minor companies, which hold exploration licences and 
capital construction in progress assets. The acquired subsidiaries do not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 
(2008) thus they were accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets. The Group purchased mineral rights at total cost 
of US$1.7 million, capital construction in progress at cost of US$2.6 million and other current liabilities of US$3.0 million for 
total cash consideration of US$1.3 million.
5. Segment information
The Group has eight reportable segments:
•	 Voro (CJSC Gold of Northern Urals);
•	 Okhotsk operations (LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company; Svetloye LLC);
•	 Dukat (CJSC Magadan Silver);
•	 Omolon (Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC);
•	 Varvara (JSC Varvarinskoye);
•	 Amursk-Albazino (Albazino Resources Ltd, Amur Hydrometallurgical Plant LLC);
•	 Mayskoye (Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC); and
•	 Kyzyl (Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLP, JSC Inter Gold Capital).
Reportable segments are determined based on the Group’s internal management reports and are separated based on the 
Group’s geographical structure. Minor companies and activities (management, exploration, purchasing and other companies) 
which do not meet the reportable segment criteria are disclosed within corporate and other segment. Each segment is 
engaged in gold, silver or copper mining and related activities, including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. 
The Group’s segments are all based in the Russian Federation, except for Varvara and Kyzyl which are based in Kazakhstan.
The measure which management and the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the CODM) use to evaluate the performance of 
the Group is segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortisation, 
impairment of non-current assets, write-downs and reversals of inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation 
expenses, rehabilitation expenses, gains or losses arising on acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries, foreign exchange gains  
or losses, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs, income tax expenses and 
other tax exposure accrued within other operating expenses. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are 
consistent with those of the Group’s accounting policies under IFRS.
Revenue shown as corporate and other comprises, principally, intersegment revenue relating to the supply of inventories, 
spare parts and fixed assets, and rendering management services to the Group’s production entities. Intersegment revenue is 
recognised based on costs incurred plus a fixed margin basis. External revenue shown within corporate and other represents 
revenue from services provided to third parties by the Group’s non-mining subsidiaries. 
Business segment current assets and liabilities, other than current inventory, are not reviewed by the CODM and therefore are 
not disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.

Mining tax is a royalty payable in Russian Federation and Kazakhstan which is calculated based on the value of the precious 
metals extracted in the period. This value is usually determined based on the realised selling price of precious metals or, in 
case if there were no sales during the period, cost of production of metals extracted (Russian Federation) or the average 
market price (Kazakhstan) during the period. 
Mining tax in respect of the metal inventories produced during the year is recognised within cost of sales, while the additional 
mining tax accruals in respect of various disputes with tax authorities are recognised within other expenses (see Note 12).
Idle capacities and abnormal production costs were expenses as incurred and relate to Mayskoye where the processing plant 
was stopped in November 2015 while underground mining was ramping up due to the redevelopment of underground 
workings using a new mining method.

Interest expense on borrowings excludes borrowing costs capitalised in the cost of qualifying assets of US$3.9 million and 
US$5.1 million during the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts were calculated based on 
the Group’s general borrowing pool and by applying an effective interest rate of 4.06% and 3.5%, respectively, to cumulative 
expenditure on such assets.
The repurchase obligation relates to the put option issued to the seller of Altynalmas Gold Ltd, which gave it a right during 
a specified period to require Polymetal International plc to acquire or procure acquirers for the 31,347 ,078 of consideration 
shares issued by Polymetal International plc at a price of US$9.57027 per share (Note 4). During the year ended

Total income tax expense 54,830 71,965
The actual tax expense differs from the amount which would have been determined by applying the statutory rate of 20% for 
the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan to profit before income tax as a result of the application of relevant jurisdictional tax 
regulations, which disallow certain deductions which are included in the determination of accounting profit. These deductions 
include share-based payment expenses, social related expenditures and other non-production costs, certain general and 
administrative expenses, financing expenses, foreign exchange related and other costs.

16. Income tax continued
For several entities, the tax calculation is prepared in local currencies that differ from the functional currency of the entity. This 
results in exchange gains and losses included in the local currency used as a basis for the tax computation and gives rise to 
significant permanent differences.
In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the Russian Federation 
and Kazakhstan. Of the large operating companies of the Group, the tax authorities have audited CJSC Gold of Northern 
Urals and CJSC Magadan Silver up to 2012, Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC, LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration 
Company CJSC and Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC up to 2010, and JSC Varvarinskoye for the period up to 2010. 
According to Russian and Kazakhstan tax legislation, previously completed audits do not fully preclude subsequent claims 
relating to the audited period. 
Tax exposures recognised in income tax 
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group had an income tax exposure of US$10.2 million including penalties and 
interest of US$3.6 million at Magadan Silver, which were provided for. Following the completion of the tax audit the amount 
was paid in full.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 no individually significant exposures were and provided for.

Tax losses carried forward represent amounts available for offset against future taxable income generated by ZK Mayskoye 
LLC, Svetloye LLC, JSC Varvarinskoye, Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLP and JSC Polymetal during the period up to 2024.  
Each legal entity within the Group represents a separate tax-paying component for income tax purposes. The tax losses  
of one entity cannot be used to reduce taxable income of other entities of the Group. As at 31 December 2015 and 
31 December 2014 the aggregate tax losses carried forward were US$648.9 million (RUB 15.8 billion and Kazakh  
Tenge 146.6 billion) and US$550.1 million (RUB 20.9 billion and Kazakh Tenge 32.6 billion), respectively.
The Group believes that recoverability of the recognised deferred tax asset (DTA) of US$129.8 million at 31 December 2015  
is more likely than not based upon expectations of future taxable income in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan and 
available tax planning strategies.
Losses incurred in certain taxable entities in recent years have created a history of losses as of 31 December 2015.  
The Group has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to overcome the recent history of losses based on forecasts  
of sufficient taxable income in the carry-forward period.
At 31 December 2015 deferred tax assets in the amount of US$7.5 million (31 December 2014: US$6.9 million) have not been 
recognised in respect of unused tax losses expiring during the years 2016-2026 because it is not probable that future taxable 
profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom.

16. Income tax continued
The Group’s estimate of future taxable income is based on established proven and probable reserves which can be 
economically developed. The related detailed mine plans and forecasts provide sufficient supporting evidence that the Group 
will generate taxable earnings to be able to fully realise its net DTA even under various stressed scenarios. The amount of the 
DTA considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry 
forward period are reduced due to delays in production start dates, decreases in ore reserve estimates, increases in 
environmental obligations, or reductions in precious metal prices. The Group’s tax losses carried forward expire as follows:

The deferred tax liabilities for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group subsidiaries 
have not been recognised as the Group has determined that the undistributed profit of its subsidiaries will not be distributed 
in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, for which deferred tax 
liabilities have not been recognised, amount to US$1,313 million (2014: US$1,231 million).

Mayskoye 9,885 12,806
Dukat 3,986 5,164
Total 13,871 17,970
The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed annually to determine whether it is in excess of its recoverable amount.  
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation.  
Fair value is based on the application of the Discounted Cash Flow Method (DCF) using post-tax cash flows. The DCF  
method is attributable to the development of proved and probable reserves.
The DCF method used is based on proved and probable reserves and uses the following key assumptions:
•	 production volumes;
•	 commodity prices;
•	 proved and probable reserves;
•	 production costs; 
•	 Rouble exchange rates; and
•	 discount rates.
Recoverable reserves and resources are based on the proven and probable reserves and resources in existence at the end of 
the year. Estimated production volumes are based on detailed life of mine plans and take into account development plans for 
the mines approved by management as part of the long-term planning process. 
The key assumptions used as at 31 December 2015 by the Group were as follows:
Commodity prices
Commodity prices are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked against external sources of information. In the 
impairment tests performed, the flat real long-term gold and silver prices were US$1,100 per ounce (2014: US$1,200)  
and US$14 per ounce (2014: US$17), respectively.
Discount rate
The Group used a post-tax real discount rate of 9.0% (2014: 9.0%).
Production costs
Production costs are based on management’s best estimates over the life of the mine, and reflect past experience.
Rouble exchange rates
Management has analysed US$/RUB rate movements for the year ended 31 December 2015. For the purposes of the 
impairment test, the US$/RUB exchange rate is estimated at 72 RUB/US$ (2014: 50 RUB/US$).
Sensitivity analysis
For Dukat and Mayskoye management has performed an analysis as to whether a reasonably possible adverse change to 
any of the key assumptions would lead to impairment.
The following scenarios were considered as reasonably possible and were used for this sensitivity analysis:
•	 10% simultaneous decrease in gold and silver prices over the life of mine;
•	 10% decrease in Rouble exchange rates;
•	 10% increase in operating expenses over the life of mine; and 
•	 0.5% increase in the discount rate applied.
Each of the sensitivities above has been determined by assuming that the relevant key assumption moves in isolation, and 
without regard to potential mine plan changes and other management decisions which would be taken to respond to adverse 
changes in existing management projections. An adverse change in a key assumption described above would not cause the 
aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the Dukat and Mayskoye cash-generating units.

Polygon Gold Inc.
Polygon Gold Inc. is a private shell company which holds a 100% interest in Veduga gold deposit in the Krasnoyarsk region 
of the Russian Federation. The Group owns 42.65% of Polygon Gold Inc. and holds significant influence in the entity.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group’s share of losses of Polygon Gold Inc. exceeded its interest in the 
associate due to foreign currency exchange losses recognised by Polygon Gold Inc., therefore the carrying amount of the 
investment was written down to nil. The Group’s total accumulated unrecognised share of loss amounts to US$3.1 million  
as of 31 December 2015.
Aktogai Mys LLC
In June 2015 the Group signed the agreement to purchase 25% stake in the Aktogai Mys LLC, company owning the 
Dolinnoye exploration licence in Kazakhstan (including related shareholder loans). Polymetal has also entered into an ‘earn-in’ 
agreement for financing of exploration and technical research and may increase its share in the project up to 50% after the 
completion of these tasks. The consideration comprises US$2.4 million payable for shares and US$2.7 million payable for 
shareholders loan and related interest, which were paid in June 2015. The arrangements constitute a joint venture and the 
investment is accounted for using the equity method. 
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group’s share of losses of Aktogai Mys LLC exceeded its interest in the joint 
venture due to foreign currency exchange losses recognised by Aktogai Mys LLC, therefore the carrying amount of the 
investment was written down to nil. The Group’s total accumulated unrecognised share of loss amounts to US$0.7 million  
as of 31 December 2015.

Total 883 (5,501) (7,915) (443) (12,976) 39,174 
The write-downs were recognised in respect of the ore stockpiles with a low content of precious metal. Reversals of the 
previously recorded write-downs were driven by a costs reduction due to the Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge devaluation, 
changes in mine plans and favourable changes in contract terms with off-takers, which have improved the economic viability 
of the stockpiles.
The key assumptions used as at 31 December 2015 in determining net realisable value of inventories (including the 
commodity price assumptions) were consistent with those used in the goodwill impairment review (Note 19).
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group provided for obsolete consumables and spare parts inventory  
in the amount of US$5.3 million (year ended 31 December 2014: write-down of US$4.1 million).
The amount of inventories held at net realisable value at 31 December 2015 is US$25.6 million (31 December 2014: 
US$32.4 million).

Bank loans
The Group has a number of borrowing arrangements with various lenders. These borrowings consist of unsecured and 
secured loans and credit facilities denominated in US Dollars. Where security is provided it is in the form of pledge of revenue 
from certain sales agreements.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group drew down a total of US$722.7 million and repaid US$696.1 million, 
a net drawdown of US$26.6 million. 
The Group secured new facilities in the year for a total amount of US$515 million with unrelated parties. US$500 million of 
these credit facilities are drawn down as at 31 December 2015 and have maturity dates between 2017 and 2019.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had undrawn borrowing facilities of US$1,196 million (31 December 2014: US$1,038 million).

and analysis of cash flows and payment schedules to ensure that all amounts payable are settled within the credit period.
28. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments
Capital commitments
The Group’s budgeted capital expenditure commitments as at 31 December 2015 amounted to US$18.4 million 
(2014: US$13.6 million).
Forward sale commitments
The Group has certain physical gold and silver forward sale commitments which are priced at the prevailing market price, 
calculated with reference to the LBMA or LME gold price, which are accounted for as executed as the Group expects to and 
has historically physically delivered into these contracts.
Operating leases: Group as a lessee
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group recognised US$6.1 million as operating lease expenses 
(2014: US$12.5 million).
The land in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan on which the Group’s production facilities are located is owned by the 
state. The Group leases this land through operating lease agreements, which expire in various years through to 2058.
Future minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating lease agreements at the end of the period were

Contingencies
Operating environment
Emerging markets such as Russia and Kazakhstan are subject to different risks than more developed markets, including 
economic, political and social, and legal and legislative risks. Laws and regulations affecting businesses in Russia continue to 
change rapidly, and tax and regulatory frameworks are subject to varying interpretations. The future economic direction of 
Russia is heavily influenced by the fiscal and monetary policies adopted by the government, together with developments in 
the legal, regulatory, and political environment.
Because Russia and Kazakhstan produce and export large volumes of oil and gas, their economies are particularly sensitive 
to the price of oil and gas on the world market. During 2014-2015 and then in the first quarter of 2016, the oil price decreased 
significantly, which led to a substantial decrease in the Russian Rouble exchange rate. On 20 August 2015, the Government 
and the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced a transition to a new monetary policy based on a free floating Tenge 
exchange rate, and cancelled the currency corridor. In 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 the Tenge depreciated significantly 
against major foreign currencies.
Starting from 2014, sanctions have been imposed in several packages by the US and the EU on certain Russian officials, 
businessmen and companies. 
In the first quarter of 2015 two international credit agencies downgraded Russia’s long-term foreign currency sovereign rating 
to the speculative level with a negative outlook.
 
The above mentioned events have led to reduced access for Russian businesses to international capital markets, increased 
inflation, economic recession and other negative economic consequences. The impact of further economic developments on 
future operations and the financial position of the Group is at this stage difficult to determine.

Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. 
Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transaction and activity of the companies of the Group may 
be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities and as a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and 
interest may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years 
preceding the year of review. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
During 2015 and 2014 the Group has been involved in a number of litigations in Russia and in Kazakhstan. See Note 16 
for details of these cases and their outcomes. In addition to the cases detailed within Note 16, management has identified 
a total exposure (covering taxes and related interest and penalties) of US$46.4 million in respect of contingent liabilities 
(2014: US$17.2 million).
29. Fair value accounting
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair 
value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable as follows:
•	 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
•	 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
•	 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, the Group held the following financial instruments:
31 December 2015

Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total
Receivables from provisional copper, gold and silver concentrate sales – 12,219 – 12,219

Contingent consideration liability – – (19,289) (19,289)
 – 36,613 (295,127) (258,514)
During the reporting periods, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and short-term  
debt recorded at amortised cost approximate to their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments. The 
estimated fair value of the Group’s long-term debt, calculated using the market interest rate available to the Group as at 
31 December 2015, is US$1,234.3 million, and the carrying value as at 31 December 2015 is US$1,350 million (see Note 25). 
Carrying values of the other long-term loans provided to related parties as at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 
approximated to their fair values.
Receivables from provisional copper, gold and silver concentrate sales
The fair value of receivables arising from copper, gold and silver concentrate sales contracts that contain provisional pricing 
mechanisms is determined using the appropriate quoted forward price from the exchange that is the principal active market 
for the particular metal. As such, these receivables are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Contingent consideration liabilities
In 2008, the Group recorded a contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of 98.1% of the shares in JSC 
Omolon Gold Mining Company (Omolon). The fair value of the contingent consideration liability was determined using a 
valuation model which simulates expected production of gold and silver at the Kubaka mine and future gold and silver prices 
to estimate future revenues at Omolon. This liability is revalued at each reporting date based on 2% of the life of mine 
revenues with the resulting gain or loss recognised in the consolidated income statement. The liability recognised at 
31 December 2015 was US$13.3 million, including a current portion of US$2.5 million (2014: US$12.9 million).
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group completed the acquisition of Altynalmas Gold Ltd, the holding company 
for the Kyzyl gold project in Kazakhstan (Note 4). The fair value of the related contingent consideration liability was estimated 
using a Monte Carlo model. The liability was revalued at the 31 December 2015 using the same model with updated inputs as 
of the reporting date and amounts to US$0.2 million (2014: US$6.3 million).
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group the recorded a contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition 
of a 100% interest in Primorskoye (Note 4). Deferred conditional cash consideration, which will be determined as the highest 
of US$13,333 per tonne of contained silver equivalent (translating into US$0.415 per silver equivalent ounce) based on the 
audited reserves estimate of the deposit, and US$8 million, was valued at US$6.9 million.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 the Group completed the acquisition of LV Gold Mining, the company owning the 
Lichkvaz exploration licence in Armenia (Note 4). The fair value of the related contingent consideration liability was estimated 
at US$5.4 million using a valuation model which simulates expected production of metals and future gold, silver and copper 
prices to estimate future value of the metals in the actually extracted ore.

The Directors consider that a reasonably possible change in a valuation assumption would not have a material impact on the 
financial statements for contingent considerations payable.
 
Commodity forward contracts
The Group enters into forward contracts for the physical delivery of metals which will be priced according to the prevailing 
London Bullion Market Association or London Metal Exchange index. The Group’s policy is not to enter into fixed priced 
contracts. The forward sales contracts qualify for the normal purchase/sales or ‘own use’ exemption for accounting purposes 
and are outside the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

30. Risk management activities
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy 
remains from prior years.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as detailed in Note 25 offset by cash and bank balances 
as detailed in Note 24) and equity of the Group comprising the Stated Capital account, reserves and retained earnings as 
detailed in Note 31.
The Group’s committed borrowings are subject to certain financial covenants. Compliance with covenants is reviewed on a 
semi-annual basis and the Group’s Board is satisfied with forecast compliance with covenants on those borrowings. 
The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure of the Group on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the Board 
considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Major categories of financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, derivatives, finance lease liabilities, trade and other payables. 
The Group has various financial assets such as accounts receivable, loans advanced and cash and cash equivalents.

Foreign currency and commodity price risk
In the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions for the sale of its commodities, denominated in  
US Dollars. In addition, the Group has assets and liabilities in a number of different currencies (primarily Russian Rouble and 
Kazakh Tenge). As a result, the Group is subject to transaction and translation exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency 
exchange rates.
The Group does not currently use derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The carrying amounts of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than functional currencies  
of the individual Group entities at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 were as follows:

US Dollar denominated assets and liabilities disclosed above exclude balances outstanding held in Polymetal International plc 
and its intermediate holding companies, where functional currency was changed from Russian Rouble to US Dollar as 
described in Note 2.
Currency risk is monitored on a monthly basis by performing a sensitivity analysis of foreign currency positions in order  
to verify that potential losses are at an acceptable level.
The table below details the Group’s sensitivity to changes in exchange rates by 10% which is the sensitivity rate used  
by the Group for internal analysis. The analysis was applied to monetary items denominated in respective currencies at the

Provisionally priced sales
Under a long-established practice prevalent in the industry, copper, gold and silver concentrate sales are provisionally priced 
at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalised in a contractually specified future period (generally one to three 
months) primarily based on quoted LBMA or LME prices. Sales subject to final pricing are generally settled in a subsequent 
month. The forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenue.

30. Risk management activities continued
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. 
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Group 
does not currently hedge its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of 
this Note.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end of the reporting 
period was outstanding for the whole period. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk 
internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in 
interest rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 would have decreased/increased by US$10.9 million (2014: US$11.6 million). This is mainly 
attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the increase in variable rate 
debt instruments.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer may default or not meet its obligations to the Group on a timely basis, leading to financial 
losses to the Group. The Group’s financial instruments that are potentially exposed to concentration of credit risk consist 
primarily of cash and cash equivalents and loans and receivables.
Accounts receivable are regularly monitored and assessed and where necessary an adequate level of provision is maintained. 
Trade accounts receivable at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 are represented by provisional copper, gold and 
silver concentrate sales transactions. A significant portion of the Group’s trade accounts receivable is due from reputable 
export trading companies. With regard to other loans and receivables the procedures of accepting a new customer include 
checks by a security department and responsible on-site management for business reputation, licences and certification, 
creditworthiness and liquidity. Generally, the Group does not require any collateral to be pledged in connection with its 
investments in the above financial instruments. Credit limits for the Group as a whole are not set up.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies. The major financial assets at the balance sheet date other than trade accounts receivable 
presented in Note 24 are cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2015 of US$51.8 million (2014: US$157.2 million).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to settle its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group’s liquidity position is carefully monitored and managed. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining detailed 
budgeting, cash forecasting processes and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities to help ensure that 
it has adequate cash available to meet its payment obligations.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. 
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on 
which the Group can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest 
flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period. The 
contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

As at 31 December 2015, the Company’s issued share capital consisted of 424,650,138 ordinary shares (2014: 420,819,943 
ordinary shares) of no par value, each carrying one vote. The Company does not hold any shares in treasury (2014: none).

deposit (Tarutin) from 25% to 50%. The Group has purchased an additional 25% from the unrelated party for consideration 
of US$12.9 million, payable through 1,746,692 newly issued Polymetal International plc shares. The Group has previously 
determined that LLC Vostochny Basis meets the definition of the subsidiary and it was consolidated from the date of the 25% 
share acquisition. The increase in interest in Tarutin was recognised as an acquisition of the non-controlling interest and 
recognised within equity. As of 31 December 2014 and during the year ended 31 December 2015, Tarutin does not give  
rise to a significant non-controlling interest to be presented within equity, income statement and statement of 
comprehensive income.
Retained earnings
Reserves available for distribution to shareholders are based on the available cash in the Company under Jersey law.  
The ability to distribute cash up to the Company from the Russian Federation and Kazakh operating companies will be  
based on the statutory historical information of each stand-alone entity, which is prepared in accordance with Russian or 
Kazakh accounting standards and which differs slightly from IFRS. Russian legislation identifies the basis of distribution as 
accumulated profit. However, current legislation and other statutory regulations dealing with distribution rights are open to 
legal interpretation; consequently, actual distributable reserves may differ from the amount of accumulated profit under 
Russian statutory accounting rules.
The distribution of cash up to the Company from the Russian Federation and Kazakh operating companies doesn’t affect  
the the Company’s ability to distribute dividends in accordance with its current dividend policy.

Weighted average number of shares: Diluted loss/earnings per share
Both basic and diluted loss/earnings per share were calculated by dividing loss/profit for the year attributable to equity 
holders of the parent by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares before/after dilution respectively. 
The calculation of the weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution is as follows:
Year ended
31 December 
2015
Year ended
31 December
2014
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares 422,958,680 399,606,989

Weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution 423,249,202 399,690,138
The outstanding LTIP awards at 31 December 2015 and 2014 represent anti-dilutive potential ordinary shares with respect to 
earnings per share for continuing operations. Therefore, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for the current and 
prior year.

For the year ended 31 December 2015, share-based compensation in the amount of US$3.3 million including US$0.8 million 
of management bonus deferral award (2014: US$2.4 million and US$0.3 million, respectively) was recognised in general, 
administrative and selling expenses in the consolidated income statement (Note 11). 
As at 31 December 2015 the Group has two portions amounting to US$3.8 million and US$6.2 million of unrecognised  
share-based compensation expense related to non-vested equity-settled stock appreciated rights with expected amortisation 
period of 2.2 and 3.2 years, respectively.
The previous LTIP scheme, which was granted in 2010, had fully vested by 30 June 2013. These options lapsed in H1 2014 
and accordingly, the related balance of US$143.5 million in the share based payment reserve was transferred into 
retained earnings.
During the year ended 31 December 2015 36,089 shares under the management bonus plan deferral award were released 
and issued in accordance with the plan.
33. Related parties 
Related parties are considered to include shareholders, affiliates, associates, joint ventures and entities under common 
ownership and control with the Group and members of key management personnel. 
As of 31 December 2015 outstanding balances owed to or from related parties comprised long-term loans provided to equity 
method investments amounting to US$6.0 million (2014: US$0.6 million) and interest receivable in respect of these loans 
amounting US$0.6 million. No significant transactions with related parties took place during the year ended 31 December 2015 
(2014: other income from equity method investments amounted to US$3.0 million).
Carrying values of other long-term loans provided to related parties as at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 
approximate their fair values.
 
The amounts outstanding at the balance sheet dates are unsecured and expected to be settled in cash. No expense has 
been recognised in the reporting period for bad or doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties.

35. Subsequent events
In December 2015, Polymetal International plc entered into a joint venture with OJSC Polyus Gold under which Polymetal  
will participate in advancing the development of the Nezhdaninskoye gold deposit in Yakutia, Russia (‘Nezhdaninskoye’). 
The arrangement will allow Polymetal to acquire up to 50% in the company holding 100% of JSC South-Verkhoyansk Mining 
Company (‘SVMC’) through an earn-in mechanism. SVMC, which was previously a 100% subsidiary of Polyus Gold, holds  
the mining and exploration license for Nezhdaninskoye as well as certain infrastructure adjacent to the deposit.
On 19 January 2016, Polymetal acquired a 15.3% interest in SVMC, for a cash consideration of US$18 million.
In March 2016 Polymetal International plc entered into binding agreements with Dundee Precious Metals Inc. for the 
acquisition of CJSC Dundee Precious Metals Kapan (‘DPMK’), the holding company for the Kapan Gold Mine (‘Kapan’)  
in the Republic of Armenia. The total consideration payable for the shares in DPMK at completion is US$25 million, subject 
to certain working capital adjustments. The consideration will consist of US$10 million payable in cash, which will be satisfied 
from existing cash balances, and US$15 million payable in Polymetal shares. In addition, Dundee will receive a 2% NSR 
(Net Smelter Return) royalty on the future production from the Kapan Gold Mine capped at US$25 million. Completion of 
the Transaction is conditional on certain regulatory approvals, including anti-monopoly approval in the Republic of Armenia.

in the footnotes):
Au = US$1,100/oz;
Ag = US$15.0/oz; and
Cu = US$5,000/t.
Gold equivalent data is based on ‘Conversion ratios of metals into gold equivalent’ provided on the following page.  
Lead and zinc Ore reserves and Mineral resources have not been assessed in this report due to immateriality.
Reporting of Metal Equivalents
Silver/gold equivalent conversion ratio for precious metals deposits
AuEq = Ag/k
•	 where k is the silver to gold equivalent conversion rate based on the difference in respective metals’ value using  
the following formula: k = ((Au price/31.1035 – (Au price/31.1035 – treatment charge Au)*(Royalty Au)/100 –  
(treatment charge Au))*(recovery Au)/((Ag price/31.1035 – (Ag price/31.1035 – treatment charge Ag)*(Royalty Ag)/100 – 
(treatment charge Ag))*(recovery Ag)),
•	 where Royalty is the mineral extraction tax at applicable rate, recovery – life-of-mine expected recovery of the respective  
the metal in the processing technology applied.

 This type of ore is currently not being processed, it is stockpiled and reflected only in Mineral resources.
Reserves and resources continued
As at 1 January 2016
Glossary Grade the relative amount of metal in ore, expressed 
as grams per tonne for precious metals and as 
a percentage for most other metals
Head grade the grade of ore coming into a processing 
plant
Heap leach a technological operation in which crushed 
material is laid on a sloping, impervious pad 
where it is leached by cyanide solution  
to dissolve gold and/or silver. Metals are 
subsequently recovered from pregnant leach 
solution by CIC or the Merrill-Crowe process
Indicated  
resource 
that part of a resource for which tonnage, 
grade and content can be estimated with a 
reasonable level of confidence. It is based on 
exploration, sampling and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes. The locations are too 
widely or inappropriately spaced to confirm 
geological and/or grade continuity but are 
spaced closely enough for continuity  
to be assumed
Inferred  
resource 
that part of a resource for which tonnage, 
grade and content can be estimated with  
a low level of confidence. It is inferred from 
geological evidence and assumed but not  
verified geological and/or grade continuity.  
It is based on information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such  
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill 
holes which may be limited or of uncertain  
quality and reliability
In-fill drilling a conventional method of detailed exploration 
on an already defined resource or reserve, 
consisting of drilling on a denser grid  
to allow more precise estimation of ore 
bodyparameters and location
Leaching the process of dissolving mineral values from 
solid into liquid phase of slurry
Measured 
resource 
that part of a resource for which tonnage, 
densities, shape, physical characteristics, 
grade and mineral content can be estimated 
with a high level of confidence. It is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling  
and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such  
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill 
holes. The locations are spaced closely 
enough to confirm geological and  
grade continuity
Merrill-Crowe 
process
a technological operation for extraction  
of gold and/or silver after cyanide leaching.  
In the first step slurry containing gold and/or 
silver is separated into liquid and solid phases  
by washing the solids off in countercurrent 
decantation thickeners. In the second step 
pregnant leach solution (liquid phase of slurry)  
is filtered to remove impurities and deaerated. 
Finally, gold and silver are deposited onto the 
solid bed of claylike material where they 
replace zinc particles which pass into a 
solution. Merrill-Crowe is preferentially used  
for silver-rich ores
Mill a mineral processing plant
Mineralisation a rock containing valuable components,  
not necessarily in the quantities sufficient  
for economically justifiable extraction.  
Consists of ore minerals and gangue
Open-pittable amenable for economically feasible mining  
by open-pit methods
Open-pit mine a mine that is entirely on the surface. Also 
referred to as open-cut or open-cast mine
Ore the part of mineralisation that can be mined  
and processed profitably
Ore body a spatially compact and geometrically  
connected location of ore
Ore mined ore extracted from the ground for  
further processing
Ore processed ore subjected to treatment in a mineral 
processing plant
Ore stacked the ore stacked for heap leach operations
Oxidised ore ore in which both ore minerals and gangue  
are fully or partially oxidised thus impacting its 
physical and chemical properties and 
influencing the choice of a processing 
technology
POX or pressure 
oxidation
a technological operation in which slurry is 
subjected to high pressure and high 
temperature in an autoclave with the goal to 
destroy sulphide particles enveloping gold 
particles and make slurry amenable to cyanide 
leaching
Precipitate the semi-finished product of mineral 
processing by Merrill-Crowe process, normally 
containing very high concentrations of silver 
and/or gold
Primary ore unoxidised ore
Probable  
reserves
the economically mineable part of an indicated 
(and in some cases measured) resource, 
which has a lower level of confidence than 
proved reserves but is of sufficient quality to 
serve as the basis for a decision on the 
development of the deposit
Production the amount of pure precious metals,  
measured in thousands of ounces for 
gold, millions of ounces for silver and tonnes 
for copper, produced following processing
Proved  
reserves
the economically mineable part of a measured 
resource, which represents the highest 
confidence category of reserve estimate.  
The style of mineralisation or other factors  
could mean that proved reserves are not 
achievable in some deposits
Pt platinum
Reclamation the restoration of a site after mining  
or exploration activity is completed
Recovery or 
recovery rate
the percentage of valuable metal in the ore  
that is recovered by metallurgical treatment  
in the final or semi-finished product
Refractory a characteristic of gold-bearing ore denoting 
impossibility of recovering gold from it by 
conventional cyanide leaching
Reserves the economically mineable part of a measured 
and/or indicated mineral resource. It takes  
into account mining dilution and losses. 
Appropriate assessments and studies have 
been carried out, and include consideration  
of and modification by realistically assumed 
mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, 
legal, environmental, social and governmental 
factors. These assessments demonstrate at 
the time of reporting that extraction could 
reasonably be justified. Reserves are 
subdivided in order of increasing confidence 
into probable reserves and proved reserves
Resources a concentration or occurrence of material of 
intrinsic economic interest in or on the earth’s 
crust in such form, quality and quantity that  
there are reasonable prospects for eventual 
economic extraction. The location, quantity, 
grade, geological characteristics and  
continuity of resources are known, estimated 
or interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge. Resources are 
sub-divided in order of increasing geological 
confidence, into inferred, indicated and 
measured categories
SAG mill a semi-autogenous grinding mill, generally used 
as a primary or first stage grinding solution
Stockwork one of the types of mineralisation, a complex 
system of structurally controlled or randomly 
oriented veins. Stockworks are common  
in many ore deposit types
Stope a large underground excavation entirely  
within an ore body, a unit of ore extraction
Strike a horizontal extension of an ore body  
or mineralisation
Stripping the mining of waste in an open-pit mine
Tailings part of the original feed of a mineral  
processing plant that is considered devoid  
of value after processing

development
excavation which is carried out to access  
ore and prepare it for extraction (mining)
Vein a relatively narrow ore body with significant  
dip and strike dimensions and sharply  
defined boundaries
Waste barren rock that must be mined and  
removed to access ore in a mine
